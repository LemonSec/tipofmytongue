00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:07,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's really something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean how many</font>

00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,879
people were here in the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk so i</font>

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,490
think what's interesting if you look at

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,900
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the defensive mechanisms even</font>

the offensive mechanisms that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

assumptions that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> own the network you</font>

9
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,980
have really tight control over the

10
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,560
network and a lot of the infrastructure

11
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,230
and even the machines on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network</font>

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,140
and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's something that we</font>

13
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,429
see fundamentally changing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to</font>

14
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,340
take you through some of the things and

15
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:34,559
talking with a lot of different security

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:38,100
practitioners<font color="#CCCCCC"> how they're dealing with</font>

this type of change<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what it really</font>

18
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,079
means<font color="#CCCCCC"> so before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I kind of dive into that</font>

19
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:44,489
just want to give you a little you know

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">a little bit about me</font>

came out of the box with you know some

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,158
of the early stuff this is a early to

38
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,930
talk about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> intestinal just with a</font>

39
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,720
box that basically you could

<font color="#E5E5E5">inconspicuously put into an environment</font>

but i really want to now we see more and

00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:25,049
more devices coming into our environment

60
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,000
we see that we don't necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

how do you start to deal with that

76
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:02,189
threat vector and the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> I like to look</font>

77
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:03,569
at this is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the five</font>

00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:05,849
stages of<font color="#CCCCCC"> admitting you're losing</font>

00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:10,560

82
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,450
of these and some of them are<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

83
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,280
tongue-in-cheek but I think there's a

84
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:16,349
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> true sentiment here in the way</font>

85
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,659
that we've historically looked at

86
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:20,760
securing our networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> securing our</font>

87

<font color="#E5E5E5">little tongue-in-cheek from from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dilbert</font>

106
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:07,079
about how we think we have super

<font color="#E5E5E5">controls over our environment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but i</font>

108
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,519
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is a way we think about</font>

109

it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we did a survey last year and in</font>

tight control of what comes on and<font color="#CCCCCC"> off</font>

114
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,669
a lot of people don't even know what's

00:04:23,349 --> 00:04:26,979
there to begin with and this is just

116
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:28,389
your everyday<font color="#E5E5E5"> vanilla kind of network</font>

117
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:31,419
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're talking about</font>

so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to me that step one of we</font>

119
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:34,840
come from this environment where we

120
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,698
think we have tight control over the

121
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,560

the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> tight control over the</font>

stage<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 then becomes you know we kind of</font>

126
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,669
call the lawyers right so the business

127
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,030
wants flexibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people becoming</font>

132
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,419
own system and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> sign</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

133
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:06,430

134
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:08,710
these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's kind of phase two</font>

135
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">great i have control but you want to</font>

136
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,409
have access

137
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,289
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta subscribe to these certain</font>

138
00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:17,199
rules and policies and what's really

139
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:19,900
interesting on this is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a pretty</font>

140
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,690
interesting study<font color="#E5E5E5"> where a company offers</font>

141
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:25,030
free Wi-Fi on the street and they they

142
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:27,880
said in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> eula</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that people signed up</font>

143
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,289
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said the</font>

144
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,270
recipient agrees to assign their

146
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,889
of eternity

147
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:38,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok and i think it was something like a</font>

148
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:40,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">2,000 people signed up only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two people</font>

149
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:42,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">right said anything about this</font>

150
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:45,190
so you know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the point of</font>

151
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,960
when we we come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> an environment we</font>

152
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,870
really think we have control we want

153
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,150
control control<font color="#CCCCCC"> equal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security and then</font>

154
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,310
we start to get the business starts to

155
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,929
push and want to push that limit<font color="#CCCCCC"> we tend</font>

156
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:59,560
to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an end user agreement</font>

157
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:01,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of phase one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but I think more</font>

158
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:04,930
and more we're seeing in the news and

159
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:06,580
just people's awareness of security you

160
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:08,889
know whether it's connected cars right

161
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:11,050
that's kind of when you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> IOT or</font>

162
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:13,449
more devices coming in this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

163
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,800
where everyone starts<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of hey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

164
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:17,110
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> enterprise it's kind of</font>

165
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,680
interesting but you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'sit's these</font>

166
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:24,099
things are vulnerable at<font color="#E5E5E5"> just yesterday</font>

167
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it was right J&J warns that one of</font>

168
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:27,219
their insulin pumps is actually

169
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,259
susceptible and what's interesting with

170
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:33,099
all these is<font color="#E5E5E5"> these aren't some new</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">incredibly specific acts that need to be</font>

173
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,830
just unencrypted wireless communication

177
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,950
same with the cars<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know these are</font>

178
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,860
more and more we're seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> communication</font>

and software<font color="#CCCCCC"> go into devices</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've</font>

180
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:55,540
never seen before<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you have a lot of</font>

00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:57,430
hardware manufacturers manufacturers who

182
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">haven't built software and now they're</font>

183
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:03,070
integrating software into everything and

184
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:06,400
also last week<font color="#E5E5E5"> right we saw one of the</font>

start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know people talk about it</font>

189
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:19,690
for a while but it's actually starting

to happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> big</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> y</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

195
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,560
with all these is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we're used to</font>

196
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:38,260
the notion of people are going to go

after some big corporation<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big hack</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">takes a lot of time you get in take a</font>

00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:45,340
lot of data out where the proliferation

of these devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> interconnected</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> devices</font>

just getting in the front door and

00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,890
dropping in physical devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a</font>

206
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,840
huge way you know physical devices that

207
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,700
are connected to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet it's easy</font>

208
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,190
to actually get<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto networks and</font>

209
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,710
exploit different environments<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

210
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:10,960
becoming a key way to get in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

211
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:13,479
we're seeing more and more that this is

212
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way criminals are actually getting</font>

prepared for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we look at how we</font>

typically secure environments so that

00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,560
leads usually what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i find talking to</font>

218
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:29,230
people to kind of stage<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 of saying okay</font>

219
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">something is different you know where</font>

is you know not necessarily the reality

222
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:41,109
that were in today and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we tend to see</font>

223
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:42,820
people who used to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> their company</font>

224
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:47,740
had complete control over their network

225
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:48,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">realize that wow I've got no wireless</font>

226
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,509
networks<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've got</font>

230
00:08:56,329 --> 00:09:02,029
those places<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to with the</font>

231
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,519
actual devices connecting to them they

232
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:06,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">more and more they don't own them they</font>

233
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:08,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">can't control them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they can put stuff on</font>

00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:09,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">them and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll talk a little about how</font>

235
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:11,959
people tend to react to this challenge

236
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:14,749
with looking at the the tools they have

237
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:17,149
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think people start to realize like</font>

238
00:09:14,749 --> 00:09:19,160
half of the devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> others</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will say more</font>

239
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:21,619
but half of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the devices</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> connected</font>

240
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:25,189

241
00:09:21,619 --> 00:09:27,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">even be owned by the company whether</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

243
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:31,819
on those machines so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the diversity</font>

244
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:34,939
and ownership<font color="#E5E5E5"> of devices are really</font>

245
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:36,559
changing<font color="#CCCCCC"> then finally I think we've</font>

246
00:09:34,939 --> 00:09:37,969
historically thought that

247
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:39,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">hey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when something comes into my</font>

00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,990
environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> connects to my network</font>

249
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:44,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">maybe a few other networks but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

250
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:47,300
really shifted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wear these devices are</font>

251
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:49,579
connecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> 24-7</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to anything they can</font>

252
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:52,040
connect to<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right if you have you</font>

253
00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:53,329
know your<font color="#CCCCCC"> phones on AT&T</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if</font>

254
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,429
you're connected to your Wi-Fi network

255
00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:57,679
you walk out it automatically tries to

256
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:59,779
connect AT&T<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's these</font>

257
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:02,779
things are so thirsty for connectivity

258
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:05,120
that they'll connect to anything to get

259
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:06,920
internet access<font color="#E5E5E5"> so all of these I think</font>

260
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,990
are really fundamentally changing the

261
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:13,189
way we need to look at how we secure our

262

263
00:10:13,189 --> 00:10:17,120
topic from the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked I you know is</font>

this notion of device device

268
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:27,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's really changing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so sure maybe</font>

269
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:29,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's take for example that you have a</font>

270
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:30,740
you know your<font color="#CCCCCC"> network completely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> locked</font>

283
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,249
little of how we've historically looked

00:10:56,059 --> 00:11:01,030
at our networks and all the new

that's going to permit more and more as

well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we tend to think I OT is</font>

very much

really not<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been thinking about and</font>

355
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:46,900
that kind of leads to stage<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 as i like</font>

00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,969
to call it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> existing solution</font>

actually you know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> no question you</font>

00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,610
can do a lot with these but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

364
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,740
certain key aspects<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

365
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:08,440
shifting and as we look at the change in

366
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:10,720
control and ownership<font color="#CCCCCC"> so for example</font>

367
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,970
neck which in this case I<font color="#CCCCCC"> could call</font>

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">network assume control</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right so the</font>

notion of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a very infrastructure out</font>

370
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,800
view of the world so it assumes that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:22,510
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> lock down my network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's very</font>

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,510
controlled environments

373
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:26,860
it's looking more at its airspace blind

374
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:29,200
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not looking at your wireless</font>

375
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's not looking at bluetooth is not</font>

376
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,050
seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's kind of around trying to</font>

00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:34,030
connect to your network<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just</font>

378
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:36,609
looking at the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and trying to</font>

379
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:39,339
control zones and such so it's effective

380
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:41,020
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's hard to scale into a moment you</font>

381
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:43,870
know a very large deployment very

382
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:48,670
expensive cost wise and operationalize

383
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:50,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">but then we look at ids and ideas really</font>

384
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:52,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think people not so much try to use</font>

00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:56,740
it's a very traffic based approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

387
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">so you're looking at traffic typically</font>

that's looking at traffic from your<font color="#E5E5E5"> site</font>

out to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet kind of monkey choke</font>

and then finally MDM right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

397
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:21,889
when people tend to think of mobile

00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:24,230
devices or BYOD they tend to think

399

MDM<font color="#CCCCCC"> and i like to call that you know</font>

421
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:17,600
it's a little bit out just really

422
00:16:15,619 --> 00:16:20,299
understanding that hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm responsible</font>

423
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">for security and but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't longer have</font>

the control<font color="#CCCCCC"> and used to have right</font>

425
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:30,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">second</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think is that the notion that</font>

426
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,759
you know my own network is just one part

427
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:33,709
of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i really need to understand</font>

428
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,709
because more and more we're going to see

429
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:39,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">new networks new devices floating around</font>

430
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:40,309
our networks that want to interact<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

431
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:42,049
if we're just looking only at our

432
00:16:40,309 --> 00:16:44,868
network we were really missing the full

433
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:47,269
picture of what it is to secure data and

434
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:50,239
enterprises today<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then finally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

435
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:52,339
think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been I think a hard</font>

436
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:54,169
thing for security is that stuff happens

437
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:55,279
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bluetooth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> locks things</font>

438
00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:56,749
happen people don't think of the

439
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,749
security implications and you usually

440
00:16:56,749 --> 00:17:01,369
finding out you know afterwards<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

441
00:16:59,749 --> 00:17:03,649
that's going to happen more and more

442
00:17:01,369 --> 00:17:06,799
with IOT<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> green CIT</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

443
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:08,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">spinning up in the enterprise and we're</font>

444
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the ready</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

445
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:13,490
secure them without trying to put

<font color="#E5E5E5">roadblocks up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you can't do this right</font>

447
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:17,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">yes be able people going to want to do</font>

448
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,209
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going to happen and how do we</font>

449
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:21,619
actually detect those<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they</font>

450
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:25,579
understand what's going on and then

451
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:27,049
protect those environments<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's</font>

452
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:29,418
what we've been focused on is really

453
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:31,490
kind of trying to figure out how do you

454
00:17:29,419 --> 00:17:33,590
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure these environments and we</font>

455
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,890
really look at it as looking at it from

456
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:37,080
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> airspace in right</font>

457
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:39,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the infrastructure out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

458
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,949
able to look you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> discover on</font>

459
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:43,410
the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the devices in your</font>

460
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:46,050
network whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> their wireless wired</font>

by you whether their infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

463
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:53,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">hoc mode whether their client based</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

464
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:55,649
really detect all of those and then look

465
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,750
at how<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're related to each other and</font>

466
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:59,880
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're connecting to analyzing</font>

467
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,410
those config so you understand you know

468
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,750
what kind of threat they pose to your

469
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:06,030
environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so it's really you know</font>

470
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:08,430
we think the wave to look at this is not

471
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:10,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">here's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my infrastructure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look out what's</font>

472
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:12,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">around my environment trying to connect</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">four part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of my environment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for trying</font>

to connect to my environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

475
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:21,209
we've actually built<font color="#E5E5E5"> an IOT security</font>

476
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:23,669
platform where you put sensors just

477
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:25,080
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> it listens to everything that's</font>

478
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,760
in your environment senses all the

479
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,980
devices you can connect into your water

480
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,930
network and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see but really think this is</font>

481
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,000
a way of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just need to kind of be in</font>

482
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:35,340
that same physical space to understand

483
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,650
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> wire is there what wireless is</font>

484
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:40,560
there what bluetooth is there and how

485
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:42,840
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are communicating and you find some</font>

486
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,669
really fascinating stuff we did that we

487
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,730
were brought in to cover the<font color="#CCCCCC"> superbowl</font>

488
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:50,490
where they had<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1200 access points</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

489
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:53,580
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> are providing Wi-Fi access to</font>

490
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:56,070
every day you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ticket holders</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

491
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,990
also had<font color="#E5E5E5"> wireless POS systems</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so when</font>

492
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:00,480
you came in you know they're basically

493
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:02,490
scanning your badge<font color="#CCCCCC"> your your ticket to</font>

494
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,070
make sure you get in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Wi-Fi</font>

495
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:07,500
enabled<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have all the coaches right</font>

496
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:09,300
the teams are using the surface pads

497
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">there on a Wi-Fi network that's isolated</font>

498
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:14,970
as well you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> interactive</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

499
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">bluetooth kind of proximity interactive</font>

500
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:19,110
which we're seeing more and more where

501
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,450
people actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to engage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with you</font>

502
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:23,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">so you walk by and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> engagement so</font>

503
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:25,650
those types of environments<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

504
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:27,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to see where it's not one</font>

00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:29,310
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> segment there's a bunch of</font>

508
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:35,790
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> conditioning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another really</font>

509
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:39,840
interesting use case<font color="#CCCCCC"> i found was that we</font>

510
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:41,940
have a customer who<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into they</font>

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,399
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> owned a bunch of performing</font>

512
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,930
arts centers and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they notice where</font>

513
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,340
people dropping<font color="#E5E5E5"> ibeacons</font>

514
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:50,230
most people are familiar with<font color="#CCCCCC"> ibeacons</font>

515
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:52,449
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're basically people they</font>

516
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:54,610
noticed that people were dropping

517
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:58,180
ibeacons into then try to take over

518
00:19:54,610 --> 00:20:00,010
people's phones and<font color="#CCCCCC"> show their ads to</font>

519
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:02,200
customers in these performing arts

520
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:03,820
centers<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's just an example of where</font>

521
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,310
you know you might not consider that

522
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:09,970
trying to take data or data theft or I

523
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:11,889
you know security<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's basically you</font>

524
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,750
know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of customers</font>

their experience away from me as the as

527
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:21,220
the company and really start to do their

528
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:22,720
own experience so it's really

529
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,400
fascinating the types of things were

530
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,210
starting to see as more and more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

531
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:30,700
these devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> get into the area so that</font>

532
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:33,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's it in terms of what i want to</font>

533
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:38,500
share<font color="#CCCCCC"> there any questions</font>

534
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:47,470
happy to take them<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

535
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:50,260
yeah so the question was is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bluetooth</font>

536
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:52,510
and wireless and<font color="#CCCCCC"> zigbee is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it starting</font>

537
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:55,000
to be a concern<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet and I'd say yeah</font>

538
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,990
we're starting to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> not everywhere</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

539
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's certain you know so i think</font>

540
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:00,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">first-year bluetooth which was kind of</font>

541
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:03,400
mostly kind of consumer<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> smaller</font>

542
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:05,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> low energy used a lot</font>

543
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,320
and really becoming one of the backbones

544
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:10,570
of kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IOT devices for sharing</font>

545
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,030
information and absolutely where you

546
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:16,030
know certain markets we're seeing a lot

547
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:17,500
of interest in<font color="#CCCCCC"> bluetooth as a as a</font>

548
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:19,690
threat vector<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's still pretty</font>

549
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,100
early and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> zigbee you know the</font>

550
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,570
other thing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> IOT is I think the</font>

551
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,500
standards are really still forming of

552
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:28,149
what's going to be the dominant

553
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:29,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">machine-to-machine protocol for IOT</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

554
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:34,400
some emerging but I think that's very

555
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:50,990
nation<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

556
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:57,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">yep in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that set the answer the question</font>

557
00:21:50,990 --> 00:22:02,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the question everyone knows</font>

558
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:03,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah so what we what we do is we have a</font>

559
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:05,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">scent you know what we do is basically</font>

560
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,560
have a sensor<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's out there</font>

561
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,870
collecting all this information<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your</font>

562
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,429
airspace<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're wired networks and</font>

563
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:12,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's sending</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it up to a cloud portal</font>

564
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:14,690
where we have all the intelligence<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

565
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:16,129
analytics<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is basically looking at</font>

566
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:20,000
all that behavior all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the connectivity</font>

567
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:22,550
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those devices and so whether it's</font>

568
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,440
things like what<font color="#E5E5E5"> device-to-device</font>

569
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:26,990
communication is there

570
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,760
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> type of networks right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

571
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:31,610
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> networks more of a mesh and</font>

572
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:33,410
connections of devices not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear the</font>

network<font color="#CCCCCC"> I on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here the</font>

devices

575
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,310
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a device it's connected this</font>

576

network<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's been connected to this</font>

577
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:41,480
network and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> we draw that out so you</font>

578
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:43,820
historically can<font color="#CCCCCC"> trend different devices</font>

579
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">we can see what devices</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if I've</font>

580
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:48,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">come into the office</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I go home I come</font>

581
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:50,450
back we can see what networks<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font>

582
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:53,420
connected to when I was not in the

583
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:56,120
office so we all that we can track in

584
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:57,470
these devices are very chatty and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

585
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,850
know keep a lot of history

586
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:01,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">you'd be surprised how much information</font>

587
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:03,199
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asked about bluetooth</font>

588
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:05,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">generals ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my bluetooth</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the amount of</font>

589
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:09,020
information that boot Bluetooth beacons

590
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:10,940
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quite amazing and and back to</font>

591
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,190
the point of a lot of these new devices

592
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:14,780
that are using<font color="#CCCCCC"> bluetooth their</font>

593
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:17,090
unencrypted sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean they just</font>

594
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:21,440
have security hasn't come to them and so

595
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:24,439
a lot of it like for example out of the

596
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:28,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">there is a presentation at DEFCON where</font>

597
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:30,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think out of 16 of the you know major</font>

598
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:32,959
manufacturers of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bluetooth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> locks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

599
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:35,240
are able to wirelessly<font color="#E5E5E5"> pop 12 of them</font>

600
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">right one of them that was touted to</font>

601
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,390
have really good security

602
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:39,890
yes it was pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wireless</font>

603
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:41,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">bluetooth wise they just took</font>

604
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:43,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">screwdriver in turn it so they they</font>

605
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,070
focus well<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> style you know</font>

606
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:47,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">the technology side but they forgot the</font>

607
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,678
<font color="#CCCCCC">locks that so</font>

608
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,500
you know it's just it's kind of

609
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:53,900
fascinating that<font color="#CCCCCC"> melting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the physical</font>

610
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the and the information world so</font>

611
00:23:53,900 --> 00:24:01,690
great

612
00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:01,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok well thank you very much</font>
