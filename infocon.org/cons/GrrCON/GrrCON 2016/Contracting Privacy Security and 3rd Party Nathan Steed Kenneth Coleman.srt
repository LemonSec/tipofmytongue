ahead and we're going to go ahead and

3
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:13,110

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,540
contracting for security privacy and

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:19,050
some vendor management aspects as well

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">to contracts since we're at this</font>

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,990
conference we felt the need to come up

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,720
with some sort of hacker<font color="#E5E5E5"> names for</font>

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,250
ourselves so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I go x rays ups</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as far as</font>

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,349

<font color="#CCCCCC">kong but my real name i don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if i</font>

should say it<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the materials so</font>

13
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:39,570
first whenever you come to the legal

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,579
presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's always preface by this</font>

15
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,890
disclaimer nothing we say here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

16
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,390
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken as legal advice and then they</font>

17
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,910
proceeded to give you legal advice which

18
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">is always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of odd to me so we don't</font>

19
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,519
have a disclaimer this stuff you can

20
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,019
take it to the bank

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,600
feel free to rely on this as much as you

22
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,010
want however if you feel it creates an

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,390
attorney-client relationship will be

24
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,460
happy to charge you for your time on the

25
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,940
way out the door cash only

26
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:06,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to cover</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 topics</font>

27
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:09,840
through the time we have together some

28
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,460
in more detail than others<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a</font>

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,040
quick overview of what we are going to

30
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:17,309
cover one thing I want to caution<font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font>

31
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">before we jump into the material is that</font>

32
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,600
there is sometimes a temptation when we

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,840
cover it this way to look at these

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,729
provisions and topics as silos within an

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,439
agreement<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's not really the best</font>

36
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:30,750
way to look at a contract you really

37
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:33,179
need to look at it holistically and

38
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,090
recognize that sometimes if you're going

39
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,979
to give up in one area<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can often</font>

40
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,570
make those provisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> up somewhere</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

41
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:42,000
in the agreement when you understand

42
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,039
what you want to get or what you need to

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,340
concede<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at other spots in the</font>

44
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,689
contract where you can get those things

45
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,189
if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give it up in</font>

46
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:52,860
a certain section so even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though for</font>

47
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:55,710
convenience purposes were talking about

48
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,210
these as<font color="#CCCCCC"> discrete</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sections recognize</font>

49
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,740
that that is not the best way to look at

50
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,949
a contract and said you need to look at

51
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,869
it holistically<font color="#CCCCCC"> so without further ado I</font>

52
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:07,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hand it over to my colleague</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> donkey</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">kong to talk about often where the</font>

54
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,360
conversation starts when you're dealing

deal with vendors<font color="#E5E5E5"> there will be an</font>

initial<font color="#E5E5E5"> that fight over whose contract</font>

lifted from something that we received

and this is this what we consider in

00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,450
some ways kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the standard line from</font>

industry terms and used by thousands of

aware that this is a thumbs-up or

<font color="#CCCCCC">Nate night work you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> predominantly</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i received an email</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font>

99
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:42,430
from the legal side and it says this is

a thumbs-up or<font color="#E5E5E5"> thumbs-down transaction</font>

101
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">this email alone makes me think that</font>

this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a thumbs-down transaction and</font>

103
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it's important to point out</font>

104
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,260
that when they say<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not an</font>

enterprise software licensing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:01,000
two opposites of each other it's not

109
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:02,739
like there's one or the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> this so</font>

110
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,820
when we got this email<font color="#CCCCCC"> we call the</font>

111
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:05,230
client<font color="#CCCCCC"> like what</font>

112
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,670
so what is this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean maybe it's</font>

113
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:09,220
not that significant they're like oh no

114
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:11,140
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 750 thousand dollar</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> agreement</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

115
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,850
feel free to review but you see that the

116
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:15,609
starting point that the vendor<font color="#E5E5E5"> provided</font>

117
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:18,730
us at the outset

118
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:20,049
so obviously if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're if you agree at</font>

119
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,370
the outside and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at a</font>

120
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:22,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of these provisions typically from</font>

the customer side if you agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

122
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,920
outset that you're going to use the

123
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,390
vendor paper without any sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fight</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

124
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,850
mean obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's an automatic loss</font>

125
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:32,830
of positioning right off the start the

126
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">the legal review to the extent you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send</font>

that document to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> attorneys is going</font>

128
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,719
to cost more to review

129
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">I mean if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they can start with your</font>

standard agreement and just review<font color="#E5E5E5"> red</font>

never seen before

134
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,650
it's going to be less expensive to

135
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:49,270
review that the first

00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,289
additionally<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's more to manage because</font>

simply kicking the can down the road but

168
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,960
it can help you to get an agreement in

169
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,789
place and then when you're actually

170
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,799
talking about ordering<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> service and</font>

00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:09,640
do focus

licensing<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the issues related to that</font>

181
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:18,009
so we have seen a lot of these

182
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:21,099
agreements and as we work through

183
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:23,860
this presentation we<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold provisions out</font>

184
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:26,319
of contracts that we've seen that you've

185
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:29,289
probably seen as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and use those as</font>

186
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,419
bad examples and then some compromise

187
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:32,770
language potentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the road and</font>

188
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:34,149
if you if you want to copy this

00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:35,830
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than happy to give you</font>

to use these provisions<font color="#E5E5E5"> use like the</font>

194
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:45,789

ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the issue here is as we</font>

198
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:58,330
move to the cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea generally is</font>

199
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,789
that these contracts are going to be

200
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:04,330
simpler<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's gonna be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> less</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">burden on your IT department and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

202
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:09,068
<font color="#CCCCCC">company</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that notion is this idea of not</font>

203
00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:11,258
only are the contracts easier but all

204
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:12,789
you have to do is click the<font color="#CCCCCC"> i agree and</font>

205
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:14,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're good it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a it's a cloud agreement</font>

206
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:17,979
there's no real negotiation to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ken's</font>

207
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:20,860
earlier . that's not really true

208
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:22,120
at a minimum<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should print out the</font>

209
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,770
click-through agreement and put a

210
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,240
signature block on it and sign it and

211
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,889
file it away somewhere so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

212
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,449
there's any sort of dispute down the

213
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:30,129
line as far as what the terms of the

214
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:32,289
agreement are you can go back to a

215
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:34,539
document say look we agreed to this if

216
00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:37,808
you're clicking<font color="#CCCCCC"> and i agree</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> accept</font>

217
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:39,248
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of provision and not keeping a copy</font>

218
00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:40,749
of it then you're going to be in a tough

219
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:51,940
spot when you need to interpret terms

220
00:07:40,749 --> 00:08:03,430
later<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

221
00:07:51,940 --> 00:08:04,510
that is a great question and sit tight

222
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,330
for about<font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes because we're</font>

223
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:08,860
going to cover that specifically but

224
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:12,370
that is one of the concerns is the the

225
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,720
modification of terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the road the</font>

226
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,890
the other issue is that these

227
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">click-through terms are often very</font>

228
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:20,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">one-sided that they have been drafted</font>

229
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,450
with the vendors concerns in mind<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

230
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:25,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're not going to be very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> favorable</font>

231
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:27,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">the notice and change provision is</font>

232
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,320
additional concern<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will flush out a</font>

233
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,969
little bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you don't want</font>

234
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,099
to do is undo<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> click-through</font>

235
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:34,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already negotiated in</font>

236
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:36,460
the past so sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll ago she</font>

237
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">this contract the vendor will send an</font>

238
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,849
update of maintenance or support or

239
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:41,229
something that will require<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

240
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:44,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">click-through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that then can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it Nick</font>

241
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:45,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">negate all of that prior work that</font>

242
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:48,760
you've done so you want to be very wary

243
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:50,199
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> click through agreements and despite</font>

244
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,830
what they say<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there's enough money on</font>

245
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,840
the table

246
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,040
these things are negotiable so don't

247
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:58,900
fall into that trap of thinking you

248
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:00,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't negotiate it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so next we're</font>

249
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,689
going to consider modifications and

250
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">really there's two types of</font>

251
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:05,590
modifications were thinking about here

252
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,270
the first is modifications to the terms

253
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:09,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">so to your point just ask the question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

254
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:11,230
moment ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then the second one would</font>

255
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:14,020
be modifications actually to the service

256
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:17,620
that the vendor is providing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of</font>

257
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:19,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">we do understand most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> service provider</font>

258
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,800
agreements when the first are sent to

259
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,680
you will say you know we can modify

260
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,479
these terms upon notice to you or upon

261
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,180
posting you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> notice of the change on</font>

262
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:31,060
the website<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you simply click through</font>

263
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:32,979
and don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> let you know actually get a</font>

264
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,959
signed copy negotiate at least that

265
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,400
provision of the agreement then you are

266
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,900
subject to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> vendor saying you know</font>

267
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,730
two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually change the</font>

268
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,439
terms<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I don't know if you noticed</font>

269
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,300
but we did post it on the website and

270
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,980
you agree that we could do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that</font>

271
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,599
does become an effective mechanism for

272
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">amending the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the terms of the agreement</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">unless you negotiate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the outset and</font>

if you're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this agreement</font>

277
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,690
has now made its way to the attorneys

278
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,790
and you're looking for a legal review of

279
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:02,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">a document i mean this this is a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">no-brainer you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't allow our vision in</font>

281
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:05,949
there that says<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna spend</font>

282
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:07,780
money on negotiating the terms of this

283
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:09,310
agreement with our service provider and

284
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">then after we sign it we all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agree that</font>

285

you guys can change it whenever you want

286
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,410
so this is language that specifically

you're dealing with a particularly

292
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:24,340
sticky vendor and they really don't want

293
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,319
to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> up this provision and they are</font>

simply<font color="#CCCCCC"> not negotiating with you it's a</font>

fairly small<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know deal and you guys</font>

power that you would like you can

298
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,430
provide that the agreement can be

299
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:38,440
changed but then providing you a certain

amount of<font color="#CCCCCC"> advance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> written notice and</font>

301
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,680
what we would say in that situation and

302
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,420
you need to give yourself a<font color="#CCCCCC"> termination</font>

right<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you disagree with any of the</font>

00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:26,200
might be beneficial for you to add some

functionality<font color="#E5E5E5"> but most often in terms of</font>

the vendor agrees not only allows them

and then six months<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said no</font>

335

was very imperative<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that service</font>

situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with modifications to the</font>

something we call<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one-way door</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">service provider that's fine you can</font>

345
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,529
make changes to the service you can

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,060
increase the level of functional

347
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:09,370
you can make the<font color="#E5E5E5"> services better you can</font>

make the service more secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> but she</font>

cannot remove any of the functionality

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're currently using throughout</font>

351
00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:15,998
the term of the agreement<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've paid you</font>

352
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:17,620
a set amount of money<font color="#CCCCCC"> oftentimes in</font>

353
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:19,720
advance to use this service for a

354
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,999
specific amount of time you can reduce

357
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:31,029
agree to this provision<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SLA is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

358
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:33,610
love<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one</font>

359
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:36,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> love getting the weeds on SL</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a's</font>

360
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:37,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">so this is a provision this is actually</font>

361
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:40,329
a little bit better than you might see

362
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:42,279
at the outset in a contract

363
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:44,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">often times the initial</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cut says</font>

364
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:45,699
something like we will provide the

365
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">service or we will use reasonable</font>

366
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:52,809
efforts to provide the service to you .

367
00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:54,219
so this is one step better but not much

368
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:56,199
and the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I like about this</font>

369
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,819
provision is that it looks good when

370
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:59,949
you're reading it but when you get into

371
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:01,269
the details of it may not be so good so

372
00:12:59,949 --> 00:13:02,949
you start reading this thing you're like

373
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:04,720
wow a hundred percent of time

374
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:06,219
that's fantastic<font color="#CCCCCC"> like they're willing to</font>

375
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,689
put this in the agreement

376
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,600
well you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to keep reading because it</font>

377
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:12,399
also excludes then<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is scheduled or</font>

378
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,180
emergency maintenance well<font color="#CCCCCC"> hold up</font>

379
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">schedule might be okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's we can talk</font>

380
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">about that but emergency maintenance</font>

381
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:23,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's that doesn't seem right and then</font>

382
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,550
it keeps going<font color="#CCCCCC"> so downtime exist when</font>

383
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:28,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're unable to transmit or receive</font>

384
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:29,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and is measured from the time the</font>

385
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,629
trouble ticket is<font color="#E5E5E5"> opened by the customer</font>

386
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,069
so it gets really philosophical like if

387
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:34,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a downtime and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nobody's there to</font>

388
00:13:33,069 --> 00:13:35,500
see it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> count is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

389
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">time</font>

390
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,800
apparently not for them but maybe it

391
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,750
should

392
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,180
so then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotta keep on going though</font>

393
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,949
upon receiving<font color="#CCCCCC"> a report then you'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

394
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:48,069
a credit for<font color="#E5E5E5"> two percent of the monthly</font>

395
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:49,149
fee<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to fifty percent for the affected</font>

396
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:52,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">service</font>

397
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:55,389
well and that applies to each hour of

398
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:58,300
downtime so what has started out as a

399
00:13:55,389 --> 00:14:00,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">100-percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up time commitment within</font>

400
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:03,099
the first seven or eight words of the

401
00:14:00,939 --> 00:14:04,569
provision<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't nothing really</font>

402
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,339
happens until there's been at least an

403
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:08,319
hour of downtime so now you're down to

404
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:10,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">99.5</font>

405
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:12,370
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you got to go there and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

406
00:14:10,689 --> 00:14:14,620
only getting two percent of the monthly

407
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:17,199
fee<font color="#CCCCCC"> captive fifty percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so if it's</font>

408
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:19,089
down for the entire month<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're still</font>

409
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,620
only getting half of the fees you pay

410
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:22,329
despite getting none of the service you

411
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">paid for</font>

412
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:27,189
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are the kind of things</font>

413
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,319
that you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> flush out and a couple</font>

414
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:31,509
of things to look at

415
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:33,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">first of all as it's not clear beware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

416
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:35,980
the standard language from the outset

417
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:38,769
from the vendor<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you need to</font>

418
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:41,529
measure multiple things feel free to get

419
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:45,550
a little bit more specific as far as the

420
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:47,050
SLA<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> times the only thing</font>

421
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,269
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're concerned about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or do you</font>

422
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:52,689
need to be worried about response times

423
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:54,160
24<font color="#E5E5E5"> messages sending</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or being received</font>

00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:56,469
sometimes measured in milliseconds or

425
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,660
whatever and then get that up time

426
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:00,790
commitment on paper most vendors will

427
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,769
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're up time has been over</font>

430
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:09,279
commit to that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's somebody you</font>

435
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,220
that

436
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:19,748
well why not it provokes an interesting

437
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,329
question and then you gotta figure out

438
00:15:19,749 --> 00:15:24,189
what counts as downtime so on the

439
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:26,709
previous provision as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it talked about</font>

440
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:28,120
scheduled or emergency maintenance

441
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:29,768
well let's figure out what scheduled

442
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,059
means if you call us up in the morning

443
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:31,779
and say oh by the way the system is

444
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:34,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be down this afternoon</font>

445

<font color="#E5E5E5">scheduled</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not what we're</font>

446
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,519
getting at in this provision so how much

447
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:41,259
notice do you need for it to count as

448
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,730
scheduled you need a couple hours do you

449
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:45,970
need a couple days you need a couple

450
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:47,860
weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> SLA are very flexible in the sense</font>

451
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:50,800
that you're not going to need the same

452
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:52,120
SLA for every contract that you're

453
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,998
working on<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can probably get away</font>

454
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,639
with some lower levels for non-critical

455
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:59,860
type of software but those things that

456
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:01,240
are running the enterprise and you need

457
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,699
access during the day like<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's an</font>

458
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,959
online store for example and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's down</font>

459
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:07,149
you're not making any money

460
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">well you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> high level of</font>

461
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:11,499
commitment and flesh out what is

462
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:13,120
scheduled<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes you can't get the</font>

463
00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:16,540
notice maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just have a standing</font>

464
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:19,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">maintenance window during which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> downtime</font>

465
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:22,089
won't count against the commitment

466
00:16:19,059 --> 00:16:23,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out who's gonna</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you also</font>

467
00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:25,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">maybe want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> include a cap on the</font>

468
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,969
amount of<font color="#CCCCCC"> down time that you can have a</font>

469
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:29,709
month so you can do during these hours

470
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">but no more than four hours in the</font>

471
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:33,160
entire month

472
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,930
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> figure out who's going to</font>

473
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,430
monitor<font color="#E5E5E5"> up time I had a client who said</font>

474
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:38,949
you know what we always want to monitor

475
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:41,769
it because it turns out when the vendor

476
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:43,689
monitors it<font color="#CCCCCC"> they never fall lower than</font>

477
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:44,440
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> up time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> commitments crazy how that</font>

478
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,660
works

479
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,870
so we want the ability to do that to

480
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:52,000
some vendors will push back on this and

481
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:54,279
say look we don't want your monitoring

482
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,980
of the system to actually affect the

483
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:58,779
uptime<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the system so we need to</font>

484
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,519
figure out how you're going to do that

485
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:02,500
in a way that's not going to affect the

486
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,959
actual delivery of the service itself

487
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,640
and we get you guys in the room with

488
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,829
their guys and then everybody figures it

489
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,350
out at some point you want to address

490
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:12,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the remedies are too so we talked</font>

491
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:15,520
about that credit in that previous

492
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:17,290
provision and the ability to recover for

493
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,750
a certain percentage for a certain

494
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:22,599
amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> down time you saw that cap in</font>

495
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,949
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> though that fifty percent cap that</font>

496
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:26,379
doesn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> any sense just as a</font>

497
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:27,819
fairness argument because again what if

498
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,530
it is down for the entire month or

499
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:32,649
whatever it what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's down for more</font>

500
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:34,600
than you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty percent of the month</font>

501
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:37,270
we are going to be losing money at that

502
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:40,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">point you also want to consider maybe</font>

503
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:43,360
having a trigger in there for excessive

504
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:45,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">downtime in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any one month or continual</font>

505
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,520
failures to hit the<font color="#CCCCCC"> uptime commitment</font>

506
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:50,710
that aren't really bad but annoying<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

507
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,470
if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this system that is supposed</font>

508
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:57,850
to be able to say 99<font color="#CCCCCC"> 9 and 1 months</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

509
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:59,950

00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:01,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">oftentimes these credits will be your</font>

511
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:03,010
sole and exclusive remedy and we'll talk

512
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,540
about that in a minute but<font color="#CCCCCC"> oftentimes</font>

513
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:06,850
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be your sole and exclusive remedy</font>

514
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:10,450
for failure to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit the uptime and it's</font>

515
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:12,250
not enough to make you want to walk away

516
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:15,070
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly aggravating</font>

517
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:16,419
so you want to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe in there if</font>

518
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:19,178
you don't hit the<font color="#CCCCCC"> UP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time in three</font>

519
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:20,590
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we can terminate and maybe</font>

520
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:23,470
you're not going to terminate<font color="#CCCCCC"> but at</font>

521
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:25,659
least it provides that stick to the

522
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:28,179
vendor to have some motivation to

523
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:30,070
address any issues that arise because

524
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:31,419
they know you could walk away

525
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:33,580
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i like to do when we're</font>

526
00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:35,380
working through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SLA is just pull out</font>

527
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,360
my calculator and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright let's</font>

528
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,580
figure this out let's assume we have one

529
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">hour of downtime this month in the</font>

530
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,370
middle of the day that that affects our

531
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:45,410
operations and then run through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> form</font>

532
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:47,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kayla</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they've provided to you and</font>

533
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:49,190
figure out if that makes any sort of

534
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:51,830
business sense to agree to oftentimes

535
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:53,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">spoiler alert it doesn't you go through</font>

536
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,740
this and you figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

537
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,159
down for a couple hours we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

538
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:59,960
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> $75 back then you think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

539
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">I have to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to my boss and say well</font>

get you fired or not so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would do that</font>

543
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:11,449
analysis and provide that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the better</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">take a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look I cannot with a straight</font>

545
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:17,510
face go to my bosses and say hey we were

respond to concerns that you have so

557
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:42,980
here's a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> provision sample</font>

558
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:45,110
provisions that deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a few of these</font>

559
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,910
aspects not all of them and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> SLA</font>

560
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:49,219
have so many moving parts and variables

561
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:51,590
in them that you can often get what you

562
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,120
want if you're creative and how you look

563
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,730
at them as opposed to just focusing on

564
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,800
one piece the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the amount of credit or</font>

565
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:59,390
the percentage itself so this first

566
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">provision deals with scheduled downtime</font>

567
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,690
and the notice and the amount of<font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

568
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,178
<font color="#CCCCCC">time that you can have in any given</font>

569
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:08,000
month<font color="#CCCCCC"> the second paragraph deals with</font>

570
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:10,370
this situation of chronic downtime so if

571
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,800
it falls below<font color="#E5E5E5"> 90 99 in two consecutive</font>

572
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:15,620
months or three months in any 12-month

573
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,178
period<font color="#CCCCCC"> or if you have one month that is</font>

574
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:19,909
really bad if it's below ninety percent

575
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:22,370
in this example then that allows you the

576
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:24,260
right to<font color="#E5E5E5"> determinate like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said it just</font>

help you out when<font color="#E5E5E5"> when the system is</font>

582
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:38,809
back at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the SLA that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

about allocating<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> determining</font>

that we can suspend or terminate your

these things have happened

so for example that you're using the

agreements for this provision you know

626

in terms<font color="#CCCCCC"> of when talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about privacy</font>

that most vendors are not going to

00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:35,780
relocate the geographic location of

737

not happy with it

739

the risk is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of these provisions</font>

are in there to help you have that

742
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:50,060
conversation with the vendor to ask the

743
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:51,980
question and no<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's it's too close</font>

around this time of the year again<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

be aware of what those issues are so

<font color="#CCCCCC">you're talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about as far as disaster</font>

00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,070
their plan is sufficient<font color="#CCCCCC"> well how are we</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">going to know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if they're playing</font>

00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,670
look at it again<font color="#E5E5E5"> most vendors are not</font>

understand how things are going to work

770
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,300
here then you can analyze whether it's

adequate or not

772
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,930

providing you disaster recovery services

774
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:55,160
is it on you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to clear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the disaster or do</font>

if you are not in a situation where the

unlimited liability so that's always the

best is that if there's any breach<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

dollars per record which may seem a

1063
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:29,480
little counterintuitive because you

1064
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:30,980
think well we have cyber insurance we

1065
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,210
can just be careless with these records

1066
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,460
because insurance will cover us if

1067

there's any issue down the road<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

contrary it actually a cyber liability

1069
00:36:37,549 --> 00:36:41,869
insurance is more of an indicator of an

1070

organization that takes security

seriously<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that the presence of cyber</font>

some security obligations that are what

negotiate some of these on our own which

00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:18,799
I would not advise you to do but if you

these are compromised spots and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we might</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">not always get all these things some of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">freeze up so we don't have any audio</font>

1239
00:42:38,589 --> 00:45:03,470
until about the 45-minute<font color="#CCCCCC"> walk</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">sorry problem</font>

00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:06,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm in and protect you from those claims</font>

1242
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:08,300
so it's generally limited those

1243
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:11,118
<font color="#E5E5E5">third-party situations</font>

1244
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:13,220
this is a very specific identification

1245
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:16,760
that you might see<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the first cut</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1246
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:18,709
it's actually not bad as far as it goes

1247
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:20,690
it deals<font color="#CCCCCC"> tho specifically with</font>

1248
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:22,250
intellectual property only and only in

1249
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:23,510
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> United States so if this is a</font>

1250
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:26,270
situation where there are no

1251
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:29,210
professional services<font color="#CCCCCC"> no on-site</font>

1252
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:32,900
services and not outside of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> United</font>

1253
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:34,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">States this is probably not bad but one</font>

1254
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:37,730
thing it doesn't deal with it all is

1255
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:39,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">data security and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> breeches so that's one</font>

1256
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:41,480
thing you want to think about is ok if

1257
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:42,740
we have its security breach of some sort

1258
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,720
of our data gets out

1259
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:49,098
are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come in and identify us</font>

1260
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:52,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we get sued by a customer or a state</font>

1261
00:45:49,099 --> 00:45:53,869
attorney general<font color="#CCCCCC"> you come in and you</font>

1262
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:55,340
protect us from that<font color="#CCCCCC"> claimed in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> addition</font>

1263
00:45:53,869 --> 00:46:00,230
to paying for any expenses that we would

1264
00:45:55,340 --> 00:46:01,880
have as a part of that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

1265
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:04,340
issue is if you're providing services to

1266
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,750
us that are not timely<font color="#CCCCCC"> what kind of</font>

1267
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:09,230
protection do we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> her what kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1268
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:10,910
remedies do we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the failure to</font>

1269
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:13,400
provide those services incurs some

1270
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:14,810
liability on our end

1271
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,339
so here's some compromise language that

1272
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:18,109
gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a son at some of these things</font>

1273
00:46:16,339 --> 00:46:20,839
you can see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> indemnification itself</font>

1274
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:23,598
as much broader<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it also applies to</font>

1275
00:46:20,839 --> 00:46:25,790
our use of the services and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the notices</font>

1276
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:27,680
bottom one this is specifically to

1277
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:30,320
address situations where there might be

1278
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:33,109
on-site services<font color="#CCCCCC"> the typical example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1279
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:34,790
uses<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendor comes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on site kicks over a</font>

1280
00:46:33,109 --> 00:46:35,690
gas can in your data center and<font color="#E5E5E5"> burn the</font>

1281
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:36,890
place down

1282
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:40,099
well they should be on the hook for that

1283
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:42,319
sort of thing which under the terms of

1284
00:46:40,099 --> 00:46:44,839
the contract they may not be because it

1285
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:48,410
links in to this second issue which is

1286
00:46:44,839 --> 00:46:51,770
limitations on liability and any caps on

1287
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:53,118
damages that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I referenced earlier so you</font>

1288
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:55,280
can see what they say<font color="#E5E5E5"> here they're not</font>

1289
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:58,400
liable to us or anyone else for loss of

1290
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:01,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then a list of things including data</font>

1291
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright well let's let's talk about that</font>

1292
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:05,240
one vendor<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're giving you data or</font>

1293
00:47:03,349 --> 00:47:07,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're creating or processing data for</font>

1294
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:10,040
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't have a copy of you should be</font>

1295
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:13,339
on the hook for any sort of losses that

1296
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:15,080
arise and then look at this last

1297
00:47:13,339 --> 00:47:16,820
sentence in the first paragraph where it

1298
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:19,670
says nothing in these terms

1299
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:21,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">will limit or exclude our liability so</font>

1300
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:23,600
vendors liability for gross negligence

1301
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:26,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">intentional misconduct or death or</font>

1302
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:28,400
personal injury<font color="#E5E5E5"> they legally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> limit</font>

1303
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:29,689
their liability for that anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1304
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're not giving you something here</font>

1305
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:33,620
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sentence</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you don't</font>

1306
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:35,600
otherwise already have so<font color="#CCCCCC"> then saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

1307
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:36,950
look<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run capped for gross negligence</font>

1308
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:40,279
and death

1309
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:41,720
well thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guess week</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but you didn't</font>

1310
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,670
even have to say that and we still have

1311
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:45,950
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you see the second paragraph</font>

1312
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:48,770
which is the cap on liability<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred</font>

1313
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:50,509
bucks<font color="#E5E5E5"> again if you walk in your boss's</font>

1314
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:52,970
office<font color="#CCCCCC"> bri well they burned down the</font>

1315
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:55,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">data center</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good news is we got a</font>

1316
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:57,439
hundred dollars out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that</font>

1317
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:00,620
so what you might often<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear though from</font>

1318
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:03,710
a vendor is this the second bullet down

1319
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:07,190
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> they might say look if we uncap our</font>

1320
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:08,630
liability for you or for all of our

1321
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:10,490
customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> then all that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

1322
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:12,320
happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if we have a problem</font>

1323
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:13,729
somebody's gonna get a lot and a lot of

1324
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:16,910
people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get nothing</font>

1325
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:18,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">so instead says the vendor</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how about</font>

1326
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:20,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">this how about we kept our liability for</font>

1327
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:22,460
all of our customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ten</font>

1328
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,950
thousand dollars<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that if we go down</font>

1329
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:29,480
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of our customers get</font>

1330
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:31,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">$10,000 I say well I'm not representing</font>

1331
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:34,100
all your other customers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

1332
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:35,930
believe for a second that I'm the

1333
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:38,330
biggest customer that you haven't you

1334
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:41,270
haven't agreed to uncap liability or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1335
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:45,020
higher cap for another customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that</font>

1336
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:46,670
that uh that provision<font color="#CCCCCC"> capping liability</font>

1337
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:47,990
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> other customers only works if</font>

1338
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:49,910
they've done it for every single one of

1339
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:51,890
their customers if<font color="#CCCCCC"> they run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> captive for</font>

1340
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:53,629
one of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you're out of luck</font>

1341
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:56,900
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I never believe for a second that</font>

1342
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:59,000
that's going to hold any water and we

1343
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:01,160
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> limited to certain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> provisions we say</font>

1344
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,690
look we don't need it unlimited in all

1345
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:04,250
situations but let's reach a compromise

1346
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:06,830
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's do get out and figure out</font>

1347
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:10,460
where we can agree so for specific

1348
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:13,400
claims that<font color="#E5E5E5"> implicate a high amount of</font>

1349
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:16,490
damage that we cannot mitigate ourselves

1350
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:17,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">so IP infringement claims we have no</font>

1351
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:19,399
idea whether you stole this from

1352
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:21,290
somebody or not whether you developed

1353

1375
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:07,349
may look at some multiplier as opposed

the amount of insurance that you carry
