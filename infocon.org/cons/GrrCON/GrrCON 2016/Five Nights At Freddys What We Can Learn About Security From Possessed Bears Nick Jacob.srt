<font color="#CCCCCC">people are gonna like other teams are</font>

00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:33,458
imagine that collaboration between teams

but<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that matures</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you may see other</font>

00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:37,239
things and that's where in the terms of

224
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,529
my game example<font color="#E5E5E5"> works out pretty well</font>

225
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">because one of the things they don't</font>

226
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:42,520
tell you when you start the game up is

227
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,838
there are actually four robots and this

228
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,649
one will run at you and come at you

229
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,089
faster than the

00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:49,540
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones if you're not watching him</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the likely also doesn't tell</font>

232
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,248
you on the first day he tells you like

233
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:56,259
two or three days<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as a fellow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ya up</font>

234
00:08:54,249 --> 00:08:58,300
by the way I forgot to mention this guy

235
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:59,559
and all of a sudden something like this

236
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">will pop out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at you</font>

it's fun so one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> an example</font>

00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:11,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">were able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reboot the VPN server and</font>

that killed all the existing ones that

00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,890
originally this was supposed to be a

00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,150
case study I left the employer that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:07,180
taken<font color="#E5E5E5"> my case study with me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but this was</font>

415
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,470
meant to be a much more technical talk

00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">if I get something like this in the</font>
