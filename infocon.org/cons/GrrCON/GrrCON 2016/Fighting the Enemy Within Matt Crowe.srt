earlier this year at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> verizon breach</font>

go take a look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's filled with</font>

55
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,239
incredible information not just from a

56
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,220
perspective of you know what's happening

57
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,930
in the industry but also some very

58
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,760
detailed statistics

59
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,129
that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

60
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,719
illuminates a lot of opinions a lot of

61
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:20,578
thoughts<font color="#CCCCCC"> and people's minds when they</font>

62
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,430
actually take a look at them so this one

63
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:24,900
here is actually the time to compromise

64
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">in this percentage on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> left that you</font>

65
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,519
see is actually the percentage of

66
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,579
respondents that said it takes days or

67
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:35,879
less<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the top is that the time to</font>

68
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:38,939
compromise and the bottom is the time to

69
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:40,620
discover those compromises<font color="#CCCCCC"> so as anyone</font>

70
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:42,299
can see here the slope<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> top-line</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have to work back to your math</font>

degree to figure out that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,269
compromises are getting faster and we're

actually getting better which is great<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

75
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:52,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">couldn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably say that four five six</font>

76
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,109
years ago as the cybercriminals really

77
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:56,730
ramped up and we got<font color="#CCCCCC"> aware now that</font>

00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:59,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being under</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seasoned attack</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">day-to-day but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not good enough</font>

they're getting faster faster than<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:06,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting faster</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right and this is a</font>

82
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:07,500
dangerous trend that we need to really

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,450
need to think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> worry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about in terms</font>

84
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,189
of the security of our data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

those devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> the compromisers took</font>

00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:32,549
here is the worrying statistic that we

see<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we know that compromises</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

bottom line that's the one that's

99
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,560
concerning to me because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe in</font>

100
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:45,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">the past that this graph</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was shifted</font>

farther to the right<font color="#CCCCCC"> even if they could</font>

them to find your<font color="#CCCCCC"> day to locate the date</font>

you know data pivot around your

105

position<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they can get out of your</font>

107
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:56,699
environment and then you actually get

108
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,040
out of the environment which is top

109
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:01,109
right the exfiltration<font color="#E5E5E5"> was much larger</font>

110
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">so now I think we're seeing an</font>

111
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:04,109
interesting gap<font color="#CCCCCC"> therebetween the minutes</font>

00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:07,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">neither is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy for them to get out</font>

114
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:09,569
or takes a little bit of time for them

115
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:11,400
to get out but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I firmly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe that we</font>

00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:13,290
look at the data breach next year report

00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,030
and we see this information will see

that graph<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bar chart on the bottom</font>

the attackers are getting better and

121
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,610
hasn't seemed to be any any sensation in
