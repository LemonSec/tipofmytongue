didn't really have an idea what to

22
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,420

your first engagement<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we're going to</font>

32
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,430
start off with a couple things on what

33
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,710
you need to do before the engagement<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

34
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,810
want to prepare your gear you want to

35
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,699
know your tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to plan ahead</font>

36

<font color="#E5E5E5">and you want to be able to find the</font>

37
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,880
goodies and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go into a</font>

38
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,520
little bit more about what each of these

39
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,619
means because<font color="#E5E5E5"> their concepts that I</font>

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,759
wasn't familiar with when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i started and</font>

41
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:42,390
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> concepts that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think are very</font>

42
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,950
important to be a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> pentester the</font>

43
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,899
first of course is to prepare your gear

44
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you're like me you've got way too</font>

45
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,500
many things you've got laptops<font color="#CCCCCC"> you got</font>

46
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">phone you got all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your fancy rubber</font>

47
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,909
duckies and Wi-Fi pineapples<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wi-Fi</font>

48
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,740
adapters things like that and you need

49
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,259
to have all of them beforehand you need

50
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,939
to you know make a list check it twice

51
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,170
make sure you have everything because if

52
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,298
you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on site and you're missing a</font>

53
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,399
vital piece of gear<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to fail</font>

54
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:09,239
and nobody wants to fail on their first

55
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,459
engagement<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you need to know your</font>

56
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,310
tools and map is a good example i'm

57
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:14,230
pretty sure that

58
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:16,030
every person who's been doing network

59
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:19,480
security for a long time here knows what

60
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:21,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">nmap is and knows how to use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but as a</font>

61
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:25,119
pen tester we need to make sure we know

62
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,530
our tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where they fail we</font>

63
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,870
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what it does</font>

64
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:32,980
we need to know how it operates we need

65
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:35,500
to know what happens when it fails<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

66
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:37,299
how it can be caught<font color="#CCCCCC"> so for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example if</font>

67
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're using my displayed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your PS</font>

68
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,590
exactly into a box<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you don't if you</font>

69
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:44,709
get a failure you need to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font>

70
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:46,060
to diagnose what it means how<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you</font>

71
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:47,830
can get around it

72
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:50,920
what settings you can change in order

73
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:52,239
for it to succeed<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to know if</font>

74
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,518
the blue team is going to catch it

75
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,110
because obviously as a pen tester<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

76
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:58,780
don't want to be caught by the blue team

77
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:03,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know the defenders catching</font>

78
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:05,860
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a bad thing most of the time and</font>

79
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,690
then you want to plan ahead and having a

80
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,069
game plan is very important because you

81
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,170
want to know what your objectives are

82
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:12,548
for the engagement<font color="#CCCCCC"> every engagement is</font>

83
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,290
going to be different sometimes your

84
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:17,620
goal is to just get into a specific

85
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:20,560
server<font color="#E5E5E5"> other times your goal is to find</font>

86
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:22,930
pci data<font color="#CCCCCC"> other times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's HIPAA data</font>

87
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">social security numbers or it might be</font>

88
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,579
showing that you can disrupt business

89
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,870
operations as a pen tester<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

90
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:31,420
that's something that not a lot of

91
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:33,790
people getting into the field understand

92
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:36,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">you need to be able to show how you</font>

93
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,929
affect the business<font color="#E5E5E5"> a CEO doesn't care</font>

94
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,230
if you get domain admin because the CEO

95
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:43,420
doesn't know what domain and means it

96
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,608
doesn't know the ramifications of it

97
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,828
what he does know the ramifications of

98
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:49,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're a widget company show that</font>

99
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:51,549
you can stop them from making widgets

100
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:54,370
completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> show them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can steal</font>

103
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,250
to a halt for an attacker you need to

104
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,100
demonstrate what an attacker could do

105
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:05,019
not just say oh I got domain admin<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

106
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,120
the best that's not the goal

107
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:09,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">you need to know how you're going to</font>

108
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,799
accomplish your goals<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to know</font>

109
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,989
what tools you can use to do certain

110
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:15,760
things you need to have a pretty good

111
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:18,280
idea of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> their network is going to</font>

112
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,108
look like when you get inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font>

113
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:21,579
to know when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do things</font>

114
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:23,530
you need to have a clear timeline that

115
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:25,330
says<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after I've completed this step</font>

116
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can move on to the next step</font>

117
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,900
and you need to know when to call it

118
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,150
quits<font color="#E5E5E5"> because sometimes you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> won't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> manage</font>

119
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,729
to get everything you wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

120
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:36,370
will need to say I've spent enough time

121
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:40,508
on this time to move on<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm wasting too</font>

122
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:42,879
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> time here and then you want to find</font>

123
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:43,210
the goodies<font color="#E5E5E5"> that might not mean much to</font>

124
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,300
you

125
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,680
so what is that what is the client do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

show impact you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to show business</font>

that you're not reaching the<font color="#E5E5E5"> c-suite</font>

00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:21,310
what does an attacker<font color="#E5E5E5"> one if you're an</font>

141
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,378
<font color="#CCCCCC">attack or what are you going to go for</font>

142
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,969
an attacker might not be interested in

143
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:27,400
domain admin if they can get all the

144
00:05:24,969 --> 00:05:29,650
information they need from a server from

145
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,049
a file share or if they can get it all

146
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:33,758
from a user's workstation<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't need</font>

147
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:37,960
domain admin every time and that's not

148
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,520
goal of every pen test and then you need

149
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,169
to ask what is the client worried about

150
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,940
you can ask them when you're

151
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:44,409
face-to-face with them what are you

152
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,120
worried about<font color="#CCCCCC"> have you been breached</font>

153
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:48,610
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they've been breached before</font>

154
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">go after that because they're concerned</font>

155
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:53,680
about that and that's going to show that

156
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:55,120
you are helping improve their security

157
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,919
posture you're showing them that you can

158
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,110
breach the data that they care about and

159
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:01,870
that's a very important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a lot</font>

160
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:06,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">of pen testers or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> prospective pen</font>

161
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:09,339

162
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:11,500
talk about a little bit what not to do

163
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:13,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">you don't want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get cocky</font>

00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:19,000
you don't want to get caught that last

167
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:21,370
one is kind of optional depending on the

168
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,360
style of the engagement<font color="#E5E5E5"> but for the most</font>

169
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:26,260
part you don't want to get caught<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

170
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,110
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

171
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:31,120
don't get cocky<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that everybody</font>

172
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,010
needs to understand is that pen testers

173
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,440
are not there to look cool

174
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:37,270
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's awesome when you say hey I got</font>

175

<font color="#E5E5E5">but the client doesn't care about that</font>

178
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:47,200
the client doesn't think it's cool when

179
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,070
you manage to get domain admin<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

183
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,880
you need to realize that it's not all

184
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,940
fun and games

185
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,130
yes it is cool yes it is fun to do this

186
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:02,770

break things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that seems kind of</font>

191
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:18,010
contradictory because as a pen tester

192
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,330
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do is break things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and even need</font>

to make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're breaking them in</font>

195
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,580
crashing production systems is bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

196
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,440
you try and run a hash<font color="#CCCCCC"> dumped on a</font>

205
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:51,760
production systems also don't alter data

00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:54,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">you do not want to drop all the tables</font>

saying but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted to emphasize that</font>

00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:10,990
because that is not a good thing to do

213
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:12,700
and don't change settings because maybe

214
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,590
they are relying on a certain setting

215
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,360
being the way it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you don't know</font>

221
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,280
you're doing is not going to impact

is a strong password

to test their security team for this

506

particular engagement we had to create a

00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:35,100
create a third domain admin on their

network for them to finally detect it

518
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:40,110
and we were sitting in their IT security

this who did this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and eventually we saw</font>

00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:51,120
them you know exchanging emails and then

524
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:53,159
we heard knock on the door<font color="#E5E5E5"> the little</font>

room we were sitting in and there were

looking very confused and very scared

because they didn't know that we were

there<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a pen test so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sometimes testing</font>

533
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:17,640
important because you want to know how

00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:20,100
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization is going to respond if</font>

535
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,539
you're a real attacker and as pen

536
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:24,029
testers sometimes we need to up the

537
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:26,220
noise level because it can be unfair to

538

those blue team guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know they have</font>

got a very very hard job

00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:33,299
I'm under no illusions<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that effect</font>

they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a harder job testers we have</font>

00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:39,360
it really easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> its we're always going to</font>

543
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:41,460
find a way in the defenders have to be

right every single time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just have to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">attacker dominance is a very real thing</font>

547
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:49,970
and it's very important to realize that

548
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:52,340

<font color="#CCCCCC">there were cops waiting for us when we</font>

00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:34,129
domain admin is always the thing you

693
00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:36,259
strive for it in an engagement because

694
00:27:34,129 --> 00:27:38,178
it will give you the keys to the kingdom

695
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:40,490
that's not always the only goal you can

you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then the last lesson</font>

708
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:11,800
learned was to always bring boots<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

712
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,910
you have to walk a mile and a half

713
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,340
through the snow and sleep under<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fence</font>

and it's cold

excuse me as measurable always bring

way too fast<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have time for</font>

720
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,340
questions plenty of time for questions

help people understand what it's like

what my experiences are<font color="#E5E5E5"> how I got here</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">feel free to ask anything that you would</font>

727
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:07,060
the question was have I seen any

728
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:09,850
instance of using a<font color="#E5E5E5"> vapor</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a device to</font>

731
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:16,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">youtube videos of it but otherwise I</font>

732
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:22,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">have not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen that</font>

733
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:24,190
yep

734
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,170
so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what did i do before</font>

735
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:28,330
becoming a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pen tester</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I had an</font>

736
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:29,830
internship on a pen test team<font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font>

737
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:30,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was an unemployed college</font>

738
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:34,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">students</font>

739
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:37,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">I got lucky it's very very hard to break</font>

740
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:40,090
into the industry<font color="#CCCCCC"> i got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lucky and I'm</font>

741
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:42,610
under no illusions there<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's very</font>

742
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:46,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult to break in but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope to help</font>

743
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:54,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> break-in by giving them this bit</font>

744
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:56,080
of information<font color="#CCCCCC"> and yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

745
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:57,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> consider my speed skates and so</font>

746
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">boots</font>

747
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,139
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> I haven't because that would ruin the</font>

748
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:01,730
blades<font color="#E5E5E5"> walking through</font>

749
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:08,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the dirt and grass and rocks and stuff</font>

750
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:12,140
like that oh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> one more time</font>

751
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:13,880
so are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> charges eventually dropped if</font>

752
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,650
you get arrested<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have not experienced</font>

753
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,030
getting arrested yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would hope so I</font>

754
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:19,070
would hope that the get-out-of-jail-free

755
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:21,500
card that we got from the client saying

756
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:23,659
we have permission to do this would help

757
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:29,390
with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have not had the</font>

758
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:43,130
opportunity to test that out myself yet

759
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:45,560
any other questions yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the question</font>

760
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:48,110
was when you're finally presenting your

761
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,399
report your findings what does that look

762
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:52,669
like

763
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:55,640
usually it'll be a report<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a you</font>

764
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:57,680
know a few dozen pages sometimes we do

765
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,600
not use vulnerability scanners on our

766
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">penta so we don't give you a list of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 500</font>

767
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:05,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">different vulnerabilities what we do is</font>

768
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:07,490
we show you how we brought<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we broke</font>

769
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,640
in our attack path<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the methods we</font>

770
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:12,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">used to get the information we got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

771
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:16,340
present that in sort of an easily

772
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:18,260
digestible<font color="#E5E5E5"> an easily digestible package</font>

773
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we've spent a lot of time trying to</font>

774
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:22,250
get that to be as effective as possible

775
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:30,170
without being boring to read

776
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:32,180
yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> have we found ourselves in a spot</font>

777
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:36,470
where we've had to roll our own tools

778
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:39,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">arm we have a we were not very</font>

779
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:42,230
successful unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> but again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

780
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:45,200
still fairly new to this so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't have</font>

781
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:47,180
all the tooling<font color="#E5E5E5"> background that would be</font>

782
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,850
important for that stuff

783
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:51,680
there will be times but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've not come</font>

784
00:31:49,850 --> 00:32:00,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">across any and been successful with that</font>

785
00:31:51,680 --> 00:32:02,120
yet

786
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:04,760
question was how big is my team and how

787
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:07,159
many people go on an engagement<font color="#CCCCCC"> my team</font>

791
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:18,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">three testers at a time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it can be</font>

792
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:21,860
anywhere from<font color="#CCCCCC"> three all of us to one of</font>

822
00:33:49,610 --> 00:34:02,110

00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:11,550
want any one of our boxes to get burned

845

we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to implement things for</font>

ourselves were upping our tradecraft<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

864
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,910
be doing that because you always have to

keep up with the pace of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Technology you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's not required because you</font>

868
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:14,790
will come across an environment where

869
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:17,160
that is required and you will have to up

your game<font color="#E5E5E5"> in order to get the results</font>

yep

873
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:30,210
how do we deal with the fallout of

possibly breaking production politely

to admit your mistakes you have to make

887
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:03,090
sure that language is written into your
