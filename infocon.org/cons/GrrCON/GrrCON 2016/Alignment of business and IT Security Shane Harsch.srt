about the RSA<font color="#E5E5E5"> breach in 2011 one of the</font>

176
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:17,739

about the threats that are likely to hit

look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can actually develop some</font>

pretty straightforward responses to them

202
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:29,290
but you have to prioritize this is

203
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:32,140
probably what's giving you the most

injections and all that wonderful stuff

00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,000
that's great

218
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,930
meanwhile your business leaders are

00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:04,089
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> how bad is it</font>

you're going to find a leadership

228

<font color="#CCCCCC">piece because we already know that the</font>

565

566
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:32,070
going to deploy our content packs and

what we understand to be the most common

ways to detect these types of threats

569
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,780
and then we're going to start conducting

what's happening in the environment so

668
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:01,419
building a team of your peers who

00:31:09,999 --> 00:31:15,159
what's driving the business and you have

00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:19,029
to help them understand why this is

so how<font color="#E5E5E5"> do we come up with a plan</font>

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,559
together to make sure that our plans

never<font color="#CCCCCC"> get shut down</font>

681
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:36,428
you then have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to develop a vision and</font>

consolidating gains to produce more

these approaches in your culture<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

stuff and it gets it gets old because

762
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:09,160
they just want to do their job they

763

we haven't put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in the right place so</font>

887
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:16,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">we think about the five stages of</font>

we can take to engage on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this</font>

892
00:41:24,029 --> 00:41:27,450
is where we can start to build that

895
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:38,910
detection and response is on these two

896
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:40,109
pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when you think about it right</font>

897
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:42,538
there

898
00:41:40,109 --> 00:41:46,049
there are seven elements that you need

00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:47,549
to focus on<font color="#CCCCCC"> an absent all the other work</font>

903
00:41:51,779 --> 00:41:55,709
you're addressing these seven points and

904
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,779
that will begin to help shape your idea

905
