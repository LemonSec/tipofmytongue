did before the program what they did

55
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,690
how we do those same things today and

try

57
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,050
learn from the things that they didn't

00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,799
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> and maybe learn from the things that</font>

59
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:17,270
they did do well as well to start out

60
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,220
let's do a little background so the

61
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,210
shuttle program itself<font color="#CCCCCC"> shuttle program</font>

62
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,590
is officially known as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the space</font>

63
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:24,950
transportation system

64
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:28,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm it was a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> US government man launch</font>

space program<font color="#E5E5E5"> it flew from 1980 12 2011</font>

66
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it was designed to be reusable so</font>

67
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:36,740
very much like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> spaces SpaceX rocket</font>

68
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:38,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we see today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on this was a reusable</font>

69
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,640
platform and that's really important

70
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:42,890
because once you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> reusability in a</font>

71
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,290
technology like a space technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

now have economies of scale where you

73
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,329
can leverage it and do things like take

people into space<font color="#CCCCCC"> consumerism</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

87
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:27,560
happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it took the money they took</font>

88
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,900
the money and of course they had to cut

89
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,750
corners right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so they weren't going to</font>

90
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:34,940
not take the money<font color="#E5E5E5"> but very obviously</font>

91
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,500
they were underfunded<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if you can</font>

92
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,870
consider they<font color="#CCCCCC"> padded their budget</font>

93
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">somewhat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is still a significant</font>

94
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,800
difference between what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked for</font>

95
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:45,890
and what they got<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's going to</font>

96
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,170
cause some design constraints and cause

97
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:50,059
them to rethink everything they did<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

98
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:52,458
that's the first part of what we see in

99
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,870
a modern parallel<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we say hey we</font>

100
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:56,209
need this technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> or we need this</font>

101
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:58,190
capability and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask management for</font>

102
00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:00,410
budget we<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask for money we don't quite</font>

103
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,970
get as much as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked for</font>

104
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,350
so we have to tailor that<font color="#E5E5E5"> request and</font>

105
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,640
figure out what can we do with what they

106
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:06,350
gave us<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nobody's not gonna take</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the money</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

108
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:11,660
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the money to do something with it</font>

109
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:14,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">um so let's go back in time for me but</font>

110
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:16,668
then during the Apollo missions<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

111
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:18,780
committed 24 billion dollars to

112
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:21,510
basically putting a man on the moon

113
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:23,460
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> 400,000 people employed and it</font>

114
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:25,590
was supported by<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20,000 dustrial firms</font>

115
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:29,909
and universities<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a massive</font>

116
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:31,979
undertaking for us to realize a dream

117
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,770
right

118
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,900
basically the mercury capsule could only

119
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,460
support one person<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's a really</font>

120
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,469
significant thing because when you only

121
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,729
can send one person<font color="#E5E5E5"> space that person</font>

122
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,680
has to be everything they have to be the

123
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,960
pilot they have to be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> scientist they</font>

124
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,400
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be logistics they have to be</font>

125
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,560
everything that you can possibly think

126
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,090
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a space mission project Apollo</font>

127
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,740
came along and now we can put three

128
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,179
people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a capsule</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's really</font>

129
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,490
significant now that we can have three

130
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,600
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can do a lot more especially</font>

131
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,000
with regards to<font color="#CCCCCC"> science and</font>

132

<font color="#CCCCCC">experimentation the weekend with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

133
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,390
the big focus is we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to put</font>

134
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,890
three people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a capsule and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> john</font>

00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:09,270
the moon by 1969<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're gonna get</font>

137
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,510
there before the Russians<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was the</font>

138
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:14,130
big thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in February 67 they have</font>

139
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,780
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apollo one disaster as I said</font>

142
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">years later we have the first manned</font>

145
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,510
after that we have the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> man moon</font>

146
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:32,940
landing<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is really significant</font>

147
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:35,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">and this plays into how we're managing</font>

148
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:37,440
risk because when we look at the

149
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,479
successes of the past or the pressures

150
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,650
that put us from there to there in such

151
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:42,599
a short time frame

152
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:44,280
what's the expectation for the future

153
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,110
certainly the expectation by management

154
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,130
is we're going to keep performing that

155
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,240
way or better

156
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,100
anybody ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard the phrase do more</font>

157
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,630
with less that's what this is all about

158
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">do more with less</font>

159
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,810
we've seen you do in the past why can't

160
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:57,659
you do in the future<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,430

first shuttle landing in school and it

171
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:26,400
was amazing thing seeing the spacecraft

172
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,529

we've seen that 24 other times<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

181
00:06:42,049 --> 00:06:47,179
there's a lot of pressure on<font color="#CCCCCC"> NASA to not</font>

182
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:48,799
just succeed but to do well and to kind

183
00:06:47,179 --> 00:06:50,419
of perform like trained monkeys for the

184

185
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:53,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">started questioning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how much money</font>

186
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:55,188
you're spending on this program<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

187

<font color="#E5E5E5">have better better successes what's</font>

00:06:55,189 --> 00:07:01,369
going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 25 was very very</font>

189
00:06:58,429 --> 00:07:04,099
special and so this is what gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> NASA</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

190
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:05,719
the sort of impetus to do really well

191
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:08,599
and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was because of this person right</font>

192
00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:10,429
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who this is this is</font>

194
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:15,409
very significant history<font color="#E5E5E5"> because she was</font>

195
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:17,149
to be the first civilian in space

00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:18,349
she was part of a program that was

197

actually called the first teacher in

space

199
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:23,688
she beat out about 11,000 other

applicants to go train like an astronaut

201

00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,119
rounds and all the talk shows when we

00:07:45,619 --> 00:07:48,589
only had three channels<font color="#E5E5E5"> right she went</font>

213
00:07:47,119 --> 00:07:51,679
to all three major talk shows and that

214
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:53,269
was a big deal . all three right<font color="#CCCCCC"> and she</font>

00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:55,669
she<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked to folks and just she was</font>

00:08:00,049 --> 00:08:05,179
civilian space<font color="#E5E5E5"> very very big deal so</font>

220
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,889
let's talk about now what actually

221
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:08,808
<font color="#CCCCCC">happened to give you the kind of</font>

222

background<font color="#E5E5E5"> hindsight in the</font>

00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:11,809
investigation and<font color="#CCCCCC"> number to go forward</font>

224
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:14,419
and show you the steps that led up to it

225
00:08:11,809 --> 00:08:15,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">so effectively in the in the shuttle</font>

226
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:18,079
system and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't talk really loud and</font>

227
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:19,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to give you a little break there</font>

228
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the shuttle system</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got a</font>

229
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:23,119
solid rocket booster which is this one

230
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:24,949
right here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in that booster you have</font>

231
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:26,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">o-rings these are these are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> orings right</font>

232
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:28,699
here those rings are about 35 feet in

233
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:31,039
circumference and it's made of rubber

234
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:33,649
and the point of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> o-ring is to create</font>

235
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:37,519
a seal<font color="#CCCCCC"> so when you are experiencing</font>

236
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:39,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">pressures pressure changes or flexing or</font>

237
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,539
things like that that rubber seal can

238
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,029
fill any<font color="#E5E5E5"> gaps</font>

239
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:45,639
that would happen during that flex well

240
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:47,259
the the problem is rubber has particular

241
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:50,259
qualities of which<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

242
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:51,399
sure and that morning which is

<font color="#E5E5E5">spaceflight morning</font>

248
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:04,899
we have icicles hanging off of<font color="#E5E5E5"> off of</font>

the rigging<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was a year that the</font>

orange crops were decimated by<font color="#CCCCCC"> by a</font>

winter so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a very harsh and severe</font>

winter<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is very very significant</font>

253
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:17,290
when the shuttle takes off<font color="#CCCCCC"> those solid</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> o-rings which is designed to snap</font>

258
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:27,699
back in milliseconds and fill those gaps

00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,740
are simply not doing their job<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

260
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:32,019
you can see right there<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where it</font>

261
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,130
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the rest is after the</font>

262
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:35,740
explosion happened

263
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:36,639
so the big<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is why didn't</font>

264
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,079
anybody think of this

265
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:42,040
why didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> they anticipate the scenario</font>

266
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:44,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">what I think the answer is that is the</font>

267
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:47,500
answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> answers they did they knew they</font>

268
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:50,139

him into doing it and it's a good thing

364
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,790
she did because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's really the reason</font>

365
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:12,730
that we know what happened today<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

has nothing to do with physics<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:55,930
doing his own thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the investigation</font>

387
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:57,850
so in $YEAR he also<font color="#E5E5E5"> when he goes around</font>

388
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:59,739
and does this he makes the first of

00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:02,770
several critical<font color="#E5E5E5"> discoveries</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the very</font>

390
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:06,370
first thing he found was very very poor

so much the engineers he's going he's

00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:17,440
talking to the engineers and he's

396
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,390
figuring things out from them in fact

397
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,690
one of the things he figures out is they

398

we don't launch

how could that be evenly divided again

00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:57,480
getting a completely different stories

correct

he's like are you crazy every engineer

knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> your system is going to fail</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

709
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:54,179
just a question of putting the right

00:24:52,499 --> 00:24:56,279
parameters around it to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> was going to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">fail again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I pull you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into a modern</font>

for it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you plan contingency you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> play</font>

things<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting that message across is</font>

719
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:13,109
very important especially when things

720
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:15,239
like this happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we start to hear</font>

721
00:25:13,109 --> 00:25:17,279
numbers like how about vendor promises

something that you couldn't deliver

<font color="#E5E5E5">right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's them writing a check that</font>

726
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:27,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">same things are happening remember this</font>

00:25:25,739 --> 00:25:28,950
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 years ago so we're experiencing</font>

728

the same kinds of failures today

729

<font color="#E5E5E5">communication communication</font>

730
00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:34,350
communication can't say<font color="#E5E5E5"> it enough</font>

731
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:35,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> set the actual findings</font>

732
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:37,350
what did they find

733
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,119
obviously they find communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

734
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:42,389
very poor<font color="#CCCCCC"> the managers had no idea what</font>

735
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:44,999
was going on in either the contractor or

736
00:25:42,389 --> 00:25:47,070
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> NASA and what he also finds is the</font>

737
00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:49,169
layers between the management all have

738
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:50,730
problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> so messages that are starting</font>

739
00:25:49,169 --> 00:25:52,049
at the bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time they get to</font>

740
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:54,359
the top it's like that game of telephone

741
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:55,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">where I whisper in your ear us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bring</font>

742
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:56,908
yours and yours and yours and goes all

743
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,899
the way around<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the time it gets</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

744
00:25:56,909 --> 00:25:58,830
the last person the message is

745
00:25:57,899 --> 00:26:00,189
completely different

746
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:01,899
that's exactly what's happening

747
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:04,269
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's not so much that there was</font>

748
00:26:01,899 --> 00:26:05,830
a bureaucracy problem because the

749
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:07,720
bureaucracy was rather thin<font color="#CCCCCC"> in some</font>

750
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:10,029
spots<font color="#CCCCCC"> but there was definitely a</font>

751
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:12,850
communication issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> people were not</font>

752

hearing or they were not speaking for

00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:17,469
both right

754
00:26:14,769 --> 00:26:18,820
we also have this issue where NASA

755
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:21,340
didn't accept the judgment of his own

756
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:22,658
engineers<font color="#CCCCCC"> NASA</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> engineers agreed with the</font>

757
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,709
contractors and said yeah we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

758
00:26:22,659 --> 00:26:25,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're right we think that the</font>

759
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:28,149
tolerance is actually 53 degrees if we

760
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:29,620
fly the low 53 degrees that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's gonna</font>

761
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:32,709
be a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> and asset management said</font>

762
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">well prove it prove it to me the night</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">before</font>

keep in mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you fight</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do you do</font>

766
00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:46,750
um right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the other thing that we have</font>

767
00:26:43,179 --> 00:26:48,730
is we have this weird thing called faith

768
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:51,340
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Machine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is very much a</font>

00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:52,659
management<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of philosophy now keep</font>

770
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:56,019
in mind<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was a manager</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sea so</font>

what do they believe about security<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

773
00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:02,590
there's a big red button that says

secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we touch it and everything's</font>

775
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:05,649
fine

776
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:07,629
they inherently<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust technology to</font>

777
00:27:05,649 --> 00:27:10,059
protect us without<font color="#CCCCCC"> realizing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've</font>

had faith in their technology because

00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:18,850
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> had this string of success that led</font>

up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what eventually was the failure so</font>

783
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:22,240
they didn't believe the people when the

people were going there's gonna be

785
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,899
problems because the machines were

we have to look at these problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font>

them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the same light and say we</font>

00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:54,168
you can have that extra pair of eyes

972
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:56,000
that can look at things just a little

973

bit differently<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might make</font>

discoveries that you are completely

what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is significant</font>

thing to try to make this happen

00:34:03,769 --> 00:34:11,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is actually easier than you think</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Mac was being funny</font>

980
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:14,719
so another finding was they said

00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:16,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">establish</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an advisory panel with</font>

and<font color="#CCCCCC"> organizations effectively we call</font>

board or an architectural review board

00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,440
these are all words for the same thing

988
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:29,388
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's this recommendation where we have</font>

the inputs from all the business people

making these decisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this is a</font>

really really good thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you don't</font>

have this today<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should start it this</font>

1001
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:55,460
is the cheapest thing you can do

1002
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:56,899
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just getting people together to</font>

1003
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,579
talk about stuff that's in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the in the</font>

1004
00:34:56,899 --> 00:35:00,049
pipeline and say how do we deal with

1005
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:01,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">this in the pipeline specifically with</font>

1006
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:03,950
regards to projects right if you don't

1007
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,329
have a steering committee for<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

projects that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are happening in your</font>

1009
00:35:05,329 --> 00:35:09,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">organization</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> put them together</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

1010
00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:10,490
together a review board and say let's

1011
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:11,540
look at the status of this project right

1012
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:13,040
now let's look at all the things that

1013
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:15,109
have gone wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that are</font>

1014
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,930
going right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and decide together how we</font>

1015
00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:19,369
can make it do better<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

1016
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:20,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the cheapest thing you can do and</font>

1017
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:22,640
it's the best use of people's time and

1018
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,440
then people feel included<font color="#CCCCCC"> two which is</font>

1019
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty amazing especially security we</font>

1020
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,010
tend to operate somewhat you know in the

1021
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:30,529
dark<font color="#E5E5E5"> and people think that what we do is</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Magic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right and they're afraid of it</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">budu</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but expose it open it turn the</font>

is problem management for lack of a

00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:44,779
better word<font color="#CCCCCC"> but that's what we need to</font>

1029
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:47,630
do we need to look at root cause

1030
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:49,700
analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have this they would</font>

have not flown the other missions

00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,210
because they would have seen that they

1036
00:35:55,349 --> 00:36:03,089
significant way to look at the forward

1037

schedule changes that you have and see

1038

how current issues are going to impact

those right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so have some kind of problem</font>

standpoint instead of a technology

1050
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:28,410
basically they're saying shake the tree

00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:29,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">kick people out making do other things I</font>

don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have the power to do</font>

1053
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:35,910
that but it's okay if if you if you can

1054
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:37,710
do this right if you can get people to

1055

it really really hard to take that away

1073
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:14,339
think of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we have a constitution of</font>

also very very difficult to resend a

1081
00:37:25,589 --> 00:37:30,480
be because those are hard and fast rules

1082

that we all have to play by<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now I</font>

1085
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:35,880
different thing to talk about the actual

1087
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,690
make sure you have some kind of policy

1088
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:41,760
which basically says when we have

1195
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:13,720
is really really an important part of

that are completely out of your control
