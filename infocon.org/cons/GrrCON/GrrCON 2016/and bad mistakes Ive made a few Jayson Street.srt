<font color="#E5E5E5">was awesome</font>

28
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,050
it's like it talked about me breaking

29
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:38,690
into like three different places and you

30
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:41,480
have to see video and and I did it

31
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:43,010
because a lot of people doubt<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font>

32
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,260
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of self-doubt so it's like I've</font>

33
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:48,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">whenever people doubted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like even come</font>

34
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,970
that compounds and stuff on me of

35
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:51,980
exactly how successful<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

36
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,510
when you do demos<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and these</font>

37
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,709
talks<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's like people see those and</font>

38
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,329
they understand that when you say that

39
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:58,610
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 'why broken this network with this</font>

40
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:01,489
technique<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's known and you can like</font>

41
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:03,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">prove that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah I just</font>

42
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:05,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">walked into a bank with the leather</font>

43
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,890
jacket and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thundercat tissues and broke</font>

44
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:09,200
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> him in under two minutes and a half</font>

45
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:11,450
and compromise the whole network

46
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,220
how do you prove that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're full of</font>

47
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,839
crap<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean your social engineer</font>

48
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,130
so you're basically lying for living so

49
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,620
it's like you know how do you believe

50
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:21,049
that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk and it was all</font>

51
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,670
about how awesome I was on doing these

52
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,650
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> breaking these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things and it</font>

53
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,268
was not supposed to be about that it was

54
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:29,870
about how to protect yourself from those

55
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:31,310
things but it came off like that and it

56
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,070
got me thinking there are several issues

57
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:36,830
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> occurred and one of them was the</font>

58
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:38,750
fact that it's like that was just like

59
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:41,269
we see a lot of these talks<font color="#CCCCCC"> to everybody</font>

60
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:43,100
talking about how great everything works

61
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:44,570
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and their demos run perfectly and</font>

62
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,920
smoothly especially when the video it's

63
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:48,799
amazing how that happens you know

64
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,869
there's no flaws in the video<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not</font>

65
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,270
you don't see the you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5,000 takes</font>

66
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:55,040
before that but you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5001 was</font>

67
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:57,650
amazing let's use it

68
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,489
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was like we need to talk more</font>

69
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:03,799

583
00:23:56,010 --> 00:24:01,860
in the face and<font color="#CCCCCC"> but was that enough know</font>

584
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:05,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we're on a conference call with this</font>

585
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:10,350
guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and with the his manager and his</font>

586
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:12,960
managers boss<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what do we do we used</font>

587
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:14,820
his password in the conversation<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

588
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,190
he used the same kind of the same

589
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:19,620
password key<font color="#E5E5E5"> phrase part of it wasn't</font>

590
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:21,450
password so that's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

591
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:25,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">but then he added numbers at the end of</font>

592
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:27,030
it and so we use that word and it wasn't

593
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,450
a common<font color="#E5E5E5"> word so we have to be creative</font>

594
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:34,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">but we use that model as many times as</font>

595
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:36,690
we possibly could just so he would know

596

how<font color="#CCCCCC"> pwned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he was during that</font>

597
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:45,360
conversation and he became better at

00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:47,370
security for<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learned his lesson</font>

599
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,350
