of the security team that was also<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big</font>

134
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,890
thing that we found no one knew how to

process raise your hands

158

have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody that we know that their</font>

179
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,969
answer to everything is just either

180
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:36,349
patch it or get it off my network<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

181
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:38,570
is no<font color="#CCCCCC"> in-between</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is no risk</font>

182
00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:43,760
process no acceptance or anything like

183
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:45,469
that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a home users approach so</font>

184
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,780
home user when when they decide you know

185
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,699
what are we<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna patch they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">call every time is going to come back to</font>

187
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:53,930
patch everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> pache all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things we</font>

188
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:55,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">continue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no just but there's a patch out</font>

189
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:57,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">there put it out there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but as you</font>

probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't run into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not</font>

191
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:01,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">something you can do because it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

192
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">to break something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if it breaks</font>

one issue you fix that one issue you

195
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:08,570
move on with your life if you break a

196
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:12,790
thousand machines<font color="#E5E5E5"> and an enterprise</font>

environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not a good thing</font>

198
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:22,720
so does anybody know what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> images</font>

199
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:25,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't either i think its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ass</font>

200
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,010
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I pulled it off the internet but</font>

201
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:29,170
that's my point is if you don't know

202
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:30,070
what is on your network<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> protect</font>

203
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,690
it

204
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,220
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run into things like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a sand</font>

205
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:35,679
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has firmware that you didn't you</font>

206
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:37,600
didn't know is five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of date</font>

207
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,640
it's going to have a vulnerability in<font color="#CCCCCC"> SL</font>

208
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">or something you know you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

209
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,580
run into those issues and if you don't

210
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:43,599
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's on your network</font>

211
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,240
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be able to protect</font>

212
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:53,020
it which also causes you to end up with

213
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:53,890
you can't patch all the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what</font>

214
00:08:53,020 --> 00:09:00,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">can you do</font>

215
00:08:53,890 --> 00:09:03,280
document everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna run</font>

216
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,890
into your OS<font color="#CCCCCC"> visit yelling linux</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> windows</font>

217
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">Apple you can patch a lot of the OS</font>

218
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:09,640
stuff pretty easily

219
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,959
the main OS vendors have gotten to the

220
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,600
point where they don't break too much

221
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:17,530
stuff honestly<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you go to patch</font>

222
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,330
java or flash<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of times</font>

223
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:21,040
any of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle frameworks are going</font>

224
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:22,600
to cause issues with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your applications</font>

225
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're gonna cause issues</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

226
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,930
compatibility in your environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

227
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run into problems like that</font>

228
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:29,859
you need to know where those problems

229
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,900
are because if you don't know whether

230
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:36,820
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't tell your management how</font>

231
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:39,970
to fix them so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the takeaway for patching</font>

232
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:42,400
is basically this is table stakes<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

233
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:44,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody should be doing patching but</font>

234
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,730
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end all be all</font>

235
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,800
so you can turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> on if you can turn on</font>

236
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,850
automatic updates that's great<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

237
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,439
can't you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to have to have some</font>

238
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:52,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">sort of process you go through to go to</font>

239
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,250
get to the point where you can patch

240
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,590
what you can

241
00:09:54,250 --> 00:10:01,330
there are other steps those anybody play

242
00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:05,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">D&D so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system hardening is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of like</font>

leather armor<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't do much but</font>

244
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,280
it's better than flapping in the breeze

245
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:11,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">so you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get a little bit of</font>

also on one thing that we've started to

<font color="#E5E5E5">byte code review one thing that I've had</font>

327
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,360
a gotcha moment on this is that a lot of

00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:59,209
places use<font color="#CCCCCC"> cuts off for commercial</font>

00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,449
you could use that

oh yeah you guys can scan it if you find

anything let us know do you realize how

350

much<font color="#CCCCCC"> it costs you know we would be</font>

something you can say at that point yes

355

we do security testing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to pay</font>

of this is your web crawlers<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ones</font>

it's not necessarily the best but it's

377
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:42,110
definitely something you should be doing

378
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:43,520
at least like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a as a minimum bar it's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">usually not quite as expensive either</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll get to that in a second</font>

out<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I asked which is supposed to be</font>

think that's still an emerging space but

394
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:16,730
other people may have different ideas

395
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:20,120
the one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can't test with</font>

396
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:22,370
an automated scanner those logic<font color="#CCCCCC"> so from</font>

00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:31,130
application and they can actually write

403
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:37,399
that's a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's not going to</font>

405
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:40,520
something that you should be doing in

406
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:42,500
your application from a protection

407
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,689
perspective to evaluate all those

408
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,920
different ways that the logic flow works

409
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:50,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">and make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have those checks</font>

410
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:53,270
and balances<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what's the one thing</font>

411
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:55,040
that most people overlook<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> blue team</font>

don't really come up with and think that

454
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:36,649
reviews but also i have this application

455
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,870
that does this for my business<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

00:17:36,649 --> 00:17:40,610
critical and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> left somebody in there</font>

457
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:43,129
that does this particular function and

458
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:44,779
they stole a bunch of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a good</font>

459
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:46,760
thing

460
00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:47,600
HR should be the key to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> though they</font>

461
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,429
should be telling you when someone

462
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:53,779
changes jobs or leave the company

463
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:57,740
alright so we were going to do a bunch

464
00:17:53,779 --> 00:18:02,270
of demos<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I think we're almost out of</font>

465
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:06,710
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're not going to do a live</font>

466
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:12,110
demo<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we will do a video</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> demo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

467
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:15,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">get it to work</font>

468
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:18,918
they're real it's a little bit difficult

469
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:21,408
to see but basically what this is is

470
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:23,389
we've got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows 7 machine that's got</font>

471
00:18:21,409 --> 00:18:24,980
an open<font color="#E5E5E5"> ftp server on it</font>

472
00:18:23,389 --> 00:18:27,049
this is part of the heart<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the system</font>

473
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:31,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">hardening demo that we are going to show</font>

474
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:33,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's jeff walkthrough on this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

475
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,929
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> did an nmap to that machine to</font>

476
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,520
discover that that port was open<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

477
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:43,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see this is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> real difficult to see</font>

478
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:51,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">Jeff can get them matter on</font>

479
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:52,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> came</font>

480

482
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:01,510
have ftp open on that particular machine

483
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">so if you part of the system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hardening</font>

484
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:05,650
if you don't turn off services that are

485
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,510
out there or if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're testing things</font>

486
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:08,919
and you're like oh I don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

487
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">heart in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a test</font>

machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have those</font>

489
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:15,158
issues where<font color="#CCCCCC"> someone is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be able</font>

490
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,480
to connect to that ftp account and see

491
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:19,240
what's out on that that particular

492
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:34,600
directory<font color="#CCCCCC"> so in this case just one</font>

493
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:40,240
connecting to it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a while so he's</font>

00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:42,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">connecting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> his guests so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone was</font>

using this to transfer data from one via

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">one computer to another</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they may put</font>

497
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:49,809
something out there like<font color="#CCCCCC"> employee salary</font>

498

data or some other malicious<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,740
whatever if they need to transfer<font color="#E5E5E5"> users</font>

502
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:01,840
are like water going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the least common</font>

503
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:04,390
or the least resistance way to get

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,220
something done<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they leave salary data</font>

505

out there on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> ftp server that's not a</font>

506
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:19,240
good thing either

507
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:20,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as our videos</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the biggest</font>

508
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:25,210
thing is what can you do to fix this

509
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:26,740
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> documented test that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plant</font>

512
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,679
that you test it quarterly<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that</font>

513
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:36,760
everyone knows what to do with the roles

and responsibilities are<font color="#CCCCCC"> patching</font>

come up like i mentioned password is

558
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:44,010
going to be one of the issues where the

word password<font color="#CCCCCC"> for PWD or anything like</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you said it is going to depend on</font>

567
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,470
multiple factors as far as a finding

data anyway

574
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:14,040
it really depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on kind of tweaking</font>

the application<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean the applications</font>

themselves are good but they're not

577
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:22,710
going to be something that you can just

578
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:37,059
set<font color="#E5E5E5"> forget either</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anywhere else</font>

579
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:38,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah so</font>

580
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:40,509
question was do we do anything with the

581
00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:42,970
identity access management and the

582
00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:48,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">access reviews we do actually we just</font>

583
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:50,379
put in a tool sale .<font color="#E5E5E5"> as part of our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IM</font>

584
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:52,120
program<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> originally was just part of</font>

585
00:23:50,379 --> 00:23:53,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">the process and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> procedures so we would</font>

586
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a request come in we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had the person</font>

587
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:58,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">to a group or to an actual somewhere and</font>

588
00:23:56,139 --> 00:24:00,399
then comes back and says<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

589
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">take this back if we need to know is all</font>

590
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:03,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">a manual process now we're getting to</font>

591
00:24:02,139 --> 00:24:05,469
the point where we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> rules</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> defined</font>

592
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:07,210
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone can request</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a roll it gets</font>

593
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:13,659
approved<font color="#CCCCCC"> it gets added it's easy enough</font>

594
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:16,179
to take all that excess away as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> ya</font>

595
00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:18,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">know it it's actually been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worlds better</font>

596
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:19,419
than we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> at before so yeah we we</font>

597
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:27,159
like it so far

598
00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:28,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's that now we use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cell . for that</font>

599
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:30,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">as well for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> privileged identity access</font>

600
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:32,559
management

601
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,149
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was asking what we use for</font>

602
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:43,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">privileged identity management</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:45,428
<font color="#CCCCCC">sail . for that as well you know that</font>

604
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:49,210
actually was done<font color="#E5E5E5"> why the question was</font>

605
00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:51,039
do we look at any other vendors when we

606
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:52,809
brought in<font color="#E5E5E5"> sale .</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i wasn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in</font>

607
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,158
that project<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually happened</font>

608
00:24:52,809 --> 00:24:57,158
during the time where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd left the</font>

609
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,269
company before<font color="#CCCCCC"> i came</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back arms</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

610
00:24:57,159 --> 00:24:59,649
do know that they did their due

611
00:24:58,269 --> 00:25:01,119
diligence as far as looking at other

612
00:24:59,649 --> 00:25:09,219
vendors<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know which ones that</font>

613
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:16,120
were though<font color="#E5E5E5"> right no other questions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

614
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:32,020
good

615
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:34,989
the question was if HR is not able to

616
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:39,070
provide you the data into your<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">programmed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to change to make</font>

618
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,679
the changes to the person's idea is that

619
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:44,890
correct

620
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:46,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so most systems that I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen from</font>

621
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:49,600
an HR perspective can at least do some

622
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:50,800
sort of an export<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CSV txt file</font>

623
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,990
something like that may not be an

624
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:56,080
automated feed necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> ours comes</font>

625
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:57,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">into a CSV so that's what sale .</font>

626
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,879
actually ingest to do any sort of

627
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,840
changes as far as creating<font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas changes</font>

628
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,510
and things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that</font>

629
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know honestly if there is a</font>

630
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:09,850
better way<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing it or if there's a</font>

631
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:18,040
product out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there that would do the the</font>

632
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:24,149
actual communication between the two

633
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:24,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you everybody</font>
