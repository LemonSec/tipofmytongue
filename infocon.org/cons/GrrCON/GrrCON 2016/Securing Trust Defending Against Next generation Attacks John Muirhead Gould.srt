00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:44,429
about today is<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys and certificates are</font>

there any<font color="#CCCCCC"> pki or ssh experts out there</font>

today

<font color="#CCCCCC">okay fair enough then so</font>

33
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:00,549
I found the easiest way to get this talk

34
00:01:57,579 --> 00:02:04,839
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> is by going back to biology</font>

35
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:08,619
class<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll know that we as a species</font>

36
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:11,440
have evolved over thousands of years and

37
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:14,709
one of the things that's contributed to

38
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,569
our success has been our immune system

39
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:24,700
let's dive in and take a closer look

40
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:27,670
inside each of us we have countless

41
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:30,369
numbers of cells within our bodies and

42
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:32,738
<font color="#E5E5E5">each of our cells inside of them have</font>

43
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:37,989
something associated with them called an

44
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:40,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">HLA tag these hla tags are unique to</font>

45
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:44,680
each of us<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody in the room here</font>

46
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:49,090
has a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> hla</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tag</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

47
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:52,209
like fingerprints and these<font color="#CCCCCC"> hla tags</font>

48
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:55,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">help our immune system regulate itself</font>

49
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:57,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">they help our bodies know what belongs</font>

50
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:01,569
and what doesn't

51
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:07,388
it helps us identify what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is friend</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vs</font>

52
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:09,790

00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:12,069
and enters the body<font color="#CCCCCC"> the immune system</font>

54
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:16,060
knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> that should take action against it</font>

55
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:18,069
because it's identified as non-self<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

56
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:22,030
if you think about it for a second<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

57
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:24,940
this makes sense a lot of our friends

58
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:29,590
and loved ones will sometimes go through

59
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:32,260
organ transplants<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one of the hardest</font>

60
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:35,709
parts of that process is getting the

61
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:38,769
body to accept something that is foreign

62
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:41,380
because the body is scanning<font color="#E5E5E5"> that organ</font>

63
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:44,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's been transplanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it sees a</font>

65
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:52,329
response is to reject it as something

66
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:55,090
that doesn't belong

67
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:57,970

similar to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hla tags in our bodies</font>

73
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:19,478

proactively handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> new things coming in</font>

way to get proactive<font color="#E5E5E5"> this takes us back</font>

to the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet security problem</font>

brings us back to the foundational

problem of authentication<font color="#CCCCCC"> who is on the</font>

well<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's go back in time and talk</font>

101
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:54,729
about how this whole internet thing got

102
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:57,610
started

103
00:05:54,729 --> 00:06:00,639
if you look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are two key</font>

00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:02,370
technologies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> established the world</font>

that is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet today</font>

106
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:10,169
one of them is<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns domain name services</font>

107
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:12,179
and the other keys and certificates<font color="#CCCCCC"> both</font>

108

of these are really foundational<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

109
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,410
really important and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to just</font>

110
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,539
be talking about keys and certificates

today but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's an important thing</font>

to consider and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to recognize the</font>

113
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:27,360
important thing to note though is that

114
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:30,150
if either one of these foundational

115
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,750
pieces is not in place in a quality way

116
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:36,599
then everything that builds on them is

117
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:39,990
going to suffer from quality issues as

118
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:42,479

from a layered security perspective and

151
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:23,050
what did<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do I didn't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to</font>

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,690
perform this task but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only one</font>

00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:31,419
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I fired up my laptop and I went to</font>

00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:33,728
<font color="#CCCCCC">Google</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and started of course asking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">okay how do you reset the admin password</font>

00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:40,630

around for that sort of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> but here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

164

had a real and legitimate need to

00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:06,370
actually perform this task<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what did I</font>

166
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:10,420
do

167
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:14,830
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> I ran home i stood</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up on my home</font>

created<font color="#E5E5E5"> an encrypted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Channel and i was</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">close the ticket and so it's really</font>

180
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:56,770
important to understand that unless you

181
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:59,170
can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> decrypt these encrypted</font>

183
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:04,689

00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:08,140
incomplete<font color="#E5E5E5"> blindly trusting the</font>

186
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:13,810
and can use these encrypted channels to

187
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:16,990
bypass the security controls you have

188
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:17,800
and it's happening more often than you

189
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:21,459
think

190
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:24,670
if you don't have a strong foundation

191
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:28,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can't effectively build the layers</font>

192
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:32,839
and your security controls are then week

193
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:35,510
if you can't identify<font color="#E5E5E5"> friend</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vs fo how</font>

level you would expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

197
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,580
important to get a firm handle on the

198
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:49,430
foundational security building blocks

199
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:54,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">keys and certificates being some of the</font>

200
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:56,239
most important ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> so let's talk for a</font>

201
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,980
minute about what these things are

215
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:49,939
let's go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a level deeper and talk</font>

216
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:55,130
about what a digital certificate and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ssh</font>

00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:57,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">key actually is so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not going to read</font>

218
00:11:55,130 --> 00:12:00,470
the entire definition here you can do

219
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:02,360
that but a digital certificate in many

220
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:05,660
ways is very similar to a driver's

221
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:09,350
license<font color="#CCCCCC"> its forgery resistant it's</font>

224
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:17,359
used for all of these different types of

228
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:27,860

and connected into a Wi-Fi network

431
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:04,950
whoever the robber was had to use a key

434
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:12,810
here is instead of changing the locks on

becoming so important from a political

00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,580
perspective as well it's it's really

567
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:30,408
interesting to watch

568
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,970
now are there any guesses into why they

569
00:29:30,409 --> 00:29:36,890
sent this letter

570
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:39,590
yes very good

571
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:41,270
here's why this is

about this

583
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,429

any guesses<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

592
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:49,640
last year we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked the</font>

594
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,600
got it right fifty-eight percent saying

595
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:56,090
that this would actually enable a

596
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,740
man-in-the-middle attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be</font>

597
00:30:56,090 --> 00:31:00,678
highly likely

598
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:03,290
and what's even more interesting is to

599
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:08,059
see how the different browser vendors

600
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:11,840
responded to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the case of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> google</font>

606
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:30,200
so here we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> scenic a certificate</font>

607
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:33,140
authority that had been caught

<font color="#E5E5E5">intercepting traffic and messing around</font>

00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:38,330
clearly no longer trustworthy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

610
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:41,120
found some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our browser vendors are</font>

611
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:43,250
having the very difficult choice of

00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,350
weighing business decisions against

613
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:48,020
security decisions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as you can see</font>

614
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:52,189
we've experienced mixed results

615
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:55,129
so while we were at black hat last year

616
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:57,710
we asked another question what action

617
00:31:55,130 --> 00:32:00,410
did your<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization take after scenic</font>

618
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:02,270
was deemed untrustworthy and

619
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:05,420
unfortunately we could only find

620
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:08,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">twenty-six</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> percent of organizations took</font>

621
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:11,540
any action whatsoever in removing scenic

622
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:15,260
from laptops desktops and mobile devices

623
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:18,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">as many as seventy four percent remained</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm sure everyone's aware of the Apple</font>

633
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:47,120
ultimately put our personal safety at

risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is why encryption has become</font>

how could your personal safety be at

risk

641
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:05,860
well let's go back to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> scenic example</font>

if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're a Chinese</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dissident say and</font>

with that knowledge<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just another</font>
