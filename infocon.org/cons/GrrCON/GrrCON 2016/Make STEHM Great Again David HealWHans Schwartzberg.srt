in these different disciplines

49
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:17,659
because our students<font color="#CCCCCC"> our kids weren't</font>

learning these skills and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we're</font>

weren't able to compete with lower labor

00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:29,540
costs that were<font color="#CCCCCC"> international but a lot</font>

00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:35,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's where they first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used it and they</font>

58
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,769
just said this is what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> . and</font>

59
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,079
then they started to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of spread the</font>

60
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:40,609
word throughout<font color="#E5E5E5"> education it's not just</font>

63
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,548
well then you can see that there's more

64
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,450
and more type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> IT courses but there's</font>

65
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:52,639
also stem courses now<font color="#CCCCCC"> stem doesn't know</font>

66
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:54,500
we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> personally always embraced</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">technology and engineering related</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

69
00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:00,829
there's also the science right you know

a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> technology</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's all applied</font>

00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:03,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">pain so how do we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with this idea</font>

Chris and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're just kind of goofing</font>

read that

120
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:17,190
so we try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with a new acronym</font>

the reason using real tools and commands

260
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:10,090
it's actually pretty actually really

261

amazing if you haven't seen it<font color="#E5E5E5"> highly</font>

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:41,890
not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're using a tool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

271
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:43,719
important part there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a community</font>

272
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:46,600
we need to make sure that these people

who have an interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> really start to do</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">it the right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's kind of obvious</font>

275
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,150
but it's easy for them to do with the

276
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:55,449
wrong way<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then just start to make</font>

the community not look so you know

540
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:46,320
great but there's also like interrupt or

541
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:48,390
cyber<font color="#E5E5E5"> boot camp which might be near you</font>

542
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,520
you should look into those<font color="#CCCCCC"> so there's a</font>

543
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:52,320
lot of other<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a lot of different</font>

544
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,270
programs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's a lot of i should</font>

545
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,129
say there's some online programs and the

546
00:25:54,270 --> 00:26:00,510
one caution that I have to offer to you

547
00:25:56,130 --> 00:26:03,450
is when you look at the price<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

548
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:05,550
look at the education that the student

549
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:06,870
would be getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got to see if</font>

550
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:09,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's value because some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them are</font>

551
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:11,909
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> two hundred</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fifty dollars for a</font>

552
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:14,430
year just to learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think some basic</font>

553
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:17,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">like intro to java it's nice to give you</font>

554
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:18,720
like $MONEY a year to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but is it</font>

555
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:20,580
really worth 250 dollars you can buy

556
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,430
yourself a nice book<font color="#E5E5E5"> for forty fifty</font>

557
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:25,770
sixty dollars and have that perpetually

558
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:27,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's just me</font>

559
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:30,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">unlike that I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> accountant by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> original</font>

561
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:35,129
look at the value of those things but

562
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,080
that's kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> an important message is a</font>

563
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:40,140
lot of these organizations are doing

collected all the characters and made it

640
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:59,019
into an alphabet and we use that as a

641
00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:00,309
way to create a secret message and gave

661
00:30:54,519 --> 00:31:02,169
in the world and eventually she went to

adjust and get used to going to school

665
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:10,450
regularly and all those things and then

666
00:31:09,009 --> 00:31:12,159
she started to show more of an interest

667
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:15,860
in computers so she said<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've never had</font>

a hacker kids and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're likecool</font>

669
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:20,840
so she did this<font color="#CCCCCC"> super robot contest now</font>

670
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:24,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is somebody who's never done this</font>

672
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:29,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">easy for controller and then build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

673
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:31,520
robot and then battled it against other

674
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:34,250
robots after kind of doing the R&D and

675
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:36,710
the tweaking on the power<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the speed</font>

676
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:39,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">not only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does she have a great time and</font>

677
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:43,070
learn more about herself she took first

she got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> $25 gift card for that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

683
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:59,240
to us but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a ton of money to them</font>

684
00:31:56,419 --> 00:32:00,770
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> she did our online CTF</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

685
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,390
she got involved with some<font color="#E5E5E5"> crypto she</font>

did some of our simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> and coding and</font>

687
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:06,140
even some of the more complex and coding

688
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,820
and you might think well<font color="#E5E5E5"> she probably</font>

689
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:09,320
got some help from mom and maybe she did

690
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:11,659
but one of the things that we really

691
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,520
focus on communicating with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> parents</font>

692
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:15,350
is not to be like that helicopter parent

693
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,820
kind of overseeing to make sure their

694
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,689
kids successful by doing the work for

695
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:20,600
them

not judging<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there's a lot of parents</font>

882
00:39:37,579 --> 00:39:40,939
some cases these kids are becoming

883
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,769
really lazy because if they don't get

884
00:39:40,939 --> 00:39:44,239
that immediate gratification that a

885
00:39:42,769 --> 00:39:47,839
problem solved

886
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:49,819
they lose interest we like what we do

887
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:52,400
because of that gratification

888
00:39:49,819 --> 00:39:54,199
we need to show them<font color="#CCCCCC"> it might take time</font>

889
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:58,550
but you'll get there

890
00:39:54,199 --> 00:40:01,340
don't give up

891
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:03,200
another little case study so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i talked to</font>

892
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:05,570
mainly you know what we usually do stuff

893
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">as a kid 717 but what about these other</font>

00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:08,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit helps and even measuring</font>

with them<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do take surveys we do track</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">diffuse the bully picking on someone</font>

1001

else rather than being a participant in

1002
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:38,000
laughing along because they don't want

1003
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,430
to be the victim

1004
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,840
it's nearly impossible to measure and we

1005
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:43,460
send out surveys we always send out

1006
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:46,400
surveys after the events we do get some

1007
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:51,650
good data and commentary for people<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1008
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:53,810
it's a tricky thing more reporting

<font color="#CCCCCC">baselines this is kinda</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the real</font>

1030
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:39,440
intelligence and none of this can really

1031
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:41,210
be done without you folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to</font>

1048
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:25,580
exciting and in time very exciting times

1049
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:27,680
and there's a lot that's emerging<font color="#E5E5E5"> super</font>

1050
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:30,410
exciting because we're part of it and we

1051
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:32,598
as a collective<font color="#CCCCCC"> our steering</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

1052
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:34,069
direction and it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

1053
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:35,440
emerging I mean I don't want to go into

1054
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:36,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">IOT you know you</font>

1055

<font color="#CCCCCC">don't know about what's going on there</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">nervous</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of cool but scary at the</font>

1058
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:45,250
same time

1059
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:47,050
what are the risks well until we have

1060
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:48,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">one we don't really know how to break it</font>

1061
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:53,740
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure there's some weaknesses</font>

1062
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:57,220
and these these small changes in their

1063
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:59,709
life<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a huge lasting impact</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:14,800
to include hacking<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's still plenty</font>
