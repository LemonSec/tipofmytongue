00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:24,660
couple months ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was it i want to say</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">b-side salt lake city and i sat in on</font>

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,250
somebody giving a talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> crypto 11</font>

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,260
the history of cryptography and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">occurred to me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> g i could give this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:39,300
I've lived this<font color="#CCCCCC"> top</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that was sort of</font>

12

the origins of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk that's</font>

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,809
really just<font color="#CCCCCC"> it started out to be war</font>

14
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,800
stories about things I've done in my

15

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,538
educational and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I made the mistake of in</font>

17
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,669
the abstract for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gurk on saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

20
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,739
today's modern world so I suspect I bit

21
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,500
off more than I could chew<font color="#CCCCCC"> today for 15</font>

22
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,820
minutes but we'll see how it goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks</font>

a few questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> usually do talks with</font>

looking at so you count the letters and

210
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:55,460
then you take it from there

00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,949
the thing about<font color="#E5E5E5"> substitution though is</font>

is probably why

220
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,770
so you start substituting the letters

were sort of in a process of

that they were using the best that the

00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,399
phone call<font color="#CCCCCC"> for some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guy at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> White</font>

532
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">House</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a Marine Colonel saying hey I</font>

533
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,620
need crypto gear so he<font color="#CCCCCC"> shifted out to</font>

534
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">him</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was there during the investigation</font>

535
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,199
and so I had to get involved in the

536
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:01,420
investigation because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was the</font>

537
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,070
custodian for that very concept account

538
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:08,830
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I sort of have a connection to this</font>

539
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:10,059
guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> I won't say what I think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

540
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,860
is the kind of stuff that would be

541
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:13,660
distributed these are these are ways

542
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,520
that you would get electronic key out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

543
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:17,650
the machines and they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets plugged</font>

544
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,350
in like that showed you earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

545
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:22,240
devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> we also put paper out there in</font>

546
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:25,659
the field one-time pads various

547
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,070
varieties<font color="#E5E5E5"> various sizes this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the spies</font>

548
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,960
that we worked with they would literally

549
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:31,000
get the little<font color="#E5E5E5"> one time pad that would</font>

550
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:35,050
hide in the heel of the shoe<font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font>

551
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">somehow get it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font>

552
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:39,220
easier to hide and it was also printed

553
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:40,960
on rice paper so they their way of

554
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:43,240
destroying it very often was eating it

555
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,460
back one time we had a contract to

556
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,350
produce these one-time pads and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've</font>

557
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:49,150
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rice paper that somebody</font>

558
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:50,980
neglected to look at the ink<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

559
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:53,290
being used it and we had a run of

560
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:55,480
one-time pads one time where the ink

561
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:58,270
apparently was toxic so our<font color="#E5E5E5"> spies</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> risk</font>

00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:00,760

those<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not public knowledge</font>

564
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:05,679
because that's embarrassing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> top</font>

character set which is really saying

00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,428
where do you spin the wheel and that

575
00:23:22,929 --> 00:23:26,679
gives you the answer back and if you

answer back with the right response<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

580
00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:36,860
that's important because like in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vietnam</font>

00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:38,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are a lot of people working for</font>

00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:49,789
they were calling in air strikes on the

<font color="#E5E5E5">US troops but you know people would do</font>

587
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:53,299
it because while the guy sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> american</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">he doesn't sound right to me so let's go</font>

important that when i was there we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,890
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> called 23 telephones</font>

00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:12,710
crypto key was that thing on the right

596
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:14,059
there that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get the stick into</font>

597
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:15,140
the phone and turn it and that would

load the key

00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:19,070

approached by a customer and the

been recruited in the field which is

620
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:09,080
what we call spies and they were doing

621
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:12,830
their communications with one-time pads

622
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:14,240
and they simply ask the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> sorry i</font>

623
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:15,860
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing on my desk</font>

624
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,929
it takes me hours to write these

625
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:19,279
messages and decrypt these messages that

626

630
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,890
kind of said yeah we should be able to

631
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:34,520
do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this this is revolutionary</font>

for NSA<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if you happen to catch the</font>

little phrase at the top at the bottom

634
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:41,989
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had a guy that was one of the</font>

senior senior<font color="#E5E5E5"> you executives within the</font>

group that I work for

637
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:46,918
say there's no such thing as software

638
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:50,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">and say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only builds little black boxes</font>

640
00:25:50,009 --> 00:25:55,739
is embedded in this in these boxes<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

641
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:59,100
this was a revolutionary idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my</font>

642
00:25:55,739 --> 00:26:01,950
knowledge<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first one to field a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">software-based encryption system and all</font>

644
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:06,899
we did was take the algorithm of the

645
00:26:04,649 --> 00:26:09,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">one-time pad and write a little computer</font>

646
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:11,369
program on it and then we took the the

647
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,889
key that we generated that would usually

648
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:15,629
be printed on the pad and put it on a

649
00:26:13,889 --> 00:26:17,908
floppy<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and we had to do it in such</font>

650
00:26:15,629 --> 00:26:19,799
a way that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could identify the pages</font>

651
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:22,200
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to do it in such a way that</font>

652
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:24,299
the page could be permanently deleted

came up with this idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me digress</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Visionnaire thing that helped me out</font>

820
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:44,970
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I made</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one with graph paper and glued</font>

still<font color="#E5E5E5"> make rubber cement</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say know what</font>

00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,170
push<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pin it together and i was using</font>

825
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:58,290
this wheel when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was at a special</font>

from me

828
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:03,150
so the next time<font color="#CCCCCC"> i came back i made a</font>

829
00:33:00,809 --> 00:33:04,620
few more and they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> literally I would</font>

turn my back to write on a whiteboard

that

taking the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-time tape and turning it</font>

the secure radios they don't trust them

880

they still use the one-time pads which

881
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,940
means they probably still use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wiz</font>

920
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:35,849
in the courtyard of CIA headquarters in

921
00:36:34,019 --> 00:36:36,290
Langley Virginia and it's an enclosed

building

923
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:42,860
there's this crypto statue and a bunch

926
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:50,300
this statute was at CIA because we were

927

NSA we were the crypto people<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we took</font>

it upon ourselves to try to break the

00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:57,020

939
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,240
$MONTH 2013 said some guy at CIA had

940
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:25,070
broken the code<font color="#E5E5E5"> like in the late</font>

941
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,140
nineties and then somehow they got wind

942
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:29,510
of the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> NSA had broken</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it years</font>

943
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:31,400
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> but like I still have copy of the</font>

945
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,520
the article<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually very factual</font>

946
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:35,990
because there was a memo that went out

947
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody's saying okay you can do</font>

948
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:40,549
this but you have to do it on your time

949
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,320
and you can't use NSA<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources you know</font>

950
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:45,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">we had all sorts of supercomputers and</font>

952
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:49,580
of statistical analysis but we had to do

953
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:52,310
it basically at<font color="#E5E5E5"> lunchtime and on our own</font>

954
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:53,930
time but it was solved pretty quickly

955
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:56,120
the three out of four the fourth

957
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:00,140
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> main problem is it's so short</font>

958
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:02,630
it's hard to get enough of an idea of

959
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:04,100
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's the underlying cryptosystem</font>

960
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,730

actually a system that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I evaluated it's</font>

found an attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had to write a paper</font>

998
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:39,089
group that was looking at networked

00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:41,220
computer systems and that was in the

1000
00:39:39,089 --> 00:39:44,249
early nineties and you know something

1001
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:46,200
happened in the early nineties<font color="#CCCCCC"> mozilla</font>

00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:48,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">something-or-other came out and all the</font>

1003
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:51,210
sudden the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet became a thing so we</font>

1004
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:53,519
all decided to be cool and get into

1005
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:55,619
learning how to break into networks and

1006
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:58,379
so we started to become pen testers and

1007
00:39:55,619 --> 00:40:00,599
ethical hackers and of course that was

1008
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:03,299
you know there's a lot of popularity in

1009
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:05,190
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so the NSA formed what was</font>

1010
00:40:03,299 --> 00:40:07,170
called the systems and network<font color="#CCCCCC"> attack</font>

1011
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:09,059

kind of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> i usually just try to</font>

produce<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cipher and most people that's</font>

obviously there's lots of different

1132
