31
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:27,720
that we use we use endpoint security<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

32
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,189
so that's from guidance software<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

33
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,689
one of the things that we do is

34
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,429
integration so we're going to talk a lot

35
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:36,179
about integrations and using your

36
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:38,520
existing tools today<font color="#CCCCCC"> are expanding the</font>

39
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,380
in 20 different formats

40
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:49,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about you know 206 days</font>

42
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,899
breach was resolution so you know if you

43
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:59,250
can break it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> any way you want</font>

44
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:01,140
it's bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around right again</font>

45
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">quickly closing the window of exposure</font>

46
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:07,979
so time to detection time to response

47
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:09,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">nets that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> results are lower</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> costs so you</font>

48
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,540
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't care what tools</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">using use your tools right so if you've</font>

50
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,450
got

51
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,670
a sim<font color="#CCCCCC"> to lure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IDs or whatever it is</font>

52
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's use those tools let's train on</font>

53
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,589
those tools let's figure out how they

54
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,060
work

55
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,850
let's take these feeds and let's do

56
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:27,190
something with it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I heard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the</font>

57
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:28,840
last guy the team guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about you</font>

58
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,579
know you can generate all this great

59
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,170
information all these logs all these

60
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:35,290
different things but if nobody's looking

61
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:38,380
at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> or nobody's interpreting it you're</font>

62
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:40,390
basically lost<font color="#CCCCCC"> i heard a great comment</font>

00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:43,390

65
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,440
fits in really great with this crowd and

00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,720
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this group of people at this</font>

00:02:54,940 --> 00:03:01,359
can be using some of the greatest<font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

73
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,430
use it if you're not trained in it<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

74
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,770
useless<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

75
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,730
it checks<font color="#CCCCCC"> the box maybe but it's not</font>

76
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,400
helping you

77
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:14,709
so let's let's take a look at the tools

78
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,290
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> get assessments I saw the the</font>

79
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:20,230
red and the blue team guys that that was

80
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:22,690
a fantastic presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

81
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:24,790
for me to see you know how they're

82
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:26,739
coming at both ends and attacking your

83
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,570
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and defending your network but</font>

84
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:31,180
they're relying on different tools and

85
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:33,340
you know you you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> toolbox</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

86
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,030
get outside your<font color="#E5E5E5"> toolbox try other</font>

87
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,739
things

88
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,810
there's great open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source stuff there's</font>

89
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:40,510
all kinds of things and try to find

90
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,430
tools that are flexible tools that allow

91
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:44,950
you to use the tools that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've paid</font>

92
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,120
millions of dollars<font color="#E5E5E5"> for and the tools</font>

93
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,130
that you have in the open source

94
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,280
community and bring them all together

95
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:54,100
and be able to take action on

96
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,500
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's gonna go forward here</font>

97
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to skip through a lot of these</font>

98
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,040
because they're kind of marketing so one

99
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,660
of the ones we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about today is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

100
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,470
know one of the integrations we have is

101
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,910
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> blue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> coat</font>

102
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:07,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody's probably familiar with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Luke</font>

103
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:10,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh so basically Bluecoat can generate a</font>

104
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,709
lot of information you know it can

105
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,390
monitor your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's looking at all</font>

106
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:15,310
these logs<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's looking at all this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dust</font>

107
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">and stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but you know we need to be</font>

108
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,180
able to take action on all that

109
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,640
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of go right to</font>

110
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">you cry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen this a million times</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

111
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i love talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font>

112
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,860
slide because this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 360-degree</font>

113
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,439
visibility

114
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,719
now I've seen pyramids I've seen squares

115
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:33,669
I've seen triangles<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've seen upside</font>

together<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway you look at it it's</font>

118
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,150
basically the attack cycle<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody</font>

119
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:43,060
knows what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cyclist so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

120
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:45,698
need to market you to death with that

121
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,020
so let's kind of just look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> skip</font>

122
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:48,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">through some stuff</font>

123
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so this is kind of what some of</font>

124
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,599
the architecture looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> so some of</font>

125
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:54,490
this stuff would be you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> your blue</font>

are coming in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't care</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

128
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:01,810
what it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

really matter to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> but what matters to</font>

133
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,750
me is that you're collecting all this

134
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,620
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you're doing something</font>

135
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,330
with it

136
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,669
so basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> all this information is</font>

137
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,859
feeding into<font color="#CCCCCC"> we show here the end case</font>

138
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:22,840
and point security tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so that's</font>

139
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,520
really where our forensic heritage and

140
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,650
your forensic knowledge really comes

141
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,060
into place<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we want to be able to take</font>

142
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,679
all this information and go out and

143
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,120
collect volatile data because that's

144
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,310
really what it's all about today right

145
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">so we want to find all that volatile</font>

146
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,060
data and then we want to be able to look

147
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,080
at it and do something with it<font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font>

148
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:42,520
action<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we get these alerts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font>

149
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing we want to be able to do is tune</font>

150
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,240
these machines so that they can they

151
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,560
become more<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost effective</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

152
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're generating thousands and</font>

153
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,430
thousands and thousands of alerts<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

154
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,930
not really doing you guys any good<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

155
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:56,409
what we're doing is we're taking all

156
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:58,509
that information we're getting into our

157
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:59,830
endpoint security tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're looking at</font>

158
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:02,229
it we're looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> ram we're looking at</font>

159
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:04,779
processes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we're able to tune our</font>

160
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:07,779
security tools to maybe go from

161
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:09,969
thousands of alerts<font color="#E5E5E5"> to maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fifty or 30</font>

162
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:11,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's really the goal we want</font>

163
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:13,750
to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to because security teams are</font>

164
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:15,639
anywhere from<font color="#CCCCCC"> I work with customers</font>

165
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:18,879
where the security team is a man of one

166
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:21,250
with security teams that are thousands

167
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">so you really need to be able to take</font>

168
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,849
advantage of the tools you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> return</font>

169
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:31,449
on investment<font color="#E5E5E5"> will talk a lot about that</font>

170
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:33,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">are going here so some of the the</font>

we talk about snapshot<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's going out</font>

176
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:48,650
to the host or to a server and grabbing

177

all the volatile data from that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

178
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,429
that machine and then being able to look

179
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:55,490
at that volatile data and<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> compare</font>

180
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:57,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">it against something previous like maybe</font>

181
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,389
this alert came in on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Friday you have a</font>

182
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:03,680
scan that you took from the day before

183
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:05,629
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> Delta those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two those two scans</font>

184
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,240
and be able to really get quick

<font color="#E5E5E5">actionable information</font>

186
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,550
the other thing we we hear a lot about

187
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:16,219
is you know active<font color="#CCCCCC"> Intel and being able</font>

188
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">to generate your own intelligence</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we</font>

189
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:19,460
give you the ability we have like a

190
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:21,199
contextual data<font color="#E5E5E5"> builder so we give you</font>

191
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:24,020
the ability to take some of those

192
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,569
indicators<font color="#CCCCCC"> dump them into are contextual</font>

193
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:29,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">data builder</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and build actual actionable</font>

194
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:31,460
intelligence<font color="#CCCCCC"> we also have very good</font>

195
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:34,430
integration with<font color="#CCCCCC"> open source tools like</font>

196
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,930
volatility<font color="#CCCCCC"> red Ripper</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things all these</font>

197
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,090
great forensic tools that you get you

198
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:40,789
guys are using<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can use those</font>

199
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:42,619
great open source tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> leverage our</font>

200
00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:44,330
tool and basically turn it into an

201
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,490
enterprise tool so let's say you got

202
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,680
volatility and you want to collect<font color="#CCCCCC"> ram</font>

203
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:50,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">and run volatility against</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> four thousand</font>

204
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,960
machines<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could go ahead and put in a</font>

205
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:56,569
set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ip's or machine names are tool go</font>

206
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,339
out grab all that run volatility against

207
00:07:56,569 --> 00:08:02,029
it and put the<font color="#CCCCCC"> result somewhere for you</font>

208
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:04,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> makes it really flexible open api's</font>

209
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:06,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">so I don't really care if it's uh you</font>

210
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:09,379
know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's fire I if it's blue coat</font>

211
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">palo alto</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lat you know whatever you're</font>

212
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:13,879
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care i can integrate with</font>

213
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:16,009
it and make bring more value to the

214
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:19,759
tools you've already spent money on<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

215
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:21,770
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the name of the game so like here</font>

216
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kinda</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were reviewing some ram in</font>

217
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:26,359
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PM case one web client so we're</font>

218
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:29,150
looking at processes<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can look at open</font>

219
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,129
files we can look at accounts<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

220
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,659
we give you the ability to do a lot of

221
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:35,479
things in your environment we<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard</font>

222
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:37,279
somebody in a talk talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> pii</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

223
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:38,659
want to know where<font color="#E5E5E5"> your bad stuff is so</font>

224
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,549
you've been breached

225
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:42,559
I'm you know where you were attacked so

226
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:44,779
now let's go out let's create a<font color="#E5E5E5"> piii</font>

227
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,219
scan and see what's actually there

228
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:48,290
what credit<font color="#E5E5E5"> card information social</font>

229
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:51,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">security numbers all that great stuff</font>

230
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's find out where it is what it is</font>

231
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,830
let's look at the register

232
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:57,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">three let's be able to do entropy scans</font>

233
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:59,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is really cool so we find a</font>

234
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:01,550
breach<font color="#E5E5E5"> we figure out we find a piece of</font>

235
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:03,140
malware I know somebody said<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

236
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:05,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">there hasn't been a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zero-day in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> long</font>

237
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:08,510
time but let's just pretend<font color="#E5E5E5"> today there</font>

238
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:10,880
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a zero-day and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody else has seen</font>

239
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:12,319
this thing so we all know we we can't

240
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,180
rely on hashes we can't rely on

241
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,250
signatures so we can use our entropy

242
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,930
scans to be able to look at these things

243
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:20,240
at the block level so when they change

244
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:22,489
when they packed and unpacked they

245
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,769
become different<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can run this entropy</font>

246
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,810
scan and actually look at those those

247
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:28,519
blocks and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> score them from a</font>

248
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:31,069
hundred down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to five and make some</font>

249
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:34,160
decisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> we also give you true</font>

250
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:37,010
remediation so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I i find it really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> funny</font>

251
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know maybe in the last</font>

252
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:41,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">three months I've seen you know 300</font>

253
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:42,980
customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and every time I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask them</font>

254
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:45,620
what's their definition<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remediation</font>

255
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">let's pick on somebody with somebody's</font>

256
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">clothes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who about this guy in the red</font>

257
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:50,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">sweater for air</font>

258
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:56,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's your definition of remediation</font>

259
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:58,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">nuke in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> machine</font>

260
00:09:56,089 --> 00:10:00,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess that works to anybody</font>

261
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:05,120
else<font color="#CCCCCC"> give me is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody</font>

262
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:08,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's your definition remediation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

263
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:14,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heard that one before anybody else</font>

264
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:16,279
what's that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also heard</font>

265
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:22,190
patching right go ahead

266
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:23,839
absolutely that's a good one so we do

267
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,730
remediation a little bit different we

268
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,610
take a couple different phase approach

269
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:31,160
to it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so everybody knows in case we have</font>

270
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:34,220
a forensic heritage<font color="#E5E5E5"> we wipe this stuff</font>

271
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:37,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a forensic level wipe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's gone</font>

272
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,779
so what we do is we collect<font color="#E5E5E5"> it first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

273
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,839
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> in what we call a logical evidence</font>

274
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:44,180
file<font color="#CCCCCC"> crc dashed everybody's familiar</font>

275
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,890
with that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we can put that away</font>

276
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,959
so when the FBI comes knocking at your

278

sued

279
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:54,649
you've got that information right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so to</font>

280
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:57,380
be able to go from finding the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

340
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:20,549
out how to do this stuff because

341
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:22,498
basically my future is in your hands

342
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,608
<font color="#E5E5E5">you guys are all defending critical</font>

00:13:22,499 --> 00:13:25,319
infrastructure

344
00:13:23,609 --> 00:13:28,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">I don't care</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's a bank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't care</font>

348
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:38,789
just to make sure that you guys are

349
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:41,519
doing this<font color="#E5E5E5"> defense and using the tools</font>

350
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:44,009
properly and getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> trained</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> makes sense</font>

351
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much what the point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

352
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:46,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get across today anybody have</font>

353

any questions or anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'd like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about</font>

355
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:58,319
go ahead

356
00:13:54,359 --> 00:14:00,719
it absolutely is<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not actually</font>

357
00:13:58,319 --> 00:14:02,429
pulling full memory dumps<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

358
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:04,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically pulling the metadata about</font>

359
00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:07,108
what's in that memory<font color="#CCCCCC"> .</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're not</font>

360
00:14:04,619 --> 00:14:08,249
pulling it over the wire<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font>

361
00:14:07,109 --> 00:14:11,699
we kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know there's been a lot</font>

362
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:12,749
of debate over<font color="#E5E5E5"> agents on the endpoints</font>

363
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:14,579
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's everybody's got a</font>

364
00:14:12,749 --> 00:14:17,069
million agents and it's burning up the

365
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:18,748
<font color="#E5E5E5">endpoints</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we've always in the past</font>

366
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:20,728
we've had what's called a passive agent

367
00:14:18,749 --> 00:14:22,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">sits there quietly doesn't really do</font>

368
00:14:20,729 --> 00:14:24,689
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tell you you call upon it</font>

369
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:26,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">so which is a good thing but we came out</font>

370
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:28,379
with this new thing this year called the

371
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:29,759
active agent<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't like calling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it the</font>

372
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:32,099
active agent<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll iconic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

373
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">passive-aggressive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> age it seems more</font>

374
00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:35,519
fitting to me

375
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:37,139
so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what this thing has the</font>

376
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,119
ability to do is be mindful of your

377
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:40,679
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you want to collect all this</font>

378
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:43,049
volatile data but you don't want to be

379
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,728
ripping the network apart<font color="#E5E5E5"> we give you</font>

380
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:46,769
the ability to save that thing locally

381
00:14:44,729 --> 00:14:48,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">also with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> n points</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are off the</font>

382
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:49,799
network so maybe your road warriors or

383
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:51,419
something like that

384
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:53,608
<font color="#CCCCCC">I give you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ability to save all that</font>

385
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:55,919
volatile information in a folder of your

386
00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:58,259
choice<font color="#CCCCCC"> encrypt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it all and then when they</font>

387
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:01,439
come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to send that up and</font>

388
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:03,689
review it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so good use case for that is I</font>

389
00:15:01,439 --> 00:15:06,389
was getting a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of asks for</font>

390
00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:08,579
this use case<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you're in charge of</font>

391
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:10,979
your network<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of your sea level says</font>

392
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:12,718

00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:18,899
the crap out of all of you right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

396
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:20,519
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you can do is you can set</font>

397
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:23,750
that thing to start snapshot<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>
