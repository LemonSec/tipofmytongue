that you know in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> security arena</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,820
just accept the rest we just keep on

yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> the decisions that we have to make</font>

00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">but what we have to do here is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> taking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

86
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,150
step back and basically what we have to

87
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,690
do is try to our best to define culture

88
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:58,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">just end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through this cut through this</font>

conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this presentation we're</font>

90
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,910
going to talk about stereotypes of

91
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:05,000
similarities we have between people and

92
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:07,100
corporate culture and people that are

93
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,510
true traditional hackers people that

94
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,489
actually work in their own workplaces

95
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:13,459
set up their own different boxes and try

96
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:15,920
to attack those boxes to try to better

97
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:17,899
our own understanding of security on

98
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">what are some of the countermeasures and</font>

99
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:22,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">the cultural clashes that go with that</font>

100
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:25,190
and hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to look at the</font>

101
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:27,020
case<font color="#CCCCCC"> studies i also believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot in</font>

102
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:30,710
history and we don't want to repeat that

103
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:33,080
so that's the kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> caucus is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font>

104
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">very techincal from that standpoint but</font>

00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:37,700
technical<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk then you might want to go</font>

107
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,670
to something else a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit more</font>

108
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,080
technical<font color="#E5E5E5"> but so about me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have 18</font>

00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:54,380
and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well how did this get out</font>

115
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,060
and I would do a quick google search and

00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:30,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've obviously</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my own and that of my</font>

130
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:32,870
employer<font color="#CCCCCC"> so when you talk about culture</font>

131
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have to realize that 1952 somebody</font>

132
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:37,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">wanted out some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sociologists</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> route and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">her</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after anthropologists went out and</font>

they<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to define culture and then</font>

135
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,500
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pass</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they had a</font>

hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> sixty four different definitions</font>

137
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,980
so on

138
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,690
by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1990s somebody finally drew line</font>

139
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:50,210
in the sand and said well this is

140
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:52,070
probably one of the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways that we</font>

141
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,450
can define culture and its culture<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

142
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:56,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">the consistence of derivatives of</font>

143
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:58,310
experience more or less that have been

00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:00,049
learned so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's so it's a learning</font>

145
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,300

146
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:03,800
through others and that are around us

147
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:07,310
and it's a team effort<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's what</font>

148
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,300
culture is basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it kind of</font>

149
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,860
sounds like some of the meetings that

150
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> participated in though when you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">about the hacker culture this is what</font>

155
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,409
comes to my mind that were<font color="#CCCCCC"> noble</font>

158
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:27,620
there's also divisions within that

00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:30,080
hacker culture<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a bike at first</font>

164
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:42,890
than the black hat culture where you pay

00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,359
a lot more for you in the same pretty

this may vary and we could probably

177
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,640
argue about this all day so we class

with<font color="#E5E5E5"> classify hackers or at least it</font>

like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> defcon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the traditional</font>

183
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:25,910
really realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> it until I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got a former</font>

184
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:27,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">for formal education and then I started</font>

185
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,850
realizing like hey wait a minute<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font>

actually like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 testing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wow I didn't really think</font>

188
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:35,510
about it you know from physical<font color="#E5E5E5"> locks</font>

189
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,420
all the way over to websites and stuff

190
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:40,789
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> arm and then I started to</font>

191
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:42,710
realize some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> value of my ways the</font>

201
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:10,430
think that we have we have media versus

the hacker<font color="#CCCCCC"> vs corporation we have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> huge</font>

203
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:15,050
one which is basically should we go

204
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:17,360
ahead and have open source for

205
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:21,140
automotive vehicles<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus the closed</font>

its information<font color="#E5E5E5"> share and the other side</font>

208
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:29,659
believes that we should have hands-on

209
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:32,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's the unbound</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of people which is</font>

210
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:35,150
more the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hackers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> versus the corporations</font>

211
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:36,680
that have very strict boundaries of what

212
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,900
you can and cannot do<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what you will</font>

213
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:41,390
say what you want say or you won't have

214
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,380
a job<font color="#CCCCCC"> so there's a communication</font>

215
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,939
response

216
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,960
there's the hacker tools that are out

217
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,970
there that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

218
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,100
and obviously the corporation has a lot

219
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,930
more money spent<font color="#CCCCCC"> on tools where we</font>

220
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,880
develop our own and we pull some<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

221
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:55,760
various websites to make them available

for people that wanna play with them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

223
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,460
we have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> testing of different</font>

concepts and legality concerns and

ethics<font color="#E5E5E5"> so cultural crash number one so</font>

226
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:09,050
it's the media<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus the hacker culture</font>

00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:12,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a this is a screenshot</font>

228
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:14,839
of what people think about hackers in

229
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,610
general<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't all wear hoodies first</font>

230
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,900
and foremost but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the stuff that</font>

231
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:20,930
they put out there you guys all know

00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,760
this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a little</font>

233
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:25,520
bit there's ads and stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> long</font>

234
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">wait says you know how hackers and car</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">ride</font>

237
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,610
well when the average user reads this

238
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,470
they think that you're trying to break

239
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:35,120
into their car<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's not</font>

240
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,710
necessarily true for the most part and

241
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just interested in like trying to</font>

work<font color="#E5E5E5"> for makers and from that sense i</font>

247
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:52,970
mean that's that's what we do

248
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:56,510
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> does immediate to portray the at the</font>

00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:58,970
culture of the hackers<font color="#E5E5E5"> like is being bad</font>

there but he<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about failure is</font>

261
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,859
simply the opportunity to begin again

this time were intelligently<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

the way we all have to approach it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

that standpoint is first<font color="#E5E5E5"> corporation</font>

kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> flying your system then that's</font>

267
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,380
actually a good thing because now you

268
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,790
know it exists<font color="#E5E5E5"> now you know there might</font>

be something that you have to address at

down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody did a risk assessment</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">something anyway so basically what we</font>

337
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:41,199
have to think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is is not</font>

00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:53,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">totally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> distracted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font>

341
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">a pleasant just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a distraction</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway but</font>

342
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,319
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about is like</font>

343
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,180
basically parent myself with the

344
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,640
corporate environments and<font color="#E5E5E5"> like how to</font>

345
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:03,579
work with them and in a constructive way

346
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">so corporations</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stone all address the</font>

347
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:08,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">zero-day disclosures in a timely manner</font>

348
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:11,650
as we would all like to see and it's

349
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:13,630
never been a cool thing to the public or

350
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:16,270
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hacker community</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the reason why</font>

351
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:19,000
this is and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same in cars as</font>

352
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:21,100
it is in any server or operating system

353
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,270
that's out there is because we just want

354
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,270
to see it fixed

355
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:27,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok and the reason why we like go ahead</font>

356
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:29,650
and we just go put things out there and

357
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,480
to the public and we say okay well

358
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:33,220
here's here's the vulnerability is

359
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:37,390
because it actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to fire any</font>

360
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:38,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody's bomb and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're . they're</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to realize</font>

have like with the example<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's</font>

365
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,940
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

366
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:50,980
interrupted was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a yahoo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> recently</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

367
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,900
they had a very good security expert in

368
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,640
over there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and he finally came out</font>

369
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:57,010
and said look we<font color="#CCCCCC"> tried to secure this</font>

370
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,780
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple years a few years ago</font>

371
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:01,569
before this all happened we<font color="#CCCCCC"> tried to be</font>

372
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:03,850
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the forefront as far as</font>

373
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:06,370
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> in yahoo but basically what</font>

374
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:08,650
happened was they decided not to you

375
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:11,380
know they decided the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost of spending</font>

376
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:12,100
the money on the counter measures wasn't

377
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,620
worth it

378
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:16,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ended up</font>

379
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,520
moving on and he's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> paid</font>

380
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty good for it and maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> his less</font>

381
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:26,740
stress<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff does</font>

382
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:29,199
happen so so anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> media versus the</font>

383
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:31,780
hacker culture<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the resolution</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> age</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

384
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">can see here is like there is like one</font>

385
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:36,459
way that I was looking at this like its

386
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:38,290
first like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hacker</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and me is like</font>

00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:42,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's on the outside but when</font>

389
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,170
you look at it from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pack you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

390
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sitting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in these meetings in a</font>

00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:47,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting with these people that are very</font>

00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:49,989
intelligent<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just is every bit as</font>

393
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:51,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">intelligence me and totally understand</font>

394
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,470

395
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:55,630
conversations<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was like wow these guys</font>

396
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:56,590
are not all ideas<font color="#E5E5E5"> these guys actually do</font>

397
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:58,150
know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're talking about they're</font>

398
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,560
actually in our community<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're doing</font>

399
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:02,800
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cool stuff that were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

400
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,989
and we have to realize that perception

401
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,030
is something that we all make up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

402
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:08,590
this is like psychological and it's like

403
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:10,089
you know at that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I always</font>

404
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:13,450
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think of it like this it's like</font>

405
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:14,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's it's just like a culture but it's</font>

406
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,900
made up in your mind<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font>

407
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:19,000
you've learned ever since you were a

408
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:22,090
baby and you and you were born and you

409
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,650
carried it through and my perception<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

410
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,540
to change at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

411
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:28,150
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was a paradigm shift</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in thing</font>

412
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:30,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">arm and go into a lot of conferences</font>

413
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:33,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've heard a lot of hackers kind of bash</font>

414
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:35,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know the corporations and stuff like</font>

415
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:38,020
that for not for not fixing things right

416
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:42,280
away<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there is a resolution for that</font>

417
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:44,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this bonus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of terms of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> contributions</font>

418
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,329
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> teamworks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1i want to</font>

419
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:49,990
think about is like how can we go ahead

420
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:53,920
and contribute contribute more to the

421
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:55,780
actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> corporate environments and the</font>

422
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,240
one thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> corporate environments are</font>

423
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:59,709
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> welcome on us and and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

424
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,260
time when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> came up with this this</font>

425
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:05,079
conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> they weren't as much so</font>

426
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:08,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">welcome</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and us and to go ahead and have</font>

427
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:10,839
their stuff and try to welcome us

428
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:14,379
forward into<font color="#E5E5E5"> vulnerability management</font>

429
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:17,260
programs<font color="#E5E5E5"> so obviously you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> GM was</font>

430
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:22,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">the first start they came out with a</font>

431
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:24,040
vulnerability disclosure program<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

432
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:25,510
that was a big step when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seen that I'm</font>

433
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,190
like wow<font color="#CCCCCC"> things are actually changing</font>

434
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">maybe for the better</font>

435
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:30,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok the disclaimers</font>

436
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:34,629
talked a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you know a lot</font>

437
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:36,640
but but anyway on that they want to put

438
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:38,830
in in the reason why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I say that is</font>

439
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,440
because they want to put constraints

440
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,939
around the hackers member unbound<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

441
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,070
don't like boundaries<font color="#CCCCCC"> so when you try to</font>

442
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:47,290
put its constraints around us corporate

443
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:49,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">then basically what happens is you</font>

444
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:51,909
really turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> us off we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to be</font>

445
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:53,500
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> how liable for something that we</font>

446
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:55,150
want to disclose to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try to fix</font>

447
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,770
your product because you probably should

448
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:59,470
have thought about<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the first place</font>

449
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:02,260
what we want to do is basically go ahead

450
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:03,130
and you know help you out and just get

451
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">it fixed</font>

452
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:06,700
you know that's that's the that's the

453
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,050
mentality<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and you know there's a</font>

454
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,910
certain pride and it depends on the

455
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:12,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">person's depends on the motivation might</font>

456
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:14,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually be like hey look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i did this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

457
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,210
was me that actually found this problem

458
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,680
and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually they fix that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

459
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:19,600
think that's where the pride really is

460
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:22,180
with the hacker community and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

461
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got to stay so we can</font>

462
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:27,070
definitely go ahead and make you know

463
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:29,889
build bridges<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in in terms of that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> arm</font>

464
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:31,840
but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also understand the</font>

465
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:34,450
legality side of the corporation that

466
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">they don't want to be held liable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

467
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:39,610
something that might actually cause

468
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:42,490
death or harm<font color="#CCCCCC"> i got knows already have</font>

469
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:45,760
teams of lawyers<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they go ahead and</font>

470
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:49,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">employ a full-time so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> realize when</font>

471
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,950
somebody talks to media corporate<font color="#CCCCCC"> vs</font>

472
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,480
hackers<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes the message gets</font>

473
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:58,240
edited<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so i actually did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh you know</font>

474
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,630
I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> channel 50 there was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a street</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beat</font>

475
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,970
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> this year I talked about hackers in</font>

476
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:06,100
general<font color="#CCCCCC"> I talked about some of the</font>

477
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:08,560
security concerns we have on that's a

478
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,570
different topic as far as<font color="#CCCCCC"> nation-state</font>

479
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,790
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we have to be more aware of but</font>

480
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:14,110
in those conversations like you know you

481
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:16,810
have to meet you realize that sometimes

482
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:18,370
when you say stuff on TV and media<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

483
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:21,429
for those<font color="#CCCCCC"> unless they have actually been</font>

00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:23,379
media<font color="#CCCCCC"> trained armed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

get edited<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cut down and then also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

486
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:27,190
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sound right</font>

487
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,770
so you have to realize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens to</font>

488
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:31,480
corporate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to arm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so this place a lot</font>

489
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:34,629
into the perception of overall public

using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> corporations which is also</font>

something that could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a limitation</font>

807
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,360
if you're looking for employment and

00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,399
they want to actually have you have

both legally on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Capitol</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

826
00:31:57,389 --> 00:32:02,699
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those people actually had to go</font>

00:31:58,889 --> 00:32:06,029
on before<font color="#CCCCCC"> capitol hill and defend what</font>

828
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:09,899
Charlie Miller did because because it

829
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:12,029
was in all perceived<font color="#E5E5E5"> as irresponsible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

830
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:14,939
which you can fall down because somebody

831
00:32:12,029 --> 00:32:16,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">could have got hurt and on and so</font>

832
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:18,720
there's that legal struggle on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Capitol</font>

833
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hill</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that goes both ways they want to</font>

834
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,049
take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> right away for testing on</font>

835
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:23,009
vehicles and<font color="#CCCCCC"> testing on different</font>

836
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:24,450
technologies

837
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:26,220
well where do you think they get these

838
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:29,580
ideas from when they see stuff like this

839
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:33,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">so there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that that long gun mentality</font>

840
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:35,009
out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> but also if it wasn't done</font>

841
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:38,190
who would ever take it as a big

842
00:32:35,009 --> 00:32:41,129
perceivable threat<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's that other</font>

843
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:43,379
side of the coin and it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

844
00:32:41,129 --> 00:32:46,439
and almost seems like what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> happenin</font>

845
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:48,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">and this is my humble opinion is that</font>

846
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,539
we're getting pushed into the corner of

847
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:53,250
making these horrible decisions because

848
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:55,190
nobody's going to listen to us unless we

849
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:59,900
actually do that

850
00:32:55,190 --> 00:33:04,160
so more solutions to demand respect you

851
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:05,690
must need you must gain respect and in

852
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:09,320
the corporate culture that's definitely

853
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:11,720
more true than that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it pays to be</font>

854
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:14,149
professional when you're dealing with

855
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,070
these people<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't have the Tommy Boy</font>

856
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:17,750
meeting because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I understood that ok</font>

857
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:19,580
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's going on in my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hat</font>

858
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:21,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> crashing and stuff like that</font>

859
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,990

862
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:32,570
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> but solutions are better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think we</font>

863
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:33,830
started off a few years ago we<font color="#CCCCCC"> used the</font>

rant about security now we're all

865
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:38,570
talking about solutions<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we have to</font>

866
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:40,370
have clear lines of communication when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:43,820
have clear lines of communication with

869
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:47,510
the hacker culture the hacker culture

870
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:50,810
also needs and wants that communication

871
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:52,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> remember we talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the BMW</font>

872
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:55,100
vulnerability<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's my humble opinion</font>

873
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:57,200
that if they were communicated to think

874
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:58,550
about this if<font color="#E5E5E5"> your corporation and</font>

00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,390
somebody comes forward with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:10,460
become your client in a way you should

manage that connection<font color="#CCCCCC"> this person</font>

881
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,980
you should probably let them know where

it lands<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are you going to do</font>

listen without prejudice we need to

that's why we have to learn to work

together on because it's about bridging

that gap so what actions will you take
