<font color="#CCCCCC">not much to it with that said this</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">kinda hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to reproduce without putting</font>

everyone here knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> what fishing is I</font>

37
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:06,390
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> or else you wouldn't be here</font>

sense of urgency<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it usually want to</font>

41
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:19,230
request something back<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we actually</font>

42
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,970
have some employees who will and you

43
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,310
guys surprising it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you'll get an</font>

44
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,090
email saying hey I've got this<font color="#E5E5E5"> phishing</font>

45
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,490
email

46
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,870
well they're not really asking free to

47
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,850
do anything there's literally just

48
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,090
information like call this number for

49
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:35,040
more information that's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

50
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:38,970
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very good way to fish so it's</font>

51
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,859
probably just spam and we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we get</font>

52
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,480
a lot of email saying hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> call this</font>

53
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,010
number to go you know if you want to be

54
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,700
invited to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this conference or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this or</font>

55
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not fishing a</font>

56
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,390
lot of times people actually put your

57
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:55,500
name in the email which is usually

58
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:57,420
pretty trivial to do so just keep that

59
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,160
in mind if you are fishing<font color="#E5E5E5"> others you</font>

60
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:06,630
want to make it as personal as possible

<font color="#CCCCCC">the threats of fishing the main</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point I</font>

00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:21,720

obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> arm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but you don't you</font>

69
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,220
basically don't want your employees

00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:35,578
<font color="#CCCCCC">computers be to become owned and when I</font>

71

say employee either employees in your

72
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:44,130
own company or employees for one of your

73
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:47,370
clients<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes phishing emails are</font>

actually forwarded<font color="#E5E5E5"> to other people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

75
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:53,280
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of you have seen that happen</font>

76
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:57,160
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is kind of what it looks</font>

77
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:14,380
like

78
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:16,600
so it's it's just a bad day all around

79
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">when that happens because on the other</font>

00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,910
employees start sending it out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> click</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the links and whatnot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how does it</font>

82
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:26,410
work

83
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:28,870
our curiosity<font color="#E5E5E5"> fear and sense of duty</font>

84
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:32,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">uh what I'm going to present to you is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually send it out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of pure curiosity</font>

86
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:38,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the vector I like taking because</font>

87
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:42,460
people are generally curious by<font color="#E5E5E5"> nature</font>

88
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:45,010
people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> are curious</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so if you can if</font>

89
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:47,830
you've got that that edge to your

<font color="#CCCCCC">phishing email I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're gonna you're</font>

91
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:55,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have more success than taking</font>

92
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:57,550
other vectors<font color="#CCCCCC"> so why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should we finish</font>

93
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:01,720
our employees and actually this this

94
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:04,600
iterates<font color="#E5E5E5"> again arm you can become the</font>

employee essentially if<font color="#E5E5E5"> their computer</font>

96
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:11,170
becomes owned<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's fun to do obviously</font>

97
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:13,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">anti-phishing software is not fail proof</font>

98
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:17,050
and if a vendor tries to sell you

99
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">anti-phishing software and they say that</font>

100
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,560
it works a hundred percent of the time

101
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:25,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">or even anywhere near that they're</font>

102
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:29,560
bullshitting you<font color="#CCCCCC"> fish fishing is not</font>

103
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:32,470
spam it's always it's always a lot of

104
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,780
times it's very targeted<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of times</font>

105
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:38,560
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed just you know a few things</font>

106
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:40,780
and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure spam does that too but but</font>

107
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,730
the problem with fishing is that it's

108
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:46,270
actually out to get someone it's

109
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:47,650
actually it's actually sent out to get

110
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:51,280
something from the user and that's

111
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:53,979
that's very dangerous<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

112
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,039
educate your employees or employees of

113
00:05:53,980 --> 00:06:00,820
your of your clients before the bad guy

114
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:04,000
does because there is going to be a

115
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:05,260
lesson learned some time in the life of

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,800
that company

117
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:16,120
so this just goes back to fishing is

118
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:19,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">fishing is technically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spam but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spam is</font>

119
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:22,660
not fishing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is actually a real</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spam</font>

120
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,979

121
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:28,210
they're like oh this is fishing were

122
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:30,130
like no no this isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> armed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

123
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,630
times fishing looks like this

124
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:34,690
hey John can you send me the account

125
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:36,580

<font color="#E5E5E5">you're giving away information that</font>

127
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:41,859

128
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:43,510
one it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if they want to get</font>

129
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,910
information from you you actually have

130
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:52,090
to act on it and you know spend more

131
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:53,770
than a few seconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so here we go this</font>

132
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:57,159
is a phishing email is on out to

00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:49,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">bimbo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dot-com I thought of that name</font>

518
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:51,650
well I had a few at<font color="#CCCCCC"> DEFCON</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it takes</font>

519
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:54,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">words from one list and words from</font>

520
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:57,860
another list<font color="#E5E5E5"> smashes them together</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font>

521
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:59,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">who is and if it's available then it</font>

522
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,760
will show it on the website<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just</font>

523
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,639
kind of a stupid thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I put together a</font>

524
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:08,210
lot of some<font color="#E5E5E5"> most a lot of domains are</font>

525
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:10,250
not safe for work<font color="#E5E5E5"> so but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's fun</font>

526
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:13,790
to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially when you're drunk</font>

527
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:16,040
so let's encrypt the<font color="#CCCCCC"> webpage that i put</font>

528
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:19,010
together<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted it to show that little</font>

529
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:21,649
lock arm<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do you can do</font>

530
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:25,370
encryption<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easily very cheaply with</font>

531
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:26,840
let's encrypt<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

532
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:28,939
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> found out about let's encrypt</font>

533
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,340
and literally within 10 minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had it</font>

534
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:34,520
working on my web server<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stupid</font>

535
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:36,530
easy to do things actually are actually

536
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:39,590
encrypted and you will actually see that

537
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:43,760
that little lock up in the browser<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

538
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:44,480
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i do it just do it</font>

539
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,799
users will

540
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,960
see that little lock and they'll be like

541
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:51,260
oh this is secure

542
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:53,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">I mean it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what it is and sure yeah</font>

543
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:56,330
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> connection secure that doesn't mean</font>

544
00:25:53,210 --> 00:26:01,400
that the website is actually you know

545
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:05,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">legit so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> email process i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had to throw</font>

546
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:07,760
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in here to get all the email</font>

547
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:09,590
addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the names create a CSV with</font>

548
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:13,100
all this information<font color="#E5E5E5"> you iterate through</font>

549
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:14,899
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> csb</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you email each person with this</font>

550
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:18,649
information and then you sit back and

551
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:20,690
you tell logs<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we'll get into that a</font>

552
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:24,950
little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> so here's what the</font>

553
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:26,929
information looks like this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CSV</font>

554
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:29,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've got their first name</font>

555
00:26:26,929 --> 00:26:32,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've got their last name then I created</font>

556
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:35,690
a random string<font color="#CCCCCC"> i originally took this</font>

557
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:38,150
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't md md5 hash against</font>

558
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:40,610
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i decided well that could in theory</font>

559
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:42,860
be decrypted<font color="#E5E5E5"> or you know at least</font>

560
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:46,760
someone could brew it so i actually just

561
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:48,500
created a completely random hash<font color="#CCCCCC"> so at</font>

562
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,360
the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now you</font>

563
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,309
want this this is actually what

564
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,719
identifies the user and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i hope you guys</font>

565
00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:56,360
in the back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and see this i know it's</font>

566
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:59,690
pretty low<font color="#E5E5E5"> but this will actually</font>

567
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:02,090
identify who had click the email<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

568
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:04,340
want it to be completely random<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font>

569
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:05,629
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually useful when they click</font>

570
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:08,570
the email

571
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:11,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll show you this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the link</font>

572
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:13,820
has this random string in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so when</font>

573
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:15,770
they go to your website you can tell you

574
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:20,510
can take a look at the log and see the

575
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:23,000
same little blob in the access logs and

576
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:25,790
then you can say oh well since this

577
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,890
person got this link and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're the</font>

578
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:31,250
only one who got<font color="#E5E5E5"> this specific link with</font>

579
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:34,640
the specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> little random string in it</font>

580
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:35,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">then I know who clicked it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> assuming of</font>

581
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,810
course that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they didn't send it to</font>

582
00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:44,370
someone else and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> clicked it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

583
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:46,889
so the fishing script<font color="#CCCCCC"> before this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

584
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:50,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know if i ever had written</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> python</font>

585
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:53,100
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so like i said this only took</font>

586
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:55,889
me about a<font color="#CCCCCC"> half-hour to get together arm</font>

587
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:58,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">like most of that time was learning</font>

588
00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:00,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">python or just copy and paste and stuff</font>

589
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,740
off the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll go through</font>

590
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,389
this really quickly

591
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:05,520
basically this is the first argument

592
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:09,480
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through the script second</font>

593
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:11,310
argument<font color="#CCCCCC"> third</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give them you get</font>

594
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:15,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">their name</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get their email address</font>

595
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:18,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then that unique blob I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the</font>

596
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:19,530
from address<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have everything</font>

597
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:25,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">else is pretty much self-explanatory</font>

598
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:28,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">subject from to this is the actual</font>

599
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:31,919
message now this is just the plain text

600
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:34,620
message that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok i think it changed</font>

601
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:37,380
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is plain text so for whatever</font>

602
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:41,129
reason the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the email client doesn't</font>

603
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:43,590
accept HTML<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll drop down to this this</font>

604
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:47,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">plain text message</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> arm unfortunately</font>

605
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:49,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's not as intuitive as if you had used</font>

606
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">HTML because there's nothing to click</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

607
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:55,380
they would actually have to literally

608
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:58,590
copy and paste this into a browser and

609
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:01,260
that's why you include HTML<font color="#E5E5E5"> because most</font>

610
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:05,370
email clients will accept HTML and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

611
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:07,920
will actually render it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so pretty much</font>

612
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:09,479
here just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a link</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they click on the link</font>

613
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:12,210
it says immediate<font color="#E5E5E5"> click here to</font>

614
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,950
immediately reset your password or login

615
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:19,080
to the portal immediately to reset your

616
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:21,780
password<font color="#CCCCCC"> arm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now in it and I want to</font>

617
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,939
make a note<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> throw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if the</font>

618
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:26,010
user it if this is looking like it's

619
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:28,020
coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> from within</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your organization if</font>

620
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:30,120
you want to make it look like it's

621
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:31,680
coming from within your organization or

622
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:34,199
whatever organization you're copying

623
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:36,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">take the standard footer and also put</font>

624
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:41,960
that on there

625
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:43,490
so this is the code that pretty much

626
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">just sends it out</font>

627
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:48,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">I so looking at all this code most of it</font>

628
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:50,660
was literally just the messages you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

629
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:54,679
just attach the plane<font color="#E5E5E5"> you attach the</font>

630
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:56,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">HTML message</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually it actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attach</font>

631
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:59,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">it down here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> send it to your local host</font>

632
00:29:56,690 --> 00:30:02,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">or whatever email relay you have and it</font>

633
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:05,900
just it just works and then you quit at

634
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:10,280
the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually sending out the</font>

635
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:12,080
email<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is what it looks like and</font>

636
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:16,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually this was a kind of the in one</font>

637
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:18,770
of the last examples<font color="#E5E5E5"> first name email</font>

638
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:21,320
address blob<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I was actually having an</font>

639
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:23,750
issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was just going to do one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minor</font>

640
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:26,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> send</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm just putting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

641
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:29,450
down here for<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be complete</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

642
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:31,610
had to write a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bash script</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that wrote</font>

643
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:35,270
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> batch script to this day I don't</font>

644
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:37,429
know why<font color="#CCCCCC"> arm the other I pretty much</font>

773
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:23,290
providers and my<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns provider my VPS</font>

774
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:26,530
provider<font color="#CCCCCC"> blocked me</font>

775
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:30,070
well this was the support ticket that

776
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:32,560
went to them the support ticket had the

777
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:36,490
link in it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so someone over there</font>

778
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:39,490
actually click the link and it showed up

779
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:43,359
in my logs<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was kind of funny</font>

780
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:45,009
so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I ever want to reference my ticket</font>

781
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:48,790
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just look at my logs and</font>

782
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:50,890
all that's the ticket number so it

783
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:53,350
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see weird stuff when you</font>

784
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:55,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">send the stuff out so the login page</font>

785
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:59,410
copy of pre-existing page like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said</font>

786
00:36:55,990 --> 00:37:02,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">modify make it arm or make your own</font>

787
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:04,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">official-looking page yet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> honestly I</font>

788
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,950
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> made a login form it didn't even</font>

789
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:07,960
say what it was for

790
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:10,330
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then right here this is the</font>

791
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,460
important part for the for the password

792
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:15,160
value you want it you want the value to

793
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:17,380
equal nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it will not transmit</font>

794
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:25,660
anything when they actually put it in

795
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:27,010
the intermediary page<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty</font>

796
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:30,609
much the same thing

797
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:33,310
this is actually after they submit their

798
00:37:30,609 --> 00:37:35,619
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's this is a same intermediary</font>

799
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:38,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">type script</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> except this one day actually</font>

800
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:40,900
doesn't look up<font color="#E5E5E5"> arm since it doesn't</font>

801
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:42,759
have that blob<font color="#CCCCCC"> center redirected it</font>

802
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:46,090
doesn't actually look up<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> name</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

803
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">but it will actually show you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> logs</font>

804
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:53,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their email address that they put</font>

805
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:54,850
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> or their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> username they put in so and</font>

806
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:57,730
then here's what the log looks like

807
00:37:54,850 --> 00:38:01,000
after they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> login same sort of</font>

808
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:03,850
deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I did have the IDL</font>

809
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was a technical difficulty that I</font>

810
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:08,740
was having actually translating this arm

811
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:11,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">the technical difficulty was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

812
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:13,060
didn't care and didn't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> didn't</font>

813
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:14,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">really want to go that extra mile that</font>

814
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:17,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">the extra few minutes to actually code</font>

815
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:18,279
that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> but in theory yes you could</font>

816
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:20,170
actually have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up the user's</font>

817
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">name instead of showing that stupid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> blob</font>

818
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:24,400
here so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear all the email addresses</font>

819
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,618
and then you could tell down here

820
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,810
someone put something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in like blah blah</font>

821
00:38:26,619 --> 00:38:30,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">screw you .</font>

822
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:32,400
you know you could tell that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there again</font>

823
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know they're kind of tests and stuff</font>

824
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,430
out and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see most of this</font>

825
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,750
like at the end of your<font color="#CCCCCC"> test</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

826
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:38,910
people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start you know</font>

827
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:42,390
talking and<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh well let me let me see</font>

828
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:44,339
what happens when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> type</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the Sun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

829
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:45,960
actually it's kind of funny

830
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:48,510
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot of people in the company</font>

831
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:50,910
telling other people hey this is this is

832
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:52,860
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> test</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go click on the link and try to</font>

833
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:55,410
log it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look what look what it</font>

834
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:56,850
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we're getting a lot of people</font>

835
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:58,770
doing that at the end

836
00:38:56,850 --> 00:39:03,779
mostly the second day of the testing

837
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:07,590
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> so and this is literally what</font>

838
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:09,300
the login page<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I probably</font>

839
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:11,640
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have put together a whole</font>

840
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:14,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">screenshot this is all they saw it</font>

841
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,900
didn't say it's you know it's for this

842
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:18,930
application<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> application</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just as</font>

843
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:21,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">support secure login</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so and this is</font>

844
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:24,210
where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> six</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> curiosity part comes</font>

845
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:26,160
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like what the</font>

hell my locked out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

847
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,700
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i gotta log in to see what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

848
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:32,850
locked out of or at least try<font color="#CCCCCC"> logging in</font>

849
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:35,640
to reset my password<font color="#CCCCCC"> they had no idea</font>

850
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:38,370
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're logging</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into and that's the</font>

851
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:41,370
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> aspects</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opposite the</font>

852
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:44,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">curiosity aspect is people are going to</font>

853
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:46,170
be generally curious and want to get

854
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:49,620
back into whatever they're locked out of

855
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:52,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">for some arteries and who knows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but i</font>

856
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:54,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> main thing is uh the</font>

857
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:56,820
main reason why people are probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

858
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:58,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this is because possibly</font>

859
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:00,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">there thinking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't even try logging</font>

860
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">into anything recently what the heck's</font>

861
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:04,050
going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> someone's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to get into my</font>

862
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:05,399
account let me see if it's still active

863
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:11,040
and this and that

864
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:12,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">so which is kind of a little story here</font>

865
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,779
one guy who actually logged into this

866
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:18,060
was on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> linux team he actually did an</font>

867
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:21,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">ldap change literally minutes before</font>

868
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:23,070
this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> some out so he thought he he</font>

869
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:25,080
thought he actually did break something

870
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:28,860
so we tried login any<font color="#CCCCCC"> scramble</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

871
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:31,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">login</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is like oh this isn't yeah I</font>

872
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:37,020
didn't actually break anything

873
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:39,119
so this is the actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> our website at</font>

874
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:42,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">they saw after they tried logging and</font>

875
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:45,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">arm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep it funny you know so</font>

876
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:46,770
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get pissed off at me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

877
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">was there is actually more to it if you</font>

878
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:50,819
actually go to the fishing presentation

879
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:52,500
like you can actually click on<font color="#CCCCCC"> here's</font>

880
00:40:50,819 --> 00:40:54,960
the link and you can see the full thing

881
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:57,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">I actually describe the things that</font>

882
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:01,290
people should be looking for in their

883
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:02,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">email you know in the future</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so it</font>

884
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:05,099
didn't just say this is a phishing

885
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:07,109
attempt it it kind of outlined

886
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:08,280
everything that people should be aware

887
00:41:07,109 --> 00:41:13,140
of

888
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:14,700
so what a random<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> winner</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are we</font>

889
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:17,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> took all the people who</font>

890
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:19,020
reported the email and then they got put

891
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:22,890
into a drawing and then they actually

892
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:24,240
got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> tin foil hat they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't get to</font>

awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> though</font>

896
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:35,490
certificate in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but on the other</font>

897
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:39,630
side we kinda<font color="#CCCCCC"> logged the people who</font>

898
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:42,930
tried logging and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a random culprit</font>

903
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,299
have to kind of think about what the

904
00:41:58,049 --> 00:42:03,599
best time is to send<font color="#CCCCCC"> us out</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you could try acting as an actual vendor</font>

if you make up your own company

00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:14,220
there's not going to be some kind of

<font color="#CCCCCC">fake company out there trying to sue you</font>

911
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:21,359
hope not

912
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:24,420
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually try sending out a</font>

secure email<font color="#CCCCCC"> so a lot of companies are</font>

914
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:29,280
getting into the secure email business

915
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:31,290
where you actually you just get an email

916
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:34,140
and then you get a link<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> click</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

917
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:37,020

00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:40,770
go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a login page that would actually</font>

919
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:43,559
be a very good way to get people<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

920
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:45,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">could actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> skip the whole login page</font>

921
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:46,739
completely and just harvest email

00:42:45,989 --> 00:42:48,839
addresses

924
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:55,109
as far with that you can actually target

925
00:42:52,109 --> 00:42:58,920
specific departments which actually this

that

952
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:04,650
put a little flag into the header<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a</font>

little flag<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the login page or</font>

something

955
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,999
keep a list of all those flags and then

956
00:44:07,229 --> 00:44:11,428
when you get your whole game up and

957
00:44:08,999 --> 00:44:17,910
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> people can submit those flags and</font>

you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing prizes or whatnot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so and</font>

959
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:24,598
that's about all there is to it

960
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:27,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">arm like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i know i went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

961
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:28,410
fast and there's not a lot of code but

962
00:44:27,299 --> 00:44:32,640
you might want to look into it a little

963
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:34,618
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do a Q&A and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll keep this up if</font>

965
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:41,640
look at the presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> arm go to my</font>

969
00:44:52,750 --> 00:45:01,780
so the question was how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

970

971
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:07,570
so it only took me two minutes to send

00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:10,480
it out to the whole organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>
