54
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:11,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">what in the world does that mean right</font>

55
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we're going to talk a lot of all</font>

56
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:17,899
threat modeling and how we use

57
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:19,640
that to plan out our security spend and

58
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,530
really focus where we're going to put

59
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,480
security efforts within our

60
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,879
organizations

61
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">I know it's late</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the second day but I</font>

62
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:29,359
need a little participation<font color="#E5E5E5"> here how</font>

63
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:31,459
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys out there work for say a</font>

64
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">decent sized organizations maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you got</font>

65
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:37,220
a hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> 200 500</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> systems you're</font>

66
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,690
responsible for<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok pretty unwieldy when</font>

67
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,220
someone says hey you<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta test all that</font>

68
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,019
stuff every so often blah blah blah

69
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">right now we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to test</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font>

70
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:46,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">hundred things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

71
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk a little bit</font>

72
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,099
about strategy how we do that we'll use

73
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,870
some threat modeling and some risk

74
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:51,950
analysis to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

75
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,319
hopefully show you how to make it real

76
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:56,569
simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about why we</font>

77
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,730
should be or why we do threat model for

78
00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:00,440
those of us that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of you out</font>

79
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:03,170
there have threat modeling as part of

80
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:09,950
your security programs today

81
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:11,569
12<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so and and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not a bad</font>

82
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,708
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not uncommon threat</font>

83
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:14,750
modeling is one of those things we've

84
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:16,160
been talking about for a long time but

85
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,350
it doesn't really happen all that often

86
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we're going to talk about why we</font>

87
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:23,239
don't do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will also get into some</font>

88
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:26,900
idealism of threat modeling<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus the</font>

89
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,459
reality of threat modeling and we're

90
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,380
going to talk about this whole idea how

91
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:33,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we ensure all is not lost you'll see</font>

92
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:35,269
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when we get there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

93
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:39,230
of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's make it simple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

94
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:41,870
so keep it simple stupid so why do we

95
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:45,230
threat model<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> red Adams textbook</font>

96
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:46,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty good book the same one guy who</font>

97
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,649
does threat modeling is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one person read</font>

98
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,989
the book<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're interested in threat</font>

99
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,959
modeling<font color="#CCCCCC"> i strongly recommend that book</font>

100
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:57,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's 500 some pages you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually don't</font>

101
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,819
need to read it all at once<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

102
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,168
half is really good to tell you how to

103
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:02,089
do threat modeling the second half is

104
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:05,060
all reference for when you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

105
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">modeling good book</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i say that now</font>

106
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,260
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm gonna probably beat up on</font>

107
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:11,090
him a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Adam personally but</font>

108
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,290
the book just<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's nothing wrong with</font>

109
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">the book but there are some things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

110
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:16,349
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can do a little better</font>

111
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,479
why do we do it

112
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:21,450
first of all it's a way for us to push

113
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">security early into the sdlc right we</font>

114
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,820
hear this all the time where people talk

115
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,099
about

116
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:28,050
hey we<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta do more things early on in</font>

117
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,430
this in the development<font color="#E5E5E5"> lifecycle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couple</font>

118
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:32,010
more security there<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta design</font>

119
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our applications</font>

120
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:37,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">how do we do that threat modeling is one</font>

121
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:40,320
way that we can start to do that threat

122
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:44,370
modeling allows us to<font color="#E5E5E5"> recognize issues</font>

123
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,690
in how<font color="#E5E5E5"> were designing our apps the ideal</font>

124
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,330
threat model that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

125
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:49,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> allows you to proactively say</font>

126
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,200
hey if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to build an</font>

127
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:54,120
application that does this you need

128
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,219
these controls to make sure you're going

129
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,870
to keep that application secure before

130
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,880
you ever start developing anything

131
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:03,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's pretty cool</font>

132
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay um another thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> threat modeling</font>

133
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:07,859
those forces it brings that business

134
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,940
context to our security structure<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

135
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to talk about building</font>

136
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,110
security into an application<font color="#E5E5E5"> we really</font>

137
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,539
want to understand what that application

138
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:18,060
does proactively instead of the typical

139
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">pentest get handed a nap</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and okay maybe</font>

140
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">we find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out some information about what</font>

141
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">it does</font>

142
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:23,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe we discover some information about</font>

143
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,250
what it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> just by doing some</font>

144
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:27,780
reconnaissance<font color="#E5E5E5"> this gets us a little</font>

145
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,430
more intelligence from the business side

146
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,570
which can be very effective<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we</font>

147
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,520
start talking about what kind of

148
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,950
security controls do we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

149
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">finally we understand if we're talking</font>

150
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:39,599
in a large organization now<font color="#E5E5E5"> how does</font>

151
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,310
that application<font color="#E5E5E5"> contribute to our</font>

152
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,360
overall security posture within the

153
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:46,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">organization so that's why we want to be</font>

154
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,720
doing throughout<font color="#CCCCCC"> modeling that's what</font>

155
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,780
threat modeling was intended to provide

156
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,640
us with<font color="#CCCCCC"> but now let's talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font>

157
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,479
don't we

158
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a good book out there called</font>

159
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,640
juggling elephants it's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

160
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">high-level management books that I don't</font>

161
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,930
normally read but this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

162
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:05,250
kinda like the reality is for those of

163
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,770
us especially those of you that said hey

164
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:11,400
I've got 500 systems are responsible for

165
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:12,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">we are juggling elephants</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything is</font>

166
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,810
a priority we've got all of these

167
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,760
systems each one of them in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> owners</font>

168
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:20,310
mind is a critical priority to the

169
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,500
company in addition just within the

170
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,690
security space<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got all these</font>

171
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,460
conflicting things that were told we

172
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,650
need to do all these security activities

173
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,138
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

174
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,638
we're supposed to be doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> pen</font>

175
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:33,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">this was supposed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing code</font>

supposed to be doing our scans<font color="#CCCCCC"> are all</font>

178
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:39,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">this stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we need firewalls we need wax</font>

179
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,120
we need this we need that all these

180
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">dolphins</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up in the air</font>

181
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,819
how do we pick the ones that are most

182
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,840
important if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we drop any of them they</font>

183
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:48,199
land on our head

184
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're done so that becomes a major issue</font>

185
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,689
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> we start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about threat</font>

186
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,330
modeling because<font color="#CCCCCC"> now threat modeling</font>

187
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:55,249
becomes yet another baby elephant that

188
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,990
we want to throw up there and give our

189
00:06:55,249 --> 00:07:01,789
security folks and our development teams

190
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:04,759
to juggle another<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem threat</font>

191
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:09,770
modeling is what is it really

192
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:11,539
most people don't really have a clear

193
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,090
understanding of what threat modeling is

194
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:17,060
in addition if you go out and you try to

195
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,560
research what is threat modeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> aside</font>

196
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,300
from again the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shostak book which is</font>

197
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,580
kind of become like the Bible for threat

198
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,110
modeling<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's about a thousand other</font>

199
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,688
resources you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to find and not</font>

200
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:29,089
one of them agrees with the other one is

201
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:31,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">threat modeling okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to it means</font>

202
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:34,490
something to ever to each individual

203
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:36,229
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> go out there and look at service</font>

204
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,879
companies like my own consulting

205
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:39,589
companies that offer this is a service

206
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:41,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're gonna see is everybody</font>

207
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:43,789
talks about a little bit differently

208
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:46,099
everybody offers their own flavor of it

209
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:47,688
so what that means now<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I've got an</font>

210
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:50,930
organization says hey you know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

211
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:53,569
want to push us<font color="#E5E5E5"> dlc security</font>

212
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:55,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">I want to get this threat modeling thing</font>

213
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:57,529
that her all about into my<font color="#E5E5E5"> sdlc because</font>

214
00:07:55,729 --> 00:07:59,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've been told that that's an easy way</font>

215
00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:03,050
for me to push all the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> farther</font>

216
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:04,759
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sdlc the cost of entry is just</font>

217
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,050
astronomical because just trying to

218
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:10,339
figure out what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do</font>

219
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:11,750
leaves you searching and searching and

220
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:13,069
searching<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's time to come up with</font>

221
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,379
your own methodology and are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

222
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:17,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do it right are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong</font>

223
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:19,520
what is right and as we're going to see

224
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:23,810
what's right isn't always the same for

225
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,549
each<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> finally the</font>

226
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:28,819
reason why organizations don't do threat

227
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:30,589
modeling today because we as security

228
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:33,589
folks don't do a good job of

229
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:36,169
establishing<font color="#E5E5E5"> why it's important we talk</font>

230
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:38,180
about this nebulous idea of hey we're

231
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:39,348
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> push security over here left in</font>

232
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:41,718
the software development<font color="#E5E5E5"> lifecycle</font>

233
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:42,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">layers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cliches</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for you want</font>

234
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:46,550
to push everything left

235
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:48,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">all ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great i can kind of see as a</font>

236
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:50,060
manager why that's important<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you</font>

237
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,410
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got all this tactical</font>

238
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,630
stuff I've got to worry about<font color="#CCCCCC"> i got</font>

239
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">people trying to attack me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> every day I'm</font>

240
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,060
worried about getting firewalls and

241
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,130
keeping them running<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm worried about</font>

242
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,869
putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> web application firewalls in</font>

243
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:01,640
front of my apps I'm worried about my

244
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:03,890
sim and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's it telling me and how do</font>

245
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">I react with all these things I've</font>

246
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,000
already spending<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe millions of</font>

247
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:09,680
dollars on penetration testing and so

248
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,570
forth now you're telling me we need yet

249
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:17,150
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> security activity</font>

250
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:18,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">why so we throw this out there as a</font>

251
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:21,890
threat modeling is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wonderful</font>

252
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:24,410
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really put any context</font>

253
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:27,260
around it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what we need to do a</font>

254
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:29,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">security folks is first understand the</font>

255
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:31,880
value of threat modeling ourselves and

256
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:33,290
how we can drive that value within our

257
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,760
organizations and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

258
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:36,469
able to communicate that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and really</font>

259
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,960
display that to our management so they

260
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,250
understand better<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully some of</font>

261
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,140
the tools i'm going to give you during

262
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:45,500
this talk today are going to help you

263
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:48,890
with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as we get into</font>

264
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:51,650
this now<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the ways that we enable</font>

265
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:54,230
better share of information between

266
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:56,000
information security and developers<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

267
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:59,480
that saves<font color="#E5E5E5"> us money than in the long run</font>

268
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">in development and we'll get more into</font>

269
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,450
that as we go on

270
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:07,160
so for the one person who<font color="#CCCCCC"> red Adams book</font>

271
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:09,800
and for the rest of you who haven't

272
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">let's talk a little bit about I the</font>

273
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,599
ideal threat modeling so this is really

274
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:16,580
according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Shostak talks about in</font>

275
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,340
that book and this is also what you'll

276
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:23,660
find most people kind of get as a

277
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:25,250
general concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ideal threat</font>

278
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:28,579
modeling happens during the concept

279
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:30,860
phase of any application<font color="#E5E5E5"> lifecycle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

280
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:32,960
for building a new application or<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

281
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,660
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bringing something in from a</font>

282
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">third-party</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever it is we do threat</font>

283
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:40,490
modeling at the point that<font color="#CCCCCC"> hate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we need</font>

284
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,840
this system to do XYZ<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're not</font>

285
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,560
designing it yet we're not doing

286
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,520
anything

287
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:49,579
the intent is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we kind of talked about</font>

288
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:52,610
what is this system going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

289
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:55,310
kind of data is it going<font color="#CCCCCC"> how's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

290
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,590
other systems is going to talk to and

291
00:10:55,310 --> 00:11:00,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we think about all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

292
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:02,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">wants</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to attack</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so and then</font>

293
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,880
from there we can say okay based on this

294
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,860
you need to make sure that when you

295
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:09,010
build this system so as you're designing

296
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:12,160
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting these controls that are going</font>

297
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:14,620
to address those threats<font color="#E5E5E5"> those actors</font>

298
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,930
who would come after us to do us harm<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

299
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:21,070
all these various various different ways

300
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:24,310
the problem with this<font color="#CCCCCC"> many DevOps</font>

301
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:26,260
developers out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody doing</font>

302
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:30,040
continuous integration

303
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:32,140
there we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kinds of</font>

00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">phase isn't really much of a phase is it</font>

305
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:38,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's hey I got an idea what's right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

306
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time to sit down and stop the</font>

307
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,740
development process for something like

308
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:44,410
this even if you're in a traditional

309
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:46,120
waterfall and agile shop<font color="#CCCCCC"> oftentimes</font>

310
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:51,189
things go straight from concept into

311
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:54,520
design in a heartbeat<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do this</font>

312
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:56,560
another issue with trying to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> threat</font>

313
00:11:54,520 --> 00:12:00,610
modeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> that early is we've got no</font>

314
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:02,140
design context<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so yeah it's great</font>

315
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,430
we throw threat modeling out there we do

316
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">it nice and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> early</font>

317
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,579
hey we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be really proactive</font>

318
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:08,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're going to figure out what the</font>

319
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:11,200
threats to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this system are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before we do</font>

320
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:13,390
any coding and then they can design it

321
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,370
can make sure it's all secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sounds</font>

322
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:17,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">great in theory and I see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you shaking</font>

323
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:19,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">your head already and I think I you</font>

324
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:21,550
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the same boat i am maybe</font>

325
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:23,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the problem is without design</font>

326
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:25,540
context<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are design features that</font>

327
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,630
implement new threat or<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduce new</font>

328
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:31,810
threats<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not considering what</font>

329
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:34,780
that design is going to be there are

330
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:39,430
potentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> threats that go unnoticed</font>

331
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:40,959
the intent is that we do a lot of this

332
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:43,479
threat modeling which includes building

333
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,860
you know some data flow diagrams and all

334
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,210
these wonderful things understanding

335
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,890
where the state is going to flow<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

336
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:49,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to attack it and we're supposed to</font>

337
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,670
go back and validate that later<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

338
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">supposed to do other activities that</font>

339
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:56,589
we're not doing today to go back and

340
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,210
validate that hey all these things that

341
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,990
we said during<font color="#CCCCCC"> our threat model are true</font>

342
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:02,330
and correct and accurate

343
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,890
so now you're talking about a security

344
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:07,700
activity that lives on through the

345
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:09,260
entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> lifecycle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> microsoft and</font>

346
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,120
you have the ability to do that kind of

347
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,589
thing in your huge and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're writing</font>

348
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,220
software that's going to be used by

349
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:15,110
millions

350
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:17,839
yes you probably have the time and the

351
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:20,630
effort and the money to spend to do that

352
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,770
the reality is<font color="#E5E5E5"> for most of us that's not</font>

353
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:25,820
something that's going to float if we

354
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:27,500
try to sell that to our management<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

355
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:30,560
the end if you get threat modeling going

356
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:33,110
according to this ideal program<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you</font>

357
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">end up with is what we insecurities</font>

358
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,050
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> is great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

359
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:37,820
security drives the<font color="#E5E5E5"> architecture going</font>

360
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:40,160
to use the technology that we're going

361
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,690
to use and it drives the design of our

362
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:46,550
applications

363
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:48,980
sounds good right how many of you work

364
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:55,790
in any<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization where that actually</font>

365
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:57,589
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> one you work for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft ok i</font>

366
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,670
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> i bring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that Microsoft is very good</font>

367
00:13:57,589 --> 00:14:01,430
at this and it works for them the

368
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:04,069
problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most of us that ideal</font>

369
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:05,839
never occurs right

370
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:08,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">infosecurity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does not get the</font>

371
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,570
opportunity to dictate design new

372
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:14,209
technologies come up all the time that

373
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:15,560
are driven to be used within our

374
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:17,719
organizations because they offer some

375
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:20,689
new functionality or something new and

376
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,430
sexy that somebody wants to add and we

377
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:25,820
are stuck<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a security perspective</font>

378
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:33,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">having to react to it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so the reality is</font>

379
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:35,850
we don't usually see that ideal<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

380
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:38,910
timing<font color="#E5E5E5"> was perfect on that</font>

381
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,930
my friend<font color="#CCCCCC"> stephen a smith hey let's be</font>

382
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:42,899
real here

383
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:47,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's talk about what the reality is</font>

384
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:50,100
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we take more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for mag pragmatic</font>

385
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:52,410
approach to this and realize first of

386
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,759
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're probably not going to have</font>

387
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:57,089
much of a concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> face where we can</font>

388
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:59,009
really slow development down if we're in

00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:00,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">a DevOps or continuous integration</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">if we push something a little bit later</font>

design phase for some of those more

398
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:21,810
traditional methodologies or even into

399
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:24,180
coding if we're talking about you know

400
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:27,540
continuous integration or so forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

401
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:30,149
even god forbid<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know this is you know</font>

402
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:32,939
a horrible thing to say but even maybe

403
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:34,350
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> post-production</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right so we've got</font>

404
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:38,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">a continuous integration</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of our we put</font>

something<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have coded that's part of</font>

406
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,519
continuous integration but we still

407
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:42,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">wanna go back and look at that right and</font>

about some other design ideas

00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:32,450
as we go but let's talk about what we're

457
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:36,170
looking at when we do this architecture

464
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,659
hopefully hopefully there's a standard

00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:54,409
way that we do single<font color="#CCCCCC"> sign-on or we can</font>

00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:56,360
start to define one do we have specific

like<font color="#CCCCCC"> off those types of things we can</font>

00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:09,590
pull in as specific design patterns we

473
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:12,710
identify them and we can start to use

474
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:15,350
our threat modeling to not only pull

those out<font color="#CCCCCC"> but later on as well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

477
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:25,730
enhance those design patterns when we

<font color="#CCCCCC">start to identify these patterns we can</font>

479

also start to refine our threat models

and make the threat modeling better<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

linking those common threats that we

know are part of this particular design

483

diet design guidance as<font color="#CCCCCC"> will see that</font>

488
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:52,520
goes along with that because we have a

where security controls are so as ice

00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:56,490
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> literally how are we going to</font>

what are we really doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we come down</font>

to a threat model<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not dissimilar</font>

and read a book on threat modeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

to do this is simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is</font>

something that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is something</font>

530

that is a common theme throughout threat

531
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,400
modeling is to get together these

532
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:41,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">whiteboarding workshops where you can</font>

sit down with the stakeholders and walk

through that design understand what the

535
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:52,230
design looks like and then start to

536
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:53,610
document the data flows<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if I</font>

understand what<font color="#E5E5E5"> data is in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there i</font>

545
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:13,360
building this<font color="#E5E5E5"> they start to ask you</font>

546
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:16,420
questions as a security engineer

547
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,580
hey I'm thinking of doing this what do

548
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:22,240
you think of this idea or what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I need to</font>

549
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:23,710
be careful if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more so</font>

550
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,360
than even just your threat model now

551
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,980
you've started<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build this</font>

552
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,100
collaboration between your security

553
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:32,140
people and your development teams<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

554
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:38,110
project teams now have that open line of

555
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:40,720
communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is a vast value</font>

556
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:42,159
add to this process this is the type of

557
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,310
thing that now you can start to

558
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:47,800
establish<font color="#E5E5E5"> real returns from the activity</font>

559
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:49,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're doing that extend beyond just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hey</font>

560
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,460
we're going to this threat model this

561
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:54,010
application<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what does this look like</font>

562
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've captured the design we've captured</font>

563
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:56,440
the data flows it ends up looking

564
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,520
something like this

565
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,870
now what you see when you get into

566
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,490
threat modeling everybody's got their

567
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:01,840
own different ways that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they like to</font>

568
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:03,910
capture<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff</font>

569
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,740
certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know there's a threat</font>

570
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:07,960

571
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,650
own does their own diagrams in certain

572
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,640
ways

573
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:11,890
everybody's got their own methodology

574
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,240
this just happens to be the one that I

575
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:15,820
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that aspect</font>

576
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so what you see here the key</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

577
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:20,260

00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:25,629
components of the application

581
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:28,030
represented here you can see things like

582
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:30,430
road load balancers in web<font color="#E5E5E5"> proxies so</font>

583
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:32,980
things at an architecture level that are

being represented<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got different</font>

are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all things that kind of get lost if</font>

588

we do threat modeling too early<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we</font>

00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:46,210
don't have that design context

those are things that we lose you see up

00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:01,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">oftentimes maybe we define as part of</font>

00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:02,980
the threat model but isn't there for

599
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,149
doing the threat model before any design

600
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:09,280
works been done

601
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:11,800
everything we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the model</font>

602
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,120
is based on what we see here<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

603
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,430
why it's important to get this right

604
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,989
this is why a collaborative session

605
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're doing things on a whiteboard</font>

606
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,830
and working with developers who can

607
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,840
immediately see how<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're understanding</font>

608
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:25,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">what they're telling us and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can correct</font>

609
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">what we're making mistakes on we may</font>

610
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">even have the architects help us draw</font>

611
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:29,800
those types of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> they may put their</font>

612
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,440
own spin in there

613
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:34,360
this becomes a valuable valuable<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece</font>

614
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,680
not only for the threat modeling that

615
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're doing but obviously this type of</font>

00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,460
documentation for any system<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of us</font>

617
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:41,830
don't have this typically in our

00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">projects today so now we've got</font>

00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:46,449
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's additional value down</font>

620
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:51,040
the road<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that particular application</font>

621
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:53,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">so now we've got the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dataflow the next</font>

622
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,610
thing we want to do is talk about where

623
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:58,000
are the controls that are already

624
00:23:54,610 --> 00:24:00,909
planned<font color="#CCCCCC"> what are the intending to</font>

625
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,610
implement what type of authentication

626
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:07,000
what type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> authorization</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what type of</font>

627
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:08,590
logging features are they looking at all

628
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,750
of the different security controls that

629
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:12,850
you can think of<font color="#CCCCCC"> break</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those down into</font>

630
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:15,820
categories and start to represent those

631
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:17,379
in our diagram<font color="#CCCCCC"> what are they doing to</font>

632
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:19,899
protect us against things like

633
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">cross-site scripting so do they have</font>

634
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,740
controls for input validation and i'll

635
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:28,300
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> encoding</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things of that nature</font>

636
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:30,850
once we have that general idea

637
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:33,040
now we can start to look at threats<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

638
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:36,909
let's look at who are those threat

639
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:39,370
actors<font color="#CCCCCC"> what are the things that they're</font>

640
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:40,600
going to look to do to our system

641
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:43,750
what's the data they're going to be

642
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,250
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> where are they going to attempt to</font>

643
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:49,360
take over system or potentially

644
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:52,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">denial-of-service</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cannot really</font>

645
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:55,209
want to attempt to deny service

646
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:57,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so this is where we start to think</font>

647
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:59,920
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> you people who are you guys her</font>

648
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:02,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">stride before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stride</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ring a bell to</font>

649
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,850
hopefully if<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple 123</font>

650
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so we don't want stride we're</font>

651
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:07,959
talking about just categories of attacks

652
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:10,330
right we've got spoofing and tampering

653
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">repudiation so forth</font>

654
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:15,070
this is now where we start to draw that

655
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:16,129
in and so what you can see here is just

656
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:17,510
one way

657
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:19,190
that you could potentially represented

658
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:21,500
the way we do it here is you've got a

659
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:24,350
number of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> threat actors</font>

660
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:26,930
represented and the relative risk

661
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:28,399
rankings in terms of likelihood impact

662
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:32,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">and overall risk of each of those</font>

663
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:34,370
threats<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we start to identify those we</font>

664
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:37,400
show the the attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> paths which are</font>

665
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:38,300
denoted<font color="#CCCCCC"> there with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> red</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so this is the</font>

666
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,310
type of thing that we're looking to

667
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:42,409
understand at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point now we start to</font>

668
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:44,960
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay here based on how the system is</font>

669
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:45,950
architected<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the technologies that</font>

670
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,390
are at play

671
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:49,490
now we have a better understanding of

672
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:50,570
where they attacking us how are they

673
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:52,640
attacking us

674
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:54,800
so where do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I either need to validate</font>

675
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the controls we have designed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

676
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,580
sufficient or where we potentially

677
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:02,330
missing controls that need to be added

678
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:03,980
to this environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> so as you can</font>

00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:06,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">imagine the last pieces that controls</font>

00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:22,970
controls that we have in place the

688
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,200
controls here are represented by

689
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:26,840
triangles again

690
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:29,210
your mileage<font color="#CCCCCC"> may vary whatever works for</font>

691
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:32,030
you is fine but we're trying to

692
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:34,310
represent here is the relative<font color="#E5E5E5"> strength</font>

693
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:35,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">of those controls and their location</font>

694
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:38,899
within the system so that now we can

695
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:40,940
visualize how those address the attack

696
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:43,520
and those threats that we identified

697
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:46,070
earlier in this case the<font color="#E5E5E5"> colors are</font>

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,080
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know colors aren't always</font>

699
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:49,129
the greatest thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

700
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's something like twenty five percent</font>

701
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:54,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the population is colorblind so you</font>

702
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,960
know you you may not want to use colors

703
00:26:54,410 --> 00:27:00,410
to represent but in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> blue are</font>

704
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,160
strong green<font color="#E5E5E5"> are sufficient and so on</font>

705
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,510
and so forth

706
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,010
there's no right up there but if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had</font>

707
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:08,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">any controls that were outright missing</font>

708
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:09,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">those would be represented in red again</font>

709
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">i put this up here not to break that</font>

710
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:14,420
this is like some great wonderful thing

711
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:17,090
that we do so well but more to spur

712
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:19,340
ideas for you on ways that you can

713
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:22,040
represent this again you'll find if you

714
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:24,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">search the happy interwebs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

715
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:26,690
plenty of information<font color="#E5E5E5"> different ideas on</font>

716
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:29,090
how to draw a diagram similar to this

717
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:29,639
but hopefully this provide some context

718
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:35,668

725

<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations who offer threat modeling</font>

729
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:03,479
threat modeling and just like the way

730
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:06,509
they would sell pen test or anything

731
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:07,889
else it's this one time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I come in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I do</font>

732

734
00:28:11,729 --> 00:28:15,599
threat modeling is ensuring that we get

735
00:28:13,649 --> 00:28:17,309
more out of it than just<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

this one time and make this one design

<font color="#CCCCCC">literally this vulnerability fix it this</font>

745
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,499
really prescriptive it gives me some

746
00:28:35,369 --> 00:28:39,779
actionable stuff but then it goes away

747
00:28:37,499 --> 00:28:41,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">and once they start making</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> changes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to my</font>

this is so effective and what it's going

doing today from security activity

00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:22,020
to give us a better overall coverage and

as we kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned as though the</font>

use threat modeling to help me build an

792

overall risk picture of all my

793
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:44,160
applications so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i understand not only</font>

794
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:47,939
what applications are higher risk for me

795
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:52,260
but maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> what types of threats are</font>

796
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:54,900
common<font color="#CCCCCC"> what types of data are common</font>

797
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:56,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">where does that data exists which</font>

798
00:30:54,900 --> 00:31:00,210
divisions of my organization and so

799
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:05,010
forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> so start by looking at how we feed</font>

800
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:06,450
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sdlc so the sdlc ties into threat</font>

801
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:08,490
modeling as we said we're going to look

802
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:11,820
at initially how do we tie this in from

803
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:12,900
the design phase onward and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

804
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">to go out we're going to do this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> threat</font>

805
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">model going to get all this wonderful</font>

806
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:17,820
information but we do with that

807
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:19,890
information really<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mentioned before</font>

808
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:23,100
that we're looking for design patterns

809
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:24,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so as I'm going through and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

810
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:27,090
start to implement a threat modeling

811
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:28,110
program within my organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of</font>

812
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:30,120
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we're going to start to see</font>

813
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:32,969
pretty quickly is that there are common

814
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,590
design patterns across our applications

815
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:37,530
some of you may already be aware of some

816
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:40,169
of these today you might have specific

817
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:42,270
implementation guidance that pertains to

818
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:45,750
certain design patterns

819
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:48,600
this enables you to expand on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

820
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:50,760
created if you don't have it today<font color="#CCCCCC"> so as</font>

821
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,409
we start to see these different design

822
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,020
patterns now we can start to identify

823
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:56,480
and document on

824
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:58,639
and provide reference architectures and

825
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,940
implementation guidance to our

826
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:04,370

840
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:42,320
we want these design guides to fit what

before and suddenly that's what

854
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,679
everybody wants to use because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's new</font>

855
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:17,660
and sexy<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not so new and sexy</font>

856

<font color="#CCCCCC">arm</font>

starts feeding back into threat modeling

860
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:29,450
that now we can consider as a part of

our threat<font color="#E5E5E5"> models going forward</font>

870
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:52,310
up with something that we hadn't thought

<font color="#CCCCCC">of from a security perspective that</font>

00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,400
design improved design patterns back

876
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,320
into the threat model so that our future

877
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,430
threat models take into account the

878
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,870
lessons learned

879
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:14,540
from previous cycles of software

development<font color="#CCCCCC"> when we look at security</font>

881
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:18,139
testing so let's assume for a moment

882
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,609
that we've got our threat modeling

883
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:23,089
program in place and we're doing this

884
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:25,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">we've also got a pretty robust program</font>

885
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:28,430
for doing our code reviews doing our

application<font color="#CCCCCC"> pentest and so forth threat</font>

887
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:31,520
modeling can help us refine that and

888
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:34,460
actually drive some efficiency<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:36,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">throughout modeling one of the things we</font>

890
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:39,889
can do is very easily<font color="#CCCCCC"> identify</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> test</font>

00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:44,389

<font color="#CCCCCC">we're gaining quite a bit of technical</font>

context into the design of that

895
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:51,470
application as we document these things

896
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:53,840
these can start to drive very targeted

897
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:57,020

907
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,960

00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:18,650
little extra<font color="#CCCCCC"> manual time to look at that</font>

ability to now refine the security

00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:41,240
more effective more efficient as well

on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> flipside coming back security</font>

917

testing certainly will potentially

00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:48,649
identify new threat vectors for us<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">something new technology has been used</font>

went<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the threat model gets identified</font>

lesson to be learned right<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can take</font>

00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:45,590
guys over here do something really good

966
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:49,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">but what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can provide a clear</font>

967
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:54,260
picture to management on where the

968
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:57,410
problem areas lie<font color="#E5E5E5"> where certain</font>

969
00:37:54,260 --> 00:38:01,730
divisions have more<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk to worry about</font>

970
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:03,680
or more vulnerabilities and more threats

971
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:07,070
to worry about then maybe other

972
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:10,430
divisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> now you've got a way to</font>

973
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:13,100
justify the money you want to spend<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

974
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:16,279
you go and you say we need this in our

975
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:18,830
application security program and their

976
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:21,770
first question is why<font color="#E5E5E5"> now you have the</font>

977
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:23,630
answers<font color="#CCCCCC"> so one of the things we drive</font>

978
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:26,450
out of threat modeling or we can drive

979
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:29,420
out of threat modeling is this idea of

980
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:32,868
an application risk rating and in

981
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:34,730
literally 10 minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple</font>

982
00:38:32,869 --> 00:38:37,519
easy questions that you would ask the

983
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:39,769
threat model<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway you can start to</font>

984
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:44,660
establish<font color="#CCCCCC"> the risk rating</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for these</font>

985
00:38:39,769 --> 00:38:46,098
applications that now<font color="#E5E5E5"> leverages the</font>

986
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:48,828
information that you're gaining through

987
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:50,240
your threat model<font color="#CCCCCC"> its transformable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

988
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:53,779
that you can provide it to

989
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:55,368
<font color="#CCCCCC">decision-makers to look at any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

990
00:38:53,779 --> 00:38:59,869
way from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sunday whether they want to see</font>

991
00:38:55,369 --> 00:39:03,349
it by divisions or<font color="#E5E5E5"> by operating systems</font>

992
00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:05,569
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> by no pci data or whatever your</font>

993
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:09,079
concerns are there are ways to melt that

994
00:39:05,569 --> 00:39:10,549
the feedback then from that is that your

995
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:12,529
security planning can refine your

996
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:14,690
methodologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> whether it's in threat</font>

modeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> security testing or otherwise</font>

998
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:20,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">based on those risk levels maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

999
00:39:18,769 --> 00:39:22,098
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> low-risk applications</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we say you</font>

1000
00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:23,869
know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're not going to pay some</font>

1001
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:26,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">consultants sixty thousand dollars to</font>

1002
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:28,999
come in and do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> two-week dynamic</font>

1003
00:39:26,749 --> 00:39:30,259
analysis and code analysis on this

1004
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:33,200
application

1005
00:39:30,259 --> 00:39:35,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> low risk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have some</font>

1006
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,950
automated tools that instead we can

1007
00:39:35,089 --> 00:39:40,489
enable our developers or security

1008
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:43,038
architects to run and provided a certain

1009
00:39:40,489 --> 00:39:44,299
level of assurance for those<font color="#CCCCCC"> low-risk</font>

1010
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:45,680
applications

1011
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:47,569
that's a little less than what we want

1012
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,788
to do for our<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-risk applications</font>

1013
00:39:47,569 --> 00:39:51,829
that oh yeah by the way are the crown

1014
00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:55,579
jewels of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization and need that</font>

1015
00:39:51,829 --> 00:40:00,019
extra attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what I'm going to</font>

1016
00:39:55,579 --> 00:40:01,940
show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you now is a a tool and I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

1017
00:40:00,019 --> 00:40:03,319
this because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I promise you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you read</font>

1018
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:06,019
the abstract that this is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font>

1019
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:08,538
going to do was<font color="#CCCCCC"> show you a tool</font>

1020
00:40:06,019 --> 00:40:11,508
<font color="#E5E5E5">this isn't meant to be something that</font>

1021
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:13,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">hey here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go use this run it this is</font>

1022
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:15,470
again meant to be an example of

1023
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:16,849
something you can do what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

1024
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:21,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">to see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is something that is built in</font>

1025
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:22,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">Microsoft Excel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now it's in Excel</font>

1026
00:40:21,529 --> 00:40:25,279
because it

1027
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:30,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">excel is easy it's portable and</font>

1028
00:40:25,279 --> 00:40:32,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody has it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> arm ideally you'd like</font>

1029
00:40:30,859 --> 00:40:34,788
to see this be in some type of database

1030
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:37,190
or some other robust system<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a web</font>

1031
00:40:34,789 --> 00:40:38,960
application something of that nature<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1032
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:41,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">to show you how quickly and easily get</font>

1033
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,460
something like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> spun up i'm gonna</font>

1034
00:40:41,089 --> 00:40:45,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">show you this in microsoft excel so</font>

1035
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:46,910
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hold</font>

1036
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:49,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">then pray that the monitor still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reacts</font>

1037
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:52,970
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way it did before because this is</font>

1038
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:56,869
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was ten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and god only knows</font>

1039
00:40:52,970 --> 00:41:00,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so what you have in front of you here</font>

1040
00:40:56,869 --> 00:41:02,150
is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I finally refer to as the as</font>

1041
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:05,058
<font color="#CCCCCC">role or the application security risk</font>

1042
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:06,829
level this is a tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> built in</font>

1043
00:41:05,059 --> 00:41:10,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">Excel that allows me to capture</font>

1044
00:41:06,829 --> 00:41:12,680
information about an application that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1045
00:41:10,609 --> 00:41:14,839
would be capturing<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway during a</font>

1046
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:17,390
threat model<font color="#CCCCCC"> the difference here is that</font>

1047
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:19,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm capturing this information and it</font>

1048
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:22,460
pertains to risk as much as architecture

1049
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:25,430
as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> as security and by capturing</font>

1050
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:27,230
this information<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to define a</font>

1051
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:29,899
scoring model<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind the scenes that</font>

1052
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:31,670
then develops for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> a risk level now I</font>

1053
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:33,680
break this down into five risk levels

1054
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:35,359
again your mileage may vary

1055
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,549
maybe you want to establish more maybe

1056
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:39,920
you want to establish fewer<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1057
00:41:37,549 --> 00:41:41,359
entirely up to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> but what you'll see</font>

1058
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,480
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that there's five risk levels</font>

1059
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:46,490
and what we use this for is now I can go

1060
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,650
out and I can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> prioritization</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1061
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:50,000
can say hey you know what

1062
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:52,279
here let's break this down into

1063
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,900
applications and that within a specific

1064
00:41:52,279 --> 00:41:55,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">division</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can see this set this</font>

1065
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:57,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">divisions got a lot of high-risk</font>

1066
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,599
applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> divisions got a lot of</font>

1067
00:41:57,079 --> 00:42:02,000
low-risk applications<font color="#CCCCCC"> now I know where I</font>

1068
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:05,839
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spend my attention from a</font>

1069
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,519
security perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> so before before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1070
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,630
get too far into this questionnaire<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

1071
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:10,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to show you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just really quickly</font>

1072
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:11,690
the way this is all driven and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font>

1073
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:13,940
this this is actually kind of cool and

1074
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:16,220
usable<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I've got a section here where</font>

1075
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:18,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can define my business lines which</font>

1076
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:21,230
then gets pulled in later<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can define</font>

1077
00:42:18,529 --> 00:42:22,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">business systems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1078
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:25,549
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm talking about</font>

1079
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:27,618
<font color="#CCCCCC">high-level this might include multiple</font>

1080
00:42:25,549 --> 00:42:29,599
software systems multiple applications

1081
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:32,660
multiple groups of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you see</font>

1082
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:35,269
things here like vendor payments and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1083
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:37,730
you see sales leads and<font color="#CCCCCC"> accounts payable</font>

1084
00:42:35,269 --> 00:42:39,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">and so forth these are your business</font>

1085
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:42,410
systems things to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a business level</font>

1086
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:44,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">the heart of this is really the</font>

1087
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:46,160
application inventory so here's all the

1088
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:48,440
applications that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know i've got within</font>

1089
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,058
this organization that fit into those

1090
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:52,130
business systems that are within those

1091
00:42:50,059 --> 00:42:54,170
business lines<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as you can see this</font>

1092
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:55,849
is all<font color="#CCCCCC"> tied together each of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1093
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:57,230
know in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of a cool</font>

1094
00:42:55,849 --> 00:42:58,580
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> excel all these are tied together</font>

1095
00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:00,560
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> dropdowns</font>

1096
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:02,180
that are generated if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i select</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1097
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,759
business system here if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I couldn't say a</font>

1098
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:06,770
new application<font color="#E5E5E5"> will say the marketing</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">portal</font>

1100
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:14,390
I can almost type and then you know

1101
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:17,300
through selection<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will assign the</font>

1102
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:18,350
other pieces are not terribly important

1103
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:20,750
again this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you some</font>

1104
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:25,279
ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you could do with this</font>

1105
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:29,360
in this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> software base so now</font>

1106
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:32,030
from here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I resource the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> applications</font>

1107
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:33,860
that generates my happy macros<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes for</font>

1108
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:36,380
using macros in excel<font color="#E5E5E5"> dangerous scary</font>

1109
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:38,390
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trust because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I wrote it or</font>

1110
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:41,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">well someone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in my organization</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrote it</font>

1111
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:43,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">I won't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> claim responsibility for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1112
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:46,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">event</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now I've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this new application</font>

1113
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:48,020
and I want to complete this<font color="#CCCCCC"> as role and</font>

1114
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:50,360
freaked out on me that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok we'll use</font>

1115
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:52,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">the one that's here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we look at this</font>

1116
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:55,580
application and you can see it's got

1117
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:57,590
things in here basic stuff we<font color="#E5E5E5"> about when</font>

1118
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:59,450
it was profiled and so forth but right

1119
00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:01,430
away we jump into starting to understand

1120
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:02,750
the risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what's the</font>

1121
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:06,319
classification of information being

1122
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:08,480
processed or transmitted<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know how</font>

1123
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:10,190
large is the user population<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's the</font>

1124
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">applications primary architecture type</font>

1125
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:14,750
things like that so we capture all these

1126
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:16,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">we break we've broken them down as you</font>

1127
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:18,230
can see they're actually all<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know in</font>

1128
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:20,210
this case again to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> its coral</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1129
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:22,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">auto</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and very automated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1130
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:24,830
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop-down list and what that ends</font>

1131
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:26,750
up giving me is then this profile report

1132
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:29,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">where I've got some basic</font>

1133
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:31,880
transformations you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can expand this and</font>

1134
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:34,100
certainly we typically would you can see

1135
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:36,260
that can break it down by specific

1136
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:38,810
business lines<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can go even into</font>

1137
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:41,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">divisions and specific business systems</font>

1138
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:46,130
and start to get a view of what's out

1139
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:49,910
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> within my organization you ask</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NEC</font>

1140
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:51,770
so go out there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand them something</font>

1141
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:53,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">like this and say I can tell you across</font>

1142
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:55,820
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where highest risks are</font>

1143
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:58,790
from an application perspective from

1144
00:44:55,820 --> 00:45:04,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">security perspective this is a CISOs</font>

1145
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:07,100
dream<font color="#CCCCCC"> so again really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simple tool here</font>

1146
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:09,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">implementing something like this of your</font>

1147
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:10,990
own<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a great way to leverage what</font>

1148
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:13,630
we're doing in threat modeling

1149
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:16,089
to really enable us to take it to the

1150
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:19,600
next level and start to build that

1151
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:21,580
prioritization<font color="#CCCCCC"> like i said before from</font>

1152
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,319
here now you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see I've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a 05 which</font>

1153
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:24,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">is our highest risk all the way down as</font>

1154
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,170
well three

1155
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:28,240
now I can start attaching different

1156
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:30,610
levels of application security<font color="#CCCCCC"> rigor</font>

1157
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:32,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">different activities and perform based</font>

1158
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:43,960
on the risk level of these applications

1159
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:45,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">so with that um I'm going to wrap</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

1160
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">up because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we are getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down to the</font>

1161
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:49,090
end of time I just want to make sure

1162
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:51,850
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i left a few minutes here for any</font>

1163
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:58,420
questions if there are any<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

1164
00:45:51,850 --> 00:46:02,110
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my published a</font>

1165
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:05,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">template anywhere for which the the the</font>

1166
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:07,600
diagrams<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the tool the spreadsheet</font>

1167
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:11,470
no not at this point like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1168
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:12,790
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of more it's one idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> arm I it is</font>

1169
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:15,189
probably something I can share with you

1170
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:17,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">though if you want actually let me go</font>

1171
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:20,050
back to the top of put my email back up

1172
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:21,550
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys can contact me</font>

1173
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:24,369
I'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> to if there is a good way to</font>

1174
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:25,720
share it<font color="#CCCCCC"> arm because yeah I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1175
00:46:24,369 --> 00:46:27,190
would definitely be helpful something

1176
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:34,868
you can build off of

1177
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:35,740
so that's a good question<font color="#E5E5E5"> any other</font>

1178
00:46:34,869 --> 00:46:38,619
questions

1179

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right well you guys continue to</font>

road
