19
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,640
i'm here to talk to you a little bit

20
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:57,270
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> private account security and why</font>

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,309
we think that's so important and really

22
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,770
just how following good security

23
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:04,949
practices around managing your

24
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:08,250

25
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:10,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> key</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and how can you know prevent</font>

26
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,049
the bad guys from sneaking in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

29
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,140
it seems like more and more people are

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,030
becoming<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of more familiar with the</font>

31
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,350
concepts around<font color="#CCCCCC"> privileged account</font>

32
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,689

33
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,759
uphill battle<font color="#CCCCCC"> explaining what that is</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many of you in this room are</font>

challenges that we're addressing and and

37
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,310
why that is so important but today<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

149

that so many attackers are consistently

00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,920
in your environment and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're doing</font>

271
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,410
nothing but moving laterally<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,729
grabbing hashes of credentials and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

277
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:33,330

278
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,500
how do we address this so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's cyber are</font>

00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:37,050
privileged account security as<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

280
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,910
mentioned is really just all we do for a

00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:42,479
living that's it

282
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:44,610
so our mission is threefold<font color="#E5E5E5"> first part</font>

283
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,860
of the mission control<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to</font>

284
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:50,550
provide solutions<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you full</font>

285
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:53,100
control over your<font color="#CCCCCC"> private accounts so</font>

286
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:55,260
you decide exactly who gets access to

287
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,670
privileged accounts and when they get

288
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:59,340
access

289
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:02,160
what type of access they get<font color="#CCCCCC"> also you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have to show them the password to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">every account they have access to so do</font>

292
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,410
you allow the user to view the password

293
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,790
or do they just click a button<font color="#E5E5E5"> and once</font>

294
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:13,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">they have authenticated the solution</font>

entered for them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and actually makes it</font>

299
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:25,650
easier for them<font color="#E5E5E5"> but more secure at the</font>

300
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:27,030
same time you change passwords<font color="#CCCCCC"> after</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">each use maybe they do need to see the</font>

302

303
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:33,180
a password is going to be useless an

304
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:36,360
hour later so don't keep it on a sticky

305
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:39,000
note stuck to their monitor<font color="#E5E5E5"> and finally</font>

308
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:44,490
you could have even multiple levels

multiple tiers of approval if you want

00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:56,280

make sure that the account is being used

<font color="#CCCCCC">beyond detection let's actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set up</font>

proactive protection and an automatic

00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:38,550
detect that the attack is happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

352
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we can send a message over to the</font>

353
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,779

358
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:59,910
so this is what the attack cycle looks

359

like with cyber Ark in the picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,250
most comprehensive set of tools

405
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:07,790
available in the privileged account

406
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:09,500
security space today

407
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:13,040
so now there's a lot here<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font>

408
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:15,470
expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> organizations</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to boil the ocean</font>

409
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:18,349
and do everything at once<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font>

410
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:20,209
encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> a phased approach</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so i won't</font>

411
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:22,250
go individually through each aspect of

412
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:24,740
the solution but<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there at the bottom</font>

413
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,630
you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main reason i just want to</font>

414
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:29,690
show you this is because of an important

415
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:31,460
consideration when you're considering a

416
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:35,059
solution for privileged account security

417
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:38,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">again you don't want to do everything on</font>

418
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:39,530
day one and and you know you may want to

419
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:42,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">have all your passwords you may want to</font>

420
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:44,960
do session monitoring today<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font>

421
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:47,120
removing<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard-coded</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> passwords from</font>

422
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,280
applications is not part of your list

423
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">you of use cases today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it could be</font>

424
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,809
down the road<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we think that it makes</font>

425
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:55,520
sense to start with a solution that has

426
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:57,410
all the capabilities not just that you

427
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,480
need now that you may need in the future

428
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:02,420
so you're not piecing together a

429
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:08,450
solution from multiple vendors<font color="#E5E5E5"> later on</font>

430
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:10,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">so just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> takeaways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to leave</font>

431
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:13,640
you with what you actually need to do

432
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:14,928
now I'm step<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is identify you can</font>

433
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,330
schedule an hour with me

434
00:18:14,929 --> 00:18:18,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually we have a free tool and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can i</font>

435
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:21,740
can run through that with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do it</font>

436
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:24,139
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and it's called discovery</font>

437
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:26,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">and audit or or DNA four short so we do</font>

438
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:28,640
a DNA scan we can identify<font color="#E5E5E5"> just all</font>

439
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,750
those critical account details<font color="#CCCCCC"> where do</font>

440
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,090
they live

441
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:34,910
which ones are out of compliance<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

442
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:38,360
their vulnerabilities and in things that

443
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:41,120
we need to address

444
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:44,179
step<font color="#E5E5E5"> two is change</font>

445
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:47,239
so identify the critical platforms<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

446
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:49,610
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> low-hanging fruit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and quick wins and</font>

447
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,850
start getting those sensitive passwords

448
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:55,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">changed to unique complex and random</font>

449
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:56,750
values that are not you know an

450
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:58,400
administrator going through and giving

451
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,800
all your<font color="#E5E5E5"> root account</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same password</font>

452
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:06,230
and do that with the enterprise password

453
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:07,879
vault<font color="#CCCCCC"> step three is isolate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nail down</font>

454
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:10,430
your domain controllers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> any other</font>

455
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:13,429
juicy targets<font color="#E5E5E5"> your crown jewels if you</font>

456
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:14,990
will determine which systems are in

457
00:19:13,429 --> 00:19:17,150
scope for those audit requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

458
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:21,110
mention things like pci or socks<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

459
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:22,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">HIPAA and so forth and then determine</font>

460
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:24,379
which systems are going to be accessed

461
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:27,170
by those less trusted third parties

462
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:29,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything that falls into at least one of</font>

463
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:31,220
those three categories<font color="#E5E5E5"> really should be</font>

464
00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:33,710
isolated behind a secure jump server

465
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">that records all the sessions that take</font>

466
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:37,940
place on any of these targets

467
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:40,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> focused on nailing down those</font>

468
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,800
three areas and you can really just

469
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:45,050
breathe easier knowing that your

470
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:54,590
security posture<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been dramatically</font>

471
00:19:45,050 --> 00:20:01,210
and drastically improved any questions

472
00:19:54,590 --> 00:20:01,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks everyone</font>
