we get a little bit of compliance but

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,439
everybody knows that you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> red</font>

only part of the whole security solution

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,329
and we say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we got compliance</font>

45
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:36,600
pretty well down and now we're going to

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:39,210
expand our program<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we're going to</font>

47
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,939
create some new policies and we're gonna

scan more apps or we're gonna you know

49

do more education or basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

will never get you all the way the

security and we all know it but we all

build our<font color="#CCCCCC"> abstract</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> programs as though</font>

up with

difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you go from not terribly</font>

tapers off really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really quickly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font>

but you're not getting that much more

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:39,870
actual safety out of it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I kind of</font>

00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">focus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on not the fact that happens</font>

78
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,430
because we also agree that this is the

problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> good compliance oriented</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> apt</font>

80
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,140
programs don't work but we can't figure

81
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:53,010
out what to do until we figure out why

82
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:58,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">compliance doesn't get us there</font>

83
00:02:53,010 --> 00:03:01,709
yep

84
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,209
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this hypothetical graph</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

85
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:04,470
this is this is this is roughly how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

see the curves go when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've actually</font>

00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,810

95
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,179

99
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:33,298
that we try to boil everything down to a

key component of a proper<font color="#CCCCCC"> abstract</font>

103

that those advocates that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we let me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">alright that's a much bigger that's</font>

220
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,310
actually a much bigger risk then the

internally but we don't measure it that

225
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,369
way because we take averages we take we

the test and help you score well enough

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if you don't go back and figure out</font>

where you screwed up

308
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,640
just get the right answers the other one

309
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:54,490
is wait for your<font color="#CCCCCC"> coworker to do that and</font>

310
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,870
then give you the answer list because

00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">all we score them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is did you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> complete</font>

00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:40,370

<font color="#E5E5E5">hey we're thinking about doing this and</font>

404
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:07,250
here's our rationale behind doing this

<font color="#E5E5E5">house is going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and listen</font>

to what the developers have to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

407
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:12,830
comes to something that everybody can

agree on<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean come on how many</font>

00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,650
of you in this room<font color="#CCCCCC"> and classify</font>

themselves as<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hacker at least at</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">describe our whole industry as the</font>

of rules they have no understanding of

425
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:54,290
shocked that people don't actually do it

<font color="#E5E5E5">you know instead of sitting down and</font>

00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:58,069
telling them the story that they need to

hear which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey we have this real risk</font>

00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:01,850
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a thing that were worried about</font>

00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,810
an organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're worried about it</font>

431
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,150
too

432
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:07,459
we think this would be the solution what

433
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:10,490
do you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> workers works hundred</font>

434
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:12,650
percent better<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we also tend to</font>

435
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:14,030
forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people are individuals and</font>

436
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,800
not averages and this is kind of related

00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:18,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">to that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one-dimensional</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking that</font>

seen organizations that you know

441
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,910
I say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to look at each</font>

00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:32,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">to scan them with some kind of automated</font>

445
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:33,650
testing tool and we're going to find out

446

the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> laws four thousand lines</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">measure how well each application</font>

451
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:47,689
that seems like a great idea but then

452
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:50,359
we're going to score the developers on

453
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:52,220
that team based on how many

454
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:56,000
vulnerabilities they<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduced and</font>

00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:57,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">check into the code that does not work</font>

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,370
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> it makes people terrify the</font>

start cutting and pasting them<font color="#E5E5E5"> my score</font>

463
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,410
gonna be awesome

<font color="#CCCCCC">alright and you know the people people</font>

465
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:19,189
work in different ways and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

467
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:22,670
realized that this was a deeply flawed

00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:26,750
way to approach things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font>

down to things like a that game ability

471
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,970
and be that these<font color="#CCCCCC"> these people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are going</font>

472
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,500
but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> check-in more vulnerabilities</font>

473
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:39,530
because i'm working on much much harder

00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:41,510
problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> right you've got me doing</font>

and see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it goes in stage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know if</font>

this is somewhat related to the last

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,690
year which is building control systems

489
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:16,190
always argue that security especially

software security is really about

00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:20,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">software quality</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right just like</font>

performance and usability<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the things</font>

00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:26,030
that we care about<font color="#CCCCCC"> securities just one</font>

494
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,740
of those quality attributes and this is

495
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:30,590
a problem systemic to software

496
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,330
development is we all say<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean if you</font>

things like oh well if we actually scan

everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we look really bad but</font>
