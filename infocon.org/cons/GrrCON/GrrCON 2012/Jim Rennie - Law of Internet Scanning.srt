1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:06,690

welcome everyone if you're here to learn
about the lawyer in the right place

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,550
my name's Jim

and this is legal issues about
internet-connected device skinning

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,550
alright is the boring side

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,980
a so my bio very briefly if you care

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,370
I am an attorney attorney for five years
I spent three years

9
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,430
doing criminal law as public defender

10
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,760
and then after that it moved on to

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,590
doing internet privacy law in san Cisco
trustee

12
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,469
past two years and before law school
which is long time ago now

13
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:52,579
I was a developer but that was a long
time ago so don't ask me develop

14
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:53,489
anything anymore

15
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:58,010
but I am here today to talk with the law
and just to educate you

16
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:02,180
on the basics now course I'm attorneys
that means there's a disclaimer

17
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,479
after say even though I'm talking about
the law

18
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:09,820
please don't use this as legal advice
I'm no substitute for

19
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,670
specific information on your own
personal situation

20
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,670
don't go into court and say I heard this
guy Garcon

21
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,280
he told me this that will go badly said

22
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,009
your this is only an hour long it only
covers the basics

23
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:28,600
laws always about one person's
particular situation

24
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,680
every little fact make a difference so
you can substitute this for real legal

25
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,380
advice

26
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,070
but hope it gives you the basics in
understanding

27
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,590
law alright first

28
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,610
what do I mean when I say
internet-connected device getting when

29
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,030
we're talking about you probably

30
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,610
know what I mean just are on the same
page I mean if you doing research about

31
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:54,689
anything connected to the Internet
whether it's a computer or a phone or a

32
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:57,920
home appliance thats interconnected
whatever

33
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,159
some things out there on the internet
and you want to learn more about that

34
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:01,829
device

35
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:05,579
there's a couple ways Michael about that
you might

36
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,979
try to log into the machine or access it
directly

37
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:13,420
that's one way love confiscating advice
are learning more about it

38
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,000
or you might look at the traffic that's
going to or from

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,270
the device both those situations I'm
gonna cover today

40
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:25,030
there's laws about both of those and
that's when the butter in a connected

41
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,750
device

42
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,940
scanning so why am I getting the stock

43
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,349
was the why did side to fire going to
talk

44
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:37,099
um about a year ago a friend of mine in
Brandon

45
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:41,040
worse the stones I love you might know
he

46
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,180
was doing some personal research he
works for Scott to research company but

47
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,260
yes I project

48
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,209
a came to me ask me you know what I
wanna do

49
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:54,170
is I want to scan all across the
Internet for certain

50
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,260
I'm small home office devices

51
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,450
their internet-connected have work are
now known as for every day

52
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:05,680
exploits basically the vendors we small
devices

53
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,430
you know the the vendors themselves are
quite small not the biggies like Cisco

54
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,180
they have they know their exploits
available for these devices

55
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,900
and they've stay out said we're never
gonna patch these exports

56
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,290
they're just can be vulnerable forever
because you can't be bothered to patch

57
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:20,780
them

58
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,769
or it's just not possible for us to
patch them we're not gonna do it so he

59
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:25,739
was wondering well

60
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,370
how many of those devices are actually
out there like what's the number

61
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:34,060
love people who are vulnerable you know
what kinda place those devices

62
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,930
and they're supposed to be in homes
first offices we nor the larger

63
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,849
industrial areas and larger companies
you know what

64
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:47,709
what's cope with this problem so you can
even ask me it was there any

65
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:52,799
is republic that can I just scanned for
these devices what are there any legal

66
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:53,950
issues in my safe

67
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:58,590
Greg in trouble for doing this and so
you know i'd

68
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,970
I gave em the basics I'm gonna give all
view about the law

69
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,989
so that he could make a smart decision
about

70
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:09,250
what kind of research was gonna do and
what he's gonna tell the world about his

71
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,299
research as well

72
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:13,299
it's one thing to

73
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:17,259
know the law is nothing to break the law
and the third thing to then run around

74
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:19,799
tell tell everyone the broken the law

75
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:23,100
so that's why given the stock

76
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,139
I also give the stock at Park on

77
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:31,150
back in April and I i was as today I was
earlier on in the day

78
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,790
and I went back to that speak area and
another guy come up to me is like I'm a

79
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,449
speaker to

80
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:39,460
unit we introduce each other he said hes
saw your talk

81
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,090
so I'm giving a talk in a couple hours
and based on your talk to change one of

82
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,360
my slides

83
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,570
my talk I said some things maybe I
shouldn't have

84
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:53,090
and said thanks for giving your talk
size agree I'm glad I made a difference

85
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:53,370
%uh

86
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,490
so you know hopefully if there's one
person out there

87
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:01,560
who learn something that they can use to
protect themselves today

88
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,270
I've done my job here that's that's on
trying to do

89
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,520
why am I not getting the stock I'm not
giving his talk in order to scare

90
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,660
anybody

91
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,960
I'm not gonna start to make anyone think
oh my god gonna be arrested

92
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,169
the fed income for me because we're done
or something and play and do it

93
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:21,740
I'm not trying to scare anybody I'm not
trying to say that you should

94
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:26,440
do anything that you shouldn't
researcher you shouldn't

95
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,220
you know poke around the internet you
that you shouldn't be curious

96
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,729
I'm just getting information so you can
make smart choices when you do

97
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:37,389
to research a look around on the
internet

98
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:41,590
so do not be worried about anything

99
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,740
bottom line is you should just be aware
of the law

100
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,850
and you know I think in our community
impact community

101
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,400
there needs to be more awareness about
what the law says so that we can make

102
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,930
smart choices

103
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:58,610
known was end up in prison no one wants
to

104
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,419
be in the press with people you know get
arrested have your name out there

105
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:04,380
someone who's been arrested for

106
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,780
by the computer crime laws and some

107
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:11,539
some cases it can be good and have been
good a good press but no cases Canada

108
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:12,270
badly

109
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:19,270
so we just saw need to be aware above
the law

110
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,380
some covering to aspect today both civil
and criminal law

111
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,110
I'm you spend most of the time on
criminal law

112
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,080
for a couple reasons one it slid more
exciting

113
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,190
I'm but to it's more definite

114
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:40,250
in criminal law you have to lay out you
know definite code of conduct

115
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,960
civil laws much more nebulous and it's
harder for me to give advice about

116
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,130
civil law with out again give you legal
advice and knowing your particular

117
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,090
situation

118
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,280
so we are going to cover both civil as
me more like general tips

119
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,099
on what to do what not to do but we talk
in depth

120
00:06:56,099 --> 00:07:02,590
about a couple different criminal laws
out there

121
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,860
alright the main criminal law we're
talking about today

122
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:10,190
is the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act for
CFA and a

123
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,539
this is the main federal law the covers

124
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:16,830
computer crimes and has been with us for
a long time now

125
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:20,830
congress actually passed this for the
first time back in the early eighties

126
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,190
and has amended at five or six times
since then

127
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,710
and will continue to amend as we move
forward it was passed by early

128
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:32,490
so you know before the Internet was even
really if things law

129
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:38,870
existed it was quite proactive at the
time when Congress passed it

130
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:42,360
you know it's its head you know having
said that

131
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,360
this is congress were talking about so
as you'll see

132
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,220
it's not perfect um Congress doesn't get

133
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,490
computers constantly get the Internet as
we all know the continued try to pass

134
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,080
ridiculous laws like

135
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,250
so but paper on other things a

136
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,840
so you know having said that at the time
in the past this they really were

137
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:08,000
for thinking um so when congress passed
the law

138
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,990
they're trying to prevent people from
using from accessing cues in certain

139
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,080
ways

140
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,500
here's the main tax to the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act its basic basic form

141
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,090
when the first passed it and if you're
following along at home with eighteen US

142
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,900
10:30 you can look it up later

143
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:27,099
alright there's a lotta love language
here unpack it

144
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:31,220
but the law says is a crime to
intentionally

145
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,800
access a protected computer without
authorization

146
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,010
or exceeding authorized access and

147
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:42,080
doing one of the following items

148
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,470
first evolved foreseen it knows is that
this is intentional

149
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,300
you cannot accidentally become a
criminal

150
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,810
for this law if you accidentally

151
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:56,410
act as if you weren't supposed to it's
fine you can review this is only about

152
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,570
intentionally

153
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:02,019
this is you going on purpose to access a
computer

154
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:05,910
and you have to do one of the following:
special things this is the Harvard Law

155
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:09,250
you have to not only access the pure
that authorization you have to have

156
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,839
intent to defraud or extort someone

157
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:16,690
you have to be trying to get password so
that you can

158
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:20,160
traffic in those passwords stored
passwords yet to try to obtain US

159
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,220
government secrets

160
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:27,360
or data or USB trying to cause physical
injury or threat to the public

161
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,040
so I think we can agree these are all
for the most part bad things

162
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,959
we don't people running around trying to
commit fraud we want people stealing our

163
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,450
password files and then selling access
to our

164
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,769
email account or something and
government secrets maybe we can debate

165
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:41,720
about whether that's

166
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,430
such a bad deal but in general there
might be some secrets you want the

167
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,680
government to keep

168
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,260
and we don't want anyone causing
physical injury it's obvious

169
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,680
know what's protected computer law says

170
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,760
US government computers and again you
can debate about well

171
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,000
are are all government computers really
deserving special protection

172
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,890
no really care if the nasa web server
goes down as much we care about

173
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:09,630
no air traffic control computers maybe
not but

174
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,430
they decide to protect all US government
computers right to reasonable

175
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,630
and they protect computers or financial
institution computers

176
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,730
we don't want people hacking your bank
accounts is doing a our money

177
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,060
okay so far all this is pretty
reasonable

178
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:27,230
congress did a good job accept this
isn't the whole law

179
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:31,610
members the US congress talking about
they couldn't stop here

180
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,490
and just say hey that's not a bad law
look for protecting people from computer

181
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,070
crime

182
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:39,220
no no no no no this is congress they
screwed up

183
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:45,899
nate is how they screwed up they added
two more things

184
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:50,200
first evolved he said that on the list
the bad things you have to do to violate

185
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,899
the law

186
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:54,550
they had this cute line obtain any
information

187
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,610
from any protected computer

188
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:01,250
awesome so instead of committing fraud

189
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,930
or stealing passwords its any
information

190
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,930
anything Lake

191
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,240
the version of the operating system
that's information

192
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,730
it is so they've now the brunt it to
cover

193
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,680
anything you could possibly learn from a
computer great

194
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,579
well at least it's only from protect
computers right so it's all US

195
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:22,260
government

196
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,850
computer financial tutions new

197
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:30,440
its any computer that communicates over
state lines

198
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,279
in other words any computer connected to
the internet

199
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:38,320
awesome thanks congress good job

200
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,290
so we go from like a nearly scope law

201
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:45,870
that actually protects us against bad
things 21 that now covers basically

202
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,000
anything in the world

203
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,360
and any computer in the world

204
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,430
so what are we left with to argue about

205
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,680
way if obtaining any information from
any computer is a crime

206
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,660
than me checking my emails a crime this
doesn't make sense well we're left with

207
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,930
these how it freezes here without
authorization

208
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:11,570
or exceeding authorized access you know
they brought it so much that now

209
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:17,440
those two phrases are the only ones
really care about

210
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,790
you know you might ask actually was
attending any information why we also

211
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,149
have the list other prohibit activities

212
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:26,320
the answer is punishments are greater if
you do one or the other

213
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,829
listed things but now they've kept quite
broad

214
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:33,589
so when the if when you think about this
yet to think about

215
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:36,500
you can basically ignore the bereaved
activities unless you're actually doing

216
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,029
one of those in which case maybe should
be a little scared

217
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:42,660
but if you just scanning in a devices
you really need to worry about

218
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,360
doing it without authorization or
exceeding

219
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,420
authorize access

220
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,570
and really those are two versions of the
same idea

221
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:57,769
I'm unauthorized access means access to
that

222
00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:01,380
machine or service and exceeding access
means

223
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,899
you know you up seen 34 but you have the
right to be on a certain machine are you

224
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:07,019
certain service

225
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,550
but you you some sort exporter attack

226
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:14,420
escalate your privileges and gain access
to information you weren't supposed to

227
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,029
have

228
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:21,209
and these concepts are important because
not only are the basis for the CFA day

229
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:24,370
remember I said this is passed back in
the early eighties back before any the

230
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,510
state's

231
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:29,029
really doing anything in this area so
pretty much every state

232
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:34,440
has used the same concepts to create
their own state laws as well

233
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,480
so in learning about the federal law
today also learn

234
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,380
about state law and we're going to a
little bit stale or later

235
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,170
but you know because if it was at the
forefront of computer crimes law

236
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:49,389
it's also really important to know these
concepts for state law as well

237
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:53,180
I put my laws there I'm Nevada up there
because that's where license as an

238
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,079
attorney

239
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,610
and Massachusetts access very
interesting law where they say

240
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,990
they go into more detail than most
states do other computer laws

241
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:05,160
and they say if there's someth service
or

242
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,410
a computer where there's a password
prompt where you are prompted for a

243
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,690
password and you somehow you paid

244
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:14,120
putting a password you are

245
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,740
that is unauthorized access under the
law so they're very specifically

246
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:22,350
not saying other kinds taxes are can be
unauthorized saying specifically

247
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:25,389
if you somehow evaded entering a
password when you're supposed to be at

248
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:28,589
unauthorized access and I think that's a
pretty fair statement

249
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:31,680
you have other states the federal I
don't spell that out if

250
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,639
you know if you are somehow managing
access to something without putting a

251
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,250
password when you're supposed to

252
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,490
Anna you know you may want to think
about

253
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:44,920
maybe not doing that or he's not telling
a much belated

254
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,490
and then at that euro I have the bottom
of the list of all the state's laws

255
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:52,760
I'm gonna put up Michigan's later but if
you from a different state that's a good

256
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,209
place to check a

257
00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:59,519
and finally the scary part it is a
felony

258
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,540
you could spend from one to 20 years in
federal prison depending on how much

259
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,889
they don't like you

260
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:08,160
you could get find much money and I'll
basically be bad

261
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,139
but I'm trying to scare people today
okay so

262
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:16,100
tell you what the law is is fine we can
all read the law

263
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,470
maybe you can it maybe you understand
the law on the defect understand the law

264
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:23,560
we're gonna do is we're gonna go three
series love hypothetical questions

265
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,889
or scenarios there somewhere real life
but hopefully help you understand with

266
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:28,220
the law

267
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:33,630
really means you know where the rubber
hits the road here

268
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:37,320
is kinda the same method they use law
school which by the way

269
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,769
you know lucky you didn't have to go I
went so you didn't have to

270
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:45,769
yeah but I this is the same as we do you
live hypothetical situations

271
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:49,339
you know what people stories try to
figure out

272
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:53,370
the law and understand what it really
means in real life

273
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:58,290
alright example one Alice knows is that
your neighbor Bob easing into tell

274
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,790
grounder

275
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,829
out as a quick search in fines but
default password for the router is

276
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:04,009
password

277
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:09,199
and decides to check if bob other teams
default or not

278
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,820
and if he hasn't then she plans to warn
him about

279
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:18,259
a unit change default password as you
know you about hackers could come in

280
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:21,820
on your I am so she doesn't

281
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,110
you know she tests and find the bob has
in fact the default password she's able

282
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,570
to get into the network

283
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,889
but is that a morning bob she forgets
about it she goes get

284
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:34,759
goes get lunch instead never tells bob
anything & default patterns left

285
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:38,209
is this problem

286
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:41,540
yes with it is a problem

287
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:46,130
um Alice doesn't is not authorized to
use

288
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:50,639
bob's network there's a passive there is
a password in place to access this

289
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,170
router

290
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:56,440
now some people say well wait a minute
but it's the default password

291
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,480
she ate else actually knows what the
password is

292
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,490
she news any shenanigans to get the
password there's no you know

293
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,220
attack using some kind of code is a
brute force going on she just knows she

294
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,010
actually knows what the password is

295
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:13,620
does not mean she's authorized no

296
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,720
she is not authorized bobby knight's
eight hours yes

297
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,549
you can log into my network she has no
business using this network

298
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:24,100
even though it's a default password so

299
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,679
I mean look if you if you get caught for
this and your def in your only defense

300
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,340
is wealthy for password so I felt like I
have permission fine role of that

301
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,410
but realistically I wouldn't if that's
not a great defense stuff

302
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,960
don't be yourself that you know that
defense

303
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,429
um now I've other ask up other questions
whether she actually remembers to warn

304
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:46,230
Bob

305
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:50,809
that doesn't really make a difference
the CFAA doesn't care

306
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:55,830
if you're a good person they don't care
if you're doing academic research

307
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:59,090
sex doesn't care if you're white hat and
a black hat

308
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:02,460
doesn't have exceptions for any of this
it's very black-and-white

309
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,179
if you do this thing it's a crime now
realistically

310
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:10,460
you know else goes and tells bob this
the fed's been knocked down

311
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,789
else's door and arrester no course not
silly but

312
00:18:13,789 --> 00:18:17,419
as for the laws concerned her intentions
don't matter

313
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:22,110
her motive doesn't matter what matters
is that she intentionally access the

314
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,020
router

315
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,559
without authorization and access the
network

316
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,410
now what else do something worse since
you logged networking and screws around

317
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,190
with it

318
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:34,250
in breaks partner occurs you know on
this computer is whatever

319
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:38,910
we ask that makes it worse it's probably

320
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,630
but again doesn't make any difference as
far as actually violating the law to

321
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,840
make a difference as far as how alice is
punished

322
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:50,840
under the law but not in whether or not
the laws violate

323
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:58,340
was at

324
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:05,340
it it is bob showing the match interface

325
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:22,840
now the question is if bob is saying the
management or face

326
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,940
online isn't he basically

327
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,429
inviting other people there I think the
analogy goes to

328
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:32,239
if you leave the door to your house open
are you inviting people to come take

329
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:33,009
your stuff

330
00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:37,659
and the answer is No 'em is bob stupid
maybe

331
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:40,719
but should again the laws and characters

332
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:44,539
if the victim is stupid lockers but what
else is doing so

333
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:48,899
a.m. no it does not make a difference if
bob should have taken better security

334
00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:49,719
precautions

335
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:53,629
maybe Italy matters what else is doing
this case

336
00:19:53,629 --> 00:19:57,539
example number two

337
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:03,320
else's job she has access to a company's
payroll system but only for the purpose

338
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,489
ordering reimbursement checks for other
employees not for any other purpose

339
00:20:07,489 --> 00:20:11,739
however her boss goes to lunch indices
you decide to one over her bosses

340
00:20:11,739 --> 00:20:12,679
computer

341
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:16,580
and her boss as administrator rights and
she checks out

342
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:20,859
all her co worker salaries and course
tells or coworkers what the difference

343
00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:21,469
hours are

344
00:20:21,469 --> 00:20:25,249
is making what you know start the whole
as much drama at work

345
00:20:25,249 --> 00:20:28,269
now for once was gonna get fired

346
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:33,059
but to is seen legal trouble too well
yeah possibly

347
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:37,609
and this goes back to the not
unauthorized access

348
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:40,849
because hours has permission to be on
the payroll system

349
00:20:40,849 --> 00:20:44,529
she has her own access to that says our
own login

350
00:20:44,529 --> 00:20:48,450
but in this case seized does not have

351
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:53,559
the right to be administrator you know
she's exceeding authorized access

352
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:58,639
she's looking at things is not supposed
to look at so in this case you could be

353
00:20:58,639 --> 00:20:59,729
in legal trouble as well

354
00:20:59,729 --> 00:21:06,729
it's hard copy examples for others
access are really obvious yes

355
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,519
alright so the question is basically

356
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:54,220
if you log into a system and there's
either a better message or maybe even in

357
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,809
the Terms of Service somewhere

358
00:21:55,809 --> 00:21:59,879
it says by using you know as parties in
this system you agree not to do

359
00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:04,409
axe on system you know you agree not to
access this at home

360
00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:08,279
something like that does that do any
good legally

361
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:13,450
I think it does good as far as cutting
off your access like if the company or

362
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:13,999
service

363
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,610
says okay you violate the Terms of
Service the ban message were coming off

364
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,669
track says goodbye

365
00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:23,019
I think that is good for them but what
we don't want to get into

366
00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:26,049
is making violation %uh Terms of Service
a crime

367
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:29,220
which if you remember the case your

368
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,379
that were due for Facebook they're
trying to make

369
00:22:32,379 --> 00:22:36,369
argument that by filing facebook terms
of service/use filing with the FAA

370
00:22:36,369 --> 00:22:40,240
because she was exceeding her access cuz
you doing something against the Terms of

371
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:40,899
Service

372
00:22:40,899 --> 00:22:44,990
that's a whole big can of worms and if f
is fighting the fight

373
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:48,529
to make sure that does not happen you
know we don't want

374
00:22:48,529 --> 00:22:53,259
you know if I share my friend stuff on
Facebook in a way they don't like I

375
00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:55,669
don't want that pic federal crime that
makes no sense at all

376
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:58,669
I don't think that's going to happen
I'll I the courts

377
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:03,129
the courts don't want everybody coming
into beer

378
00:23:03,129 --> 00:23:07,860
getting arrested for fighting Terms of
Service unauthorized access

379
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,440
and see if it a you know really means

380
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,350
like case like this where there's a
clear delineation you know you're not

381
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,629
supposed to look at something and you
going to anyway

382
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:21,320
again has to be intentional and CFA as
well you can't if you accidentally

383
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,999
if a programmer stirs up design
interface and you access accidentally

384
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:26,080
stumble onto

385
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,490
administrator privileges you know that's
not a crime you have to be intending to

386
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:30,960
go

387
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:37,960
access parts the system the you know
it's was BS

388
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,070
so the question is okay so in this case
the company

389
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:54,430
say call calls the police and says Alice
to this thing who decides whether she

390
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,290
gets prosecuted in the answer is

391
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:59,610
the district attorney or the

392
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:04,130
recalled assistant US Attorney you know
the government prosecutors decide

393
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,380
the company doesn't really have a say in
whether someone is prosecuted for a

394
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:07,940
crime

395
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,780
under civil liability the Indian company
cialis cialis

396
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,090
they can complain to make noise to a
prosecutor

397
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:19,120
but it's the prosecutor's job to decide
who gets charged with what

398
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,950
and I think especially in federal system
federal prosecutors

399
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:27,960
they're not interested in small time
stuff like this

400
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,059
they'd be like yeah whatever you know
she got fired we lost unless you really

401
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:32,510
wet

402
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:39,510
you know if she took a relief are yet to
come after by is the company obligated

403
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,790
to report this

404
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:47,990
um I'm to give you our answer it depends

405
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:52,640
because states have work all data breach
notification requirements

406
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,890
which basically says that if your
customers data gets stolen error

407
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:00,970
it could have been stolen you may have
an obligation to report

408
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:05,600
but there's no federal data breach
notification requirement it's different

409
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,470
in every state

410
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:10,760
as I don't wanna say yes or no because
really does depend on the situation in

411
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,610
on the state your

412
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:15,860
up here's michigan's law

413
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:20,650
really quick again if you want to follow
with 750 2.79 5

414
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:24,550
and not gonna read it into much detail
but you can just see

415
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,550
it basically tracks with the FAA

416
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:31,910
in this is common for all states Bay
pretty much copy the CFA

417
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:35,920
language directly about unauthorized
access or exceeding access

418
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,240
other

419
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,740
at I will know the michigan's
punishments are actually pretty harsh

420
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:47,440
from most states that i've seen up to
five years

421
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,400
or 10 years if you do it more than once
although if you do if you get caught go

422
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,290
to prison

423
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:56,890
come out do it again a No

424
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:01,470
so here's another example and brings up
some new issues so now Alice wants

425
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,370
revenge against Chris for being fired

426
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:07,350
spaced of so from her home in Michigan

427
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:11,220
houses else legally access the server
located in New York

428
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:16,630
which has some personal data Chris's and
steals it in or to blackmail Chris

429
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:20,220
Chris lives in California now

430
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,240
I'm not asking else did something bad
because yes italy did

431
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,290
a you know you can't you can still

432
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:30,590
you can talk hack into a computer skills
them to blackmail someone

433
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:34,320
I think it's not a crime that a crime
but where is she in trouble

434
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,410
is the question what what states and/or
work for the government

435
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:46,410
is going to matter with

436
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:51,500
federal for here to New York City
Federals right the answer is

437
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:56,860
definitely New York will be mad because
that's where the data was sitting

438
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:01,270
michigan might be mad because that's
where alice is

439
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:06,690
California probably not because there's
no data your server anything that was

440
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,470
accessed in California you know Chris

441
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:11,990
is the victim in this case not gonna be
in trouble there

442
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:17,340
and also federal as well because a
crossing state lines or access the data

443
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:22,640
that brings up the federal law so I say
Michigan maybe

444
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,740
realistically New York is probably going
to the one his most upset about

445
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,510
situation because that's where the
service with data City

446
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:32,120
now hours can get in trouble

447
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,940
both in New York and under the federal
system

448
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:40,570
that is not double jeopardy and it has
to do with the

449
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:44,330
fun legal doctrine known as the two
sovereigns doctrine which basically says

450
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,850
that it is not double jeopardy if a
different state or jurisdiction charges

451
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:48,300
you

452
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:52,330
the same crime it's on double jeopardy
if say Lake

453
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:56,560
she gets tries once in Michigan goes to
jail loss until the charger again for

454
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,450
the same act

455
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:01,500
that's double jeopardy you can't do that
but you can get in trouble both

456
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,510
in the state and under federal law for
the exact same at

457
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:08,890
the way it works in real life usually

458
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:13,220
is that unless the really don't like you
for some reason the pic 1

459
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:17,280
like you still come get you or the
federal come get you and then even if

460
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,210
both come get you those questions about

461
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:24,590
how you be punished except for a but you
can get pub punished by more than one

462
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:31,590
jurisdiction right

463
00:28:36,879 --> 00:28:40,450
so that was the FAA that's when you
access the machine directly

464
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:43,490
or exceed your authors access

465
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:48,429
now on talk about wiretapping you know
when you hear the term wiretapping

466
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:51,559
you can get this romantic notion of
someone up on like

467
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:54,679
the telephone poll the late lineman's
handset

468
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:58,399
listening in on calls Andrew that's
exactly what those laws intended to

469
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,139
prevent is passed back in the sixties

470
00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:05,399
but it has grown to cover a lot of
online activity as well

471
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:08,740
now %uh

472
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,970
basically it illegal to intercept any
communication in transit without

473
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:12,820
permission

474
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:16,039
how much permission you need various

475
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:19,460
under the federal law and in most states

476
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:24,470
you only need one party permission one
part the communication has to give you

477
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:25,100
permission

478
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:29,440
for you too intercept communications not
get in trouble

479
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,889
ins a few states you have to have

480
00:29:33,889 --> 00:29:38,529
all parties permission all parties to
communication must give you permission

481
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:43,179
for you to be able to intercept and
those all-party States

482
00:29:43,179 --> 00:29:47,369
some other the Big Sur California wash
in about a

483
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:51,210
and Michigan michigan is an all-party
state you have to permission from

484
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:51,999
everybody

485
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:55,179
his party communication before he can
intercept

486
00:29:55,179 --> 00:30:02,179
question is is that the same thing as
recording the conversation

487
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:06,409
um yes in that I guess

488
00:30:06,409 --> 00:30:10,749
if you intercepted it but never did
anything with it then no one would know

489
00:30:10,749 --> 00:30:17,749
up to the question is

490
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:26,889
if you're in Michigan and you record
your own phone conversation and don't

491
00:30:26,889 --> 00:30:27,809
tell the other person

492
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:31,240
is that possibly filing the law I think
the answer problem

493
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,230
yes there's the possibility because is
an all-party state you're supposed to

494
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:37,830
get permission from everybody cuz

495
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:41,710
there's not a big distinction between
britain where you intercept

496
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:45,090
like your intercepting and and point

497
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:48,409
but that still wiretapping yes

498
00:30:48,409 --> 00:30:53,519
up

499
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,610
the questions is permission or
notification it's supposed to be

500
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:57,480
permission

501
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,629
but as we all know if you recall the
call center

502
00:31:00,629 --> 00:31:03,830
the failed a message that said this
comic the record it better serve you

503
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:04,669
Bubba

504
00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:09,070
it's implied permission because
basically saying if you don't want to be

505
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:09,860
quoted you can

506
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:13,639
feel free to hang up now so

507
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:18,309
yet in real life it kinda notification
but the legal standard is permission

508
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:21,450
how I think you have a hard time going
and say oh I didn't know that to be the

509
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,409
only people who call to be like well
there's this

510
00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:29,549
audio notice that this is going to
happen there is an important exception

511
00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:32,539
if you member the CFAA didn't have any
good exceptions

512
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:36,460
there's no exceptions for being a
security researcher anything like that

513
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,690
but under wiretapping

514
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:42,039
there is a really and the exception if
you are the one running

515
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:46,119
the network for the service you are
allowed to look at traffic in order to

516
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:46,940
maintain

517
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:50,940
the service itself in the security
around that service

518
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:55,320
so they succumb to play for a lot of you
when it comes to work

519
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:00,690
and monitoring your own networks as long
as using fraudulent purpose

520
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:04,460
let's go through some examples because
again

521
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:09,559
this is all very vague with girls are
some examples right since now houses out

522
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:10,230
of a job

523
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:13,740
see a fight from last one sites learn
more about the internet install

524
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,179
Wireshark on her computer

525
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:19,539
and at home she activates the program
records against message conversation

526
00:32:19,539 --> 00:32:21,269
between herself and a friend Dave

527
00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:26,240
she does not estates permission goes
back to the question a tougher

528
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,830
2000 trouble it depends

529
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:34,289
in a one-party state she's not in
trouble

530
00:32:34,289 --> 00:32:37,799
others is not asking one permission she
has permission

531
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:41,169
from herself to record your own
conversation we would imagine unless

532
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:41,669
there's some

533
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:45,330
you know movie style split personality
shenanigans going on here

534
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:49,519
she give yourself permission to record
so in a one-party state this is fine you

535
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,960
can record a conversation without a
problem but

536
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,109
an all-party state like Michigan other
the problem here

537
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:01,429
because she's not have all parties
permission to record everything

538
00:33:01,429 --> 00:33:05,009
or exam the conversation

539
00:33:05,009 --> 00:33:11,179
yes

540
00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:15,100
if you

541
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,600
yes alright so what if you're in a
facebook chat you just copy paste the

542
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,090
chat

543
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:23,309
I think you have it in this kit does get
back to some semantic late October

544
00:33:23,309 --> 00:33:25,990
recording it and point I think you can
get

545
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:30,690
you actually probably could do that
because wiretapping is only during

546
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:31,590
transmission

547
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:36,570
and you do that I don't get into too
much but there's a whole quagmire in

548
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:37,539
federal law about

549
00:33:37,539 --> 00:33:41,070
wet weather some things in transmission
or whether it's at rest it makes a big

550
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,480
difference for a lot different laws

551
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,610
crimes laws and it's one of those things
where I want to like a

552
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:49,720
legal conference about that we basically
talked about that issue for like eight

553
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,330
hours in the answer was who knows

554
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:54,870
or the answer was it's really
complicated and it takes like specials

555
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:55,299
lawyers

556
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:58,600
going into that but know if

557
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,289
what the transmission is done then
there's a more wiretapping

558
00:34:02,289 --> 00:34:08,379
I think for phone the kind of States
transmitting for mostly the whole way

559
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:14,250
but for Facebook Chat know if you copy
paste out the window I don't think that

560
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,070
would be considered

561
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:22,070
that but not legal advice indeed

562
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,290
most IM clients will offer the
opportunity to archive conversations

563
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:35,399
again

564
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:39,570
just because this may technically be
legal to be the feds are gonna be a lake

565
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:44,159
up you for you copy/paste the Facebook
chat

566
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,260
going down that yep

567
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:54,179
example ever to Alice love this whole
pack capturing things great

568
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:59,030
if I can with all sorts people's
conversations house decides to go to

569
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,320
local coffee shop

570
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,670
and see what's being sent over the
unsecured wifi at at the coffee shop

571
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:08,480
nothing anyone in this room has ever
done that %uh

572
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,200
in the process you can record the
conversation with a friend Dave but she

573
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,280
also intercepts

574
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,240
someone else's I'm conversation between
Allen and Frank against a course in

575
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,730
asking permission to do this

576
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:23,450
you see in trouble well

577
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:26,980
it seemed kinda obvious we already went
over the point Dave so

578
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,580
maybe maybe not it seems pretty obvious
that the conversation between

579
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:33,780
ellen frank she does know these people
she's reading with their writing to

580
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,560
other over the Internet

581
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,680
it seems like good wiretapping with
anyone else do you need

582
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,390
but there's a court case just last month

583
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:44,480
and unfortunately you are I'll give the
way that punchline where

584
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,380
um there's court case just last month in
Illinois alas

585
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,210
what the judge said at

586
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:56,540
because it was an open WiFi network
because it wasn't secured

587
00:35:56,540 --> 00:36:00,589
there is no wiretapping here if it's
over WiFi network

588
00:36:00,589 --> 00:36:03,140
it means that the same things going on
the most read into shouting a

589
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:03,930
conversation

590
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:08,210
everyone thinks that was a stupid
decision

591
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:12,380
with Nick and also goes against others
at

592
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:15,589
a court case %uh the 9th circuit which
is the California area

593
00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:20,470
for the courts upheld the opposite they
said no even if its unsecured wifi can't

594
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:24,900
that doesn't give you license just a
recording everything on it so

595
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,900
both cases are being appealed so I don't
have a great answer

596
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:32,190
I don't think it's open season on oil I
can run over there and start recording

597
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,089
everyone's life I'd like green ones

598
00:36:34,089 --> 00:36:37,760
II no I would not recommend that

599
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,839
or if you do that don't tell everybody
you doing that

600
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:47,430
but a so you know the law is still in a
state of flux which is little silly now

601
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:50,660
like how long we had computers now hong
hasn't existed in we still

602
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:54,190
the lost a leg we don't know etc

603
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:58,060
and it gets you know up with me
replacement for trying to guide you

604
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:01,420
at the same time the courts do silly
things like say yeah

605
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:05,550
listenin the WiFi networks whatever with
so but thats

606
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:09,470
you know I think it's clear okay in an
all-party state clearly

607
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:13,369
I don't think she's doing a good job
here I would not recommend running on

608
00:37:13,369 --> 00:37:15,290
cops ups and listening to people
conversation

609
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:18,710
but the court said

610
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:25,710
you to question the guilt trip before
yes

611
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:48,950
so how did turn the service type things
affect the Galletti

612
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:52,490
respect to wiretapping I think they have
a greater effect for wiretapping

613
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:55,590
because it goes back to me right now if
we have this long tradition

614
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:59,990
love we call the call center they tell
you a recorded conversation the normal

615
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,770
weight for you respond if that's okay or
not

616
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:05,710
a.m. so it may work better for
wiretapping

617
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:09,160
and remember whoever's running the
service

618
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:14,040
has a certain degree has some latitude
in listening to conversations to

619
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:21,040
protector on our as well

620
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:31,500
yes

621
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:37,540
isometric question going back to see if
a present

622
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:42,200
so it if the router if I also try to log
in above router

623
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,380
and there is no password all its just
hope it is that okay

624
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:51,680
at still say probably not OK because
again soon after mission to access

625
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,840
the router gymnast Bob Baker Lexus
rather will be harder for

626
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,030
them to show that there is no permission
may be you know

627
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:03,270
you there's nothing more I can still
make when there's no password protection

628
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:05,280
at all said in open service to the world

629
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,020
yeah you have pretty good defenses are
the fed's gonna really want take you

630
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:09,910
down for that

631
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:13,910
spend the time and effort I mean not
that

632
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:19,120
but that does the panel on the
particular situation as well know for

633
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,150
the service that's being presented to
the public on purpose for SES is a

634
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,350
service that

635
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:30,350
you know accidentally left open yes

636
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:42,339
up yes so if you're monitoring things

637
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:46,819
nor its to because your obligations
under hipper

638
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:51,259
tomorrow certain things I mean if if the
federal law in your lawyer says response

639
00:39:51,259 --> 00:39:51,950
to do it

640
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:54,989
that which do it for yet

641
00:39:54,989 --> 00:39:58,489
monitoring to meet requirements for
federal law under a person like that

642
00:39:58,489 --> 00:39:59,569
would probably be fine

643
00:39:59,569 --> 00:40:06,569
I'm not have expert so I can't really
speak to weigh perceptions and do

644
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,400
okay the question is what if you have a
phone call

645
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,920
you know pretty stigma phone call police
are you allowed to monitor them because

646
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,989
they're the police

647
00:40:33,989 --> 00:40:37,579
I don't think that really changes the
equation la partie stay

648
00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:40,940
monitoring them when they're out public
is a different

649
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,989
set of laws than this there's only

650
00:40:43,989 --> 00:40:48,799
you know what happens only about
communication electronic order

651
00:40:48,799 --> 00:40:52,150
allocation a tumor examples lemme

652
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:55,339
get through those indicate well time for
more question at the end or

653
00:40:55,339 --> 00:41:02,339
our example 3 after exposing the dangers
of having an open WiFi network to the

654
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:03,559
coffee shop

655
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:06,650
they decide to hire Alice as their
network security administrator

656
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:10,059
as part of her

657
00:41:10,059 --> 00:41:13,640
security diligence you occasionally
capture traffic to look for suspicious

658
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,680
activity

659
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,009
she spots one patron DG using up almost

660
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:21,799
all the band with because you do you
share in Torrance at the coffee shop

661
00:41:21,799 --> 00:41:27,259
and proceeds to kick TD of network she
also again records own and Frank coming

662
00:41:27,259 --> 00:41:28,459
in. conversation

663
00:41:28,459 --> 00:41:31,640
and she decides to read it because he
never know they might be doing something

664
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,410
legal David

665
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:35,430
planning a drug dealer over I am who
knows so she decides to read it

666
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:38,479
she is now asking for permission

667
00:41:38,479 --> 00:41:44,969
issue in trouble is seen on order
California

668
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:49,299
mmm of the California um

669
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:54,089
is in trouble now for the stuff with GG

670
00:41:54,089 --> 00:41:57,229
for figuring out what she's doing on the
network newtrouble

671
00:41:57,229 --> 00:42:00,670
members an exception for wiretapping
allowed a look at what's going on to

672
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:01,759
protect networks

673
00:42:01,759 --> 00:42:04,799
security and also to provide the service
in

674
00:42:04,799 --> 00:42:09,089
in maintain the integrity of the service
so if someone's Dawson your network

675
00:42:09,089 --> 00:42:11,759
you get to read their current you get to
read their info and figure out what's

676
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:13,699
going on so that you can stop them from
doing that

677
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:17,469
so that's not a problem the stuff

678
00:42:17,469 --> 00:42:21,079
ellen frank the maybe not that goes back
to the previous example

679
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:25,239
yeah she's an employee yeah she's
protecting the network

680
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:28,599
but you don't doesn't mean you get to
assume everyone the criminal and 3 the

681
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:31,089
conversations because who knows it might
be something that

682
00:42:31,089 --> 00:42:35,390
'em I mean you're not a police officer

683
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:39,049
not gonna get it you don't have to let
some reasonable doubt her you know

684
00:42:39,049 --> 00:42:42,849
suspicion but you know does just the
point that

685
00:42:42,849 --> 00:42:46,420
the exception for network operators
doesn't give you card

686
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:51,269
Austria everything that comes across a
network just for fun but you're free to

687
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:51,940
read it

688
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:55,539
as much as you need to to maintain the
service in the security

689
00:42:55,539 --> 00:43:00,420
finally else decides he's had enough

690
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:04,359
love miss get moved organ which is a
one-party state

691
00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:09,079
she dials into a conference line and
ordered

692
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:12,819
you know phone conference line or to
speak with three other people who are

693
00:43:12,819 --> 00:43:13,890
all in California

694
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:18,209
which is an all-party state but to party
but an all-party stay

695
00:43:18,209 --> 00:43:22,469
so prior to the call she gets one
person's permission

696
00:43:22,469 --> 00:43:26,839
to record the call but not the other two
its Records the conversation she worked

697
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:27,829
at the conversation

698
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:33,059
is she in trouble because now she's
located in a one-party state

699
00:43:33,059 --> 00:43:36,809
but everybody else is in them all-party
state and she didn't ask everybody else

700
00:43:36,809 --> 00:43:37,479
permission

701
00:43:37,479 --> 00:43:40,849
the answers she's probably not

702
00:43:40,849 --> 00:43:44,119
in trouble wiretapping cares

703
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:48,319
because their state statute in federal
statute cares where

704
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:51,559
with a federal statute says any one
party permission which she got

705
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:56,369
the fellow status as a front for the
state statutes care about where the

706
00:43:56,369 --> 00:43:57,779
wire-tapping takes place

707
00:43:57,779 --> 00:44:01,699
if she's happenin in Oregon she is one
party's permission

708
00:44:01,699 --> 00:44:05,619
she sneaks over californian size it
happened there then she's everyone's

709
00:44:05,619 --> 00:44:06,239
permission

710
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:09,519
so

711
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:12,369
makes a difference what state you're in
need to know when you're an all-party

712
00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:15,009
States because it really does make a big
difference about

713
00:44:15,009 --> 00:44:20,690
extent wiretapping you're about to do
tell people this and like if you wanna

714
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:21,140
be's

715
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:25,869
if you want to be really on like the way
had side for the good person do your

716
00:44:25,869 --> 00:44:27,599
security research from a one-party state

717
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,999
because you get you a lot more get to do
a lot more

718
00:44:31,999 --> 00:44:38,529
when it comes to games I think occasions
okay at the moment

719
00:44:38,529 --> 00:44:43,369
realism of doing this throughout the
talk that's okay are the fed's gonna

720
00:44:43,369 --> 00:44:45,900
bust down your door for recording I'm
conversation

721
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,469
probably ninth again I'm not trying to
scare people here

722
00:44:49,469 --> 00:44:52,210
we just went through some scary krummel
stuff and I said this is legal don't do

723
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:53,279
this stuff that

724
00:44:53,279 --> 00:44:56,499
something and if you don't run around
telling people

725
00:44:56,499 --> 00:45:00,199
if you're not doing things that are
really bad

726
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:03,460
how much for the fed's care I can't say

727
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:06,539
but a your as well as want pasta

728
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:11,430
a deep breath you're scared the
president can get you

729
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:15,779
probably all rights to briefly on civil

730
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:21,099
will be brief civil lawsuits are what
happens when you piss someone off

731
00:45:21,099 --> 00:45:26,009
will sue you and they can kinda see you
for any stupid reason

732
00:45:26,009 --> 00:45:29,819
now this there's some truth to this
because

733
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:34,099
you can be sued whenever like your news
poor this person got sued

734
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:37,420
I mean doesn't mean anything you can't
sue someone for

735
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:41,599
anything you know whether there's merit
to that's what matters

736
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:45,640
um but even if there's no merit to it
even if it's completely stupid

737
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:49,069
I'm especially comes computer stuff
judges will be like for

738
00:45:49,069 --> 00:45:52,150
understand this crazy internet you're
talking about like who knows what's

739
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:53,130
going on here

740
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:58,729
it could take a lot of time in a lot of
money even if the really stupid lawsuit

741
00:45:58,729 --> 00:46:02,549
and you have to get a lawyer to call the
FB page your ass

742
00:46:02,549 --> 00:46:09,019
like you don't deal with it even if it's
baseless lawsuit you don't deal with it

743
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:13,249
so basically my advice for civil
lawsuits

744
00:46:13,249 --> 00:46:16,469
don't break stuff people

745
00:46:16,469 --> 00:46:21,489
most people only see you civilly if you
cross the money

746
00:46:21,489 --> 00:46:25,099
most people don't not gonna spend
thousands of dollars suing you if you

747
00:46:25,099 --> 00:46:28,239
didn't break anything and you kinda have
just for their pride

748
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:31,559
some people will in Iran most businesses

749
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:35,229
most about their will not so

750
00:46:35,229 --> 00:46:40,420
as for civil goes don't break stuff
please and you probably won't get sued

751
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:43,430
others to might be a crime because with

752
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:47,319
so you know as far as civil goes it it's
really there's too many civilize out

753
00:46:47,319 --> 00:46:50,529
there that people can see under it
really depends on your situation

754
00:46:50,529 --> 00:46:53,729
so I can only give you the general
advice have to break things and you'll

755
00:46:53,729 --> 00:46:56,680
probably be okay

756
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,489
so some general tips that for civil but
this also applies criminal

757
00:47:00,489 --> 00:47:04,660
ask permission when you can if your
gonna run around scanning things

758
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:08,900
on the Internet endured a gray area see
if you can ask permission

759
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:12,190
i mean sometimes it's not reasonable
like my friend messaging Brandon

760
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:15,279
you want to scan across the whole
internet to see who have these internet

761
00:47:15,279 --> 00:47:18,999
devices you can go to every homeowner be
like knock on the door

762
00:47:18,999 --> 00:47:23,140
backache a nice gain your router it's
ridiculous so but when you can

763
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:26,210
as Commission don't break stuff

764
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:29,440
any of all the golden rule would you be
okay with someone else sitting in this

765
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,789
room doing the exact same thing to your

766
00:47:31,789 --> 00:47:36,400
hardware or network if the answer is No

767
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,579
why you can't do it fall the golden rule

768
00:47:40,579 --> 00:47:44,349
on if you know you're in a gray area are
you think you might be

769
00:47:44,349 --> 00:47:49,429
don't run around talking about it

770
00:47:49,429 --> 00:47:52,799
and you can get legal advice you can ask
lawyer asked the FF

771
00:47:52,799 --> 00:47:55,519
there's plenty of free legal advice and
%uh people are intimidated think lawyers

772
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:57,289
cost a lot of money

773
00:47:57,289 --> 00:48:00,929
don't know a lot of lawyers you know
they don't take up too much time

774
00:48:00,929 --> 00:48:04,089
don't worry about that Lake we're here
to help I'm here to help

775
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:07,089
if that's you to help CTZ to help

776
00:48:07,089 --> 00:48:11,499
whoever Lake I'll you know lawyers are
happy to help you

777
00:48:11,499 --> 00:48:15,410
if you just have a question you can
cause up it's fine

778
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:19,609
and everything anything you say even if
we don't end up taking your case

779
00:48:19,609 --> 00:48:22,679
you know if even if we don't end up
charging money

780
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:25,709
it can be protected under
attorney-client privilege

781
00:48:25,709 --> 00:48:30,849
even initial discussions so don't be
scared about talking to attorneys

782
00:48:30,849 --> 00:48:35,089
I i think i have about 10 more minutes
and I have time for more questions and

783
00:48:35,089 --> 00:48:42,089
no people were questions

784
00:48:42,539 --> 00:48:49,539
yes

785
00:48:54,039 --> 00:48:56,260
yes

786
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:59,890
so you're at home you have your own wife
in our Christmas was due

787
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:03,490
came on to your own personal life in
America home answer is yes

788
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:08,059
yes you can you're running you know your
own poll network again I wouldn't

789
00:49:08,059 --> 00:49:12,280
I wouldn't go crazy and about everyone's
conversations

790
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:15,579
I'm me but at least you have a defense
if you do that

791
00:49:15,579 --> 00:49:18,300
with the did that would say like every
home network and you're copping every

792
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:19,869
single thing that goes across network

793
00:49:19,869 --> 00:49:22,920
in reading of it at least you have a
defense

794
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,890
with wiretapping you have that accepts
me like I'm running the network and the

795
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:26,829
seeing what's going on

796
00:49:26,829 --> 00:49:29,819
you have a pretty decent defense there
now whether or not it works is no

797
00:49:29,819 --> 00:49:30,559
question

798
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:35,660
you know you know but

799
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:40,079
i win I went if you're running the
network you know I wouldn't worry as

800
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,190
much about wiretapping you're probably
okay

801
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:46,559
again if you use if you then take that
information

802
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,650
and use it to do something do something
with it

803
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:53,839
Lake you record people's passwords they
remain on the log into their email like

804
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:55,220
that but OK

805
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:59,290
if you're just recording traffic on your
network again realistically probably

806
00:49:59,290 --> 00:49:59,930
occur

807
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:06,930
the gentle and back there

808
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:26,450
okay

809
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:29,540
alright so you what you happen to be
wiretapping all say

810
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:33,290
wiretapping the Glee hopefully neither
let's say doing some illegal wiretapping

811
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:34,330
you happened is like

812
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:37,470
actually catch them and I've
conversation playing the drug deal

813
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:41,080
a what you do

814
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:44,770
I think in that case if you went to the
police on

815
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:48,460
day with and the you know it turns out
yes they catch them and they were

816
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:51,180
actually playing ZBA drug-dealing you
you save the day

817
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:54,710
with that would then the police
turnaround charges wiretapping

818
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:58,390
I mean theoretically yeah they could
with a be dicks yes

819
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:02,490
from and whatever the problem but then
if they did that

820
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:05,590
then no one would ever come to them if
they saw it again so it's bad for them

821
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:06,000
to do

822
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,990
is that is it admissible evidence

823
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:14,840
yes yes it illegally obtained evidence

824
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:19,870
but it still miss upon court it might be
inadmissible if the police had used

825
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:23,780
chance to get it but still admissible E
if you're doing something legal

826
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:28,870
in court but yet again for a la the
stuffing and realistically if you're

827
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:30,620
doing legitimate academic research

828
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,750
or if you catch someone

829
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:37,700
doing a much worse crime and go to the
police um

830
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:41,500
if the police or FBI whoever turnout
charge you

831
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:45,280
Lake their their stupid so

832
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:50,790
in they might but you but that would be
bad for them because then no one would

833
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:52,320
ever come to them again with

834
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:56,060
to help them out Lake you note have a
chilling effect on everybody

835
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:59,140
so I think it's pretty unlikely that
they would do that

836
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:04,500
I'm now doesn't mean they haven't rather
Sabres before about that kinda stuff

837
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,660
there's been talk to Def Con that have
been cancelled

838
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:12,030
their academic researchers because the
police said hey you're doing something

839
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:13,020
illegal or

840
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:16,790
in the so that can still talk I don't
think that air ever charged her got

841
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:17,660
punished for it

842
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:20,950
fights no it can happen I i think it's

843
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:24,130
that don't think it's wise with police
to do that we're trying to help them out

844
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:31,130
the truth to that yes

845
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:38,610
legality of were driving a.m.

846
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:43,080
so there is a difference

847
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:46,780
when it comes word I think some courts
might disagree

848
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:51,230
arm because access wireless access
points

849
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:55,050
on purpose broadcast information you
know the SSID

850
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:58,270
you're there ID's whether another the
protected

851
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:02,930
you know that's not you know accessing

852
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:06,700
the device you're just capturing things
that are being publicly

853
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:11,510
transmitted on purpose I'll think
there's a problem with that I'm

854
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:16,550
there can be problems if you comes to
how you free site publisher I would say

855
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:19,890
if you post information like hey there's
nope

856
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:24,200
you know there's this access point over
here and we tried the default password

857
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,750
admin interface in Cali works like
that's not so great

858
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:31,430
but if you just posting the existence of
an access point in using that data

859
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:36,320
I think there's much a problem there
home again some courts might disagree

860
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:40,860
and who knows some states might have
wacky were driving laws always make sure

861
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,110
your own state's laws

862
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:49,110
you know are okay them proved anything

863
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:07,630
yes

864
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:12,510
I that's a good question okay the
question is

865
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:17,809
example to house gets fired from her job

866
00:54:17,809 --> 00:54:23,000
but her company is stupid and forgets to
change your password or roofer account

867
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,140
from the payroll system

868
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:27,309
and then she again accesses the payroll
system using her account

869
00:54:27,309 --> 00:54:31,290
is that unauthorized access arm

870
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:34,530
that's a really good question the that
would be a good case

871
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:38,680
because you I can

872
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:43,050
you can see both sides that argument she
still has about Login and Password

873
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:46,490
but the same time she's been actively
told by her company probably when she

874
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:47,000
got fired

875
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,890
got fired like you can access the system
anymore like or its kinda understood

876
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:53,109
when you're fired ruin us was access the
system anymore

877
00:54:53,109 --> 00:54:58,440
that's the kind of thing where she would
probably definitely be charged by the

878
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,089
police

879
00:54:59,089 --> 00:55:03,589
where it went from there will rely more
on that particular state's laws

880
00:55:03,589 --> 00:55:06,760
in any other you can find her so it's
kinda but that's like a really great

881
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:07,650
area question

882
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:11,319
I don't think it's a good idea if you
get fired or no longer work for an

883
00:55:11,319 --> 00:55:12,930
employer to user logins

884
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:17,270
it's probably not the greatest if you
like stat a gray areas that's probably

885
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:18,010
not good

886
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:25,010
and the blue

887
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:33,550
as I miss the first

888
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:40,710
up beginning Brandon um

889
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:47,080
its night I well well

890
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:52,060
I don't know what he did so there's

891
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:57,460
80 K so if you're if you're scanning
their net for many devices I would say

892
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:00,900
know if you're staying for the mere
existence the device you

893
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:04,660
yet like something existed as IP address

894
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:09,190
that's obviously fine the problem is I
think when it came down to figuring out

895
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:12,359
whether Iran apps particular version of
firmware

896
00:56:12,359 --> 00:56:16,750
that is exploitable like how do you find
that out some

897
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:21,030
services will just tell you their
version when you talk to them now be

898
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:21,660
okay

899
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:25,540
but some you have to poke and prod them
in special ways

900
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:29,450
you know im you know there's skin to do
where it's like what I see this

901
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:32,220
malformed packet thing you'll send me
back this that means you this version

902
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:35,710
I mean that stuff i think is in a gray
area

903
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:38,730
because you are actually at that point
in

904
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:41,980
let me start interacting with the device
became bigger area

905
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:46,080
although I'm saved publicly available
net I would argue it's

906
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:52,000
it's fair to do but when it comes to
trying to leap for pick 3/4 path or

907
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,060
something like that are trying default
passwords

908
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:57,630
that's right I would it was me for my
client house they don't do that

909
00:56:57,630 --> 00:57:01,190
like don't try default passwords I know
you want to but don't do it

910
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:08,190
yes

911
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:42,580
mmm the question is looks like there's
researchers who made have been violating

912
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:43,300
the law

913
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:46,370
and the answer is at some point a

914
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:49,920
some researchers just say fuck it
honestly your thick

915
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,360
yeah I know the law is but there's like
gotta do we gotta do we need to do is

916
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:53,880
research

917
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:58,190
the board research and that a that their
choice like I'm just trying to keep

918
00:57:58,190 --> 00:58:04,370
like a sense I let you guys know the law
is and you can make good choices it when

919
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:05,400
it comes to

920
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:09,420
you know I can't say if they talked

921
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:13,410
perhaps the FF before they got legal
counsel before me that maybe didn't

922
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:16,560
but yet I with a lot love the research

923
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:19,860
it's presented that deals with
intercepting communications

924
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:23,150
I think a fair amount of people to say
fuck it way

925
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:26,470
where the chance the feds are gonna come
down i mean not that great

926
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:31,480
and you know I'm glad they do it because

927
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:34,790
research needs to be done and you can
always ask permission

928
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:38,120
so but as long as they were at the risks
thats

929
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:42,720
what's important I believe I'm at a time
but if you'd like to ask me questions

930
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:43,790
are you could be

931
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:48,020
you know they're having a beer or appear
on the con- please come up to me

932
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:51,210
if you wanna talk in private about
anything that's fine too

933
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:52,430
let me know thank you very much for
coming
