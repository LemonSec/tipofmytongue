00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,500
service they hard to I A I

110
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,410
for relatively flat network part from
the main file server which %uh

111
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,760
all the dates are on it which wasn't
separate dams at

112
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,340
here up top I'm within 15 minutes we
have the domain controller

113
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,410
cold owned how 08 67

114
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,880
I we also learned lots that's up box

115
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,310
boxes fists up put to bed most updated

116
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,640
this up boxes what does all these
default comes on so we can come back a

117
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,680
minute but with them again

118
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,150
all the user boxes well

119
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:21,870
I say all until we got ball be in about
six in the middle topped off with that

120
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:26,370
followed the use boxes rubs deprecation
we gots the main file server which had

121
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:30,080
all the shit on a including credit card
data well the most

122
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,880
was on because the development manager
had access to it

123
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,120
and Tina had MS 03 027

124
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,210
so fucking I practically decade

125
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:44,110
old issue on a fucking production
environment with acccess limo file

126
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:44,600
server

127
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,820
now in the real world beyond

128
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,170
let's get Windows 8 put on our tablets
and then have a group ok

129
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,980
in the real world where people don't
have that much money they still run XP

130
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,470
which is shaped the storm in 2003 which
she shaped

131
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:01,530
and the storm 2000 which is fucking
hilarious

132
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,540
now even without discussing obscure

133
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,130
legacy shit

134
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:10,090
legacy stove his fourth win I mean at
the main control

135
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,860
the primary count you know 4,000 user
hashes

136
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,990
in like 15 minutes shocking

137
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,820
and yet hilarious and we did do a little
dance that bomb actually gonna be

138
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,550

00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:43,420
I'm gonna be talking about why it's
impossible to talk about all that shit

146
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:47,100
in an hour without sounding vaguely like
you're on coke which are not

annual low-fat

151
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,390
secretly you all want to be him and have
a massive be it

152
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:07,160
and you know leads to the end of capital
be awesome

153
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,850
second boat and this guy's awesome guy
call Phil Edwards

154
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:17,500
in 2000 was writing for the system I
network which is like IBM group picture

155
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,570
and such that the masses Manish a
Packers

156
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:24,110
is often overstated SAR all you people
suck

157
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,530
according to Phil Edwards who have not
heard from since

158
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:31,000
so maybe the Menace posed overstated
maybe just got paid to shit

159
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,920
but anyone for site looking nice for
hundreds I noticed a couple things

160
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,070
was published from her ability was in I
like which was the official end of life

161
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:41,710
thoughts when

162
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:45,130
the i-series by Sydney da later became
system pay

163
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:49,010
because you know it's IBM and they do
things alphabetically apart from the

164
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:49,710
name which

165
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,730
obviously is now allegedly I was told

166
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:56,800
nobody uses ice for hundreds are not in
use that to old we don't like them

167
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,900
allegedly because you know I asked
Twitter and Twitter as I'm sure you're

168
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,900
well as a reliable source of data up all
times

169
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:10,110
people tell the truth consistently and
accurately suck began to ask return

170
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,430
Jessa has anybody seen as 400 improper
lighten up we've seen them in the trash

171
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:17,130
which is bollocks was also an asphalt
and trash

172
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:20,670
it would be coming home with me because
they're quite expensive i've seen

173
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,460
are icons people have seen them in
server room saying I mean a

174
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,600
I on to sign saying here be dragons
apparently

175
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,930
never ever ever in production now as
usual

176
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,060
I have an issue with Doc I'm call
bullshit to everybody on Twitter

177
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,930
like to me euro lying bastards I have
proof because

178
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:41,150
I've seen them on client sites handling
payroll

179
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:46,110
I've seen coming order fulfilment and
warehousing I've seen them storing CC

180
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,450
details which we know anything about how
I S 400 humbling trypsin

181
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:53,380
is insane I've seen them regulating
industrial controls

182
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:57,220
like power stations and ships I've also
seen the being left the fuck alone

183
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,210
because nobody knows what they fucking

184
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:04,000
then who I've yet to see the moon under
sign saying he be dragons but at some

185
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,190
point i fukin well

186
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:09,480
on that point at least will be Acura now

187
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,240
if you showed on which he showed always
you showed on

188
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,190
it's funny it makes giving talks much
easier I found as for hundreds a

189
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,250
public-facing

190
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,250
the blunt quest the bomb belong to fault
the belong to bell south

191
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,360
most of telecom Italia's backbone is on
ice for hundreds because you know

192
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,590
ass for hundreds and actually a bit like
the pope the quite become quite

193
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,450
well-liked

194
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,630
i've seen the bank's i've seen.
universities

195
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:38,390
I've even seen the local government
Cedar Rapids has got us four hundred

196
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:42,210
Grand Rapids is not when I saw the
rapids I got really forget it cited

197
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:46,370
and then realizes Cedar Rapids is in
Grand Rapids I have to check book in

198
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:51,230
Google Maps for the ship suck not apply
so how some

199
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:55,420
is to Z 2 Q's if you don't know the
people to organize the pool party at Def

200
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,650
compass all that full because they
provide to the communities to do it

201
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:02,090
so you know I've also seen them

202
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:06,860
aside Telecom Italia that's me startups
all of this fucking super hero here

203
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:12,550
ladies and gentlemen jerry Shaw not mom

204
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,000
is the gentleman

205
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,769
although I am slightly worried was put
in a drink our star tripping balls

206
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:24,920
it's not californians fall power

207
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,180
suck moving on from the free beer yeah
that's me stood outside Telecom Italia

208
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:29,899
tryna looks

209
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:35,370
you know disingenuous and shit so I'm I
S 400 to xx they are in the Internet

210
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:39,529
they are in production you can see them
you come talk some I I am

211
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:43,079
how did they do the Voodoo that they do
well for the story about us about ninety

212
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:44,019
four Life

213
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:47,639
IBM tried to trademark the phrase

214
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:51,810
powered by pixie tossed they were denied

215
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:55,100
but thanks for checking trilight because
their entire thing

216
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:00,440
was okay all servers a fucking magical
their power by magical for canals and

217
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,430
pixie dust

218
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:05,100
we're not something you how else they
focus on work but this pixie dust in

219
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,240
them now boxes

220
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,160
looking inside any other vendor in the
Falcons world's

221
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,660
how did your shit work well pixie dust
the foot

222
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,440
that a guy calls

223
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,230
tom Van Lloyd did not all some talk on a
small group

224
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:28,269
hiking around 2009 hiking running if you
don't know as an event that happens

225
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:29,180
every four years

226
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,510
where all the European hackers get
together sit in a field smoke dope

227
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:36,640
and try and you know not look
interesting to law enforcement fried ice

228
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,560
I it was awesome topics outlaw technical
detail

229
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,790
is also an awesome talk top because it's
delivered by adults got

230
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:47,699
and Dutch guys talking about
technologies forking for me

231
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:52,149
the us for home build saw that's fucking
genius

232
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:55,640
you win now the reason why I'm so as for
hundreds

233
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,220
is because I p.m. are believers in close
of a love clothes sauce

234
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,970
they don't share in the secret fuckin
recipe would nobody now

235
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:07,740
doesn't I Wescott system on the loss at
the dock of a small group

236
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,310
and it's really relief or can we its now

237
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,370
book took what system are dole's

238
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:18,649
is a virtual machines fax yeah and
basically

239
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:22,360
Osama if you disregard the fact that
it's all virtual which is fuckin wit

240
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,510
it looks object orientated design now

241
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:29,209
is so for the entire West support
subjects dont machine level

242
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:32,819
the whole addressable they all have
independent message queues

243
00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:36,329
Neil talk to each other well except for
objects which documental

244
00:14:36,329 --> 00:14:38,830
now

245
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:43,190
what amidst is what leads me to believe
at those s for hundreds are effectively

246
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:47,350
big forking databases real computer for
cambodia backs

247
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:51,730
sole object orientated now the way
things are p.m.

248
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,800
don't measure CPU speed what you know
about a CPU state

249
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,270
the base on how many jobs the system
come fall which is again

250
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:02,480
pretty far from it know the second I S
phones all the install programs as far

251
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,160
as I'm aware

252
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,590
have to be licensed and approved by idea
so don't talk about their shit

253
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:11,190
the early development that shit unless
you actually say we've developed on your

254
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:11,540
shit

255
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:15,380
when you can weave mission to sell it
please mister idea which is toll

256
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:19,010
now another weird thing is this thing
called the single-level stall

257
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:23,920
single-level stalls for you mental
basically what you've got is warm 64-bit

258
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,760
address space

259
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:29,750
the shows all the data storage all the
programs all the day to all the things

260
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,730
aren't single level saw now there's no
dress reuse which

261
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:37,420
weeks more now and that's only

262
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,070
a the memory space in there is only
addressable from a single permanent

263
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:41,580
press

264
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,790
and its virtual if your program you can
access real memory on as/400 you've

265
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,030
talked with virtually

266
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:50,640
so I can I'm going up some dinner had a
hole in the morning of

267
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,850
and I'm now if you've got all your
sheets

268
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:58,430
in one place a program has come access
all your shit because it can access real

269
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,040
memory

270
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,980
what the fuck possibly go wrong
especially on a close all system

271
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,280
it'll be fine is on these trust IBM
continue to get big blue your morning

272
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:13,440
nothing the system or does it operates
for a VM

273
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,960
now even hypervisor you don't have real
access to memory

274
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,080
I'm system also uses dot balls it's talk
to you

275
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,500
all of that system local have a laptop
society looks for an object

276
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:30,480
Dixon now it remains Afghan massive
database not operating system now

277
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,960
almost very very interesting Moncton
thank you for filling up ten minutes

278
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,770
you know i mean this techno waffle but
come we actually have kept

279
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,780
can actually be pops well yeah cap

280
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:44,540
because you know cyst system I indeed as
for hundreds

281
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:50,460
relief of pain no easy by the full what
shitload of common pollsters assault and

282
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,200
Ashlan Carmel who's basically

283
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,530
the go to guy on his phone secure in
2006

284
00:16:55,530 --> 00:17:00,190
before you know he was abducted by most
other shits by Spiro book on the senate

285
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:00,790
so when

286
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:05,120
but they are so fucking we see it's
inciting

287
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,250
I mean this is a classic example then or
use yeah

288
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,500
this is just right connection 5 could
have to pay you have to a box that was

289
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,420
all on a snow

290
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,510
brilliant walls arms doesn't respond

291
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:20,780
how do you know its men's 400 well
because I S 430 focus

292
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,830
on how you know is Beatles is says 22

293
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:27,720
the 220 cutie CP this is how I ask for
much more

294
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,680
if it starts with a queue is an as/400
was everything in an ass for 100 stocks

295
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,600
were fucking cue

296
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,630
user accounts services everything

297
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,880
IBM basically up a hold on for the
letter Q

298
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,140
which we age now

299
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,350
do TCP is about full largely

300
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,490
now according to Sean como is an israeli
Gaza

301
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:53,190
spoke a lot about as 400 society forgot
black box somewhere

302
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:57,400
I am to stay awake at night because the
system reveals its Celeste

303
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,120
unauthenticated users

304
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,770
all you fucking months old if I can

305
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:05,960
discovered discover what your system is
just by connecting to a poll

306
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,500
that's kinda K it's especially trying to
gay and vaguely retarded

307
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,920
if I can brute force the all of and then
ran quite obsessed

308
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,400
and then find all sorts of juicy details
about the shit that you left

309
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:24,060
on by defaults results nothing you've
got is pop 3

310
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:28,030
pop 3 TCP 110 fasten a nice for hundreds

311
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:31,650
not there very often but when you find
it its forty-four can shaped

312
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:34,940
wise shaped of 24 kinship because

313
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:39,330
depending on the implementation and you
know it's almost implementations

314
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:42,610
you get very very useful error messages

315
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:47,040
which basically tell you what accounts
exist and not so what you do is you get

316
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,180
things like to 283 that says the user
profiles disabled piece of

317
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:56,460
you get see 2235 which says there's no
password associated which means the camp

318
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,530
is a fucking that

319
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:00,610
you know you get to 20 fall use profile
notfound

320
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:05,630
again piece of be also got two chief I'm
to GT which really for useful

321
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:10,070
was uneven maybe start having a pop at
them a so you don't pump up for the

322
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,000
often but when you do

323
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,310
fucking hilarious thank you for telling
me what uses you have

324
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:19,420
thank you what could possibly go fucking
wrong well what could go fucking wrong

325
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,530
is the as/400 ship with a fucking to
home

326
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:27,380
up default users I mean the not quite as
bad as Oracle 9i but the pretty fucking

327
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,420
klux

328
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,590
they've got what what serve them and
again because it's

329
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:36,020
IBM they all start with the letter Q
because we like you

330
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:40,050
I don't know why they chose cue I really
do not fucking understand but you know

331
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,020
the dead

332
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:45,570
that many of those accounts be disciples
men even won't be remote camps

333
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:48,820
but if they all that may well have no
passwords

334
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,380
a name lol have the same use the same
password as the username

335
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,740
because IBM retarded suck

336
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,360
his name in the russian easy pot from
discovery easy

337
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,090
now weather warning if you try brute
force mass 400

338
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,880
it will end perhaps it will and very
very bad

339
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,020
because most people will use G Max I'm
now a few months I'm does which is

340
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:16,660
rights is if you for Corp put in the
drama of details

341
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,060
it all to say be the user profile it'll
drop it which is great if you know the

342
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:20,700
%uh people

343
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,090
in a it you can access your shit no mall
cuz by

344
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:28,180
for you up by putting the wrong thing
five times for Gulf

345
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:33,080
cool what that book also can happen is
you can disable the device is GG the

346
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,950
terminals people used to look at the
shirts

347
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,980
or even better the devices themselves

348
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,810
you can kill in as400 by guessing wrong

349
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:46,510
the house also

350
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:50,430
sup wiser a picture of a man with a
beard in my talk

351
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:55,570
well this car is called Ian ian joined
dozens of us about three weeks ago

352
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:59,800
came from RW eight very nice guy but in
terms of like to see shit

353
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,680
doesn't know it in terms of Ruby does it
know it

354
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,800
now on the day and as anybody who knows
me will testify to

355
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,930
I am actually moderately evil I get off
from being in Aus

356
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:16,390
so I did to Ian knows nothing about
legacy nothing about Ruby site

357
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:20,670
what we need is a Maxis ploy module go
to

358
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:24,890
and Fritos like era mas Port Metro
module for pop free animation why did

359
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:25,550
the right now

360
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:29,300
because what I'm gonna do was a mistake
every single published on ability

361
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,560
and puts him at a sports because I think
it'll be fucking hilarious

362
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:38,020
top 30-year-old technology bottled in
the core modules

363
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:42,030
this will amuse me

364
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:46,010
wanna some point space for hundreds is
that some vulnerable to malware

365
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:49,890
it's like fucking superman is the
Superman oval SS

366
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:54,580
yeah now IBM technical documents make a
big fucking deal about us they say

367
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,670
according to our magical secret sauce
know she will run out of cash

368
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:01,940
on on I'll boxes now if you have an
asshole drilled

369
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:06,010
it will say permanently isn't this rpm
technical document is the

370
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,560
tallest fucking thing I've ever hot
saree

371
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,320
is badly written badly constructed in
quite frankly I dozed off of white

372
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:13,760
Falcons

373
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,300
wrote now spontaneity do cite

374
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,340
as although the OS system of is more
invulnerable

375
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:24,490
IFIs the integrated file storage GG
where all the shitty stalled

376
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:29,090
isn't you know so another interesting
thing that Doc

377
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:33,100
is a basis I there is no AB 4s for
hundreds

378
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,420
so there's no way made so how do you
know you have ours is

379
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,960
just thoughts now

380
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,280
what you could do is a site you could
use the I fax

381
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,380
to stall well social around the network

382
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:50,310
you could stick it on BiPAP fried steak
on by a domino can stick it on by Nasser

383
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,290
begins to come by often FTP

384
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:55,410
stick on the USB I don't have a fuckin
do we get on that

385
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:58,660
why because I saw hundreds never go off

386
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:02,040
people don't understand them so they
don't turn them off

387
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,560
and there has no AV so it won't know
it's not a virus on its

388
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,810
so if you were to use a half ass as a
malware distribution

389
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:14,580
network on a network you could own the
fuck out that network of people were too

390
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,760
scared to turn their ass phone was off
because they don't like paying people

391
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,340
six in 50 books a fork in our

392
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:26,710
why although no bars as far as for
hundreds is it's magic

393
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:31,550
new it possibly be calls IBM are
incredibly fucking closed lipped about

394
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,440
the internal memory stocks and how she

395
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,970
books now quick aside:

396
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:41,070
I got I am interest in this phone comes
in a silent tears

397
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:45,250
I can't afford an ass for 100 picture
now I like buying beer and shit

398
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:49,950
and somebody keep me warm so I'm a guy
in a pope who was a very very scary

399
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:50,850
gentleman

400
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:55,190
was very beefy in very light clothes
shaved on almost had him about ok I just

401
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:58,880
does offer a fascist or its military or
possibly fork and knife

402
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,890
on the next table there was another
couple beefy 4-pin dollars

403
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:06,170
shaped heads drinking Coke which never
forget happens in the UK ball

404
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:10,100
adver on dinner came out eventually

405
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,340
he's from connecticut genetic if you
don't know them basically a very close

406
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,220
allies with the

407
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,620
UK military and you can tell a chance
covering communities

408
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,620
and basically make very interesting shit
that goes boom

409
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:23,860
or maybe pop on the network now

410
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:28,870
they gave me an ass for 100 for free
just after I talked about North Korea

411
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:33,150
that's not us and best thing about it
they said well we may have left some

412
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,490
dates wrong there

413
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:38,080
but if we have don't tell anyone home
now

414
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,120
the house smells like %uh for keine Zeit
so

415
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,690
I'm going to jail because if you're
fucking books all I

416
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:49,810
nicely however I have managed to avoid
jail because false

417
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:53,100
the fucking thing only connects via 20
bucks

418
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:57,500
auto trim ring I don't have token
wrinkle is not 1994 Pinto

419
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,540
and I definitely don't have a twin X
terminal flashy costs more than gold

420
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:05,620
or golden unicorn shaped so I needed to
an external

421
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:09,060
somebody needs must have one in a shed
rotting give me

422
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:14,120
I will take out and I will be arrested
for fucking with kinetic

423
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:18,110
now my plan is fun to team up to an
external that announcement to connect

424
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,390
city so I can actually use the form the
box

425
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:24,820
the monitors missus unsettled assist on
all the system-level calls from comes to

426
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,190
me

427
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,600
moves votes them from document because
IBM never have

428
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,610
in Republic shot because you know for
KBM that

429
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:38,300
in secret sauce on the number by for a
noon call

430
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:42,620
come about them our thing are you know
the ice for hundreds of the virus is the

431
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,380
indestructible

432
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:47,480
fuckin Superman have a cape and
everything join caramels publish details

433
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,760
love in a also to ship privilege
escalation

434
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,570
I hijacking user sessions overriding job
starting jobs

435
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:59,140
drop in jobs generally forget about
thought sure ship sounds like my left to

436
00:25:59,140 --> 00:25:59,990
make

437
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:04,440
and I'm stop Tehran's filtration TRX
filtration and deletion

438
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:09,350
that's poppin Mauer now is also publish
details for how to use raw

439
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:12,860
rocks for can really wait is like the
Java version for remote desktop

440
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:17,810
documental we tried to get a hold of a
copy if it is up for can hold you cal

441
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:21,220
was up Thomas L parole session anybody
that connects n

442
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,030
will automatically you know be playing
with our whole session which may or may

443
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,170
not be legitimate

444
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:28,720
so what we gonna do as we can control is
to fuck about neck but again I need to

445
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,270
focus when external first

446
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:36,120
suck there's lots of interesting stuff
in terms of texture

447
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,690
on system on but nobody spoke you look
in it

448
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:43,429
it's not an Android phone to people just
like share don't exist isn't a sign

449
00:26:43,429 --> 00:26:45,530
saying he be dragons

450
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:50,460
now researching has fallen trees is no
easy you need to access we'll

451
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,510
this is one thinking folk I'm going deaf
repost on this page

452
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:56,640
somebody commits when external I'll put
this on a public face Nike in the new

453
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,070
comply

454
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:01,470
now another cover of everything about
his phone

455
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:05,410
to stop choices to the balance forbes
but if you have a chance some

456
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:09,350
give me one I'm back in here and I will
open the show up to everybody and then

457
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,050
you could all

458
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:13,710
have applied a fucking of Ibn

459
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:17,390
F PLC spill sees a bright there on big
ships

460
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:21,590
this guy is running a pill SiC he may be
playing for a missile command

461
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:25,240
you may even be playing elites I'm not
sure what he's talking doing but that

462
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,400
doesn't look like work

463
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,590
suck Phils ace

464
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:34,620
programmable logic controllers the like
normal computers

465
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:39,390
only that better the hardened I'm in
terms of environmental shirts of no

466
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,010
ghost

467
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:44,540
no water no electricity you know that
the family call systems

468
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:48,360
because they have to be because you know
the room checks on the used installed

469
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,920
alarm siren oil refineries & Gas Works

470
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,130
gonna which a dangerous noisy horrible
sweaty places

471
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:58,030
other also used in uranium enrichment
plants like you run shit

472
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:02,460
that went to people talk about hacking
starter and they do all the Falcons I'm

473
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,420
another talk about how i fucked start a
quite welcome you

474
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,630
well the russians talking about is
pissing around with pale season

475
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,210
supporting suffer environments

476
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:13,690
now interesting thing about Hill seized
shitload 25

477
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:17,160
but they will do the same thing there
suddenly like fucking chicken wings

478
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,010
because bush you to do the same job but
you know it's hardly different texts

479
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:24,960
I'm Phil sees other just like a normal
computer

480
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,450
no they're not like a normal computer
you retell the cost a lot more money

481
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:32,250
the reason why the call so many because
programs are stored in non-volatile

482
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,270
memory

483
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:37,110
to basically output Israel time limit
based upon what you play

484
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:40,950
now you can make I am import via

485
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:45,200
program sample and I weekender over
Ethernet or you can do if i reprogram

486
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:45,590
the chip

487
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:50,740
if you want to get really old store
because of what PLC's control

488
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:55,990
they make really high value targets a
wonderful wonderful new stores

489
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:59,120
have stocks as a fucking classic example
this

490
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,840
a quick reminder to anybody in the room
that's not heard of stocks and if you

491
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,270
haven't you really shouldn't for can be
here but let's just

492
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:09,160
assume that somebody in here works in
you know the accounting department or

493
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,730
something

494
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:14,510
what will stop snapped all stocks net
was a worm that was made by Magical

495
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,440
Elves have questionable national it's a

496
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:21,970
is what stocks at Los some have blamed
the israelis

497
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:26,490
some have blamed the Americans I
personally blame Santa

498
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:29,650
wall sign said was he said

499
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:34,030
Iran a very very North Sea and we have a
bit of downtime cuz it's only February

500
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,320
secrete calm

501
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,740
make some malware lb Falcons clarice and
I'll teach

502
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:42,330
at my gym a job for being a naughty boy
this year the focking

503
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:45,670
Ltd its now what details do

504
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:50,530
their target Windows PCs rendezvous
scary the target Siemens PCI someone CC

505
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,190
which basically is the shit is used

506
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:55,250
program PLC's which they have regained
it was fuckin funny

507
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,990
now they also attacked the PLC's
themselves

508
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:02,770
nobody's ever said which was possible
sources am our company anyway

509
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:06,170
days now what PLC students

510
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:09,990
who knows probably seaman's want to get
its fessing and it really upset the

511
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,850
Iranian substantial was rights

512
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:15,730
nap for anything about up stocks at

513
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:19,040
issue could spread it far USP which is
fucking great

514
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,460
if you think about it this basically
means some little elf

515
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:26,340
flew in from the north pole a scattered
foxing US peace around the North

516
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,640
enrichment I'm

517
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,020
what a fucking red teaming health

518
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:34,280
here have some presence of my lap
children

519
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:38,679
and then disappearance while stocks now
also did

520
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:42,320
is a use default products which is
fucking terrifying however did they get

521
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,530
the default credentials

522
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:47,460
first demons devices well its time

523
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,310
that was huge news the actual credit to
use a been known for fucking yes

524
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:55,260
they were published yeah now the overall
some of the vendors

525
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:58,800
over them King cements all the seams
don't think they're all because Siemens

526
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,429
a German

527
00:30:59,429 --> 00:31:03,650
for a little bit arrogance now what I
wanted to do

528
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:08,110
is only one set defaults cause stocks
not to fall so I wanted to

529
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:12,850
so it got lots of them I got all the
ones from probably a lot more to comment

530
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:16,320
on the bar I got lots and lots of
seamanship not just freak folk you

531
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,510
stocks not ions yeah

532
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:23,730
how did I get them because I went on to
Siemens forms on what happens on series

533
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:24,610
Siemens forms

534
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:28,130
this is fucking hilarious is somebody
will sir

535
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:31,780
I can access my PLC because I forgot my
password because

536
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:36,150
I am a retard and then some grey beard
all site well we shouldn't be talking

537
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,130
about this on

538
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:40,580
open public forum because that would be
about it people got this information

539
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,560
wouldn't say

540
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:48,560
and then another tribunal sec forget I'm
bald yet talked up before the why did I

541
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:49,720
do this

542
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,790
wanna fuck not seaman's the stocks now
have three Siemens defaults

543
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:57,290
I've got forty love them was my fucking
price

544
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:02,419
Sao how do you find PLC's

545
00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:08,450
use a map rockwell's yeah Siemens s7 see
all you sports you can find out what

546
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:12,150
they all the pertinent documentation and
everything all you have to do is read

547
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:15,659
which I know is an abstract concept for
americans but that's when you actually

548
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:17,659
look at shirt on paper

549
00:32:17,659 --> 00:32:23,200
or I'm losing the kraut bail bail
retreats if

550
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,919
now what can you actually for confined
if you could see you some

551
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:30,510
well you can use them up or you can you
showed up music shop in the final salsa

552
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:30,929
she

553
00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:35,090
phone IP bridges why would I be on the
inside loopholes

554
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:40,040
also find some over interesting shit you
know you find horizon Ethernet boxes

555
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,340
in for info can human machine interfaces
you know

556
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,679
control checks human machine interface
that sums up the bill say

557
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:50,050
you can also find the industrial
controls for a fork in building

558
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:53,340
let's turn off the air conditioning in
Japan I'll be phony

559
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:58,040
especially if we do it in July teehee

560
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,270
this low to show you can find I mean the
best thing I found

561
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:05,300
with six this is a water treatment plant
in Canada

562
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:10,270
pass on the fucking internet now if you
hate opera levin

563
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:14,620
if you think gee the sum 41 of shifts

564
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:18,370
if you have a real fucking emotional
issues with Bryan Adams

565
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:24,780
you can chlorinate these focus

566
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:28,730
quick protec Kate's keep your fucking
PLC's

567
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:33,730
of the internet's because otherwise I
will get forking revenge for a for a

568
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:34,740
living

569
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,110
it will focus happen %uh some point I
will focus not

570
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:43,120
and then you focus drinking nothing but
flow right

571
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,800
%uh stocks that was fucking awesome
doomed but doing better since talking

572
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:51,150
lockup 2011 even for combat did some
very very pretty

573
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:55,460
to Massport model seems really tall if
you remotely into PLC's a few

574
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:59,700
if you two wanna research daughter to
reduce foreign sockets also

575
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,610
now you miss something us to make stocks
not

576
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:07,870
thus I am seaman's themselves a program
called wipeout

577
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:11,179
now what wipeout dole's is it based the
drops the memory

578
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:14,429
on s7-200 just clears appeal say

579
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:18,290
you can do the same thing by connecting
to Siemens s7-200

580
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:21,510
and issuing as a user name clear PL se
that drops

581
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:24,669
the fucking entire memory

582
00:34:24,669 --> 00:34:28,540
now that works on s7-200 which is like
the baby lets

583
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:33,570
learn how to program PLC's versions I
for campaign might work elsewhere

584
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,780
I don't know I've noble PLC to play with
if you have

585
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,919
get a copy of Wipeout reverse engineer
the focus find out if it works

586
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:45,810
correction it for might you yeah

587
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:48,859
that by the way its interest in Koper
you don't know what that is

588
00:34:48,859 --> 00:34:52,210
that's the fucking dole yeah

589
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:57,010
what's up I seventy-five before there
was the Internet there was X 25

590
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:01,200
now so love you he may be old enough to
remember and see you all bastards

591
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,230
i apologize. to anybody here this use in
our TCPIP

592
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:08,860
they need to know I X from five its
causes also

593
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:12,000
first national lebanon network still
used all walks

594
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,520
I mean a lot it's owned by Telkomsel
Telcom don't like talking giving the

595
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,119
circle

596
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:23,070
so is used a lot Tom a spill in salt
stocks is believed to be a mass is built

597
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,740
into OS phones going to waltz

598
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:30,119
ship by the full now how it works well
if you got a lease line

599
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:33,710
which 625 ready you got network user

600
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:37,190
and that's always associate you least
like what you do

601
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:39,980
she told the police line and you pay for
the cost to the traffic not the

602
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,690
connections on

603
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:44,410
it's a bit like a telephone call with
computers and shit and I'm

604
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:48,960
now a site making making phone calls
with computer

605
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,540
bevin alien concept here back in the day
with this thing called I love it was

606
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,030

607
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:57,350
my phone times you chief

608
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,450
telephone

609
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:02,150
and computer sect

610
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:05,750
as many as 25 sign up assigned globally
now

611
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:10,610
as a cop all some all some things about
extremely fine X 25 addresses

612
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:12,349
all reserved

613
00:36:12,349 --> 00:36:16,330
because I reserved and changing them is
a pain in the ass because people have to

614
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:18,190
deal with the International Telcom
junior

615
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:22,460
they very rarely change all some fax
number two

616
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:26,050
if you've got the day and network ID
code for lease line

617
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:29,890
and the new which typically no longer
than about 15 digits

618
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:33,590
you can access the X 25 least now

619
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:36,670
all some facts number three teenax

620
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:39,710
which is the key to the country codes a
published maintained by the

621
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:42,780
to you and US because that bus

622
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,110
you can walk I'll its focus

623
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:47,569
nobody does in public

624
00:36:47,569 --> 00:36:50,490
why does this matter Bowl there's a lot
of public barrier

625
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:54,240
is published and is accessible and can
be read and it doesn't change

626
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,910
a book why it matters: is for a couple
reasons

627
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,180
Iran

628

returning your can champion

935
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:18,930
a.m. I have come to defend the crown

936
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:22,130
except I've been attending a bunch of
the talks and

937
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:25,010
I've really liked a lot of what i've
heard there's been some great technical

938
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:26,510
contact: this year

939
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:28,619
a.m.

940
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:32,000
but I've already decided that I've won
because the one thing that is still

941
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:32,819
messing

942
00:57:32,819 --> 00:57:36,920
from the discourse and dialogue and
you're just their branding and fuckin

943
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,119
crazy as a raving

944
00:57:38,119 --> 00:57:41,470
which is that's what that that's this
home

945
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:45,520
as a level of accountability for
industry were still patting ourselves on

946
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,650
the back trying to solve the world's
problems

947
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:50,960
but spending like no time looking
internally

948
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:55,849
as to you why it is that maybe we're not
solving some of those problems as fast

949
00:57:55,849 --> 00:57:56,450
as we could

950
00:57:56,450 --> 00:58:01,140
so a.m. so anyway

951
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:06,039
by gay and taken off the ground and the
reason that I'm taking off the crown is

952
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:06,470
cuz

953
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:10,309
I don't want to be the only person I
don't want to be the only voice

954
00:58:10,309 --> 00:58:14,390
thats out here talkin shit about what's
wrong with

993
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:49,220

994
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:52,310

the air I'll the answers all of the
above mother fuckers

996
01:00:56,990 --> 01:01:00,240
the truth of the matter is I'm not half
bad

997
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:04,610
what I do for a living doesn't have shit
to do with the pilot plaques on my desk

998
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:09,750
I'm but I'm also not half bad at taking
multiple choice exams but I can't

999
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:12,320
remember the last time I was at work and
somebody said

1000
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:16,430
quick your pond do you a or do you be

1001
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:22,370
or do you see right and I can't remember
the last time

1002
01:01:22,370 --> 01:01:26,210
as ash from the start but I had to fire
a Photoshop so

1003
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:30,320
so there you go so

1004
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:33,510
our day book what's what what the fuck
is my point

1005
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:36,630
right whitewater so let's talk about
certification

1006
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:40,750
as an industry body cuz because let's
admit it this industry

1007
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:45,210
I T in general completely culpable
InfoSec

1008
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:49,630
maybe a little bit worse I mean I so the
DOD

1009
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:53,410
doesn't require that you have your MCSE
to work on their servers like they'll

1010
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:53,790
take

1011
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:57,120
dude I'll take a they'll take a grime
leg right out a basic

1012
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:01,780
and if he says yeah I like computers the
full image from the the store on nt4

1013
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:05,040
this through the commitment from the
Windows Server they don't care that he

1014
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,440
doesn't have an MCSE

1015
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,820
but if you want to go do Lake you know
cyber

1016
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:14,670
security for the DOD you have to have a
sis be so

1017
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:18,650
so what's the value right i mean if
we're ever so obsessed with these things

1018
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:20,780
why what we what are we really getting
out a bit

1019
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:22,920
so

1020
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:26,230
their tool for your HR department right
the idea is that this makes it possible

1021
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:29,360
for human resources to do hiring and
recruiting around the particular skill

1022
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:32,520
sets that they need to this is hard
security is hard I'm not gonna lie to

1023
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:32,910
you

1024
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:36,460
without how I'm probably preaching to
the choir you know

1025
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:40,460
right so if I wanna be a Windows guy how
much do I have to now

1026
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:43,760
about be GrpN HSRP

1027
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:48,119
exactly jack shit right and thats and
maybe I do know some stuff but I don't

1028
01:02:48,119 --> 01:02:48,789
have to

1029
01:02:48,789 --> 01:02:52,309
right if I'm a UNIX guy how much do I
have to know

1030
01:02:52,309 --> 01:02:56,390
about you know registry hives

1031
01:02:56,390 --> 01:02:59,620
not a damn thing if I were to insecurity

1032
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:04,090
have to know all that shit on I at least
all the shit to my employer as

1033
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:09,490
so it's hard for HR so what about you

1034
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:13,260
well you'd like that job the end of the
day you would like to

1035
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:16,300
move ahead you like to do some new stuff
you want your career

1036
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:20,650
to progress so you don't get those certs
in hopes of getting better job

1037
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:24,950
get a raise your current job get a new
job go to Washington

1038
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:28,650
centered ass watch large

1039
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:33,320
make six figures do you seriously we do
that Tammy T

1040
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:37,170
okay and then after the certification
body a fuckin this is america

1041
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:41,760
let's make a little cash private
enterprise 3 market right if we have

1042
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,820
the certification program that everybody
wants then

1043
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:48,630
everybody's gonna come to us and we'll
make money it's a quality product that's

1044
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:49,890
the free market right we are

1045
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:52,930
we are adding value it's it's it's all
good

1046
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:56,670
I think we're gonna spend a little time
examining you to these and I

1047
01:03:56,670 --> 01:04:00,820
bad a bad all the people certifications
in the room they're really good a

1048
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:03,560
multiple choice questions have already
figured out the answer

1049
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:08,789
because there is only one right answer

1050
01:04:08,789 --> 01:04:12,990
so raise your hand if you're I TPG
certified

1051
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:16,210
as a room full love you here you don't
even know it

1052
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:19,770
in 2001 I S E to choose the certificate

1053
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:24,130
the the certification body by NCIS is BS
SEP in

1054
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:27,560
like four other search for you can
become like a

1055
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:32,780
developer you knows its offer security
life cycle all back up in Dr

1056
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:36,230
nearly business continuity you do all
that stuff go get a search

1057
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:41,170
that I see two years earlier company
called I TPG does it

1058
01:04:41,170 --> 01:04:44,530
to ATPG generates the courseware for all
the exams

1059
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:48,300
so the camera body of knowledge like the
whole thing everything that goes into

1060
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:50,260
the exams as report together by this
company

1061
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:54,440
they do all the pre review courses race
for those people that show up with the

1062
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:57,420
isc2 pains at the classes for any of you
who've done that

1063
01:04:57,420 --> 01:05:01,270
20 min work pricey to work for a company
called ATPG

1064
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:04,730
and they're not really supposed to tell
you that although I mean let's be honest

1065
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:05,430
I got this

1066
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:09,210
with you awesome open sources ATPG dot
com

1067
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:13,480
I'm the world it. BG's really freakin
Pradesh

1068
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:17,710
I don't think I don't I didn't find it
and I see two dark side though

1069
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:22,420
is now we're so I don't think it's like
a big secret but

1070
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:26,329
they do all other marketing to so right
so the market the stuff

1071
01:05:26,329 --> 01:05:29,760
the market HR departments the market it
into the industry they did a fantastic

1072
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,500
job marketing it to the federal
government

1073
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:36,480
they run all the classes that people pay
for they put all

1074
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:41,420
all the books that people pay for they
run all the tests that people pay for

1075
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:44,499
so what what the fuck does she do

1076
01:05:44,499 --> 01:05:48,970
do but what what do they do

1077
01:05:48,970 --> 01:05:52,859
alright this non-profit collects 23
million dollars in revenue

1078
01:05:52,859 --> 01:05:58,430
from I TPG each year believes this is
the last year I think it at one point it

1079
01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:00,250
was as low as $6 million dollars

1080
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:04,650
for for running on a website and mailing
you pieces of paper

1081
01:06:04,650 --> 01:06:09,339
so hot I am in the wrong we are all in
the wrong business are we

1082
01:06:09,339 --> 01:06:15,900
so by the way

1083
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:20,339
pay attention to the titles on my slide
so

1084
01:06:20,339 --> 01:06:24,819
the CISSP common body of knowledge
currently has 10 domains

1085
01:06:24,819 --> 01:06:30,609
to pass that exam you're supposed to be
proficient in all those domains

1086
01:06:30,609 --> 01:06:34,270
and each exam is gonna 50 question six
hours one sitting

1087
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:38,130
a I know there's like a there's like a
lite version is this where Lake you know

1088
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:42,470
if 250 in six hours is too hard it's
like a hundred and three hours

1089
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:45,809
on really

1090
01:06:45,809 --> 01:06:49,770
I'm but anyway so that's what the test
consists serve and that's all it takes

1091
01:06:49,770 --> 01:06:51,900
to get certified is to go through the
process

1092
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:55,500
and take the exam and then you and the
somebody like out for you and say that

1093
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:58,490
you know in some a copy of your resume
which they don't validate

1094
01:06:58,490 --> 01:07:02,380
and somebody puts a a number on the
thing and signed it like there that

1095
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:03,740
person but they're not really

1096
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:06,839
you know they're just checking the name
and the number validation

1097
01:07:06,839 --> 01:07:10,450
so anyway so I'm I'm not saying

1098
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:15,029
you could lie and kisses P but you could

1099
01:07:15,029 --> 01:07:19,799
art tho

1100
01:07:19,799 --> 01:07:23,599
I decided that that the O evidence-based

1101
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:29,039
arguments are the most effective so
here's a graph

1102
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:33,779
this graph is um a frequency brakeman it
looks like button on the screen doesn't

1103
01:07:33,779 --> 01:07:35,589
matter yeah

1104
01:07:35,589 --> 01:07:38,630
alright so I will walk you through this
because it was so bad

1105
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:42,490
right so this piece of the pie a

1106
01:07:42,490 --> 01:07:47,059
rate here is 50 questions in the 250 and
they tell you this going in

1107
01:07:47,059 --> 01:07:50,660
are for a.m. boldness and then

1108
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:54,329
I the psalm notice that they have seen
99 shelves

1109
01:07:54,329 --> 01:07:58,650
shaped that shouldn't be there could be
perhaps and then they were stopped from

1110
01:07:58,650 --> 01:07:59,200
backup

1111
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:04,170
unfortunately set back up c99 shall weld
of keeping your audit trails

1112
01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:07,430

account is not the IT security director

1146
01:09:58,909 --> 01:10:02,929

security director

1147
01:10:02,929 --> 01:10:08,130
such sorry Mike I'm didn't do this not

and just explain to me what's a webshow

1150
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:16,949
24 you work in an industry

1151
01:10:16,949 --> 01:10:22,230
well basically all you do is the web
your security director in charge before

1152
01:10:22,230 --> 01:10:23,830
King webshop

1153
01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:29,090
you don't know what a webshow East's the

1155
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:36,469

1156
01:10:36,469 --> 01:10:40,090
our phones now I'm we've known about it
for years exists now for Kim

1157
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:44,370
boats on the maps is still being
actively exploited it easy to focus

1158
01:10:44,370 --> 01:10:48,270
do poor is still not been found an app
assessments

1159
01:10:48,270 --> 01:10:52,590
because you know PCI compliant merchants

1160
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:54,710
existing web show on their web sites

1161

1162
01:10:58,790 --> 01:11:03,570
presided now fine a point as IT security

1164
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:11,260
budget one

1165
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:15,000
represents now partners

1166
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,770
legacy K is still used yet still being
used in lotsa places the bridge probably

1167
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:21,690
shouldn't be using it like for panorama

1168
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:25,940
ISO Control some really interesting shit
