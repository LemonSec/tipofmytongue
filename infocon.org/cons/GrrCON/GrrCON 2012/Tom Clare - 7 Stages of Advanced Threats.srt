1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,560
hi thanks everybody I know about lunch
coming up some move along pretty quick

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,850
on fifty-some other Star Wars metaphor
we just had this room this

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,250
pictures gonna play rated are gonna get
into a bunch

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,730
DLP as a defense which is a pretty cool
stuff

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,230
seriously brought out 10 you defense
technologies using DLP engine so

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,180
criminal crypto password file of textile
CR

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,340
upon text and images about cool stuff so
let's talk about

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,099
and move the conversation into the
advanced stages what you can do for

9
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:30,789
containment

10
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:35,559
so I've been around for two years is too
military firewalls long time ago as part

11
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:36,040
Mac

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,160
the laptop nineties back pre-internet it
up

13
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,010
I was in product management checkpoint
for many many years firewall VPN

14
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,980
up spent eight years a blue coat large
proxy gateway

15
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,280
fortune 500 all around the globe and I
Websense year

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,420
mainly because %uh the DLP engine and
what you can do it as a defensive work

17
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,670
seeing that innovation

18
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,600
my previous employer so it was kinda
nice to move over to allow

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,210
where we've got some stronger tools cool
things first

20
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:07,439
up party game things changing for you

21
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,600
now as part of a package for many years
and anti viruses

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,610
you know the signature detections are
working like they used to I'm and the

23
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,860
good days they radiate ninety-one
percent

24
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,520
cleaning might be 65 Sep sixty-eight
percent

25
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,220
now in the 30-50 percent Rangers for
what the signature defenses can do for

26
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,229
known threats against changing the clean
but doesn't work

27
00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:31,130
matter fact the last time you seen your
system wake up within a dealer

28
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,670
doesn't happen often so you gotta moved
into more frantic analysis

29
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,579
sandboxing tools you need to understand
the value yourself you have to identify

30
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:42,970
infected systems remediate based theory
and Mitch

31
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,560
love the convenience Maston hour gone
away

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,880
render this custom crafted targeted
stuff and

33
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,490
will change the playing field some other
big changes the obvious I was any

34
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,750
signature bass stuff

35
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,040
I is a sacrificial lamb defenseman
alright see

36
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,649
gotta wait for the mass detection most
bench teams are 15 12 people

37
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:05,840
I'll take the highest volume high impact
stuff study a

38
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,090
so what a cybercrime done they've got a
low-profile below the radar

39
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,510
staying away from best teams in that
kinda make signature

40
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,879
whether it's a you're our even
reputation less effective

41
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,890
on the other thing is obviously a lack
of real-time

42
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:25,430
engines that's one thing I look for sale
a proxy gateways to stop the traffic

43
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:30,050
and you can rip through the content the
scripts are you go to the header stuff

44
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:30,840
you can look for mouse

45
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,330
command you can ripped through all the
the dynamic links

46
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:38,260
refer you can understand the hauling
chain you can get into

47
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,879
a lot more contextual information do a
better job than

48
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:46,660
do that a composite scoring way some
predictive analysis and you got a shot

49
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,650
and adding another

50
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,440
ten to twelve percent effectiveness to
detection ranges right so you wanna

51
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,360
dial up somebody's techniques the third
one's pretty important kinda plays of

52
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,790
the All Star Wars metaphors that most
networks are built with forward facing

53
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:00,659
defenses

54
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:04,849
I pull airplane symbol on the chart here
saigon the airport to get on the

55
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:07,840
airplane ideal time you gotta go to the
whole strip searched the whole bit

56
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,599
especially if you're like over in tel
aviv you're flying to Germany like I was

57
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,230
on one trip

58
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:15,540
as a four-hour shakedown I so you can

59
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,110
international place is a good for more
serious but then once you're on the

60
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,800
plane

61
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,450
I grab someone's back in walk-off quite
often happens accidentally

62
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,319
affect the present our company walked
off the wrong bag and was followed

63
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,170
medicine

64
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,540
how that individual needed their
medicine for six hours in

65
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,709
kind enough to contact each other and
hotels helps which bags but if you're a

66
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:38,989
malicious and stuff someone goes the
bathroom falsely

67
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:42,129
grab some other technology paying
attention to it

68
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:45,159
walkouts this airplane model security

69
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:48,290
doesn't provide any containment talk
about containment

70
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:52,480
Francis today and then there's the whole
you know packaging more the same stuff

71
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,530
up with different names and as I was a

72
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,680
a new generation of people have actually
been doing a staffer

73
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,569
twenty-some-odd plus years by me a lot a
new folks to its summer the old stuff

74
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:03,720
just repackaged again in sandboxes

75
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,930
around for a long time some people get
excited think its new

76
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,040
lot other techniques are out there al
Qaeda build of each other so kinda

77
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,680
strip away the the marketing sticking
really get down to the basics understand

78
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,459
the fundamentals

79
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:20,269
you should be able to get those
technology papers the arm

80
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:23,570
advanced threat stages they don't apply
to every throughout the should start

81
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,750
thinking this way

82
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,009
most people think a dropper files in
Cary North Block with your als

83
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:33,160
those %uh the stage is AC five and six
but begun to realize a lot

84
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,550
reconnaissance gone on our customer
orders

85
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,580
stuff it's bill just the fact that you
came to this event

86
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,830
someone profile do they might send you
know agenda day

87
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,889
that's how they got into a bridge laps
the second break and Oakridge labs

88
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:49,169
was an email about it and update that
those people

89
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:52,740
a-tens fifty-five people open email to
people collect

90
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,750
and well what they saw was the guest
book from 1990 to 2004

91
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,360
by his identity their birthdays number

92
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,580
some pretty interesting house this whole
targeted attack

93
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,610
things coming on pretty strong as you
stay below the bench teams stay on the

94
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,620
radar

95
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,020
up the big labs the Mac semantics Spurs

96
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,630
us the other stuff to get a bill to
reserve a custom of a similar style that

97
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,229
these the dynamic redirect as you know
every web request

98
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:25,710
i still meet people that think think
there's one web request

99
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:31,690
like now there's a 150 to 175 dynamic
URL that fill out the average web page

100
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:35,610
how a lot of dynamic content coming and
it's not really just want request

101
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,690
and there's opportunities for Albert
Ising about advertising links on all

102
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,820
sorts of stuff so blind redirects happen
all time you just don't know it

103
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,460
example the the Canadian boarding
process

104
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,180
exposure class presentations pretty good
the exploit kits are getting stronger

105
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,740
some black hole

106
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,069
Phoenix all the other ones out there
matter fact they keep adding more more

107
00:05:57,069 --> 00:05:59,610
zero-day vulnerabilities it's very easy
to use

108
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,490
in this changes threat delivery to a
sniper type aspect

109
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,720
and they're going to take the shot with
the dropper file know they got the oven

110
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,380
ability

111
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,580
other than that the redirect is going to
blindly go by redirect you to where

112
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,350
you're going

113
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,960
you even know what happened your sniffed
your check out

114
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,080
your seven Isles device for some there's
not too many exploit kits gone after

115
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,490
that

116
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:24,800
Window System with some old job on its
moldova code is just Swiss cheese

117
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,280
and so they're gonna take a pretty good
look at what you have there yen

118
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,740
then the dropper files come and
obviously the trip to the usual step six

119
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,690
pack battery

120
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:36,300
defense is classically call home
analysis

121
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,080
lot of people don't have you should be
looking at and ask you should be

122
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,190
looking at some other variables I'll
bring up custom creations

123
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:48,210
stuff better and data theft itself and
most people look to deal P

124
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:52,460
as though its regulatory compliance
allow these projects kickoff to go for a

125
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,699
year or two

126
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:57,110
and all you're doing is data
classification your risk profile hasn't

127
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,370
changed at all

128
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:01,400
you just out there fingerprinting data
you tell

129
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,539
and there are advanced machine learning
techniques in other ways you don't have

130
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:05,639
to do all that it cost

131
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,840
Asian you can salt pepper the system
with enough data that

132
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,490
vans machine learning will go ahead and
take off right away should be

133
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,300
an a risk prevention status in about
eight weeks

134
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,770
on a decent project shouldn't hang
around for two years

135
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,970
see kinda got a lot to the Han Solo the
contractor from last plantation

136
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:27,090
watch the advice for getting really know
your data theft prevention and the

137
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,699
message that came out strong was prevent

138
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,030
ankle and did a good job bringing out
the end is if you don't move to

139
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,650
prevention status

140
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,289
you not gonna change a risk profile I
think you did a good job so

141
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:42,919
you'll find the seven stages a very
handy to use in discussions ass benders

142
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:44,060
what do you do about this

143
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,250
how do you detect explico how do you
play three tracks

144
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,780
what is your call capabilities can you
detect any data theft

145
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,520
this is a very nice storyboard for you
to use derogatory

146
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,060
to find out how defenses working what
you actually our own

147
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,460
know what you're gonna get from the
vendor its gonna some innovation

148
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,639
technique some simple slides here but

149
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:07,160
encrypt it uploads whether it's the
protocol the red line towards the actual

150
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,030
file itself

151
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,539
we can take basic pattern all the known
ciphers

152
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:16,490
so it's not a noun ones that we know
it's something it's custom

153
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:20,080
to be more marketing like about a collar
criminal interruption be more fear

154
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,979
mongering but

155
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:25,020
its custom trips in its non-standard
stuff you should know if that's leaving

156
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,520
your network

157
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,599
you can tie this in with things like geo
location and Cyclops Southwest Airlines

158
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:34,560
and wiser custom a trip to traffic going
to Estonia from an hour

159
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,990
not a good thing don't know what it is a
kick it into it by

160
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,760
raising my routes and again this morning
awareness

161
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,269
the communications so this is one of the
things that is gonna show up

162
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:50,070
mysteries new defenses do this now if
you do have access the actually see in

163
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,120
the file

164
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,170
you should be looking for password file
theft in this is just a binary features

165
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,610
turn it on Sam database actor database

166
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,769
those formats are known you can mix the
formats up

167
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:06,029
you natural language processing location
a list of built in these engines

168
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:09,519
you should be able to pick up if the
files can be seen anybody trying to

169
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,779
exploit password files

170
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:15,600
the first things I want to do again the
trip to one's binary check this one's

171
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,910
miners feature

172
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:20,000
are entry-level proxy gateway is now
have these features

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,019
as well sir past ones so this is the
stuff yesterday using

174
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:27,269
next up is not document data theft more
more

175
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:31,230
mobile devices out there taking pictures
I always choco we have our annual

176
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,920
Partner

177
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,500
someone high level gets up to give their
pitch in on the legal slide comes up

178
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,640
what you're about to see is confidential

179
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,500
everybody's phone comes I'll slide 1
clicks like to collect all

180
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,580
solved our presentation is on there
devices in a matter of minutes

181
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,740
as you go through it and so you gotta be
on a position to use 0 CR

182
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:56,209
now most web gateways but 8587
standalone is on the rebound right the

183
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:57,190
response coming back

184
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,970
you might be real careful looking at
that traffic is you can really screw up

185
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,339
the user experience

186
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:07,180
on the outbound its 15 17 percent back
on a range is very elegant place

187
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,980
the throne smart offenses you can
actually look at all about images

188
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,339
use LCR scraped attacks from are you can
look for standard stuff like

189
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:18,420
confidential and footers and footprints
you can look for

190
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,690
registered eight if you want that
standpoint

191
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:25,470
the test we do we all know and love
people just use iPhones droids whatever

192
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,410
take pictures a stop-and-start senator

193
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,690
you know pick it up people out tonight
opener

194
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:36,720
so the image file image files in general
on the internet generally

195
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,040
now 3537 traffic profile it most im bout
analysis

196
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,190
avoid them there are a lot unknown
threats an image file system

197
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:50,209
result and stuff but generally AV
engines and other defenses will say look

198
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:51,730
it's an image file

199
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:54,779
true file type it TFTs that's positive

200
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:58,500
looks like it's the right type file
gotta go bye because you're gonna get a

201
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,920
12 to 15 percent performance benefit

202
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,970
gateway and performance is really
important when you deal with every mouse

203
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:05,860
click

204
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,709
internet cell its common own open area
with cybercrime that image files dali a

205
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:12,019
look at the inbound

206
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:16,709
you now he looks out very nice
communication method you use

207
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:21,560
that's currently just wide open so we're
gonna tack that start to get into

208
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:26,529
Paul are taxed flow data leaks most of
our gateways are building architecture

209
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:27,070
look at

210
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:30,500
each instant by itself becomes a request

211
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,730
in comes back we don't look at multiple
requests we don't have a cumulative

212
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,040
knowledge

213
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,570
and so slow data leaks it's also called
repeal

214
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:43,480
he is another open area so why does this
PC every hour send out one customer

215
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,640
occur

216
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,720
I've set my DLP policy where I look for
at least three

217
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,290
because one's kinda acceptable plus I
don't want a bunch of alerts cuz I get a

218
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,470
hundred alerts today I got too much work
to do

219
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:58,610
have the staff for its dial-up that
threat level on to say okay well office

220
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:03,079
if it's one or two it's okay and soul
cybercrime leverages this they learn

221
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:04,070
these thresholds

222
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:08,149
gonna go ahead and stay low and they're
very patient got time on their side

223
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:12,079
so slow data leaks another area and
again you can use deal is a defense

224
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,260
and you can allow the administrator said
basically an anomaly algorithm

225
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:20,730
and have them times t rights yet have an
advance within a time zone T

226
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,690
some other stuff we developed a check
for years ago use it

227
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:27,690
we called them at our back in the early
days checkpoint

228
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,720
now use this website as well we allow
you to define

229
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,970
now for DLP incidence

230
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,399
email security evasion this guy really
big shift in a lot of people come

231
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:39,220
blindsided by it but

232
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,930
you know hackers gonna send an email to
embedded link mostly the stuff that's

233
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,079
gone through is business related

234
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:48,940
FedEx delivery ticket confirmation
credit card affirmation time set up a

235
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,810
business topics

236
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:54,529
spam it's getting through I'm on the
converse on Facebook its

237
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:57,769
mostly lewers forty-two percent a
facebook is a social media streaming

238
00:12:57,769 --> 00:12:58,810
content

239
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:02,959
on that tends to be videos right the
lewers our greatest golf video

240
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,649
cam left on at walks in on daughter time
actress expose ourselves as hundreds of

241
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:08,490
them

242
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,769
so you got the website tens
entertainment the male side as the

243
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:13,010
business-focused

244
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:17,120
and what they're doing with emails are
sending an honor Friday or Saturday

245
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,060
maybe a Sunday your email gateway
analyze that made the attachment

246
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,600
announces maybe like an hour

247
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,110
explain they have an on the web site yet
Monday morning at 6am

248
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:32,079
the army website you put the email the
user and box on tonight

249
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,790
I got my favorite coffee shop open up my
email click

250
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:39,649
on a laptop outside the corporate
network probably just have AV

251
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:42,949
maybe there's a sweet personal firewall
hips cast-off

252
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:46,639
but I'm generally open to a brand-new
arm website

253
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,269
on its gonna go ahead and probably throw
me to exploit kit look for

254
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:50,060
vulnerabilities

255
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:55,019
zero-day heavy n I am and so you have to
really look at Sunday

256
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:59,370
email security doesn't protect on Monday
know you need to do is you to wrap your

257
00:13:59,370 --> 00:13:59,899
else

258
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:03,459
if you can allow embed urals go through
email you wrap them

259
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:07,160
so that when they click on and they go
to a cloud-based defense the allies

260
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,850
real-time and that's what we're movin
email secures changed

261
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,389
there so you're probably hear more about
that from different vendors

262
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:17,690
three or four vendors to do it Websense
is one as well

263
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,709
we call it your all email Sam boxing
some people call redirect wrapping

264
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:26,149
some to put on your radar screen here's
a nice example

265
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:29,420
house actually build the pics to go to
London and launched on these two

266
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,940
defenses and stuff

267
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,870
this comes in 12 30 on Friday absent
Websense email

268
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,930
first a while our security company while
to come through it's got an HTTPS like

269
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:42,510
which is great because most people are
messing with SSL

270
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:45,899
beautifully crafted and it's like a
debit to my account much like

271
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:50,490
what's this mom we here about six to 10
people

272
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,690
remember the last love those executives
love people public exposed

273
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:58,519
Downey so first initial last name webb
says to calm pretty easy target people

274
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:02,089
I want to give to laugh researched it
was malicious was a malicious link it

275
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:03,500
was a spear fish

276
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,589
so here's the custom crafted lower
here's the redirect

277
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:11,370
SSL if you're not expecting us all
traffic you're gonna be her

278
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,620
the other thing just to bring up an SSL
real quick is it's greatly growing

279
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,470
rights 15-20 percent

280
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:20,050
its common now to go to customer an hour
cloud-based aP's

281
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:24,800
people using more more mobile platform
to see sixty percent I was a one company

282
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,269
seventy percent SSL

283
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:31,769
those kinda SSL olds will hit you up
gateway and deliver about one-fifth the

284
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:33,610
16 the performance

285
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:36,750
you got a Web Gateway the hand of 10,000
people use on the go

286
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:42,459
sellers 20 percent body and now it's
creeping past 50 heading toward seventy

287
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:46,120
because SSL Sky News defacto for people
for privacy

288
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,910
you're gonna find a gateways get crushed
so keep an eye on your laws keep an eye

289
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,630
on your CPU performance sister

290
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:56,110
May after major hardware sellers is
busted a lot of people

291
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:59,139
been in the shop so we actually go to
the whole load balancing our that we

292
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:01,050
show how all for gateways craft

293
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:04,440
order they dead inside yeah you guys are
just gonna

294
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,149
UN use exchanging inside totally

295
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:11,930
cloud-based male of based out you don't
have any IT infrastructure inside your

296
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,720
house anymore

297
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,639
and so watch for that so this is an area
got to inspect

298
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:20,740
alright so kinda moving solving open
issues

299
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,180
we really gotta look at protection for
advanced threat slow slow below the

300
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,040
radar

301
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,040
we've got it is containment for data
leaks I'll show you some these new

302
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,709
defense

303
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:32,620
composition again a threat dash for each
other through a dashboard

304
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:36,269
friends reporting you shall who how
their attack

305
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:39,660
where the communication destin what
would a was targeted

306
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,009
really on a lot less curious as we can
grab the data

307
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:46,959
the data that was a attempt stalling
friends data capture show that with this

308
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,699
stadium their profile

309
00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:51,699
you gotta kinda home and we're gonna do
your work you can just protect

310
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:52,810
everything

311
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:56,019
with super drawn level have to focus
socially important

312
00:16:56,019 --> 00:17:00,740
frantic reported a leaky I'm our
analysis and Sam boxes come on strong we

313
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,540
offer a club a sandbox or so that you
know better

314
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,140
I the key thing here is you can't push
the claim but many

315
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,929
a lot of other things that were nice in
life or gone away as affective

316
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:15,100
you have to understand you know how the
system was here registry to file changes

317
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,650
global and then go find other systems
like characteristic so

318
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:23,760
the whole reimage clean things consuming
massive amounts of times

319
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,339
and when I look a customer success
stories that's the biggest benefit

320
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:31,520
as we're not having image systems like
used to that performance

321
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,169
really pay attention yes performance you
get the school defenses

322
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:39,049
at the defense is used on the outbound
public user

323
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:42,410
if someone's push in a whole bunch
offenses I return a response

324
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:45,650
and the processor intensive you may not
be able to turn

325
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:49,660
depends on your user audience or
performance memory 5 silos come about 15

326
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,640
percent now

327
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,080
if you can put defenses on the outbound
of a good chance you can leave my apt up

328
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,100
rights revert right architecture distal
advertised Websense does leave

329
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:04,780
put all this together the key things we
use our truck seeker intelligence

330
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:08,400
tied into Facebook about other stuff we
have an ace defense engines actual about

331
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,990
seven defense assessment areas

332
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,610
and this will be built at the OP engine
and we've got three different now earns

333
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:15,510
there's

334
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,640
now analyzers script elisa's lotta stuff

335
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,260
many from our security lapse were in
five different comments and

336
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,280
over 120 people there's

337
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,970
the race engines used in seventeen
solutions across this product I want to

338
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,760
hone in on as the web one

339
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,770
are you steal p web email our building
out cloud now

340
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:39,130
will eventually have DLP across all five
areas for mobile today with the mall

341
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,740
email DLP so I emailed on your mobile
device

342
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,830
force information there were building
out cloud

343
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:49,270
register data stuff for the cloud

344
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:54,049
we added these ten new defenses 3 a.m.
and read those are on the outbound

345
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:57,230
him down the new ones the

346
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,250
outbound green path so kremlin trip it
uploads

347
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,919
base level proxy advance when you can
detect files contain

348
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,620
house for these are finer switches you
can just turn on vans Mauer commanding

349
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,260
control

350
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,630
market place's got OC are you got acumen
GOP

351
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:15,419
geolocation geolocation can apply to any
of those

352
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:19,720
and what this comes a value in you can
pull into any threat dashboard

353
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,210
you can see all the other security
events we pick up you can look at it

354
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,240
from App

355
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,950
Heights Rd area chart marjorie want you
can dig into a security incident

356
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:32,240
and no by User ID and your group who is
compromised

357
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,830
how them our works where geolocation
what

358
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:39,370
actually click on the date and see what
day it was attempt to be stolen

359
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:42,809
in the blue LEP sees you can go over to
the sandbox

360
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:45,960
so is the seven different areas we dig
into

361
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,480
it's a new threat scopes am box if you
look at fire ice stuff like that's very

362
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,410
similar

363
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:53,490
I think what some the difference is ours
were actually gonna give you

364
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:57,309
better user I'd any information geo
destination location will pick up

365
00:19:57,309 --> 00:19:57,960
friends

366
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,320
data and give you a few five or six more
variable

367
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,250
folks so you can take a look at this
thing down a water sample reports and

368
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,070
stuff but

369
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:09,190
these are the tools are coming into the
forefront

370
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:12,690
fires effectiveness our goals to move
into that predictive

371
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,870
quadrant front known threats real time
analysis we keep putting more more

372
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:17,700
working here

373
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,429
taken DLP built-in as a defense engines
are trying to give you more tools to do

374
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,539
a better job

375
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:27,440
and there's quite a bit more to come or
actually keep pushing the ideas

376
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,299
got a whole nother way we just launched
the standard defenses Morcombe

377
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:36,120
a lot it's also really pushed up you can
get that same defense remote users

378
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,659
remote users are kinda screwed over it
how they don't get the same protection

379
00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:42,919
is on promise an on-premise people have
the best offenses but

380
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:47,030
when a remote but a lot of people are on
you can be on some other basics so the

381
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,010
industry's gotta

382
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,159
cough up and do a better job there

383
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:55,159
alright a couple examples is having some
case studies and this was about forty

384
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:56,650
thousand years our medical

385
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:01,600
facility 50 percent reduction Mauer
incidences critical stuff they lower

386
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,340
their spam rates

387
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,590
they deployed Web email a deal PL
integrated together

388
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:10,230
obviously being a medical facility it's
very important for pH

389
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:13,260
hi type information day

390
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:17,260
dropper after structure from 16 to six
appliances use cloud cleansing

391
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:20,970
we can actually clean our email for
deliver Tom so that knocks down about

392
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,270
seventy-four percent

393
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:27,030
mellowed which reduces bandwidth reduces
the appliances on-site service and cost

394
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,850
savings tricks when you go hybrid

395
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:33,429
now and you also want a cloud-based
email to use those rappers I talked

396
00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:36,380
about some people of a coffee shop the
click on

397
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:40,600
URL goes that cloud defense for real
time analysis

398
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,870
remember that the sunday defenses don't
protect Monday so

399
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:48,179
these people picked all add up greatly
reduce them hours

400
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:51,570
this one federal agency it's actually
Health and Human Services

401
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:55,260
medicare medicaid FDA CDC

402
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,970
as eleven different organizations here
the crew obviously

403
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:03,690
medical information overall federal
government gets hit pretty hard

404
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:08,250
very important customer they estimate up
to my attacks month

405
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,250
they had over 60 percent reduction
system reimaging

406
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:16,169
which saves IT people time the embedded
DLP is built right into the engine sit

407
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:16,710
in the AC

408
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:21,620
engine it's an email gateways myself
save-a-lot cost to the taxpayer to get

409
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,570
the money back

410
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:25,850
sorry they actually when did some other
projects

411
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:29,270
so damn thats heads up the sages stuff

412
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:32,980
saw some significant returns so were
kinda happy that these defenses are

413
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,500
showing these kind of results

414
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,600
there around the industry for
twenty-plus years and you know

415
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,669
the same old stuff around this time to
change things containments very

416
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:42,610
important

417
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:46,610
again the presentation was before just
mine Star Wars metaphor

418
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:50,220
really hits and you gotta have prevent
turned on you should move towards risk

419
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,539
reduction policies

420
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:54,549
and allow these new fences are available
so look at your current infrastructure

421
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:55,890
look at upgrades

422
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:59,020
you may be able to reduce your fines for
praying he's called

423
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:03,179
cleansing Miller fights better defenses
and put you in a better position

424
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:06,929
and again I also be a statement
fear-mongering or going into

425
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:10,179
senior executives and sounds guys
kitchen any

426
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:13,950
any support you gotta come in with
practical rising tools

427
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:17,140
so a raid on the time there comp tech
questions

428
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:22,840
have to take those yessir

429
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,620
the there's product called web filter it
actually started 1998 Websense that's

430
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,419
basically just URL filtering its are

431
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:33,340
entry-level product probably about 12
percent over sales today

432
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:37,210
based about AP senator businesses
gateways now so proxy based gateways

433
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,669
email gateways cloud

434
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:44,080
presence so that's a a legacy pride say
Websense is 2007 spit over seven million

435
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,320
dollars in the Gateway technologies

436
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,789
the acquisition the DLP technologies in
07 and building that in the engines

437
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:50,490
really

438
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:53,789
reshape the company so I wouldn't look
at Websense

439
00:23:53,789 --> 00:24:00,789
filtering company faggots kinda with

440
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,470
so the question is does the OP other
cable LCR yes it does

441
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:09,510
as a 77 you can do it for discovery

442
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:13,080
to do it on a date and point to do the
data security gateway to do in the Web

443
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,090
Security Gateway

444
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:18,049
and also email gateways so it's pretty
prevalent across all those

445
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:25,049
areas we use the engine

446
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:28,510
Websense has a mobile client I

447
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:32,049
if you can use Isles devices Android
devices is actually our cloud-based

448
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:36,380
so on i'll settle VPN profile to protect
the mobile device if you wanna send the

449
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,860
data channel through their

450
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:42,580
I the DLP technologies on the Klaudia
per se that we wanted yes as the future

451
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,100
doing that right now it's a

452
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,789
a spring 2013 item we also have for
