1
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,339
howdy everybody

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:12,250
the big group of people doing so little
about me just real quick before we get

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,380
started as a knot things up

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,470
state an exit from Michigan for those
that didn't know actually grew up in

5
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,350
Redford Michigan

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,740
about four blocks away from Detroit
moved Ann Arbor spent a lot of time to

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,230
do them

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,820
those above those that support you know
the Wolverines and for those of you that

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,220
don't

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,349
okay but some heavy be back

11
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:31,800
actually really excited about the fact
that there's a conference in Michigan

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,110
that we can come to actually talk

13
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:37,250
exciting for me I all around a lot of
talk to other places

14
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,760
but having worked here and having
struggled to get money to fly out of

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,520
state to conferences for certain things

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,690
I think something that's a little scary
actually so hopefully all here to learn

17
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,329
about the human mind because I love the
human mind

18
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:53,420
to the mall your minds all very
fascinating me

19
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,270
spent my entire life dedicating myself
to understanding why you do things

20
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,930
and then secondarily how I can get you
to do those things again so this

21
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,480
presentation is really about

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,659
why do the things that you do that you
have no idea why and that being said

23
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:14,670
is the Foundation's social engineering
it's basically a predication of social

24
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:14,930
and

25
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,979
the social environment we're social
creatures Lake

26
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:21,509
any other a I like any other social
construction

27
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:26,340
any other biological entity we as as a
group function under certain pressures

28
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,240
and dynamics

29
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,509
in those pressures and dynamics evolve
over time but have

30
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:35,280
quarter relationships to you those
things we need to survive and some a bit

31
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,540
has to do with how society has taught us
to survive

32
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,720
and this particular image by the way is
one of my

33
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,720
favorite images in the world l3y

34
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,720
some love you were looking at this image
thinking that guy's losing his pieces

35
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,259
right that by the first solve your
thinking

36
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:55,500
well maybe he's getting his pieces back
a social engineer on the other hand look

37
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,409
at that image in goes

38
00:01:56,409 --> 00:02:00,450
who I can move the pieces had six

39
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:06,770
feeding like moving PC so in a culture
today we have built a culture of

40
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:10,720
love providing value in services your
service driven

41
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,090
culture you do not buy things you by the
with expectations

42
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,440
love them doing something for your
service and as we move the cloud

43
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,250
has moved more service pay subscription
you even sing traditional

44
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,580
commodity-based

45
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,319
understands like video game or other
services

46
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,739
start to become subscription from my
service played a videogame you once

47
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:32,930
were all service credit and what happens
when your service driven

48
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:37,510
you really cared the people that you're
working with get the services that they

49
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,230
and you drive into those people who are
your phone contact people

50
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,569
that they should under no circumstances
upset

51
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:48,569
customer because the customer might take
its business to alternate service

52
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:52,920
and that would be losing revenue so the
first stage in this game is absolutely

53
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,390
everybody in this room is wired to help
all where the hell because

54
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,700
one beyond this but society as a whole
word

55
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:04,890
deeply to help and that wire miss that
help that desire to provide

56
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,040
value in services makes my life really

57
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,580
so was a social engineer

58
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,790
you now there was an earlier social
engineering talk but i sat in briefly

59
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,180
objectified

60
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,430
to an engineer social engineers
essentially a three-part game right

61
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,360
first is Rico

62
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,690
I word everything I can about whatever
my party is

63
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,110
I were in their lingo I learned how the
popular think with a carer

64
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,560
and that's the most Park what you know
what somebody cares about

65
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,420
you can way with what they care about
their value systems are

66
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,690
by far the most easily influence things
in the world

67
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,950
if you ever wonder about that I ask dust

68
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:49,640
discuss religion with strangers right
because religion is a value system

69
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,069
that's all it is right it's a very
complicated value system with with rules

70
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:53,760
with

71
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,189
with rituals abounded I'm not saying
it's neither

72
00:03:57,189 --> 00:04:01,379
real or fake or anything like that
doesn't matter but I am saying is that

73
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,519
if you want to have a conversation with
somebody who's got a value system based

74
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:06,069
off a specific religious faith and then

75
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:11,049
disagree with that you will see how
actively people defend their social

76
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:12,900
mechanism a

77
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,220
I will tell you that some link is the
worst thing that any company could ever

78
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:17,519
do

79
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,259
and Lincoln is great for me really sucks
role you I used to spend time dumpster

80
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:23,490
diving I'm people

81
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,759
dumpster dive anybody actually ever done
dumpster diving awesome Omega

82
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:30,669
we were into ever get right anybody's
ever dumpster diving those two things

83
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:34,680
1 there's way too much people in the
world we should really really say

84
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,340
trees and two coffee crimes sock

85
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,290
just suck bigoted everything 16
everything

86
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,680
everything slowly coffee therefore
rather have been an appeal

87
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,000
right now rotten meat is better than
freaking

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,930
anyway I get off now but so we can solve
this problem for me

89
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:57,360
right now I just going to LinkedIn and I
typed e-bay

90
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,020
wanna bet like a hundred people show up
work for Bay not only does it show

91
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,370
where they worked closely with the do
not only tells me what to do which was

92
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,039
me with the

93
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,039
you in a pack it shows me with a cure
shows me what skills they have

94
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,090
it shows me how they relate to their
business it shows me who else would like

95
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,710
for them with their business

96
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:17,470
bills this entire social framework map
under company

97
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,479
it takes me on average when I'm doing it
targets keeping

98
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:25,160
on LinkedIn it takes me roughly 15
minutes before I have all the

99
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,360
information I need to start

100
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,570
calling information

101
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:33,169
now don't get me wrong I don't do that
spend a lot longer doing research but

102
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:34,550
that's just how easy it was

103
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,930
this is to take a I miss you to take
physical penetrations into the

104
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,410
environment get into the dumpster just
like get stop paying off a guide

105
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:46,280
garbage or whatever so I could get
access to track down and have your day

106
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,720
is ridiculous so if you're on LinkedIn
like prescribes upgrade you are

107
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,539
a break doing for your company wonderful
other things you're peaking yourself

108
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:59,330
speak a

109
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:03,030
you know getting access to employees to
be really hard thing to do

110
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,300
used to be difficult you step that the
cupcake pre-tax

111
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,039
have some reason for calling have some
relationship that the person wanting 81

112
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,789
not so much any you don't need that
anymore the service driven culture is to

113
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:15,789
find a way that

114
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:18,539
I can call you up and say I don't even
know what I'm doing and someone will

115
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:21,630
spend half an hour on the phone trying
to figure out what I want

116
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,060
so that they can likely to you can call
the helpdesk up you like

117
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,180
yeah I'm not even sure your company does
but

118
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,699
I'm problem and they work to sit on its
way with the company does

119
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:35,210
explain you how they can help its

120
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:40,389
on social engineers in specific their
mobile thanks to social engineers if

121
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:41,720
you're wondering what type I am I'm

122
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,460
connors I did a long columns I'm not
sure con game

123
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:49,020
got it right email that you click on
something on the way care

124
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,509
snide what I do do is convince you to
give me money but you can

125
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:57,360
resources convince you to do other
things probably shouldn't do

126
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,520
wide just my style

127
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,669
so getting access to people is always
the goal

128
00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:06,680
Mike socially here people are my keys

129
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,180
some people don't want iraq knowledge
wasn't email to you have you interact

130
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,349
with technology

131
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:14,699
and have the technology do all the work
for them and that's predominately

132
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,729
you see today it's very risk

133
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,770
for harder targets for pharmaceutical
companies

134
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,340
were thanks for people who have rejected
said segmentations

135
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,960
controls and have a very clear
understanding of how much their

136
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,729
intellectual properties were

137
00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:35,060
and that go through the process is up
protecting it that for people like me

138
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,060
we're the ones that actually physically
petrie organization and depart

139
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,569
things like keys inside USB keys inside
organization

140
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:45,810
or befriend the secretary or send
flowers to somebody

141
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,610
has about my candid whatever just do
these things

142
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:54,720
corporate espionage game so

143
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,810
preloading and protecting rates so these
are two techniques that use

144
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:02,900
at a very fancy names for life were less

145
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,389
I don't know why we don't call life
apparently your back

146
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:10,680
in the boardroom saying I like 7zip text
you

147
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,160
is got very popular P actually very
popular in if he's can anybody remembers

148
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,370
the HP Scan with Meg Whitman

149
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,099
the private investigators using free
texting

150
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,289
to get additional information best
investments were going

151
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:26,599
huge deal tech adjuster

152
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:29,800
your way I can call you and tell you I'm
doctor

153
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,990
so-and-so I all these wonderful things
it's not illegal

154
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:36,250
until like processor Russell that
threshold is

155
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,950
authority rate so I say I'm a doctor and
I can be met with Vice points for

156
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:44,279
right not attack on a person position
extra I call your doctor and I don't

157
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,890
give you any medical advice

158
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:49,459
I talk about something else perfectly OK

159
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:53,600
a so the first step is find out how the

160
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,470
I can't stress that in order to blend in
with the part

161
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,510
need to know how the Paul can't

162
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,690
just call up i'd a surf shop

163
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,810
from California and call up and say

164
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,760
yes I'd like to see the numbers on the
financial as before 2012

165
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,800
January word we have discrepancy in

166
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,060
back were I'm gonna get along

167
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,310
what and then when he gets up to someone
who actually knows what theyre talking

168
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,220
about he like

169
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,880
some guy like to see the HP on the phone
like I'd

170
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,970
so we're going to pop like and walkway

171
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,779
Bay we make on as I've said before with
wicked

172
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:37,920
review you don't right

173
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,839
and once we've attack once we decide
whether factories which is the local

174
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:42,149
most likely thing

175
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:46,180
you would

176
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,180
so recall was recalling me

177
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:53,300
so in the last social engineering pocket
upon a cool

178
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,800
some people was so been of ego is what's
known as an

179
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,029
open source information collection
system

180
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:04,329
in for more open source open

181
00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:07,440
and what that means is mining public
places

182
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,709
for about for your company

183
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:14,070
or whatever it is that I have Park

184
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:17,170
a I like partners specifically

185
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:20,800
there might be then to attack

186
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,670
customers you can shove off is when
customers a big deal but its future

187
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,290
partner pissing them off because

188
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:29,769
billions just in case you're wondering
like the last

189
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:34,100
capture the flag at

190
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,779
but I'd you have discussed his pretext

191
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:41,980
was Canadian Walmart and he said that he
was with

192
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,990
the UN and they were doing a

193
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:49,120
disaster preparedness drill about an
epidemic one no

194
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,420
you know what their capacity was to deal
with that

195
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:57,399
and so that he could you know help them
with the country

196
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:01,750
yes partners billions of dollars in
awesome anyway

197
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,560
so yeah I use LinkedIn of politicians
individuals public company relationship

198
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,519
to look at Twitter although

199
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:10,200
winners we cast because it allows the
company in Iraq

200
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,329
users this plus be to track how they
popped

201
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:17,529
their customers which allows me to wrap

202
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:20,240
even allows me to replicate the partners
better because I don't know what

203
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,740
partners

204
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,140
what customers we have been diagrammed

205
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,680
lucien and the next week

206
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,440
a NCR relationships everywhere slide

207
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,730
as I director

208
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:41,170
a you know log into all these different
various sites you can name them all

209
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,709
in some of them there I people I find
one LinkedIn

210
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:48,240
wrecked sure to find you on facebook
twitter

211
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,769
and what they find on Facebook and
Twitter start monitoring hop

212
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:54,000
and what they're going to harm someone
start looking for hobby sites that you

213
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,029
interact

214
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:58,570
and start looking at the way that you
your hands using those different or

215
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,440
actions like

216
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,300
I'm separate business from your personal
life closer and closer

217
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,880
confer which will go into

218
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,959
so who's using it is always a question
that I get like well who's using

219
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,480
social engineering how should I worry
about them who cares blah blah blah

220
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,610
so this is sort of my by default least
social engineering

221
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:21,310
right the good people like me people
like me

222
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:26,089
people like you salesman obviously think
salesmen use social engineering

223
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:29,820
said marketing people are actually
better than us addict

224
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,470
they've had way more time researching
how people thing and find the big one is

225
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:36,240
organized crime and that's probably the
one that most of us care about in here

226
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,050
today

227
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,560
is that organized crime uses malware
like it was a commodity chip rate you

228
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,550
can almost invested

229
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:45,339
this point and likely it is almost like
a market we can be like well I believe

230
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:47,029
that this particular our company

231
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:50,300
now wears a service company better
business than that network services

232
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:50,980
company

233
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,459
with their the market going to mark it's
that bad

234
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:57,820
vinik information the bad

235
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,700
rate the bad for the fish is this came
to the fore want know they're back

236
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:06,100
because you can talk to just about
anybody and they will know what they are

237
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,910
right if you want your mother you say
something about a 4-1 once Cameroon

238
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,500
Nigeria

239
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,339
she goes oh yeah Prince so-and-so
they're back

240
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:18,430
rate the mainstream knowledge no longer
good at it the fissures tend to be

241
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,450
moderately good at its you know you make

242
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:25,240
AT&T know this is you have weeks overdue

243
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,579
to me that's still in that sort of basic
phrase doesn't have my name in it

244
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:33,430
doesn't have any relationship to me it's
sort of a generic lasater's

245
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:36,730
do you have an AT&T account I hope so if
you do have one

246
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:40,389
checked Lee hope so if you have a check
Lee callously

247
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:44,240
that sort protecting that goes with that
I'm much more along the lines of

248
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,290
more specific and the ugly rate we have
script kiddies alright mafia

249
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:51,370
in school kids I'm an organized mafia

250
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:54,779
is you know this is out of Brazil
currently like the best now where

251
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:58,480
being written right now is coming
Gadhafi why

252
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,860
no making awesome nowhere but they could

253
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,050
they couldn't serve you malware as a
business to save your life

254
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,180
like they don't have the infrastructure
at the sophistication that still coming

255
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:08,430
out

256
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:11,779
Russian the organized crime russians

257
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:17,230
the chechnya

258
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:20,800
anybody know what this is any

259
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,519
already every move the freeze for
Knology

260
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:28,350
haha couple people for LG is the

261
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:32,300
early 18th century concept that you're
bringing side

262
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,420
and the way that it worked in the box
that you had on it actually determine

263
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,459
a person it was very very prominent

264
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:42,399
in Jack recaps one it a lot of forensics
evidence

265
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,329
analogy evidence in doctor case looking
for that guy

266
00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:51,490
good the pic used to take measures your
head

267
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:56,829
but the reason I have is that this
actually comes from a very famous

268
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:59,870
Grey's Anatomy not the show

269
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:04,329
before was a show it was a book and it
was known to be the best medical pacs

270
00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:07,850
in the world it's fine because one very
specific day

271
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:11,089
peery very good illustrations that

272
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:14,220
need different to this is actually in

273
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:19,010
whether and what I like about this is it
shows you something very specific

274
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:22,410
to see things like combativeness over
here you see things like

275
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:27,529
language for me calculations history
strategy over

276
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:32,470
does anybody have been no how they feel
this out

277
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:37,839
we've

278
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,339
absolutely right when he said was brain
injuries this is a mass

279
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:44,800
0 perhaps somebody got there had crept
in and they have a brain injury

280
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,130
and now they kick you act so must be
that part of the skull that does X

281
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:53,110
that's what we were that's what this is
on

282
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,990
compared to what we know today this is
the equivalent

283
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:01,470
what I would say you

284
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,990
what we know today about the brain and
how well we can damage the brain

285
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:09,029
and how much I know about how your
brains works should care if I absolutely

286
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:12,490
everyone in this room because

287
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:16,160
fMRI several hours watch the brain you

288
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,070
to the point now and we actually have
the ability to have a computer read your

289
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:19,459
bring

290
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:26,459
had a picture and say this is what you
were thinking about

291
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:31,019
so social engineering school districts

292
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:34,750
we have all these little mechanisms they
have antonin use in order to get

293
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,029
things elbrick sir said but

294
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:41,180
we have things like referential
Association

295
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,009
and everybody in here knows the
referential Association model

296
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:45,350
everybody's exposed

297
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,630
effective been desensitized to it at
this point still sort

298
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:52,610
and for referential Association I only
have you into

299
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:58,709
be Fiat commercial for the super sporty
Fiat 500

300
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:02,360
you know seen a commercial essentially
involves a not

301
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,919
stereotypically handsome man and its
fairly attractive woman

302
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:10,709
and she really likes him a lot is that
hard

303
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:13,780
which implies that I had the fancy car
very attractive women

304
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:18,480
would fight be very attractive and then
so I should buy the car to happen

305
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,299
very attractive women it on we all know
the reality

306
00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:26,039
that's just what they do index works in
the river most people don't know this

307
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:26,630
but

308
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,590
let's say you're not attractive woman
because you're more attracted to the

309
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,429
mail

310
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:35,049
what it says to you is that if you
yourself go after the guy with that car

311
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:39,400
you will be that attract that's what it
said reference while

312
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,320
other a

313
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,580
we use reference Association social in
here in specifically in this one

314
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,200
last line right here the california
state taxation for doesn't this

315
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,910
made it up

316
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,490
but I was giving a conversation with you
when you had no reason to doubt me and I

317
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,340
use that phrase

318
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:01,120
would trigger anything in your mind just
okay

319
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,830
okay use your

320
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:11,470
sensationalism the crop up

321
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,610
sensationalism I'll probably where

322
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:18,960
right oh my god this is the greatest
thing ever Steve Jobs died this is last

323
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,929
night workers

324
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:23,750
here's a picture Britney Spears you know
with her head shaved off sitting

325
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,280
upside-down

326
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,280
water K sensationalism is

327
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,549
artifact says society has picked up on
something if you don't know what it is

328
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:34,850
society within ostracized for being

329
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:39,340
and if we all remember brown rates we
should all start realizing exactly what

330
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,400
that feels like

331
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,809
it's much more subtle which deeper into
our brains not bigoted

332
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:47,150
very black terms anymore that's
essentially sensationalism does

333
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:50,370
says every the world is watching friends

334
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:54,190
you're not you artist see

335
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:58,700
UK up your you can read Harry Potter you
don't even know speeches

336
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:03,240
I we this things that sensation

337
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,010
and then scarcity scarcity weird one

338
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:11,039
works if it works well because you have
to have define scarcity models in order

339
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:11,480
to have

340
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,440
work really for fails older models but
scarcity like

341
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,210
realizes refractory to be controlled
realized

342
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:22,549
but actual truth is I'm not making that
up there is a critical bacon shortage

343
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:24,030
coming

344
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:27,200
and it's because the corn drought has
gone so bad

345
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,660
feed enough pics to make

346
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:36,850
so this scarcity erbakan's when cause
the ought to be Skyrock

347
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:43,820
scarcity does it's not be lit inflated
scarcity fanciful

348
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,520
acting all social engineers essentially
or

349
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,850
country for just playing a role Hall a
bus

350
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:54,530
in the world are the people you are
whole are not the people you are in

351
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,179
society

352
00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:59,210
this aside said and Levi legal several

353
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:03,190
their concert I'm fairly sure that all
of us apart

354
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,990
wanna execute something wanted very very
badly the situation

355
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:11,840
restrained ourselves because there are

356
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,919
rights that's what police car there the
social cops raided new

357
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:20,020
we as a society do not tolerate the fact
that you jump

358
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:24,330
Scott that's not accept you

359
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:27,470
well kid pay for it later in some cases
that might work

360
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,590
some people %uh normally in here I do
some sort of like

361
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,919
relaxing

362
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,750
if you don't think it's getting up your
act now better think I am

363
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,789
sithole walk over that

364
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:46,830
question overload question overloading
is very hot

365
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:50,490
in a very specific set UPI

366
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,860
like questionable earnings almost
exclusively used by

367
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,710
if you're wondering yes I used to wonder
around

368
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,440
money psych and the

369
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,830
part not made it all up

370
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:09,880
that being said question overloading I
mean people teen Gianna

371
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,880
was like a tax professional okay mad at
midnight

372
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,720
even John Edward that I was talking
about I will tell you the John Edwards

373
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,630
is the best

374
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:20,559
question overload ever seen egos

375
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,350
exam and getting something in J

376
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,900
J JA he should

377
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,500
relationship jape female might be a
female

378
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:36,289
J its K that is a question overloading
all I'm doing is said

379
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:39,600
out in audience so that at one point
something registers

380
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:45,590
you make you'll notice that I'm skating

381
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:49,130
thank you for that a

382
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:52,840
and once you once you do something then
locking you in the circle

383
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,929
your way past we to question overlooking

384
00:21:56,929 --> 00:22:00,409
question overloading in a more specific
rather than like

385
00:22:00,409 --> 00:22:03,909
question overloading use it towards
getting something out of some

386
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:08,799
Kevin first me is something along the
lines of hey how's it going

387
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,740
%uh yeah I'm really needs you'd because

388
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,470
you know my account number yeah I just
remembered with Daisy

389
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,809
one-time charge I had something to do at
three o'clock so

390
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:23,520
you tell me what my account number is no
idea need something for my counter

391
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,760
I did I'm sorry what do you need that

392
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,919
I gave you my name and you see that that

393
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,380
that question overloading dynamic it's
just the way to overload your senses

394
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:37,190
keeper critical mind being able to
access questions and keep you

395
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,559
responding to me not be responding
minute I responding to you

396
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,750
I've lost with works

397
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,409
now experts by experts

398
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:50,780
expert use the confusion I'll

399
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,980
explain something to you probably no

400
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:58,490
there's only one mental state what just
one mental state

401
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:01,679
that is so important to your brain you

402
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,860
ever it can to believe that state and I
but the vast majority right now we're

403
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,340
thinking

404
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,500
its fear never have gone its confusion I
know because that's the top

405
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,590
talking but fears and it could be scared
out

406
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:17,500
I mean bigger go to the moved scare

407
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,909
its you can few somebody

408
00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:24,490
and able to whatever they can I'm
confused as the worst state

409
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:27,669
ever be in up which is why

410
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:32,210
people who have mental problem

411
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:37,010
are often considered confuse work
confusing reality

412
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:44,010
you work you that's the confusion it's
very hard to pull off an

413
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,640
it creates quite a bit of work you have
really good

414
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,779
it backfires probably ninety said

415
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:54,570
even from somebody who's extra but when
it does work

416
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:57,419
it's like or you have to do anything
else on that point what you've got

417
00:23:57,419 --> 00:23:58,340
confused

418
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,409
you supply them with the answer that
solves the confusion and they are your

419
00:24:01,409 --> 00:24:02,279
best friend

420
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:07,640
save there said it's that simple

421
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,039
hand I think everybody in here public
but I'm where they were confused by

422
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:11,520
something

423
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,100
to me said something that sounded
reasonable and in five minutes later you

424
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,919
walk away with

425
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:20,309
were that's now right that

426
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:23,419
just makes you be whatever I can for
about five seconds

427
00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:28,120
lied

428
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,179
I think this one is all hacked you know
everybody knows

429
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:36,140
claiming authority right everybody knows
the power clipboard sure about that

430
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,900
nineteen eighties not

431
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,590
by the 1990s having a clipboard was
suspicious

432
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,730
by the 2007 support is just no way

433
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:49,919
you see people words

434
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,380
who might wanna check do stuff

435
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:58,340
opening i early ha but so

436
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:02,000
but planning authority for people like
me with slightly different

437
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,890
no wonder if what we do is clean

438
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:09,080
40 through its right

439
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,320
so I double statements of their my
people what actually is

440
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,720
what as anyone else taking CPR classes
no this is what we do

441
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,190
rate here I said that very authoritarian

442
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:26,140
very straight anybody doubt

443
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:29,190
no reason to doubt right its like you
read right

444
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:33,400
I know CPR first thing we should do the
trick ya to

445
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,409
up right that the cause reports yeah
okay

446
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:41,429
you know as the real thing CPR we need
to do is raise his head

447
00:25:41,429 --> 00:25:44,429
their his his bouts we can pre

448
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:47,590
I'll do that sounds reasonable ever take
a CPR class

449
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:51,690
no idea been but doesn't matter

450
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:54,950
saying he right you know never said I
could keep your glasses didn't do it I

451
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,500
just said

452
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,950
have you no well then I'm orbit or even
you are because

453
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:03,789
you don't know if you don't ask me if I
know

454
00:26:03,789 --> 00:26:06,980
and all rights

455
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:10,250
aggressive posturing

456
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,570
this is part of confusion use aggressive
are strangely Creek

457
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:17,630
aggressive Australia's a

458
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:20,700
it's more along the lines of discarding
just putting somebody your

459
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,880
more risk than they should added

460
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,840
but most often it's used by you know
front-line people

461
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,640
help the people aggressive Austria works
for like people were scared

462
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,090
work is targeting a management level
record level in you know aggressive

463
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:36,960
posturing just nothing

464
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:43,960
makes piss them off making one asked
questions about you

465
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:49,909
exactly preposterous was used in the see
if

466
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:53,809
social enter like using

467
00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:57,010
because apart from nearby city I don't
know but I know it's worth billions of

468
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,260
dollars

469
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:02,159
aggressive you personally are
responsible for this company losing

470
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:02,960
billions

471
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,770
you you that many of us would stand on
the other side

472
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:13,380
asked questions

473
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:19,440
by the way any draw my attention

474
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,770
petr apps my personal favorite better

475
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:28,600
actually have a blog out it was like I'm
uses a better

476
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,070
editor up to the ability to
short-circuit your break

477
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:35,380
want to give them as a buffer overflow
bring

478
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:38,399
what they all

479
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,610
but if somebody's having a very intense
conversation about something I don't

480
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:42,470
care what it is

481
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:45,500
you said see the purple

482
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,200
very nothing to do with anything

483
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,320
and they have to devote time into the on
into their into the process and

484
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,390
ever figure out what the heck you
talking about min supplied

485
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:59,640
you can see how this relates to confuse

486
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,340
got gotta love it what popped up

487
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:06,890
right back pattern Europe is a way for
us to stop you

488
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:10,840
from going down a path watch restarted
did not happen after questions that I

489
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,730
can't answer

490
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,909
I want pattern interrupt you so the you
rail your thought processes

491
00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:17,970
and then convert you to it happen more

492
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:21,380
beneficial my process of the times this
is

493
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:25,120
secured cards use this tougher security

494
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,460
X actually live there right penetrated
into a

495
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,559
into organizations sitting in the
finance department

496
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,000
and was having of actual financial

497
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,049
in the middle day became over like K

498
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:41,690
you should be accessing that like both
of these potentials we didn't have

499
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:42,110
access

500
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:45,279
whatever mine and that was my response

501
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,390
well a book colors /3 like

502
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:51,919
just want to stay but as long as they
don't you pause for is also don't you

503
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:52,529
think about

504
00:28:52,529 --> 00:28:57,140
covers three zones I keep going notice I
mean it's you know you know the answer

505
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:00,890
rate I created confusion what colors /3
I don't know

506
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:04,559
its yellow thank you for answering that
for me rate

507
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,909
it is one's life was good right the way
this actually works is

508
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:11,850
if I were to say to the phrase attack
what

509
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:15,210
know I'm the only what real quickly what
colours 3 know it now it's yellow

510
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:15,909
nevermind

511
00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:19,140
what would you say before you can say

512
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:24,000
access wall I've said something else

513
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,679
is about the fact that I had to reset my
password you know I just reset my

514
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,460
password

515
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,960
now wondering i reset my password
invalid access what you can with those

516
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,549
two things together

517
00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:37,899
and for a brief moment in time they will
make

518
00:29:37,899 --> 00:29:41,909
by then I'm running door hoping that no
one will ask me

519
00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:44,940
do it

520
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,970
reciprocation principle this is from the
strongest principle that we have

521
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:52,630
this is the one that most of it everyone
will fall for ivan is built into our DNA

522
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:56,909
from a social or social wonder

523
00:29:56,909 --> 00:30:02,200
and that is because this is as a long
ago when we were living in caves

524
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,919
and they were 12 us and the world was
scared

525
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,110
helping each other out which is about
the clan

526
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:12,899
ru try what everyone be needed to iraq

527
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:15,960
order to make themselves successful this
is so far

528
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,970
into your social a easily exploitable

529
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:24,240
and it is most commonly known as Fri Sep

530
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,870
that's the most on elegant illustration
up such

531
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:31,279
but it's the same thing that says a John

532
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:36,350
I noticed you like this sorta book every
day so I found one when I was on a trip

533
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:39,919
your day years now the next time you
come up to John

534
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,990
hey John you do me a favor he says will

535
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:50,279
even thought about me you know his so of
course I can

536
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:55,610
without the actual we bring more or less

537
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:58,789
I'm sleepy

538
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:02,120
I'm slick awesome I'm swings was used by
magicians

539
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:06,669
one I'm splitting is the fact that

540
00:31:06,669 --> 00:31:09,809
sound like crap different

541
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:13,000
and differences between your process
information and

542
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,600
actually happens are different so by the
time you hear my voice

543
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,690
I already said by the time you getting
your brain processes

544
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:23,649
put things into understand that there
were coming out well Rd

545
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:29,029
the further away you are for me ball
this

546
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:32,190
now you can use that

547
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:35,450
to do pattern interrupts you can't use
that to diffusion technique

548
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:38,890
do you that to call differential

549
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:42,870
perceptions based on certain things

550
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:48,250
magicians use a lot of

551
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:51,470
bites I am a bit just because they did
not know

552
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:55,529
mobile -ism the path to keep it isn't
man sleep

553
00:31:55,529 --> 00:31:58,630
is a very good example up times

554
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:01,799
cuz sleep doesn't happen for those I
don't you sleep like

555
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:05,690
sleep in work a whole bunch of factors
that go into one of which is touching

556
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,809
which is turkey bills with the area much
other stuff

557
00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:12,679
but the when I go when I pull your hand
your body jerks your

558
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:15,890
ships I see sleep sometimes

559
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:19,269
bodies receiving a physical sensation at
a certain time auditory nerve is

560
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:22,570
receiving differences at a different
time you bring have to pick and choose

561
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:24,210
which one is going to pay attention to

562
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:28,500
I'm going to pay attention when it says
I'm Pauly

563
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,350
I would so it's right by your conscious
mind rated

564
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:36,580
subculture go sleep I'd in Europe the
worker

565
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,750
so don't worry report

566
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:44,940
this number one skilled

567
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:49,510
the ability to make like at all that'd

568
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:55,730
so we're thinking

569
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:59,029
I agree that if I wanted like me I could
probably get there

570
00:32:59,029 --> 00:33:02,690
eventually this all goes back to a bunch
of different techniques that use the

571
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,620
most common which is language

572
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,750
which was backed by protecting

573
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:11,120
in making sure that I don't speak your
language speaking with you speak

574
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,230
somebody's you know dress right have

575
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:17,909
sir a bet synchronization is a good one

576
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:21,710
we the same rate likes

577
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:25,260
programming reading is actually boasting

578
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:30,820
biological synchronization when are

579
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:35,260
you can synchronize you want us to think
a very same

580
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:38,590
you some people

581
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:45,590
did side

582
00:33:46,029 --> 00:33:51,960
that is what piece away

583
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,580
but this picture his way

584
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,750
but let me either way I know

585
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:02,200
effect that particular girl up there are

586
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,850
standing stride free

587
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:10,940
the goal here this is how easy it is for
to drive to bring

588
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:13,950
I'm staying up here now driving your
brain brain does not understand this

589
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:14,579
image

590
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:18,720
intellectualizing put across to say I
understand it's not be

591
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,879
workable but if it's this easy

592
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:25,889
from your visual or just word play with
visual cortex

593
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:29,609
especially which is easy to do to
visualize

594
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:33,210
I can due to the restive years

595
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:36,429
for example how many people here just to
get

596
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:39,579
all of your hand with some fingers about
how many

597
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:44,109
nervous system you think you here

598
00:34:44,109 --> 00:34:48,230
you have to 3 5.1 over there

599
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:52,889
follow case for the most part the
country had

600
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:56,480
was actually free to speak nervous
systems in your body 3

601
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,640
one of them is the country's one we all
know

602
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,630
and record the second one your fighter
flight

603
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:07,010
we used to think that somehow they were
related

604
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:11,570
it's a completely separate nervous
system they both start at the stimuli

605
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:14,980
and we branch of different direction and
never

606
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,480
Shelby ever so I can affect change in

607
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,520
one it will affect change in

608
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,349
now the third one just discovered

609
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:28,810
and if involved

610
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:32,630
has no purpose that we can figure out
except to let you know that you're being

611
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,740
touched by another

612
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:39,119
at it's too slow to be a reactionary
reflect survival instinct

613
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,040
it doesn't carry any additional messages
about pain discomfort lawsuit obviously

614
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,500
designed around motor functions or any
other culture systems that we do

615
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,890
it's been there to tell you somebody
else was also we can

616
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:55,030
is touching on that your

617
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:59,329
services

618
00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:03,940
so houses all work he's a real world

619
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:07,470
that I in my previous life

620
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:11,740

I you fired a

635
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:13,660
in particular this particular person was
targeted because I found him in a form

636

thing about anti-virus and how was
screwing up so i talkin

guy system

640
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:32,480
ever and in stores I P its owner the key
thing about this one is

641
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,170
is that everything went into the
conference room to get rules of

642
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,250
engagement for the gay

643
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:39,640
walk back in the same day headed with
their own

644
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:44,740
intellectual property right that's the
only kind in my entire life I was a

645
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,380
social engineer

646
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:50,380
Rockstar rising yeah suck

647
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:57,380
right but only wanted the like
microphones like out

648
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:00,430
they were horrified needless to say

649
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:06,709
developers now hit me persona non grata
now the a

650
00:38:06,709 --> 00:38:10,890
so this one is about manufacturing
company anything

651
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:14,729
companies are interesting the have two
sets before prop no

652
00:38:14,729 --> 00:38:17,680
if the intellectual property of their
up-and-coming star which is there he

653
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:17,949
said

654
00:38:17,949 --> 00:38:21,430
designs the guys things than and then
they had

655
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:24,650
look for pop the things that their
current Sep

656
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:29,119
to get attacked different but in this
case

657
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,819
they wanted me to acquire proprietary
specifications for chip

658
00:38:32,819 --> 00:38:38,249
one so did a buncha stuff you can see
that it's all using the same things I

659
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:40,599
called when the previous lives there is
nothing

660
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:43,699
ordinary doing here a

661
00:38:43,699 --> 00:38:47,190
you can see that Lincoln's probably
display you can see that it might be

662
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:51,479
world are right you can see I

663
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:54,880
it's a Twitter conceded in Iraq awesome
that was for me

664
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,999
so I monitor Twitter

665
00:38:57,999 --> 00:39:02,459
I say okay partner event Halfpenny

666
00:39:02,459 --> 00:39:06,089
K I you know something

667
00:39:06,089 --> 00:39:09,109
for this event to take place working
people

668
00:39:09,109 --> 00:39:12,839
use the word Martin what I'd

669
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:16,509
because

670
00:39:16,509 --> 00:39:20,130
the state's these things that we we're
doing here right now make working people

671
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:23,449
spent the better life okay

672
00:39:23,449 --> 00:39:28,459
so necessary it said 23 people I got got
some its

673
00:39:28,459 --> 00:39:31,579
so

674
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:34,509
this particular person was a marketing
person they should have access anything

675
00:39:34,509 --> 00:39:35,390
that I wanted

676
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:39,969
right just a misconfiguration net access
record at one point I can like

677
00:39:39,969 --> 00:39:43,219
guess that they were doing a marketing
campaign and they needed access

678
00:39:43,219 --> 00:39:46,420
development specs hard-working and they
just never close

679
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:49,489
share so

680
00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:52,969
you know they had no if I station they
had no pac

681
00:39:52,969 --> 00:39:56,509
with was hiding although scares

682
00:39:56,509 --> 00:40:00,430
about the OP autrey right to be free HD

683
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:05,489
mostly strangely enough

684
00:40:05,489 --> 00:40:12,489
actually

685
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:26,910
actual 6 so fertile serve any questions
related

686
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,020
what you like throughout their question

687
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:36,610
I have both

688
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:40,160
so his question was is you have normally
accounting pay for premium Access

689
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:40,770
actually have

690
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:44,840
0 but normally the normal one will just
work

691
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,830
because you're not looking like the
premium stuff is about mining for

692
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:49,690
connections

693
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:53,650
and getting access to you either a
people were doing hiring

694
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:57,150
your a premium subscriber looking for
jobs or be

695
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:00,680
you're trying to mine for connections
for sale relationship you

696
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,840
you ollie sale so

697
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,930
the individual in for your the hierarchy
behind company that store publicly

698
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:11,140
and personally Lake

699
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:15,250
I think we should all being together is
group demand

700
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:22,250
inside

701
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:31,269
that I mean I would say

702
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:34,890
general yes inject question was

703
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:37,980
is it true the perceived authority which
from

704
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,500
or out the answer to that is you wuli

705
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:45,910
on it depends on the level stressors
that are involved in for those that

706
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:46,230
don't know

707
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:49,799
stressors are my miniature

708
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:54,589
stressors are those things that
posturings I

709
00:41:54,589 --> 00:41:58,430
professor just the name instructor if
you're like

710
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:01,640
standing outside a burning building and
people earning

711
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:05,859
runaround easy authority from morality
every right because you're in a state

712
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:06,599
where

713
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:10,240
your appendix a: we've we've defined
ourselves to trust persons in authority

714
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,630
specific like a fireman

715
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:15,769
such-and-such so you would defer to that
even if the morality different by

716
00:42:15,769 --> 00:42:22,769
now

717
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:34,620
know it I mean but this report with the
entries

718
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:44,950
fanatics

719
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:56,910
agree I said

720
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:07,830
oh yeah I mean yes yes

721
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:11,380
a religiously if you like which is why
what we

722
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:15,170
got walk away from unit dismisses
factors like walking over here

723
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:19,380
but some for those where we were doing
but to give an answer

724
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:24,340
why disagree with something that's is
fanatics

725
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:28,400
fanatics morality if imprinted into
their psyche to the point where it is on

726
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:28,650
break

727
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:33,400
right think the guys with guns guns is
sitting in his house and says I will not

728
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:33,960
pay

729
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:39,570
in compact authority is not driving
around in there

730
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:43,600
anyway she before right but yes in a
normal social situation

731
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,960
authority will always trump morality
unless of course there something more

732
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,470
severe

733
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:53,300
case like you know shoot that guy well
that way so

734
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,430
your back on the I have

735
00:43:56,430 --> 00:44:01,650
degrees in their appeal if therapy

736
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:04,950
mentalism

737
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:08,600
this forum magicians so

738
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:12,530
magic's all these things I use on a
regular basis to do

739
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:15,560
social engineering yes

740
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:22,560
to answer your question the clinical
definition all

741
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:28,760
there is no there is no clinical of

742
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:33,690
there's no clinical a study that shows
the hypnotherapy is any different than

743
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:38,680
you thinking yourself to yourself I want
to do the same all rights under the

744
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:41,840
PC preamble to think well

745
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,110
mostly spicy the

746
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:48,780
the placebo effect well-known everybody
in here its

747
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:53,720
what it is and does it really just
introduce you to do something

748
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:57,180
that consciously you or able you

749
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:00,450
so it's really just a

750
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:03,790
yep I just wanna know mind sort of that
true

751
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:07,120
actually about 1000 different centers in
your mind all picking about whether or

752
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,120
not they're gonna do something

753
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,280
there was once a great quote by

754
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,250
with and I think it was that I am actual
Rex

755
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:18,980
difference sets their centers in your
brain that but with each other over

756
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:22,220
whether or not you're going to do
something that slide

757
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:27,450
one couldn't do that bring with
competing so all

758
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:31,090
it is and does put you into a state
where

759
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:35,420
you are receptive the doings but it if

760
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:38,780
if it's not something you want to do
won't do it but but it allows you to

761
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:41,940
to get rid of all news here's a
manufactured yourself

762
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:46,030
district your online behaviors and say
you know what but stopping talk

763
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:49,520
every right okay

764
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:56,520
so yessir

765
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:14,100
request he's asking how do you protect
yourself and social engineering for

766
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:18,930
which was a question which was in the
last winter a

767
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:23,420
the first thing is is that all social
engineering field critical the second

768
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:24,430
you for critical thinking

769
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:28,370
all social engineering because we're
building this fictional

770
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:31,740
whether it's fictional for

771
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:35,280
whether it's a fictional urgency whether
it's a

772
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,940
a a fictional fear job

773
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:42,200
rates of fictional to the minute you
stop and ask yourself like this is

774
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:42,970
really make sense

775
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:47,630
all social injured just falls on the
ground so that's one thing

776
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:51,170
the second thing I think somebody
touched upon it is don't leave the

777
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:51,600
victim

778
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:56,330
right so he said that the stop playing
the victim

somebody who thinks about response with

821
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,050
three in some you just goes

835
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:13,670

will talk about yeah

843
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:55,080
so the question was is what kinda few
words with were

844
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:58,200
that mean yawn the first level of
support

845
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,960
or whatever to the next level a

846
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:06,800
I don't actually look for keywords for
process people were first line defenders

847
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,010
the either one of two people

848
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:11,320
people who know what they're doing the
people who were following the script was

849
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,390
never give you any idea

850
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:15,630
everyone's like it a third one but I was
not do so I was focused on

851
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:19,320
want to and this is we determine whether
or not script with everybody here knows

852
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,630
what the scripture

853
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:24,920
the easiest way to determine whether
prospectus ask out outbound question

854
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,170
completely out

855
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:31,590
like okay have you turned off the router
your pattern of the right but I have a

856
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:33,880
question for you you know with the
software

857
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:37,990
and the way with this is because i think
im in 2028 if you're in 2026

858
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:41,750
okay have returned the router back up

with social engineering never done

861
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:49,680
before

862
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:54,750
easiest place in the world to do it
helpdesk one they can't get too pissed

863
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:55,359
off at you

864
00:52:55,359 --> 00:53:02,359
into they're very strict yes

865
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:38,200
if fair so so

866
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:38,570
yet

867
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:40,810
its gonna do is a first I would just
like to point out that the question is

868
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:42,290
what somebody accident

869
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:49,230
that's awesome to I'm you have a war
that benetton

870
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:52,540
a this is the question was is so

871
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:56,020
let's say you're on the phone this is
not normal usage social injured

872
00:53:56,020 --> 00:54:00,290
does work on the phone with the help
desk and have a problem wanna sleep

873
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:04,670
escalate because well their train we all
know that their tree

874
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:09,960
there are a couple things that you
personal realize that you have no power

875
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,920
right that person's escalation process
is their decision you have to you

876
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,560
give them a reason to escalate because
otherwise they will get fired

877
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:21,080
that's how they think right you have to
think about how you think a bit like I

878
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:21,800
just want to get by

879
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:25,300
you have to think about it like this do
to get a job

880
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:32,300
it's not a great job world obvious
Michael and he's got us and he's very

881
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,600
good at what he can do

882
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:40,600
red yet

883
00:54:43,369 --> 00:54:50,369
words

884
00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:58,940
welders there's some things you can do
here's the you to find the trigger point

885
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:00,500
that's because that person

886
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:05,810
to referred that's what you mean you to
find out what that person

887
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:09,660
need so that he can want two things that
I do and this happens all the time is

888
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:15,930
what will make this so bad can't fix I
asked the question I did you

889
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:20,550
what make this so bad that you can't fix
it if it has this light on it has that

890
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:24,940
light what did she say that at the
beginning

891
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:30,450
I didn't know that what was important to
you told me right

892
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:33,960
there's that the other thing to do is is
is better case we have to do

893
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:37,140
report you have to give that person a
reason to help you

894
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:41,910
you have to explain you know just relate
to it be like okay if

895
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:45,970
I know you that's cool how much more the
script is there

896
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:49,130
how much more time do I need to do this
before we can

897
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:53,580
and sometimes you get the I don't know
sir will you please turn on the modem

898
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:58,430
that you know to Pinterest operate and
but sometimes you get that look man I

899
00:55:58,430 --> 00:55:58,820
know

900
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:02,250
right I know this sucks and I know you
probably know what you doing just let me

901
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:03,430
run for my checklist

902
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:06,950
I can do what I okay alright so

903
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:09,970

minutes on the phone with you

905
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:17,430

somebody about that and that it's not

906
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:18,050
about him

907

right you know not taking away his
progress rate you're talking about the

908
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:23,480
system has to run in

909
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:27,240
that we could escalate all day long like
and this guy

910
