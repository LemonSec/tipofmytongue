1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,449
very welcome we're trying to this is a
appeared thing

2
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:07,470
orbit about us

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,380
I have been at Michigan State now for 25
plus years

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,860
deters by students so

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,150
what I'm gonna show here he obviously
did all the work

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,330
his part

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,210
I'll active one is not being a student

8
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:30,390
with that let's go into this the real
emphasis here is on taking a look at

9
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,610
botnets and the interest here

10
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,700
eventually years work with

11
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:41,700
how people are stealing money using your
browser's word

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,530
each has been doing is sorta dissecting
botnets and

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,120
we're gonna try and give you a little
bit over sense of what's going on inside

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,000
those

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,260
latest generation so

16
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,770
to start awful to talk a bit about the
taxonomy of our brows from our

17
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,900
they were gonna talk about the browser
explore exploit packs

18
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,509
and then the you're so that's what

19
00:01:07,509 --> 00:01:10,590
that's what puts the nasty stuff on your
system

20
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,940
the drive-by downloads or what lead you
to the browser export Platt

21
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,540
of and now we're gonna look at so stuff
receive inside

22
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,940
so obviously

23
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,690
everything that we've done here is you
know doesn't relate to

24
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:30,350
stealing things so

25
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,479
first-generation what IRC

26
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,890
second-generation peer to peer and

27
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,700
we start getting into using Internet
Protocol

28
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,340
pretty much what's going on here is the
the trend that you see here is to try

29
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,209
and hide

30
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:50,509
try and bring in some more sophisticated

31
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:54,330
operates at not surprisingly

32
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:58,740
what you see these days using some
combination these three

33
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,920
for you just makes

34
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,200
more so in terms of the

35
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,039
taxonomy there's a few things we could
do here

36
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,450
you can actually put something inside
browser

37
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,930
you

38
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:22,099
what cross or and this is what we're
seeing a lot of now

39
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:26,640
actually start putting some books into

40
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,860
the into some other functions and
actually sneak in

41
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,000
that way and and that's a lot of what
we'll be talking about

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
the Devils really in the details and as
best as we can in this kind of

43
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,480
environment we're going to try and show
you some the details

44
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,159
at least is forests on stuff

45
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:52,489
and and as I'm sure many of you know

46
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:55,689
the details yet

47
00:02:55,689 --> 00:02:59,719
for you here okay so let's start with
the

48
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:03,379
browser export packs BP's

49
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:06,569
I always have trouble getting those role
of my car right

50
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:09,870
and and all right now black hole

51
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:15,819
is is one more a problem once the idea
is

52
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:19,750
alright how am I going to loathsome now
where

53
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,790
on your sis basic idea is that

54
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,439
the the EP is going to

55
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:31,519
look at your browser you know your fire

56
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,239
rocks for a terror I year

57
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:39,079
whatever you're running the air this
particular reason will look up

58
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:43,219
wow yeah I can I can exploit you with

59
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:47,140
with this particular one and

60
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,909
you know and that's pretty much you know
what its job

61
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:54,280
there's jobs the doing

62
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,709
and there's all sorts support for
plugins

63
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:03,329
they they get to be reasonably complex
piece is a sophomore

64
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:05,780
will have these available for you what
they rose

65
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,079
you know some more details how

66
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,150
in fact they do that you know

67
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,199
elsewhere so there

68
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,889
there's a there's pictures from our for
you you know if your

69
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:23,669
if you're taking the trouble to try and
dig into some of those

70
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:27,600
this is what it looks like you

71
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,780
you know what you trying to its track

72
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,009
here's something that was a little bit
more like

73
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:38,870
yet details of how we do that

74
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:42,110
I could spend all day on this stuff but
we want to get

75
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:46,039
just as an example

76
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:53,039
so years your cell

77
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,700
there are other ones

78
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,190
fetus and red

79
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:03,270
so so the server you know if you start
looking around for %uh some these

80
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,680
export pass there's a variety of them

81
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,520
you know so

82
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,560
what we're gonna do is actually he

83
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:21,230
in no in action what I want you to watch
for when you're looking at this

84
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,440
and I'll let the two show the softie

85
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,020
here I would you wanna watch for is you
know

86
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:33,670
why while this thing is is going we we
were courageous enough to do this

87
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:37,370
actually truly lives your op

88
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,310
but watch how how many are getting
infected

89
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,170
while you're watching and then also the
other thing you want to watch for is

90
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,490
what the percentages

91
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,010
because one thing hopefully occur to you

92
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,470
when you're looking at this is that well
how office your

93
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,990
are these guys successful at doing there
in fact

94
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:01,780
you'll see the infection rates are down
largely in the single digits

95
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:07,010
but because were doing this across the
internet you will see the

96
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,870
number of the actual successful action
be free

97
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:15,640
so with that hello everyone so

98
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,080
this is a demo that we came across like
analyzing some other phishing attacks

99
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,100
that

100
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,330
came across an hour in in boxers
typically the last couple of the

101
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,870
I think months and setting the blackhole
exploit back

102
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:33,050
and resented the right get an hour thank
so you got to say like there are a lot

103
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,990
of phishing emails coming from AT&T I as
sand and as a LinkedIn scam and so we

104
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,360
analyze love those things

105
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,190
so I came across that interesting fact
and the idea behind this I we

106
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,000
we getting access to one on the Status
stick Beach on the live nuclear exploit

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,500
back

108
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,140
and idea is to simply show you that
whenever that particular exploit back is

109
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:53,680
running

110
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,170
what is happening ruined reality maybe
it's very easy to say okay you got a

111
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,490
phishing email you will get redirected

112
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:05,470
but menu false that particular next bite
back on a happy traffic volume website

113
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:09,270
what actually happens that's what the
dis

114
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:16,270
this family actually gives you an idea
and let's take a look at it

115
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,460
so we simply got an access to this URL
and we've been we accessed 8

116
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,630
and we get an idea like though all the
statistic page of the nuclear exploit

117
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,300
back here

118
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:34,520
and if you see they've MSI Microsoft
Internet Explorer Firefox or proctor on

119
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,930
at than ever every time we have fresh
did big number changes

120
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,320
cause what they actually malware alter
our the

121
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,000
actually attack did at that point of
time he cost to this particular exploit

122
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,550
back in one other high-traffic oriented
web site

123
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:53,750
some callers all my reviews stock net
and every user that access the website

124
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:58,770
gotta infection defense is better that
infection or successful or not but it

125
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,920
tried everything

126
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,020
so every time a futon see

127
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,110
when we have fresh did the numbers
changed significantly

128
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,070
and this was I like in the time P did of
like five to eight minutes

129
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:14,140
and you can get an idea I mean if they
were running it for like an

130
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,580
offer on any successful in factions of
how many

131
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,470
try our offense they have already made
and

132
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,720
then actually totally give you an idea
we have %uh some other interesting down

133
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,280
those

134
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,800
by a lot of videos showing some of the
other attacks I'll

135
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,669
why how the box likely so what the
system so this actually gives you an

136
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,200
idea like

137
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,060
all my reduced on there was actually in
fact it and there's another sub domains

138
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,660
and all these are producing on about as
well I S one is like

139
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:44,890
all my reviews dotnet and it's going
really fast

140
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,640
727 is all these and we see like Windows
seven it's pretty scary but

141
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,580
it isn't actually that actually gives
you are many loads are actually

142
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,550
successfully activated

143
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:58,260
and how many systems get exploited the
BART so this was just gonna give you an

144
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,870
idea of how the browser exploit
infections

145
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:07,870
really rocks gonna have to go but so
that's all

146
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:13,170
that's the the pact that actually loads
the goodies on your machine

147
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:17,230
how do you get to those what ways is

148
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,780
with for it's a popular way is with the
Pride

149
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,420
and basically you what we're

150
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,110
what we're trying to do is leave the
victim

151
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:32,350
to the export what we're getting there

152
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,950
now now we can see how we can get one
how do we get

153
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,470
and the basic idea is

154
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,500
you know an effective website I'll get
an iframe to direct

155
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,330
that and then once we get to the BDP
then you get the action

156
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:51,230
that we just saw as we've seen talked
about in

157
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:55,450
in many other talks here I'll this whole
process may start

158
00:09:55,450 --> 00:10:00,200
something like a phishing email member
if if you can just convince somebody

159
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,650
just for our Wong enough period of time

160
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:07,140
to hit that clip then

161
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,570
you know we're off to a webpage week
directed

162
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,980
the EP if you're in there you know

163
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,050
5 10 percent or whatever that a of that
particular

164
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:24,180
brand about browser we've got at

165
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:29,490
again I guess I should say that yes we
end up doing this in a way that

166
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:36,490
most users are going to have a clue as
to what

167
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,930
sup I'll there's any number these
frameworks around we have

168
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:47,070
the I did you want to say something yes

169
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,130
so this one is an anonymous JDB

170
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,880
like to GDP at you sound so it shall I
Drive by framework

171
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,830
an idea I like anonymous like to put it
that Jolla framework and it produces

172
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:03,530
all the challah related jar files and
all other sort of template for you

173
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,650
so what happened actually I mean you
just have to you this is Anna up

174
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:10,630
I know crime here as a Service far the
underground up salyers

175
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:14,470
and they actually provided to the user's
I mean they could be any cyber criminal

176
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:19,480
a normal user maybe a Africa business
guy who actually wants to run this on a

177
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,510
high traffic volume website to get the
Redwood easements on

178
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:27,710
and so ideas like you know going to the
underground community

179
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,810
you know talk to the guy talk to the end
on Saturday

180
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:35,080
getting access to an anonymous JTV just
rely some all the details

181
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,660
and you get your Malaysia's gel athletes
ready and that you can

182
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:43,020
infuse that vid you are malicious iframe
on a some compromise domain and get

183
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,790
things done

184
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:48,560
and this one is that another one call as
a Jolla Drive by generator

185
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,130
I think this is being used to at a very
happy skiing nowadays with an existence

186
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,680
of new job along the abilities

187
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,350
with the last couple of months you've
seen the light there with the black hole

188
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,100
is being known

189
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,070
heavily for exploiting Jolla the GRE I'm
Java Runtime Environment

190
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:07,450
ha state on because it's a platform
independent court

191
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,210
in a run on anywhere and you can export
anything what you want so it's a very

192
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,670
simple you simply go to underground
community

193
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,990
piece %uh 10 bucks get things done a a
malicious code is rad

194
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,330
and you provide like okie along this
particular up late

195
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:23,900
the bombing get back to my command and
control server and things will be done

196
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,220
for you and you just simply call
somewhere find another crime their

197
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:27,840
service

198
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,200
and your typically are done in that case

199
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,400
so that's the concept of drive-by
frameworks this the produce everything

200
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,190
for you

201
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:42,580
you had just gotten into you there and
get things straight so

202
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,380
now we're gonna talk about the mallet
dispense so this actually came from the

203
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,520
perspective that

204
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,880
when we talk about phishing attacks we
have simple phishing attacks

205
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,750
be strong broad-based attacks then we
typically have spearfishing

206
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:59,160
counts of targeted tax comes from the No
harnessing the information using social

207
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,400
engineering tricks on in targeting the
user

208
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,400
for a specific organization what
happened in this particular thing

209
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,130
attackers find another interesting we I
mean they really don't want to get into

210
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,570
the fishing one why not to attack the
content delivery networks

211
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:16,320
because the idea is that a acts are
distributed attack

212
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,180
asana chain reaction what happened
despite a case

213
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,580
anything that you in fact somewhere some
point of time and content delivery

214
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,280
network or maybe there is an Asus can
bring network

215
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,880
out that actually coming to get back
with the content delivery any website

216
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,840
communicating

217
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,350
back with that content delivery network
fact is the content from it

218
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:39,300
and obvious I'm if it is in fact it is
gone affects the Malaysia said would be

219
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:39,750
spent

220
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,810
and this one is some like a working
previously for a company called I rise

221
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,290
pretty good in doing that about malware
analysis

222
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:51,150
so in this but do Casey alexei it was a
piece of some really upon a graphic bebe

223
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,530
side which is being used and they did a
key

224
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:57,010
analysis for that and they find that
they were actually costing a malicious

225
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:01,310
at woodys met and that actually goes
from this to traffic junkie

226
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:04,890
ecology salameh schools and local from
everything and

227
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:08,630
de césar exploit so I do simply Hall

228
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,760
from 10 to the and other I meanwhile who

229
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,990
being an alice is you might have only a
one compromise domain in between

230
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,940
where the attack yes I've actually
loaded the iframe and that actually

231
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,660
bombing case back with the domain

232
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,180
listing browser exploit back but if you
look in

233
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:28,710
the size they are many number of false
jump from one to another and

234
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,870
because it's in a worldwide that they
are interconnected

235
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:36,010
and things can get really nasty from
that perspective so phishing attacks

236
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,710
maladies manse but

237
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,930
fishing is being known for a long period
of time but Malik has been site

238
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:45,880
you know I really working pretty good
knowledge a and you can do whatever you

239
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,380
want on that case

240
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,400
sir so up

241
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:57,400
so we've shown you will export drive-by
downloads to get us there

242
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,900
how we can use the advertisements to
maybe guest

243
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:06,010
you into an iframe width yes into the

244
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:09,140
the export I so what what you do with
them

245
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,220
one you is know somebody who has

246
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,270
written the export they can

247
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:18,920
you'll sell their services to install
your mail our so you've come up with

248
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,750
something that you would like to get

249
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,970
install or writing machines and

250
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:28,610
you contact one of these guys your
malware

251
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,720
maybe this is the link to it and they
will go ahead

252
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,600
say all right whenever somebody hits my

253
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,630
exploit pack I will then upload your

254
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:43,430
your so that's that's a pay for

255
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:46,560
small type thing that that's been around
for

256
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,170
the other way that that we think install
malware

257
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,600
yes that have a black master who

258
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,660
so again what is the botnet

259
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,050
its collection a infected machines

260
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:05,270
and black master has control those so he
can go and say

261
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:08,720
alright give you peace malware and I
will now

262
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,010
goals followed on however many machines
that

263
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:15,810
what happens all

264
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:20,230
just a couple things they may be the
same person

265
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,110
so we're seeing one things that that's
been interesting

266
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:27,740
with teachers work is that he's gone now

267
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,320
actually worked at this whole up
hierarchy

268
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:36,089
up up an economy that has grown around

269
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:39,440
so we always had one person sore doing

270
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,089
the the infection whole criminal
activity

271
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:46,690
what we're starting to see
stratification there

272
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:50,050
and you get somebody who years maybe
creating

273
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,700
be he somebody else to its

274
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,990
doing the drive-by download somebody
else doing melberg pies minutes

275
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:02,140
and somebody else controlling the botnet
and then

276
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:06,050
you can actually sell some stop to

277
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:10,750
to criminals who or technically
sophisticated

278
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,750
so sore starts stratification you're so
when I talk about

279
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,560
different people I you know sometimes
they are sometimes they are

280
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,650
and and we're seeing a stratification in
this

281
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:27,170
underground but in a case you know
they're they're kinda a

282
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,650
I'm the difference i

283
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,950
just as an example there's there's a
nice little Hui

284
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:37,350
up okay I give you my

285
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,679
my URL go ahead

286
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:44,440
install this this piece of mail

287
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,429
as we saw with some these with some the
other

288
00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:53,840
pages that the show you we're starting
to see quite a bit sophistication

289
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,900
quality of the tools that are provided

290
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,820
arts while we have also pouring we've
got to

291
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,910
host some these things up

292
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:11,040
how we gonna do that again this ties in
because we've got four

293
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:16,960
the piece of place I we might have to be
hosting our iframe someplace

294
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,150
you gotta put it someplace I and

295
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:23,679
1 one thing that that's nice do you

296
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,440
go after virtually hosted sites because

297
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,610
I that now you know if we if we can get
in the water

298
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,890
follows maybe I can yet to

299
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,010
all the sites that are being hosted this
particular

300
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,330
visible so you know we've got several

301
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:43,470
sites with with single server

302
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,540
pop and with waterfall

303
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:51,210
maybe yet all lol

304
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:56,120
uploading Psalms iframe injector in
there

305
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,910
and replay attacks as a whole variety

306
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:04,050
up these that we can use to get in there
and now now we have a nice place the

307
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,320
posters

308
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,910
we certainly don't want to be so

309
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:13,620
as an example if I I'm

310
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,620
you know bpm so it's a nice way to do
things

311
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,990
a popular one is Panama why well

312
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:27,860
the cybersecurity was there are not
particularly strong

313
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,830
so less host let's do our VPN

314
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:36,130
there you know you know all very nice

315
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:40,750
art for you know you can act up there
and now gotta pee pee and then I can

316
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:45,380
use as my watching point maybe I can use
that as my

317
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:51,000
Munich for all just variety of ways that
I can use

318
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,410
and again eventually the whole thing
this is just

319
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:57,440
sort making myself a little bit more on
on a missile

320
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,570
are yet

321
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,770
sup what's let's take this a step for

322
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:07,630
op so I've got some what's out there

323
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:11,660
and what I would like to now you is

324
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:15,679
you know walk do with this

325
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,370
let's take a look at Roscoe op

326
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:23,450
you know so what Russell dupes Russ kill
and you know

327
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:27,220
install malware force and you can
monitor

328
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:32,500
and when things are all the time we can
remove all traces

329
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,419
we might be removing traces dropper that
drop

330
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:41,040
now we're and then it you know we remove
the traces other than the malware is

331
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,960
still there

332
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,490
or maybe I I'm renting

333
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:49,490
you know these services are I wall
install your malware

334
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:53,640
for some period of time you know maybe
we something like that

335
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:59,010
and at the end of the week will
disappear of

336
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:02,830
op so its all I mite control

337
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:06,070
want to buy I

338
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,110
do this install by install that I just
showed you

339
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:13,220
like to go historia

340
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,370
our understanding I love the sore

341
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:19,540
history that for

342
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,230
op

343
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:26,210
we'll see I think yes me

344
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:29,830
wanna ride so

345
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,309
I mean is it talk about like on the rust
scale and body by doctor and body the

346
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:36,090
details that idea behind rescue as that

347
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:39,740
haha the idea is not new because you can
use up ought to download and execute the

348
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,809
file doubt what that

349
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:45,240
important part in the Ruskin the deal is
because it's good the name actually came

350
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,309
from the russian

351
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:50,700
a malware gay art they read Russian game
actually not as a dive all

352
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,190
and from there is like a game between
among the players who is %uh powerful

353
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:54,760
one

354
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:59,100
so in this particular can said the rust
skill not only download them out there

355
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:03,010
but it has the capability monitor as
well as tracing the system changes

356
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:06,799
this is a very interesting one because
after the reboot it can really move

357
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,909
all your application data which is a
temporary one and it will lot of other

358
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:11,429
things

359
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:15,419
and I'll show you in a little bit in a
damn fool which will actually projects

360
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:16,720
you the fact that how

361
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,130
a popular bought we saw this the ruskin
module in a dark about

362
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:24,240
and that I'll be damning later on and
show you how from there

363
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,299
using an IRC channel all weekend execute
a command base on it

364
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:31,690
and that's the really interesting fact
everest get is a

365
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:34,850
is all about that game of power I mean
who got the power

366
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:37,940
you can consider it as any concept a
bottle arse

367
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,419
because like boston also fighting with
each other like who's gonna

368
00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:46,529
get top infected machine and but this is
a very close module Amin

369
00:22:46,529 --> 00:22:49,970
some other functionalities been there
but the flogged %uh purpose of malware

370
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,200
writers they are really

371
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,980
enhancing it so what I am gonna we are
going to show you must go down is likely

372
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,149
going to install a bought and now we're
young we're

373
00:22:58,149 --> 00:23:01,590
I mean this particular bought we
actually do some reverse engineering and

374
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,270
you do some boundary patching and

375
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:07,130
force the ball to communicating back to
our command and control channel that we

376
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,460
set up on the IRC

377
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,970
and from the I actually we gonna use the
commands that we find during worse

378
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:15,000
engineering and that will show you all
weekend simply

379
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,529
download a file in executed so there's a
lot of difference between white

380
00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:22,850
only downloading a file and downloading
the file and then executing it in the

381
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:26,370
context of the system and that's what
the idea behind

382
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:33,370
musculus and let's take a look at the
damage here

383
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,880
so this is our IRC channel which year we
actually set up far

384
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:44,410
you know maintaining and running this
particular Gamel and were you doing

385
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,780
right now here is like

386
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:49,890
we just rigor the IRC client here and
that's where we are going to join the

387
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,550
channel on the server which I

388
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:56,560
which we stated as NGR and you say like
now that talking is Angie are so

389
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,010
session is up so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to run this

390
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:04,880
an GI da txt five here just to ensure
that this is Anna

391
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,490
a legitimate by angry and so what
happens when we executed this

392
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,960
by angry here if you take a bit of time
and return

393
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,080
melt away but then supplementing states
that

394
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,710
into remove the drop or and put me
somewhere the boxes to the proper

395
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:26,760
so it will cause a it actually goes away
right here and within a speck of time

396
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,090
you'll see that ball gets connected back
to the

397
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:33,070
demonic Control Panel on the IRC channel
so

398
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:37,320
invest where you say like the body
summit hosted in USA training and AXP

399
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,430
running an XP machine here and this is a
random name on the boat

400
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:45,040
using Windows in bed both in
cryptographic API's so then I read the

401
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,170
washington on it gives me an idea

402
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:50,410
that we're kind of bought as they're
very displeased and what kind of

403
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,960
capability the test so what I did
actually here

404
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,860
so it is gone

405
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:01,820
so I use the term on call as bajado here
used by the spot

406
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,830
and I paste the URL for on some

407
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:08,430
is like yours from the beauty and
enables the rescue met you what you hear

408
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:13,070
so I run that command by enabling the
risk in my view and on the VMware

409
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:13,690
machine

410
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:17,260
download stuff I'd and execuse that
would be for you

411
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:20,800
and you can't do this process as many
time

412
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,960
as you can and because this is a in both
capitol city on the BART

413
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,940
just download and execute it but it has
an additional functionality

414
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:32,990
you cannot show right now because the
the time constraints it can do all the

415
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:33,810
traces

416
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:38,120
after the execution of a file like you
know removing the registry entries and

417
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,230
sort of things like that

418
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,320
and its people on you can keep on trying
it

419
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,110
and even fetching up binder from remote
resources than

420
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:51,810
executing it and a reappear so that's
the capability over us killers

421
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:55,170
right now miss gonna take a DNS Changer

422
00:25:55,170 --> 00:26:00,020
okay so this is another interesting
capability like

423
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:03,830
if you have seen on the media outlets
for the last couple of months

424
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:08,040
and you must have gone through a lot of
media news and media articles that are

425
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,980
actually talking about DNS Changer

426
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:15,640
so the concept is if it is not if we are
not doing that DNS cache poisoning one

427
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,410
ability

428
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:19,470
are not exploiting that one ability on
the server side

429
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:23,330
so how the man you're actually doing the
DNS money police in on the client side

430
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:27,470
that's that then sat days and that's the
question that we really need to answer

431
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:32,250
so different we there are many ways you
can do the DNS manipulation on the

432
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,070
client side

433
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:36,470
and we're gonna go one by one and then
we'll see all the present-day bought

434
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:36,950
next

435
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:42,330
college star generation expire Izzo's
andromeda dark bought and the set a box

436
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:47,670
how they actually exploit the DNS are
functionality on the victim machines

437
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:51,880
soul a simple line is everybody going to
talk about replace and reason that easy

438
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,680
cost flight

439
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,980
very easy can be the detectability
simply open the file in any terrain get

440
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,890
things done ok at this particular IP

441
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:02,240
like for example Facebook is redirecting
to this particular malicious to me

442
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,790
to some extent expiry fine another
interesting one is like the

443
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:11,140
a be execuse DNS amplification attack
doesn't actually have

444
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:15,580
dont think attackers drive attack a
small local area networks we have like

445
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:19,880
routers it right when you play the
router addresses the DNS entries

446
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,810
so from the other perspective of a
network if the eat me

447
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:27,460
get recap ability of resolute in the DNS
addresses exploited

448
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,740
so any notes or any likes Kendry no

449
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:34,680
machines that have been acting back to
the router will also get on a DNS

450
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,660
amplification

451
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:40,360
but that actually defense pond a concept
of having someone ability in the routers

452
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,040
that South

453
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:46,460
so now what ha the present I bought as i
doing it against the concept of hoping

454
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:50,930
but how difficult the DNS there's a
gonna take a look to the first one is

455
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,540
the hooking began SAPI

456
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:57,530
so as we know that in bindas we have a
DNS API doc lib and the NSA be I dot the

457
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:58,490
library

458
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:02,550
and that but at the library expose some
sort of function like DNS query

459
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:07,300
so value browser you know opens up and
I'll use the force is a browser

460
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,730
to trigger are open up the Facebook dot
com website that

461
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,290
this particular ball as you know
executed

462
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:18,640
in the system and then acted as a loose
your DNS address and price you IP

463
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,560
address and then you can connect back to
the

464
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,960
you know Ethernet frames and all that
what happens

465
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,190
since your system is already exploited
and bought has the capability of talking

466
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:32,290
it actually hopes that the NS grady
function

467
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:36,090
so what it as we go I'll be going to
demonstrate in a bit of time

468
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:39,180
and other interesting live cooking DNS
cache is all were

469
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:42,620
I mean we need cash is I mean because of
the fact that we don't want to every

470
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,660
dime forces the browser

471
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:48,740
NN quatie the DNS server if that entry
is present in cash and just watch it

472
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,080
from there

473
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,770
in that case do the same to function is
collin via like Windows

474
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:58,030
the US to underscore 32 don't be a lot
and the

475
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:01,260
so the bought what the board actually
does it actually verifies that function

476
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,090
if it is called

477
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:06,250
it's a there's a you know there is a way
that bob dole that he actually

478
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:09,730
connecting are using that cash is all
their service to get the DNS

479
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:13,170
mapping but that not the case all that
is

480
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:16,610
let's take a look so the in in this
particular damn like the we do that we

481
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:17,660
have made

482
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:21,080
so system is already infected with the
NGR the doll court

483
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,450
that we have demonstrated are you so we
are you using DNS engine will block two

484
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,510
sites Microsoft and Facebook

485
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:30,700
but when we tried using like them to
redirect

486
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,600
from my Google .co gone to summit the
malicious domain

487
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,610
didn't get we directed actually so there
is always a problem with DNS

488
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:42,760
a blind-sided backs to sometime it goes
re: and a

489
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:48,560
thanks a lot in a fine place so let's
take a look at this particular

490
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,930
site

491
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:56,970
slightly a simple like I I came across
as some other pieces made by some other

492
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,230
companies like

493
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:02,180
for example the pit like nine iframe
tonya one that page and they tried to

494
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,810
like Microsoft dot com anti-white s

495
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:09,180
that's a lie Kaspersky and if it's if
it's not getting loaded into

496
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:14,730
iframe you might have in a problem like
you have in fact if the DNS Changer

497
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:18,040
let's take a look at it this particular
down here

498
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,600
solving the system is already connected
back to the IFC channel

499
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,530
and I just render was in command here I
get all info

500
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:28,530
to the system is already infected

501
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:31,310
the first worry and I'm trying to show
you is that here in this particular

502
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,630
panel

503
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:39,480
that when we try to open browser and
that we saw the Microsoft dot com

504
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,010
it the address actually get special you
did and you get the Microsoft are calm

505
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,580
and Facebook actually

506
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:49,070
in a successfully opening your browser

507
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:52,100
since we made a custom so we had to
close the browser right now

508
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:56,300
and then where what we doing right now
is we're using the change DNS come on in

509
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,210
this particular part

510
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:03,210
to block the Microsoft dot com faces
like this particular bark but the NS is

511
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:04,440
blocked

512
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,060
and we issue and other interesting come
on for changing as to

513
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:11,260
Facebook dot com

514
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:14,490
so you say it gets to the masses like
notification that

515
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:18,820
even the Facebook is blocked so when I
when we opened and other

516
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:23,640
in stance on Mozilla browser and we try
to open it is blocked

517
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,870
and again for the Facebook is again
blocked

518
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:30,890
face a dynamic cooking into the DNS
library functions that with this body is

519
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,760
actually using

520
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,920
even on the truck ride with them because
we made this blog

521
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:40,020
we did some US engineering tactics and
we you know customize it

522
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,090
when we try to do the redirection here

523
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:46,920
with change DNS come on

524
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:53,170
dude some love for example nada dot com

525
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:57,420
may try to open Google got come here

526
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:00,570
simply goes I T I mean you can find that
one up because

527
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:03,370
there is some problem with that being a
soaking with this blog you to offer

528
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,640
customization

529
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,380
but still you know do not allow you to

530
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:13,030
getting access to the Google dot com and
you can money played these things

531
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:17,740
as many times as you can in your we are
so this is actually a concept of DNS

532
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,570
Changer is

533
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:22,100
that with the media is typically talking
about for the last couple of months

534
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,240
and up for anybody about man and the
probs

535
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:32,240
okay so we told you about for

536
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:37,410
now there some of the capabilities want
to show you now is the money make

537
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:42,270
right so so this is how you rob a bank

538
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:46,310
we're doing online Willie Sutton said

539
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:50,540
you know when asked wide rob banks
that's where the money is

540
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:54,020
now its online so I'm show you here

541
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:58,940
yes the way that once we have infected
the browser

542
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:02,650
I want at

543
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:06,540
here webster

544
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:11,350
this at

545
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,440
and this is the me in the browser see
for

546
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,900
heard about me in the middle attack

547
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:21,370
wall this is a man in the middle attack
that is happening inside the browser

548
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,980
here

549
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:27,170
rock I i apologize.

550
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:30,610
what probably us all see I'll

551
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:34,260
pocket for were all

552
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:39,350
up yes for

553
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,760
bank fidelity page or

554
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:49,760
water the

555
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,370
browser WAP that

556
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:57,470
route is going to

557
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:00,810
inject pay

558
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:05,440
before split like maybe less for some
extra

559
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:12,169
at and they may not have had the
injected

560
00:34:12,169 --> 00:34:16,240
there you will see there's two things
want

561
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,389
actually in Jax something to change the
pay

562
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:24,730
you know maybe had some extra feel

563
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:28,050
their out like use or

564
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:31,220
the other is our for grabbing

565
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:35,290
where I'm going to just get the
credentials

566
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:38,750
of okay and anything about that we'll
see about four

567
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:42,379
grabbing is on like walk you get all the
characters

568
00:34:42,379 --> 00:34:45,810
form grabbing you're going to grab stuff
right of for

569
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:49,149
yes what label here

570
00:34:49,149 --> 00:34:54,200
password here is the now saw so what
happens is

571
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,650
whoever comes through I'm a

572
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:04,190
at that point Jackson extra and that I'm
going

573
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:07,820
split what's coming out grab

574
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:11,430
information like me for information

575
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:15,420
the extra stuff that I am there and at
the same

576
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:20,050
hundreds normal operations so the user
doesn't

577
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:25,540
see anything going where West set

578
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:31,500
the server now user

579
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:36,480
now sees you know whatever you like it
their bank transactions and so on

580
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,140
and everything was fine so

581
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,160
so I showed two things yes

582
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:49,060
at some extra field nearby sec

583
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:52,740
is stuff block

584
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:56,410
for what I inject information years

585
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:01,290
I can actually possibly transaction
transfer

586
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:04,310
money from wanna out another

587
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:09,180
up I want to clean up

588
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,270
so so that's me in the browser that's
how I get

589
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:16,770
credentials and and that of course at
some point I have to turn those

590
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:17,590
credentials

591
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:21,990
into money and it may be that I returned
to that

592
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:25,620
underground market that I talked about
before it's like oh here's some

593
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,720
credentials please turn them into cash

594
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:32,930
just as an example so this would be an
example

595
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:36,940
up that actually chase oppose

596
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:41,000
as watch out with this here's a case

597
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,480
were we have a legitimate page

598
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,080
and on top of that we ask for some extra
Mason now

599
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:52,760
in you you you saw this you all the
alarms would go walk

600
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,600
while while you're walking

601
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,350
out by the way dried

602
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:04,940
for you know everything shoe size
whatever we walk

603
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:08,530
you know olive view the alarm to go off

604
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:11,550
but there's a sufficient number of
people that

605
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:17,490
would go ahead filled so so that's
that's just a real example

606
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:20,810
love this type of attack while

607
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:25,820
so that this process %uh Vinci acting

608
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:30,110
is is what's called weapon jacks because
we've got web pages

609
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:34,820
were stuff into it so as that webpage
comes

610
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:38,000
into the browser we're going to
manipulate that webpage

611
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,150
you know like as we saw their

612
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:44,850
maybe put a pop-up maybe at some extra
import

613
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:49,810
whatever yes op what are the
restrictions that we

614
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:54,310
app on this is that this is this is a
very static kind of attack

615
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:57,680
and want things we believe is that that

616
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:02,000
don't think it's possible really make
this the dynamic so

617
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,770
so ahead a time you have to decide
alright this is what

618
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:10,270
Chase Bank a what's like and then I'm
going to specify

619
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:13,580
alright if you see this in age spank

620
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:17,600
page then make this particular
modification to the page

621
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,200
and display so this is i'd

622
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:27,620
stat there yes

623
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:31,860
text file that is that as part of the
attack that has to actually be set up

624
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:35,670
have upon and and that provide some
limitations

625
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:40,550
what if you look at that file

626
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:43,550
alright you know put this information
for this particular

627
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:46,550
feel work with this information after
this particular

628
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:50,110
feel and all do with online

629
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:54,070
a particular page served up from a
particular situation

630
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:57,940
these are is a very direct faster
specific but

631
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:01,190
they are out there and walk

632
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:05,330
up and I don't want to explain the
actual one sir

633
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:09,430
so the other some other back said been
conducted for the East live banks so if

634
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:13,200
you get an idea this one is on a
forceful cookie injection and citibank's

635
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,570
website so what they actually did like

636
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:18,870
during the bedtime like they have a
better so with an advent of her

637
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:22,530
generation partners we have a building
compliment that actually been somewhat

638
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:23,610
for you

639
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:26,750
for the design like that actor ahead of
time

640
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:30,070
said some fun at the bank website and
try to fetch like different backgrounds

641
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,490
out of it and the

642
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:34,490
and attacker actually use that patrons

643
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:38,410
because I know one that injects saw txt
file or any name he can get

644
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:42,320
and that particular file is boss to the
better and better actually use that

645
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,370
background rules

646
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:47,270
and put that contained in a bind def all
met in the box itself

647
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:51,700
so we compromise one other domain
somewhere and used by spy and things

648
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,560
like that

649
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,590
and so gotta cross with this interesting

650
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:59,270
back in Jax they say is like sex URL
format the US citibank's

651
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:02,490
dot com look for the guy before

652
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:06,780
if there is a donde before like this
kinda thing injected this

653
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:10,270
the police crept into it which is Anna
cooking injection

654
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:13,450
I'm is gonna generate a false kooky for
it

655
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:16,900
and over in a pretty interesting attack
and Citibank knows about it like

656
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,040
some other box I've actually done that

657
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,590
let's not only restricted to one
particular bank this has been going on

658
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,840
for like different institutions there

659
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:30,130
so if you look at this one is far like
xD ima got any bank of America website

660
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:32,830
so what better bought actually needed
here

661
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:37,870
it actually injects label if you see an
ass for the ATM number

662
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:41,180
this on as a again a life target like
attack

663
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,960
and it's not restricted only to Bank of
America we have enough for like votes

664
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,210
Fargo to

665
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:49,530
and they are also looking for the ATM
PIN and the password

666
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:53,440
which has been injected some like in an
unauthorized manner and some other back

667
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,520
pages

668
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:58,050
really when did that kind of information
is not be very quiet but

669
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:02,160
these kind of attacks are running in the
wild and it looks significantly harder

670
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,840
for the people are scattered eating
because they believe that while they

671
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:09,840
sell their banking services we have an
asset protection and we give ETF favor

672
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,770
give you a lot of things like that

673
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:15,630
but this kind of issues are cropping up
and the server-side like the banking

674
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:18,770
scouting teams are not being much
attention because they feel like this

675
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:19,790
not their problem

676
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:24,080
the problem of the end-user okie go
ahead and get banned the widest and but

677
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:29,420
any wise cannot you know fine in fact
these kind of problems here

678
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,880
gonna talk about phone grabbing

679
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,670
so I mentioned for grabbing your here's
the process

680
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:39,730
a little more detail side

681
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:44,730
user requests or

682
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:48,730
start own for at that point there is a

683
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:51,740
oppose well

684
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:55,790
I'll into one of options

685
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:59,280
that processing I'll what

686
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,520
for rap the that

687
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,750
ship it off to my store at that point

688
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:09,140
now release for

689
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:13,200
it goes back to the normal running up

690
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,560
up for with post

691
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,670
goes off to server

692
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:25,670
user his underwear yep

693
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:28,859
business up the phone so

694
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:32,620
when they go to post we just

695
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:36,840
server sales right there grab the
information

696
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,109
let control go back at that point and
nobody's then

697
00:42:40,109 --> 00:42:44,530
why a white

698
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:47,510
but again there there are certain it
turns out that there are certain

699
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:49,240
restrictions on

700
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,850
what

701
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:55,870
with this but what think

702
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:59,010
no this year is that water

703
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:02,500
why does encryption work your

704
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:06,140
you know like always like communication
with the bank

705
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:09,370
alling for while yes it is but I grabbed

706
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:13,160
information before that this me in the
browser

707
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:17,250
saw grab you all

708
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:21,010
everything that's all after backup
armored

709
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:24,800
poverty got my information for back

710
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,950
way yes

711
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:32,850
I at just I yes I think far

712
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:36,030
about everything that

713
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:39,120
though so we're going to do is we've got
yet another

714
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:43,280
here for you and what your know what
we're showing here

715
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,859
is this is what the

716
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:49,930
criminal or whoever is is grabbing

717
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:54,760
this is the kind of for me the

718
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:58,240
is all sort good stuff

719
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,420
you know i'd passwords at all that

720
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:04,790
another them all you so

721
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:08,260
sexually down came from the practice is
why we analyzing somebody madrick

722
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:11,130
domains and we came across with
interesting fact like some other one

723
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:13,540
they believe they were present in that
particular

724
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:17,640
malicious domain phone exploitation or
does one abilities some weak passwords

725
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,839
the launching some brute force attacks
we can access to the that demonic

726
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:22,220
control panel

727
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:26,220
so what we did actually I mean so we are
also analyzing so many other things got

728
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,300
an excess to

729
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:31,210
the ball off and SP interesting I just
bought is coming getting back to that

730
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,890
command and control server

731
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:36,710
so it's really good to run that brought
in an emulator in our virtual machine

732
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:40,730
to get things done and I do simple try
to look at how the farm grabbing

733
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:43,140
actually works here

734
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:47,120
so mara explain this Tamil

735
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:51,420
so good this data was constructed using
Lincoln I spot which is actually a

736
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:54,540
descendant of the use like the guy who
actually brought brought this particular

737
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,440
bought

738
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,620
uses some other concepts from the C you
sexually and thus

739
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:02,490
he actually optimizes some with abandon
Jackson phone grabbing things the way

740
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:03,460
totes

741
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:07,250
and came across with this interesting
boxer again the concept is

742
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:10,310
a we have a new we are machine here

743
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:15,350
and we have an ass sample of ice bought
here

744
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:18,580
so game then I'm gonna run this a bot

745
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:23,060
this particular dropper gone extracts
the box somewhere in the system

746
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:26,839
and a game melting process because
dropper gonna kill urself

747
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:32,530
having a embedded some sort of Windows
batch script and it goes it's out

748
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:35,670
your system gets infected so what i'm
showing here is you like

749
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:39,190
IP address of my system as this one

750
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:43,010
and is the CNC that we got an access to
and when we

751
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:47,990
so we're logging into it

752
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:51,080
me some me that we get this like simple
machine at it actually in

753
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:57,140
having a like concentration a box up to
like nine or ten in number

754
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:02,250
not much that so idea here is that try
to show you that this particular

755
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:06,080
be in the machine is infected with nice
blog and is our IP

756
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:11,350
and it and it automatically gets
connected back to the command and

757
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:13,130
control panel here

758
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:17,820
is our IP so the system is infected it's
an iraqi say to communicate back with

759
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:19,960
the command-and-control

760
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:23,359
so what we're going to do now less being
the consider yourself as a legitimate

761
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:24,310
user

762
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:28,220
I'm in my system is in fact I'm gonna
when a cheese dot com website here

763
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:31,339
not going to use the real credentials
but I'm just trying to

764
00:46:31,339 --> 00:46:34,950
show you that this process works on this
week

765
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:38,820
and it would like wrong user ID in some
other

766
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:43,560
iraq possible here and I click the
summit but

767
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,580
and idea for showing Facebook dot com is
like these

768
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:50,210
the kind of attacks on not only directed
to its banks it can be

769
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:54,670
any website are anything so I also
slight some %uh the

770
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:58,890
rocker tensions here and I summit the
button

771
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:02,810
summit the phone actually so because
it's not a legitimate one so we get an

772
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:03,330
error

773
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:06,839
that it will not be processed by the
servers

774
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:10,160
analysts get back to the command and
control and wanna look try to look at

775
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,680
the reports

776
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,890
and there you see we get an access to
HTTPS

777
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:18,170
the cheese dot com website here

778
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:23,410
the logs actually and this is what a gay
like the bottom has a nice 9 watchin 1.2

779
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:26,870
is you know there's an XP Service Pack 2
and all those things here

780
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:30,089
and this is how you get all the phone
request year

781
00:47:30,089 --> 00:47:33,160
to be good all this request is being
posted

782
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:37,450
by the leads to meet browser and that
would block hope they can get you got

783
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:39,010
the password

784
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:43,770
and the other things that is very
legitimate I'm in the same way when you

785
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:46,359
do transaction do any sort of thing

786
00:47:46,359 --> 00:47:50,390
and a that looks that looks pretty fine

787
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:56,310
and but say another interesting fact the
sky of boss I ran the malware authors

788
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:59,940
designed this blog to try to put up a
time constraint like the or

789
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:03,320
only want the ball to connect back to
the command-and-control server

790
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:08,400
after a time lag of 10 min I like 10
seconds fifteen seconds

791
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,410
and things like that and after that the
command and control panel updated the

792
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:13,140
database

793
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:17,230
and things like that in this case

794
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:21,010
we got a facebook request to and that is
our

795
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:24,080
this one is here is our email and the
password

796
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:27,720
and that actually a concept based on
Form grabbing is like you can map

797
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:31,520
this kind of functionality at this kind
of attack to go banking website you're

798
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,160
using

799
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:36,460
writing your credentials and things like
that your system is in fact a this

800
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:39,810
this thing is going to happen

801
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:45,650
and

802
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:48,960
so want to accept

803
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,550
we have year most things this is a

804
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:57,030
you know arms race your attackers

805
00:48:57,030 --> 00:49:00,310
you something the defenders do something
else

806
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:03,660
response we have to believe that with
this

807
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:07,370
hyper attack

808
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:10,410
there are enough restrictions on what
the attackers do

809
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:14,359
as slick as it is that we actually think

810
00:49:14,359 --> 00:49:18,970
the survey a synchronous workfare

811
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:22,260
I have a up analysis that

812
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:25,750
offenders likely bill will exit

813
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:29,070
attackers online this this

814
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:32,870
waiver man in the browser actor

815
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:36,109
using this for and

816
00:49:36,109 --> 00:49:43,109
yeah I guess over what

817
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:01,079
IDBI like its this I think I'm nor I
know that discussion is going to pass

818
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:01,400
that

819
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:05,220
the concept is for the antivirus the
actually based on the concept of

820
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,599
signature-based detection

821
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:10,119
so there is always the time gap the very
first thing is like them until the time

822
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:11,579
they discover the malware

823
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:14,819
they're going to both the signature
Farhat things are done

824
00:50:14,819 --> 00:50:18,359
let's say they still bear the signature
but there is a lot of like

825
00:50:18,359 --> 00:50:22,460
obfuscation techniques we have like
based on polymorphic encryption and

826
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:23,829
other costs of things

827
00:50:23,829 --> 00:50:27,029
which actually changes the instruction
inside a binary

828
00:50:27,029 --> 00:50:31,140
and RDX with Anna I croatian would
become significantly harder father and

829
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:34,230
the widest it detected and

830
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:38,819
that's what the idea is the is still
running lights protection against both

831
00:50:38,819 --> 00:50:39,759
kinda box

832
00:50:39,759 --> 00:50:42,950
whose signatures has already been
detected previously

833
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:47,160
but with the concept of latest
generation for example zero-day attacks

834
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:50,869
the 31 abilities and some other things
you can use this particular blog on

835
00:50:50,869 --> 00:50:52,609
rapid insight as some sort of

836
00:50:52,609 --> 00:50:55,849
polymorphic encryptor are and border

837
00:50:55,849 --> 00:51:00,059
with a significantly higher for them to
find a bi and other bodies like it's

838
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:02,859
really hard to detect the in line hoping
in the browser's

839
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:07,250
because it batch it uses since like a
building concept of Microsoft Windows

840
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:10,579
call it sought batching that's the first
five batters the

841
00:51:10,579 --> 00:51:14,230
bison that function Apple organic become
sick hot for that

842
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:18,890
to some extent a show for insurance
purposes antivirus engines are fine but

843
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:19,690
these are not

844
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:22,710
began to prevent you from man in the
browser

845
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:25,910
they cannot prevent you from back in Jax
they cannot prevent you from form

846
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:29,029
grabbing onto unless they find that your
system is in fact it

847
00:51:29,029 --> 00:51:32,779
but tell that bind systems are still be
hat

848
00:51:32,779 --> 00:51:33,279
so
