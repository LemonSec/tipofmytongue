1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:03,899
Phil all strike and I would just want to
talk a little about

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,290
hacking forensics on the goal what can
you do with

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,360
are battery-powered low-power

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,019
devices

5
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,180
so what is this talk about anyway

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,760
as I said battery-powered low-power
devices but kinda fun to have them

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,910
in particular when you talk a little bit
about an arm-based

8
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,850
BeagleBoard BeagleBone I system

9
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,940
that have developed over the last year
or so are

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,150
and give you a little insight into how
you can port

11
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:41,760
stuff to a new platform and also talk a
little bit about USB forensics

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,180
if you know me I've been doing a little
better talking about USB forensics

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,330
over the last couple years and now

14
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,449
we have hi-speed USB that chemical

15
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:55,790
act so why should you care well

16
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,550
you can take a whole set of tools

17
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,470
and fit it and the kids once box if you
don't believe me

18
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:08,020
work on the table alright I so

19
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,500
someone asked me why do you have a buzz
Lightyear lunch box

20
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,409
well number one it was on sale and
number two I thought

21
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,320
its kind of appropriate because I'm
gonna hack to you to infinity

22
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,470
Andy on my stop right are so what
they've done is they've developed a nice

23
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,850
full feature when X

24
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,520
distribution it's nice to have a full
Linux distro

25
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,790
because they give you a lot of
flexibility this law stuff you can do

26
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,250
you know they're there are some drop
boxes in

27
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,500
Little Pony plugs and things like that
out there and their

28
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,590
they're cool may have your place I but
there is a lot of flexibility

29
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,890
and having have everything on every
little device

30
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,200
the other thing that's nice is if you
have a low power device

31
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,600
you can run it for days or weeks of a
battery

32
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,659
a tool for power when of

33
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:05,399
a its small stuff

34
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,460
you can plan it

35
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,320
and come back later get and did I
mention

36
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,760
you some high speed USB stuff so was a
handsome dude anyway

37
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,520
I i teach at a a small University

38
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,510
in I what I got a few students here

39
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,880
today I've been programming since age 8

40
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,490
and havin fun with hardware since about
age 12 I've also been known to fly and

41
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,760
build airplanes and

42
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,160
have some fun in aviation so what we're
talking about

43
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,710
I want to talk a little bit about I'll
platform choice

44
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,760
what

45
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,590
kinda OS

46
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,580
did I wanna slack as a base OS how do
you build out that base OS

47
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,599
how do you at all your good tools

48
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:58,080
I love there's the easy way when you get
lucky

49
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,080
you can leverage from repositories

50
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,190
and a slightly harder ways when you're
starting to build stuff out a source

51
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,790
code are

52
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:10,569
little bit about are you can build some
different accessories

53
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:14,150
I have a couple demos arm

54
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,990
being how the live demo god's go I have
some demos

55
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,070
screenshots I know they're not quite as
dramatic but

56
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:26,200
they work so that's always a good thing
and talk a little bit about some future

57
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,030
directions

58
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,320
that I have in mind so she's in a
platform

59
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:36,380
I whenever about this and i said i want
something that's small

60
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,020
low-power

61
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:43,080
affordable which juror has built in
networking

62
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:50,080
as good USB support anna has convenient
input and output options

63
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:55,150
and the winter turned out to be the
BeagleBoard

64
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,900
why the BeagleBoard straight quarter
inches square pretty small

65
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,300
less than 10 watts

66
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,489
by two hundred forty nine dollars to be
just buy one

67
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:09,189
odds based on a court at a processor

68
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:12,459
comes in with built in networking

69
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:15,879
as for USB high-speed

70
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,990
ports

71
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:22,470
and USB on-the-go lotsa output options
DVI D

72
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,470
or HDMI so if you have a TV

73
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,800
you can use the TV you have a digital
monitor you can use that

74
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,810
out it has as video again use that on
your TV

75
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,370
are you can output LCD

76
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:41,380
as I've done here with what my systems
I've mounted to my

77
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,430
Buzz Lightyear lunch box I it also has

78
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:49,490
serial connections webcam connections
micro SD slot

79
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,640
all that good stuff

80
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,100
and here's a picture that are ripped off
a Wikipedia

81
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,750
about the BeagleBoard basically the
BeagleBoard is meant to be a desktop

82
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,600
replacement

83
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,190
see can replace a desktop with this and
again

84
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,560
it is not very large cell

85
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,860
on the back this LCD screen I have a
BeagleBoard

86
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,270
and here's another BeagleBoard

87
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,860
that separate and they're both running
the same

88
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,900
fall on pen testing and friends ex
distro

89
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:28,330
are by the way some people might say why
didn't you get the Raspberry Pi

90
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,490
especially people on from the UK like
Heinz use the pie

91
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,090
I pie doesn't meet my criteria

92
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,160
it definitely doesn't meet the mature
criteria and

93
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,310
arm ASM Bari to say

94
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,990
using Ubuntu is a base distribution is a
good thing to do

95
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,720
you doing pen testing kinds of stuff as
you probably know

96
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,900
backtrack is Ubuntu based so a lot of
those tools that are

97
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:59,010
out there are already in summer the
Ubuntu repositories

98
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,360
the Raspberry Pi not known to run

99
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,620
12 really at all so was not a good
choice

100
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,750
also try to get the Raspberry Pi in this
country they're still not very

101
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:14,440
out so when you buy me Lord

102
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,889
comes with hangs from 1/8 which if
you've never

103
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:21,569
run a bigger border a small device
before you probably never heard of

104
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:24,900
but art that's what comes in the box

105
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:30,470
is kinda optimize for the hardware
that's a plus group

106
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,700
and it has some nice package management
but

107
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:38,100
doesn't have a really good repositories
and for that reason

108
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,979
i'd shows 12

109
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:43,850
because it had goods community support
repositories

110
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:50,740
Center so how do you build your base
device how do you get started with us

111
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,930
well the first thing you probably want
to do is when you bought your

112
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:54,810
BeagleBoard

113
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:59,760
came with two more for gigabyte micro SD
card they had

114
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,770
thought that had not Ubuntu had are

115
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:06,820
extra minute you want to upgrade that so
how big you wanna go

116
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,820
well go big or go home right you know 16
gig or

117
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,000
32 gig if year

118
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,270
cheap I know there's no two people in
West Michigan right def

119
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:22,169
are if you're cheap you could go with an
a gigabyte

120
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:26,250
that would only give you bout two gigs
free

121
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,440
up and then how do you go about building
as well

122
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,720
you can download an image and you can go
to Canonical's

123
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,039
website and they do have an Ubuntu for
arm

124
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,330
image that you can get are mister nelson
Robert C Nelson

125
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,520
also has some demo images I shows his
images

126
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,770
why wall because he's tweaked

127
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:52,960
his stuff for the BeagleBoard canonical

128
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,870
folks you know their stuff runs but are
Robert stuff

129
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,479
runs better he updates that very
frequently

130
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,610
there's also some good instructions on
how to do this yourself

131
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,509
at Punx or BeagleBoard wanted writes a
few

132
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:11,150
follow that link

133
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:17,550
you can get there alright the easy part

134
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:21,490
what's the easiest thing you can do
apt-get

135
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,730
every is there this is easy right

136
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:28,350
so you get lucky on a lot of the tools

137
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:32,030
you know I've pretty much what that
backtracked and I said okay

138
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:35,640
which are these tools does anyone really
use and which allow

139
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,760
do I find useful and if I thought it was
useful

140
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,840
I ported right up in many cases it was a
simple

141
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,370
as doing an app get in some cases

142
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,660
downloading some dead files possibly
tweaking them a little bit

143
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,590
are and they work so what works best

144
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,720
well if you have something that's
written in a nice interpreted language

145
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,770
like Java

146
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:02,090
Python coral Ruby et cetera are

147
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,490
usually it kinda worked out a box

148
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,690
I didn't have to do a lot of work oz
sea-based

149
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:14,780
tools you know if you had the right
libraries installed

150
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:21,780
most the time at work you know probably
thirty percent the time he had to work

151
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:26,329
so what about the harder part what if
you

152
00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:31,629
don't have something in a repository you
don't have a nice deb file

153
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:35,589
well if you get a built from source code
gotta make it twice

154
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:39,039
and you have two basic choices you can
either

155
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:43,169
bill that on the BeagleBoard or

156
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:46,879
you can cross compile now

157
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,770
why would you want to build on the
device

158
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,740
it's easy why don't you want to build on
the device

159
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,660
well you know it's a nice desktop
replacement but

160
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,770
you know it's not like a build server
alright

161
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:04,180
it's a little small Mopar device you get
a gigahertz

162
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:09,680
processor and you've got half a gig
arria

163
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,250
so it can take a little bit I'm to
compile something few

164
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,880
enter cross compile

165
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,680
right so what do you do when you cross
compile you cross compile

166
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,959
you take your quad-core hex core

167
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:29,690
act Corre whatever you have desktop with
boatloads REM

168
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,950
and then you use that and use all that
power to compile stop

169
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,630
and then use move it later

170
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:39,740
so that's the the big advantage well
course there's a downside is that little

171
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,960
bit more complicated

172
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:46,130
little more involved so what if you want
to do the easy thing are

173
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:49,440
pretty much I get to do is install

174
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,700
build essential build ask essential

175
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,540
and you're on your way by the way it's
billed essential

176
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,050
not build a sense shoals

177
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:03,210
arm I would have thought its essentials
its more than one thing but

178
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,660
Aydin name the repository and

179
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,400
pack so arm something else to keep in
mind

180
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,700
if you are shelling into these little
devices

181
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,680
if you're looking at the BeagleBoard are
the BeagleBone is different but the

182
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,680
BeagleBoard

183
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,770
the Ethernet is done through the same
cheer

184
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:27,020
that does the USB and an artifact

185
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,740
that is every time you boot the thing if
you're using DHCP

186
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,510
it says hey you're somebody nope because
it gets a new Mac address:

187
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,400
and they can be kinda obnoxious

188
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,170
if you keep getting a different IP
address every time you boot itself

189
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:48,680
just something you should be aware of if
your gonna work with these devices

190
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,649
art so how do I cross compile

191
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:54,190
others a couple of options

192
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,830
the absolutely simplest option is you go
you download a toolchain

193
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:02,870
on Tara

194
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,540
you set up your building vir manages the
a script

195
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,620
in there and by the way you can get
these lies I'm gonna

196
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,520
come to give you an overview cell don't
worry that there's a lot of detail in

197
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,650
here

198
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,590
you know you can ask me about about it
later are

199
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:22,630
download your source code and he do that
slightly modified version

200
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:26,220
up the standard configure

201
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:30,860
make make install cycle and the only
real change

202
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,320
is when you do you configure you have to
add this of shit retell it

203
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,270
hey I'm not building for this computer
I'm building for something else

204
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,430
what's that something else it's probably
arm

205
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:46,080
Hank Stram 1x new he the and

206
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,580
you might have to prefix all your stuff

207
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,280
if you're building in a subdirectory

208
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,620
are you don't have to do that if you've
installed the stuff for

209
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,770
every user

210
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,000
so once you've done that make

211
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,140
and Sue to make install will create your
stuff

212
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,630
now you got a copier binaries over

213
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,959
are you going to do that are you can use

214
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,690
s copy you can use

215
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,920
thumb drive whatever you want to you

216
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,210
you could use USB networking if you
really want it up

217
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:25,640
one small problem you may run into if
you're compiling

218
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:31,230
and you might have a package that's
designed for particular kernel version

219
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:36,020
if there's a mismatch between that
kernel version and the kernel version on

220
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,040
your BeagleBoard

221
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,600
you could have some problems I haven't
really run into this problem much

222
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,260
but is this something you should be
aware

223
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,530
so how do you do it a little bit

224
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:53,890
or fancy way right are well you can
install toolchain

225
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:58,500
as I described and then you install
Eclipse if you don't already have that

226
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,440
within Eclipse you have to install SEC
plus plus that tools

227
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,600
downloader software and

228
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,810
user make file to create an Eclipse
project

229
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:13,700
now you can there is an option eclipse

230
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:18,650
where you can say hey I want a make
file-based project that's probably not

231
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,700
what you want

232
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,800
here's why for one thing you left week
that make file

233
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,340
anyway because that make file assumes
native compilation

234
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,480
not someone that's cross compile

235
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,380
cell you're already going to have to
modify that make file

236
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:37,790
personally what I prefer to do is I look
at the make file see that the pen

237
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,610
disease are and I create a new

238
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,249
project in Eclipse

239
00:14:41,249 --> 00:14:44,549
you can do what you want are and

240
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:48,459
once you've done that you create a bill
configuration you have to tell it hey

241
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:50,059
this is not for my

242
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:53,230
me this is for this other platform over
here compiler

243
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:57,899
and then you move over your binder
simple enough

244
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:02,670
are again you can create the project
either is a makefile base project

245
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,680
which

246
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:09,380
I tend to not prefer or you can create
your own

247
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:13,150
I Craig bill configuration and you gonna
project explore

248
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:17,310
you tell it bilkul configurations
managed to create a new one

249
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:20,860
he set up your pass basically incentive

250
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:25,590
GCC it'll be GCC dash arm blah blah blah
blah blah

251
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,640
very and that's gonna very depending

252
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:33,320
on which tool chain you install a really
good

253
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:39,370
tutorial on this Jan axles and she's
written a lot of walks especially about

254
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,680
USB stuff she also has

255
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,240
on her website LVR which is Lakeview
research

256
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,460
she's up in Madison are on her website
she is a really good tutorial on how to

257
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,050
do this stuff

258
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,720
cell you know if you hear me talk

259
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,990
you get my sides are still confused or
you can email me or you can go to her

260
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:01,640
website

261
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,380
and maybe so do better di love

262
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:09,040
explain this to you alright are

263
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,190
method 3 the Cadillac method right the
same is not the two

264
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,570
except you take it to the next level

265
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:22,910
and you can easily move your binaries
over you can use Eclipse

266
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,270
to do all this stuff for you

267
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,140
and that's the biggest plus you can also
remote debugging

268
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:33,420
like if you're having issues with the
package that you pour it over and you're

269
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:33,900
thinkin

270
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,990
on what's going on well you

271
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:40,370
could fire up the gdb debugger natively

272
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:43,710
on the BeagleBoard or you could via

273
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:48,100
fired up remotely and use your more
powerful desktop

274
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,999
so how do you do that are

275
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:55,290
in Eclipse you have to go under mobile
development and add a few things there

276
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:55,730
is a

277
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,560
the bugger integration

278
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,850
package remote wants passed package

279
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:04,200
wrote System Explorer I

280
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:09,699
roses and explore actions you had a
couple of things

281
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:13,120
and you create and at sea hosts

282
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,289
entry for you BeagleBoard in again

283
00:17:16,289 --> 00:17:20,929
member my warning no if you're using
DHCP every time you power cycle it

284
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:26,049
its gonna change so if you're using DHCP
you definitely want to do this

285
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:30,519
and know what the new IP addresses and
change it that's a host you do not wanna

286
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:31,830
hardcore Nyepi

287
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:36,590
it changes all the time in Eclipse so on
your big aboard

288
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:40,470
install SSH which probably was already
there

289
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,650
energy DB server

290
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,169
there's a commands for that

291
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:49,700
are first time around you have to
manually SSH into the BeagleBoard so the

292
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,980
generates keys

293
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,779
in Eclipse a greater connection are you
created gdb

294
00:17:56,779 --> 00:18:00,269
in net file this is a key step

295
00:18:00,269 --> 00:18:02,249
sold don't forget that one

296
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:06,429
you're like why does it work on prayed
about configuration

297
00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:10,789
%uh so how do you create a connection
you get a remote system Explorer you go

298
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,440
to connections new

299
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,840
laid eggs and you type in a few things

300
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,019
you can optionally enter IP user
password

301
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:24,969
and all that stuff set of typing it over
and over again

302
00:18:24,969 --> 00:18:28,589
again don't forget the creek that Gd
bien et file

303
00:18:28,589 --> 00:18:32,599
so that you can use to use touch and go
forth and have fun

304
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:36,759
finally you've gotten through all that
as is a little bit is set up it's not

305
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:39,580
really complicated there's a sec a few
steps

306
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,969
once you get through it all you have to
do is

307
00:18:43,969 --> 00:18:47,289
use it I you can go and you can take
stuffing

308
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:50,679
cross compilers really cool special the
first time you like ask

309
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:55,639
company you know I built on this big
powerful machine and I sent it over here

310
00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:59,229
they have to do anything are

311
00:18:59,229 --> 00:19:02,940
little bit more detail here's how you
you can go create that the dog

312
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,079
configuration

313
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:08,410
as I said you're you can get the slides
are

314
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:12,120
make sure you do things slow like are
have been

315
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,480
execute before out I mod 777

316
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,350
otherwise tense things tend to get a
little flaky network

317
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,960
okay

318
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:29,419
switching gears a little bit billet
accessories bill in your own hardware

319
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:32,759
this is one example

320
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:35,409
Ave power supply

321
00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:36,460
right

322
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,450
I give you the SD card for

323
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,500
scale right

324
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,940
pretty small what is this it's a couple
of components

325
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:50,390
and it's got two 9-volt battery clips
why does it have two 9-volt battery

326
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:50,980
clips

327
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:55,170
while you can run to nine holes at once
if you like or

328
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:59,480
you gonna Ron 19 ball and when it starts
to get a little we

329
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:05,110
you plug in the other one and unplug the
bad one why would you want to do it that

330
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:05,440
way

331
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,530
as you don't on a reboot your stuff
right

332
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:12,170
so you want your stuff to keep on
running up

333
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,800
there is no other examples of stuff that
you can build but

334
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,590
you know there's there's a good place to
start as they said you're talking about

335
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,139
a less than 10 what the vice

336
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:25,289
alright see you can run it of a battery

337
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:29,179
for a while you know you can run it
often I'm all for bat

338
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:32,229
arm if you want a little bit more

339
00:20:32,229 --> 00:20:33,760
time

340
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,910
you can get something like a little
lantern battery

341
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:40,680
years and the cells and that'll run
longer it's just a little bit ball

342
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:45,310
here cell it depends on you know do you
want longevity

343
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:49,230
or you what size do you want this small
package

344
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:53,430
that you can plant somewhere please

345
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,590
alright so this is what I consider
pourable are

346
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:00,450
here's an example love this system

347
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:04,000
up and running are in this case

348
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,890
I've got it LCD screen

349
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:14,330
see if I can successfully login here

350
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:18,190
so I am its evidence LCD touchscreen
that

351
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:22,960
I've just attached to a buzz Lightyear
lunch boxes not even the big size lunch

352
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,639
boxes the medium size kids lunch box

353
00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:29,169
and in it

354
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:32,609
there's enough space I can throw things
like

355
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:36,580
this little keyboard I love these little
keyboard mouse combinations

356
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,690
you can get these for about 25 bucks

357
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:44,259
other Amazon its gotta keyboards got
touchpad if even that

358
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:47,259
you got a little laser pointer right

359
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:51,799
cell are and you can charge it of a USB
port

360
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:56,029
hey I got for a commuter jet of my the
Vikes

361
00:21:56,029 --> 00:21:59,129
right the device

362
00:21:59,129 --> 00:22:02,149
are I just named it Didak

363
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:06,609
some love you who are familiar with the
book neural mansur

364
00:22:06,609 --> 00:22:10,839
me know what the references so

365
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:14,059
this is the deck so

366
00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:17,809
you can are install a touchscreen

367
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:21,899
I I actually have the touch screen
disabled because I find the touchscreen

368
00:22:21,899 --> 00:22:22,710
obnoxious

369
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:27,229
I rather use this I you could put a full
size keyboard

370
00:22:27,229 --> 00:22:30,440
but you know for size keyword doesn't
fit my lunch box

371
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,629
are or if you prefer

372
00:22:34,629 --> 00:22:36,190
you can

373
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,769
have a BeagleBoard and find a TV

374
00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:45,159
year whatever and work with that this
platform the deck

375
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:48,570
also will run on the BeagleBone which is
a smaller

376
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:53,479
slightly less powerful platform right up
BeagleBoard

377
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:58,169
about 149 dollars is about eighty nine
dollars

378
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:03,909
the last if you buy more but are and of
course the BeagleBone is even lower

379
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:04,590
power

380
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:09,600
and that's good so you can run it for
much much longer time

381
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:16,600
of a battery so it all fits in my
lunchbox

382
00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:22,360
and here you're looking at to complete
system alright so I've got

383
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,789
the one with the touch screen in my main

384
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:30,960
lunch box and then I have my little
spider-man lunch box

385
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,789
for the separate system

386
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,889
you I say well but Phil you only have
one display

387
00:23:38,889 --> 00:23:42,200
no problem be cuts

388
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:49,200
wat just wait there's more here's my
little network up

389
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,970
which guess what hours this USB

390
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:57,160
it's all USB cell USB

391
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,980
power network are USB hubs if you want
um

392
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:05,940
a I even have a power cable

393
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,710
that

394
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:11,050
uses USB so I can daisy-chain these
together

395
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,750
right so I can Ron my second BeagleBoard
BeagleBone

396
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,610
of love the main one

397
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:21,630
network all this stuff together and then
what can I do with that well

398
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:26,010
for example I could take my BeagleBone

399
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,690
that's the smallest platform

400
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:32,970
and again it's running the fall distro
right it's not quite as powerful as the

401
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,220
seven earned 20 megahertz

402
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,429
system verses a gigahertz system has
half the RAM

403
00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:42,580
what it still got more than enough to
sit

404
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:45,900
and monitor your network and run
aircrack

405
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,660
right so it's not just gonna capture
packets its gonna crack

406
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:53,210
your WiFi what's there right so I can

407
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:56,210
you know take my little will be parsed
by here

408
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,700
plug in my BeagleBone

409
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,130
connected to my little harm shell into
it program it

410
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:06,450
disconnected from my heart go planet
somewhere come back in a couple days

411
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:13,450
right it's like a look at its cracked
five WiFi network passwords

412
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,670
so a for my first

413
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:20,980
them all this is the hardware years

414
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:24,170
are I thought I brought my

415
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:27,690
gag the antenna wifi can in with me

416
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:31,100
I'm really hoping I left that it might
desk at home

417
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,340
as I couldn't find it this morning so
you that

418
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:37,850
or someone has stolen a very nice wifi
in are

419
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:42,560
cell I have this 15 DB directional WiFi
antenna

420
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,790
has a ranger up to three miles %uh

421
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:51,150
the building I'm at at the University
sucks for why fights like a big black

422
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:51,530
hole

423
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:56,670
just sucks in WiFi signals are so I have
an access point downstairs that I have a

424
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,060
hard time connecting to

425
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:03,170
but not with this are and there is a
Hardee's restaurant about a quarter-mile

426
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,470
away

427
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:09,260
I can connect to their wifi just fine is
that my of the like

428
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:13,130
I wanna get get on the internet and
purse the university does obnoxious

429
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,460
things like be filtered

430
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,810
teen juris web sites like

431
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:21,270
0 at a evil hacking website

432
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:26,190
Websense has blocked it everyone knows
that licenses to like they're out there

433
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:31,090
there there hun Sen effective I have no
ways of getting around websites

434
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:34,400
like out that

435
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,560
it's a hundred cent effective for ninety
percent of our students right

436
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,000
alright so are to that

437
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,060
I have a little

438
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:50,190
Alpaugh wireless card this is one I'm
sure a lot if you're familiar with these

439
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:53,880
21 what al fuck here's a little tip

440
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:59,430
here's the two wat alpha most powerful
WiFi device you can buy in this country

441
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,300
blah blah blah

442
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,730
do not buy this

443
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:05,810
this is a piece are crap alright

444
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:11,290
and here's while say that this overheats
and if you do connect to a network

445
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:15,410
what's your connection speed they go
like this who were you know they're up

446
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:16,430
and down up into

447
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:20,480
right I would recommend don't buy don't
buy the green one

448
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,840
you know you're like woods fancy it's
great you know up

449
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,160
don't buy right the the 11 alpha Carter

450
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:31,210
awesome yarn you can buy the ninety be
in terrible

451
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:34,810
ninety be attending and works well all

452
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:41,810
are cell here's my setup I had a little
music so you might recognize that as a

453
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:46,450
Def Con 20-city no so you know what's
the very

454
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:51,490
basic thing I I use my system with the
LCD display by the way

455
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:55,550
you can connect a monitor to your system

456
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,620
even if you have

457
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:01,020
the LCD display connected the only
caveat

458
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,320
is you might occasionally noticed some
funny tense

459
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,950
on your monitor because I've sinking
issues and

460
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:12,120
you know having the power to drive both
displays

461
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,680
at once but in the works fine just might
notice

462
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,910
a little funny yes okay

463
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:22,390
so is what I call a warm up demo

464
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:27,400
so what is the world's most widely used
Boehner ability at every security

465
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,980
conference

466
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,210
ms alway

467
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:38,540
06 out so it's like alright let's see if
any of this stuff works

468
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,470
so what an ideal are in the left side

469
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:45,310
I don't know how legible that as are
that very much bipartite

470
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,940
I

471
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,650
I just a simple and maps can in my
network

472
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:53,800
and as you see in the highlighted parts
Chernoff

473
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,360
I see a process running on port 445

474
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,490
when the systems on Mike who

475
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:04,240
sounds like I might have a chance at MS
08 06 up

476
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,750
cell on the right hand side up fired up
Metasploit looks like I got the

477
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,390
that a ball or cal

478
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:16,200
I did it's the bail are afar Metasploit
yeah of course I ported

479
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:21,400
has played a and then and this grain

480
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,680
what do you see you see are well

481
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,890
sorta see just just trust me is like
trust in these

482
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:32,190
at this conference right are that here

483
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:37,950
what I've done is i've run my exploit
and I've got a matter for your cell

484
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:44,210
and if you are open up a command prompt
you'll see that it back it says

485
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:51,210
microsoft windows xp virgin 5 blah blah
blah

486
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,840
cell

487
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,180
there you have it okay our rightful I
mean

488
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:00,240
who still has em são 8067
vulnerabilities

489
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,510
actually might be surprised you know
sometimes you're like

490
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,600
but you never patched

491
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,480
but some people have it it's like the
Brits

492
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,590
great out

493
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:18,620
we fixed the language for them then we
we fix the English language

494
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:22,659
we speak English they speak British
right

495
00:30:22,659 --> 00:30:25,260
and you know some people

496
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:28,190
physically Brett's might disagree with
this but I

497
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:32,530
I told them it's their fault cuz week at
two hundred years a patch is they don't

498
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,590
subscribe to

499
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:39,590
so they didn't get all those pics this
is maybe a little bit more legible

500
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:43,320
here I've done a shell and it comes up
tells you its windows

501
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,110
XP art not surprising

502
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,320
alright what about some love wifi crack

503
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,460
so what you gonna do 10

504
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:56,080
crack wifi wall I can have start-up

505
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,080
Ehrmann Angie start up there Mon NGT

506
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,240
a using my one what wifi adapter not the
two water don't buy

507
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,980
right up you know funny story I had the
two water

508
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:14,350
I ordered it online it was kinda my
house as a deaf con the summer

509
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,830
talking to a vendor is like

510
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:21,070
mike d cells to waters because all we
don't sell those

511
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:25,160
yeah we started selling them and they're
just there is crap you know and they

512
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,179
overheat made all the stuff like that is
trying to sell me

513
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:31,860
another after is some like

514
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:37,100
well we is right it never hurts to have
another wifi adapter side I bought a 1-1

515
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,020
adapter from him

516
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:41,920
ice cantana and I got home in

517
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,230

518
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:48,559
came all over that def con come home in
like all

519
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,610
he was right this thing is that or
appease track art

520
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:57,820
so you fire up their mind what do you do
okay

521
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:02,300
air Odom you like yeah I see a couple
interesting looking that works

522
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,330
out there a I can see there's a lotta

523
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:11,310
Apple users how can I tell others what
Apple users

524
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,440
but look at the

525
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:17,610
massive previously connected network
lists on family

526
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:22,440
going on a of the screen why when I say
that

527
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,800
use a lot of the Mac people you can't
clear it

528
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:30,380
and burt different versions ally OS
right you have to be connected

529
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:33,790
to a network to forget the network how
convenient is that

530
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:37,190
that's going to be it for us art so

531
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:41,559
like yeah this network looks convenient
looks like something I might want to

532
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,090
crack

533
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:45,750
fire up aircrack and

534
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:48,020
I forget exactly how long it took

535
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:51,150
to find his password a by the way

536
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:55,630
any the are networks on here I did
change these passwords

537
00:32:55,630 --> 00:33:00,130
so don't think you can go back you know
I know all the one at do a road trip to

538
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:00,700
the view

539
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,710
and you think you're gonna crack on my
wifi Pat

540
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:07,360
networks are on campus now as
problematic

541
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,700
but are this wise person

542
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:14,310
fought like everyone else and chose
password one

543
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:18,430
as their password and sure enough it was
cracked

544
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:22,070
this is a wpa2 password

545
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:26,760
I love password one i've a little
sticker on my door

546
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,860
at the University I got from up

547
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:33,270
welcome soft and it says you know wise
men think alike

548
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:36,870
and choose password alright

549
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:41,010
what about a password cracking yeah
alright

550
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:45,960
yeah it's cool to get on your network
but I want to control your network

551
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,530
I want to control your router so what I
want to do

552
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:53,160
I want to crack your router password
somewhere cracked a router admin

553
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,720
password

554
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,090
andy is my password less I find that the

555
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:01,880
usually my first crack at something I
like the John password less

556
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,180
its short and you get a lot of password
sometimes

557
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:09,280
you don't get them all but you get
enough that it's worth a try

558
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,360
the other thing is some other password
less are not prioritize

559
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:17,639
I yet something like that dark odorless
it's huge

560
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,700
and it's not prioritized by frequency

561
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,640
cell I kinda like the jobless

562
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:29,480
and advertisement for John are but

563
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,820
is so I ran up and I

564
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,990
had a pretty common password all
password so too

565
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:40,320
like a second right the buzz through
five these password

566
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,230
and there you have it up I don't know
how many view

567
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:47,300
like hydro maybe some love you prefer X
Hydra

568
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,600
I all supported that so it's also
available

569
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,790
just personally I I'm a command line
kinda guy

570
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:57,970
like to do stuff in the command line its
I think it's

571
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:01,610
will easier cell yeah I could be used X
Hyderabad

572
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:07,600
okay what about WP ass

573
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,400
will WPS cracking right are

574
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,590
so what all you need is for that River

575
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:20,050
right so up it's in there

576
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:24,620
I so it's like alright let's fire
reliever

577
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,750
and for those are you there familiar
Reaver uses

578
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,680
a

579
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,950
problem with the protocol for WPS

580
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:37,450
and hacks the PIN code in the pic I mean
you can have the world's best password

581
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:39,020
that's not in any dictionary

582
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,610
I guess what that pin code is in a
dictionary

583
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:45,680
because there's only so many choices

584
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,289
cell and they the protocols flawed so
that tells you pay

585
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:54,670
that first half is right all no it's not
sorry I like you know so

586
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:58,109
itself it's very convenient because you
only have to crack

587
00:35:58,109 --> 00:36:02,060
half it at a time

588
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:05,300
are so yeah here's is just a little
screenshot

589
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,490
running Reber

590
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:11,700
and you can see it's scanning and going
three different things

591
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,120
by the way just a little tip on using
Reaver are

592
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,360
think I love what router

593
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,710
you're going after if you go to some
other newer

594
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:26,600
higher and a home office routers like
the

595
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,900
Cisco Linksys is

596
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:34,090
eat what a the 4200 e 4500 kinda routers

597
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:37,310
Andy the cut updated the firmware

598
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:40,600
so if you're just hangin on that router
with

599
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,330
all these WPS request guess what it
starts

600
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,740
throttling you bad

601
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:49,200
back and then going somebody's attacking
me and then

602
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,610
it's going to take a long long time to
are you might want to

603
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:58,140
try to prevent that by throttling
yourself back because if you travel

604
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,080
yourself back

605
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,420
you're probably still be faster then if
you let

606
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,670
the people that at Cisco wrote that
forward roll

607
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:09,010
arts the slaughter are if you

608
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:12,430
are attacking a crappy router

609
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:15,860
are rate i since a crappy inexpensive

610
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,869
router that you might buy for 30-40
bucks

611
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:23,820
at Best Buy you know the ones I'm
talking about they have the default

612
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:27,890
up SSID delaying curly

613
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:31,050
says whatever probably a default
password to sorry

614
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:35,740
I try that first up by if you're trying
to hit those guys

615
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:40,310
I you might wanna throw it back because
they tend the crash

616
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:44,090
if you hammer them too much so I usually

617
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:47,480
go with the yeah it does take longer to
crack it but

618
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,060
a

619
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,940
you know maybe three attempts and delay
for a few minutes and then hitting

620
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:59,590
you know they'd they seem the you okay
with that alright so here

621
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:02,869
I've got a couple love attempts going

622
00:38:02,869 --> 00:38:06,710
I'm sending this stuff

623
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:11,970
and up sure enough by WP as pin for this
router was a

624
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:15,630
was 5032 5436

625
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:20,370
and once you have the pen it said hey
password is password one

626
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:27,370
so you probably could have that directly
on and here's the SSID

627
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,759
RI this is what I call ponen windows 7

628
00:38:32,759 --> 00:38:36,130
like it's a Mac right why would I call
it that

629
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:39,230
I'll you know and I think are Phil

630
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:43,130
you gotta get your terminology right
it's like poon it like a boss

631
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:46,249
not like a Mac okay why do I say that

632
00:38:46,249 --> 00:38:49,390
early this year like January or sell

633
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:54,670
up there is a the age thing that came
out in the news what was this big thing

634
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:57,490
600,000 Macs

635
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:00,900
compromised because about Java problem

636
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,000
right

637
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
and what did some of us still

638
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,890
I A you know you pappas Mac users

639
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:14,680
look at you is that is probably not
appropriate response right

640
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:19,120
on I know that some of us you know if
you do that internally

641
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,130
maybe that's okay but let's not the like

642
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:25,310
and the downfall right up so

643
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:28,850
yeah there is this I'll problem

644
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:34,260
you guys I'm sure you guys all know
about this with the Java Virtual Machine

645
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,980
took a little time are it even to this
day unites I

646
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:41,600
teach security and programming but I'll
speech

647
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,540
introductory computer classes at the
University recently I had this

648
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,730
assignment for my

649
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:51,960
interest students that they had to tell
me about their ideal computer and a

650
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,810
whole bunch from

651
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:57,079
I'm gonna buy a Mac because the Mac
doesn't get viruses

652
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:01,779
are you know I was at my daughter's
school installing anti-virus last week

653
00:40:01,779 --> 00:40:05,430
and the principles like well I have a
Mac

654
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:09,580
so I don't need antivirus yeah exactly I
was bullshit

655
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,680
so arm

656
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,230
but anyway I thought well okay so you
get those

657
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:19,390
now those Windows users go in Cata

658
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:25,100
lot to you too I guess what was windows
all solve our old to this exact same

659
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:25,970
problem

660
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:29,850
yes it was cell

661
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:32,880
that's what I mean by polling 107

662
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,500
like it's a Mac so here I fire up
Metasploit

663
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,720
and I pull up this %ah Java atomic

664
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,660
reference

665
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,230
array

666
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:49,240
are exploit what it's called set up my
options

667
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,660
and

668
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:55,360
set my payload at sea which one that I
use

669
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:01,540
I just is a simple reverse shell

670
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:06,950
and hit the Esc exploit

671
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:11,240
brawls done over from a Windows 7
machine that I

672
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,349
Canadian the borrowed from the
University are

673
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:18,520
so says they hit

674
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,380
sending the jar set in the jar ban

675
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:26,369
I got a shell you know it's their shells
been created

676
00:41:26,369 --> 00:41:31,759
it sessions I N are you going to see it
says Microsoft Windows

677
00:41:31,759 --> 00:41:36,739
version 6 it's like comes with a7
analytes virgin sex but whatever

678
00:41:36,739 --> 00:41:38,850
I

679
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:41,670
and you know you see it's like dumped me
to

680
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:45,060
users University of Dubuque art desktop

681
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:48,360
okay

682
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:51,400
yes I did get them to finally upgrade
their job so

683
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,690
again

684
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:57,079
for my students don't think you're gonna
be still be able to do this

685
00:41:57,079 --> 00:42:00,819
art last demo

686
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:04,230
this is what I call it quits kitty demo

687
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:08,640
alright so quick Katie quick katie is a

688
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,069
term that I A N Aaron

689
00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:13,849
then X

690
00:42:13,849 --> 00:42:17,540
CNN develop out and it's kinda like this

691
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:21,530
everyone over the script katie is right
but the script kiddie

692
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:25,119
someone they can download stuff off the
internet news that

693
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:29,950
they can download scripts right sell you
know yet scripted easing at

694
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:33,950
actually skill older you know different
levels about that

695
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:37,520
all way up to you know some so really
hacker status

696
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,240
and then you know below the clip script
kiddie you've got like

697
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,569
Microsoft user you know when those
people stuff like that so

698
00:42:45,569 --> 00:42:50,380
on we came up with the new term to
describe

699
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:54,020
someone that's still above those
Microsoft people call the quick Kitty

700
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,160
wallet the quick Katie

701
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:59,859
a quick kitty is someone that hopping I
can't hit like download that stuff off

702
00:42:59,859 --> 00:43:00,810
the internet

703
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:04,150
and Todd Heap I can only

704
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:07,839
quick I can only use going to college to
all

705
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:11,060
right cell here's an example

706
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:16,890
this to all that I have on the screen is
called up for no wifi cracker

707
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:20,260
I'm review her to the store before

708
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:23,260
right this to all the viewed a month ago

709
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:26,400
Afghan 20 right are

710
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,470
so this is like point-and-click college

711
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:33,160
for WiFi I mean truly you don't have to
know

712
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,640
anything okay one thing what

713
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,839
is my wireless interface

714
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:43,200
but guess what he may have you may get
the pic

715
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,079
that other drop down box so how does
this

716
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,870
how does it all work

717
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:55,190
alright group are you click it

718
00:43:55,190 --> 00:44:00,510
on that dialog box and then you say all
right

719
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:04,789
use this interface dan its gas it's like
hey I found some these networks

720
00:44:04,789 --> 00:44:08,219
this one attack

721
00:44:08,219 --> 00:44:13,130
go get lunch you come back home you can
see it so well because it's in red on

722
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:14,150
the screen but

723
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:20,120
it's probably displaying a network
password for a little network I set up

724
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:24,350
around the of

725
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:26,590
okay

726
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:30,730
somebody might be thinkin what's up I
thought you said there there was gonna

727
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:32,190
be some friends ex on this talk

728
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:35,720
it on if you've heard me talk for last
couple years have talked a lot about

729
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,700
friends it's

730
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,820
cell are

731
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:42,370
I i don't wanna piss off Jackie Chan so
I better tell you a little bit about

732
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:43,530
friends are

733
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:46,920
how this whole thing got started I on

734
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:51,600
been talking a little bit about USB
forensics recently

735
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:55,660
and I've been using these little
microcontroller devises an awesome

736
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,850
but they don't do high speed USB so I
started thinking

737
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:03,310
what can I do to you good make this move

738
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:07,720
up to high speed USB so you know the
BeagleBoard

739
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:11,490
was out and shortly after I started
working on this stuff the BeagleBone

740
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:12,330
came out I thought

741
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:15,420
yeah I should do something like this he
has a little more money in a

742
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:16,430
microcontroller

743
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:20,780
but I can do high speed USB now if you
know anything about USB

744
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:25,780
if you're dealing with things like flash
drives the right speed absolutely sucks

745
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:26,420
on Nos

746
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,470
so full speed USB is fine but

747
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:32,670
if you want to do some friends again
Vesta geisha

748
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:37,160
on a terabyte external hard drive things
are not so fine

749
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:41,720
I me it would take you a long long time
to make a friends at copy

750
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:45,460
that cell

751
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:49,690
you know by being a programmer and
someone who likes to hack code

752
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:54,790
my initial thought was I'm just gonna go
in there and I'm gonna get those USB 1x

753
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:55,560
drivers

754
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:59,660
and I'm gonna hack the crap out of him
and I'm gonna make it do what I want and

755
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:00,210
then I'm like

756
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:03,850
away unfortunately there's an easier way

757
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:07,850
in a better way like there goes that

758
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:11,020
phone hacking project so what's the
easier way

759
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,880
you have rules

760
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,550
I mean familiar with you have rules

761
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:19,580
you have rules are beautiful thing at
they control

762
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:23,410
what happens when you connect and
disconnect stuff

763
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:28,530
so what I did is I created what I call a
magic up

764
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:32,930
so everything that's connected
downstream of the magic up

765
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:36,350
is automatically mounted and mounted
read-only

766
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:39,640
see you don't have to worry about
altering it

767
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:43,680
right if you want to have your magic
carbon

768
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,840
any green cuz its you know you're good
to go you don't worry about it might put

769
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,250
sparkles on it go ahead

770
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:54,520
I don't care alright but the cool thing
about this is that you can use it for

771
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:58,010
anything that you came out by USB which
is essentially

772
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:03,260
anything because he always can get an
adapter

773
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:04,740
I here

774
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:09,420
is just a %uh give me a little bit I
love what do the rules look like

775
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,720
you have a series of matching conditions
%uh

776
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,990
so here it says action is at re: I added

777
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:18,560
a block device and

778
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,130
and it's one of these devices

779
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:25,460
and if there is an parents vendor id:

780
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:29,150
all won a 40 an apparent product idea

781
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:33,769
0101 which happens to be the did and PID
for particular

782
00:47:33,769 --> 00:47:36,930
Harbor that I used are

783
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:41,990
then I set environment variable and I
said a couple of things

784
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:45,330
%ah and then I have another action for
removing things

785
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:49,760
are these actions create

786
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,180
script so they have they run scripts
that create other scripts which might

787
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:54,330
sound kinda dawn

788
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:58,570
at first but if you look at how this
stuff works and when things Ron

789
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:01,660
you end up having to do that right so it

790
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:06,030
in the end there's two scripts that
right to other scriptures or are

791
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:09,290
and had script and remove script

792
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:12,800
and this just shows you what the scripts
look like

793
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,960
are you know I'm mounting starve

794
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,860
et cetera et cetera out so as I said
this script all it does

795
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:23,160
is that creates another spring that's
why this

796
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,800
bunch alchemy

797
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,780
another similar script are

798
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:31,920
that product by the way I call you know

799
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,940
this product is called the DAC that's
before Dec a friend's ex Taq

800
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:40,930
I am %ah in future actions trying to add
other packages

801
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:44,400
to the deck platform a also looking at

802
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,380
other accessories output devices

803
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:50,680
are

804
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:54,450
I had a vendor that contacted me a
little while ago when he heard I was

805
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:55,150
doing this

806
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:58,720
he said hey can I sell like preloaded

807
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,380
SD cards and even preloaded systems

808
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:06,230
and I said sure whatever base open
source

809
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:10,130
do whatever you want are so that is
available now I'll

810
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:13,920
all show you the URL for that %ah and
all that

811
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,950
out you can

812
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:22,340
download the stuff and download my
install script the only warning is the

813
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:23,350
install script

814
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:26,000
is about three gig

815
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,490
because it has an archive

816
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:31,890
for the root filesystem the root
filesystem

817
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:35,420
on the deck is about 6 gigabytes where
the stuff

818
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:39,110
so there's a lot of goodies in there I

819
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:42,230
it takes about an hour and a half to

820
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:45,780
copy 6 gigabytes toward a class for

821
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:49,590
SD card now if you get one other more
expensive fast ones

822
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:52,810
you can do it quicker are

823
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:57,910
if you want I actually do have a couple
extra preloaded cards I might be able to

824
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:01,640
saw you for like and box whatever ob you
don't want to spend the time

825
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,779
I

826
00:50:03,779 --> 00:50:09,059
so other stuff I am looking at possibly
associating with a standard pen test

827
00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:10,380
this troll some sort

828
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:13,449
are maybe a port to another platform

829
00:50:13,449 --> 00:50:19,609
soon and are some full-on weaponization

830
00:50:19,609 --> 00:50:22,619
I love the platform are as I mentioned

831
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:27,770
I'm also an aviation I there might be an
aviation aspect I won't go into all the

832
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:28,440

833
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:32,089
