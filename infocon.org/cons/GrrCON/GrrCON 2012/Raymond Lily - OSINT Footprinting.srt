1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:04,610
yeah so where do it up Python talk to be
a open source intelligence gathering

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:08,830
talk and exactly whom I

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:13,740
so I am really I'm a student at Eastern
Michigan University studying I

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,180
yeah I'm on the

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,180
extended stay plan which means I'll be
done

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,269
in sometime are I but

7
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:28,699
a I am at thirty 7.2 on Twitter feel
free to spam me with whatever

8
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:33,670
I don't care up I'm also a analyst at a
company in novae

9
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,890
do in social media customer relations
are management and yet so

10
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:44,280
soon at Easter so what are we talking
about

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,850
it's the OSA gathering methods are we've
research with implications

12
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:53,020
specifically in social engineering for
this talk but it extends far into

13
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,059
marketing staff

14
00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:01,059
ants I your intelligence world so we're
gonna play with Twitter

15
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,890
is what we're gonna do today we use
Python to do it where he's a model call

16
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:05,549
tweet by

17
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,020
but before we dive into the actual API
stuff in the

18
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,170
code we're just take a quick I'll look
at some

19
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,540
key to our concept I'm sure all familiar
but was go over a quick so tweet

20
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,560
140 characters this is awesome cuz
people

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,330
tweet out everything really short
they've really don't think about what

22
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:24,909
they're signing

23
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:27,950
and they just send it it's also really
concise

24
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:33,070
so there's a lot of information in a
small space we also have the school

25
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,570
thing a Twitter the laws you follow
people this is I think they're

26
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,860
their main business model loves you to
determine who you wanna see

27
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:43,009
whose information is coming to you and a
lot of people say

28
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:47,220
I wanna follow you and see your
information so what will go over how the

29
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,280
other friends and followers actually
work here

30
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,619
so france we're look from is perspective
here

31
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,990
a followed be so ace friend

32
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,200
is be a friend is someone that you
choose to follow

33
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,890
moving on to followers so this

34
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:07,299
I love their terminology here cuz
following friends followers

35
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:10,479
followers from sees perspective

36
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,510
be followed see see did not choose to
have be followed them so

37
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,940
the person you don't choose as your
follower so we put it all together

38
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,970
from bees perspective these from the sea
these followers a

39
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,459
and this gets to be really cool because
if your trip out

40
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:31,090
graphene out are groups and
organizations and you're going to see

41
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,230
who's connected to who

42
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:36,550
and whose thinks they're who are who
thinks that they're connected to certain

43
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:36,970
people

44
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:41,260
they define that for you it's just out
there is public data so you can take a

45
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,470
look at any sort group an organization
see who's talking to each other who

46
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:47,120
follows who and you can map out the
whole organization

47
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,190
really quickly so

48
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:55,980
how do we do this we use Twitter's API
it's really cool to have that woulda com

49
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,500
and we now have to do this authenticated

50
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,430
about a month ago Twitter chains are API
used to build to do this all

51
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,640
unauthenticated you to send the right
you're ok West and information comes

52
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,030
back

53
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,349
now you need of tokens so how hard is
that to get

54
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:14,890
you go out to have that we're a calm you
say

55
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,050
you login with your your Twitter account
you say I wanna make an app and you name

56
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,810
it whatever you want

57
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,170
and you say okay cool generate of tokens
boom

58
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,580
done and if thats if that's still too
difficult

59
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,900
for you to actually work make a fuss you
can say League of the O of generator

60
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,420
tool

61
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,900
for the specific and point request I
wanna make and it will generate

62
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,950
the Coral Springs for you the the
command line for curl

63
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,780
you copy paste that in your machines run
it here comes information back

64
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,650
so were authenticated now great this is
an authenticated tho

65
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,730
stop you from doing something this is
authenticated so Twitter can actually

66
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,010
see what you're doing and who's doing it

67
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,160
that's all I really want to say is they
want to say yeah this user request this

68
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,270
information so we can

69
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:03,069
market never ties directly to that user
better based on what they're doing they

70
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:06,630
have to API's they have the REST API
which is what we're gonna be using

71
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,600
and they have a streaming API stream in
school you can play with that you can

72
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,220
say I have the search term and i wanna
see everything in real time

73
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,769
coming at me on this term and actually
returns 1 percent of them

74
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:20,600
because you just that's a lot of
information but it's one percent

75
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,120
love all the tweets in real time dealing
with whatever search from you put in

76
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,360
you know the committee but specifically
the REST API

77
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,470
well the right we buy we were actually
were about the API directly the

78
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,060
endpoints

79
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,500
sweep I as awesome Python wrapper for
Twitter's API

80
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,490
so you're right and you're a Python
interpreter import we fight and to start

81
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,330
rocking path

82
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,840
the of tokens and you're good to go up I
get home

83
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,800
dot com slash tweet by it's written by a
guy Josh the coder

84
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,160
is actually went pretty active on the
project in the last few months

85
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,580
our point in new features an updated for
the new API changes

86
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,410
stuff so it's it's really start to pick
up speed in this really powerful

87
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,520
anything that I want to do

88
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,990
its in there already are door I've not
actually had extended at all

89
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,450
if I go and look up the ape actual API
docs and say what is

90
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:14,240
how do I actually do this water there's
a method in tweet by that does that

91
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,090
so the API and points for using

92
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,360
if you go to %uh Twitter API to
twitter.com

93
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,900
slash status less use our time line this
gives you information specific to

94
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,330
users and what they actually tweeted so

95
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,280
takes the user ID or screen name so
screen name would be thirty 7.2

96
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,350
and the user ID would be each user has

97
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,700
a are 64-bit integer value associated
with them

98
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,539
that's how Twitter actually tracks you
across the stuff so if you to go on

99
00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:48,310
there and you were to have an account
you like I no longer like this name

100
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,530
I want change it versus okay you change
it but you still have all your followers

101
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,780
and you still have all your friends

102
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,920
because they're tracking based on that
64 bit I D so it doesn't really matter

103
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,920
if you change your name to get away from
someone if they have that I D

104
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,810
they've they've got you you can change
that I D into account is

105
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,980
basically what it is there's a pram
inner sense ID

106
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,670
which so every user has this ID every
tweet

107
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:16,200
has this idea as well to every tweet is
as atomic units

108
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,620
its sick 64-bit I D so that's the sense
I D you can say

109
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,950
give me every tweet sense this
particular tweet so if you're building

110
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,650
up a database and you say this last week
I have my database

111
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,910
I wanna see everything this person has
done some Sun user time-line

112
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:33,820
with the option sense idea but last I D
and here comes everything back at you

113
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,140
but you don't have %ah count

114
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:41,410
this is this is exactly what you think
returns account number of tweets

115
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:45,400
to return in the request you can do up
to two hundred at a time

116
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,560
and if that's not enough tweets you can
actually at page in there

117
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,730
with that you can page up to 16 so you
get 3200 tweets

118
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:56,340
at a time basically in in one request
3200 tweets

119
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,560
that's the max Twitter will let you get
for one person

120
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,770
you want for the back on that I don't
know how you do that

121
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:06,880
it's not it doesn't exist in the API if
there's a way back machine for Twitter

122
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,860
let me know really interested in that
but I haven't found it yet

123
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:16,110
%uh exclude should say include but
exclude replies

124
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,220
know it's excluding replies in this one
so

125
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,100
if I don't really care about the
conversations that you're having with

126
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,370
other people i just want to see what
information you put out

127
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:29,190
specifically I can exclude all your
replies so if someone tweeted to you

128
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,480
haha I went to the

129
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,990
ice cream store and they were out of ice
cream and you you to be back haha

130
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,060
well it's not really that interesting

131
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,680
your flight back that we don't want that
further away was it to get just the

132
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,100
information you post as yourself:

133
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,570
include RTS that stance furry tweets

134
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,210
so if you re tweeted someone by default
that doesn't actually come in the stream

135
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:52,449
from here but include read tweets

136
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:55,449
Eagles true home you get all the REIT
which the person that

137
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:59,810
which as we go further into some other
stuff all point out why that's ok really

138
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,880
good idea to do that

139
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,750
but basically down at the bottom tweet
by that API to get status

140
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,590
and then just the user name that's going
to return back 100 tweets

141
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:14,850
for whatever user done

142
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,779
next and point well back

143
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:21,009
that standpoint user show if you want to
get specific information on specific

144
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:21,849
user

145
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:26,799
again takes ID your screen name are
really cool thing here's include an 80's

146
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:30,519
so you get back tweets in their 140
characters

147
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:34,719
and inside the tweets are user names and
there's URL's and there's hash tags and

148
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:35,169
everything

149
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:38,519
and you can write some really cool Raj
axes and you can't parse all that stuff

150
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,459
out and grab it all

151
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:42,829
or you can just say include entities and
Twitter will parse it for you

152
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:45,850
comes back in the chase an object in
it's awesome

153
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:49,610
they'll give you 30 that Co your older
shortened version will give you what the

154
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,449
user actually typed in or give you the
HTTP request that their

155
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:56,759
actually gonna send out and sometimes I
even are on shortened URL so they bought

156
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:57,410
a bit lien

157
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:01,250
sometimes election resolve it for you so
you don't have to go do it yourself

158
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,759
our list of all the hash tags
individually will stop all the users

159
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:06,649
that were mentioned in the tweet
individually

160
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:09,930
so you just don't have to really do any
work its already done for you

161
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:13,870
and again it's we piled up API that get
user

162
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:17,100
and returns back all the information on
the user

163
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,920
and this is what returns back for

164
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,040
a user this is the Jason object for
myself

165
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,509
and there's actually an interesting
piece of information in here

166
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:31,649
if you want to figure out what sort of
operating system I was using when I put

167
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:32,490
my status

168
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:37,940
are just shouted out

169
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:43,649
give you heads and description

170
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:47,420
okay so we've got we lookin description
we have two characters slash

171
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,940
R slash and if I was on a UNIX or Linux
box

172
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,300
you would just see slash and because I
was on a windows box

173
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,680
it appended the carriage return
character so

174
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,410
you could see just by looking just at my
information

175
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,420
that I use Windows machines arm

176
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,290
again you have your also apparently I
still have my LinkedIn up there

177
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:13,699
great connect to make awesome arm number
followers France

178
00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:18,389
how many times listed when the account
was created sets in UTC SATs

179
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:22,579
actually close to gonna do the math
right now but you guys can

180
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:26,970
its were five hours of the give you the
offset what time zone and stuff like

181
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:27,360
that

182
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,459
is the count you enabled so should you
be looking for

183
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:34,519
GPS court in its potential along with
the cow arm

184
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:38,649
how many times persons tweeted is the
cover fights thats

185
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:42,069
if you had someone like a a sports
figure some like that they could have a

186
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:42,810
verified account

187
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:47,709
that its actually them using that
account well Twitter's not verified me

188
00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:54,230
I'm not big enough yet they don't care
so this last half a bit it actually

189
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,750
returns the last status

190
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,089
and the I redacted that information cuz

191
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:02,699
I didn't ask the person if I could put
it up there who was talking to so

192
00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:06,060
it's not up there but you can see it
watch list of

193
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,230
the background images and colors and
stuff an interesting point with the

194
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,089
background image

195
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:14,079
so if you have a protected account and I
can see your tweets

196
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,550
I can still see your background image
score at your Twitter page

197
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,850
and its gonna show up it's God's sake
house protected right in the middle but

198
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,519
you still see the background image so if
you were to put personally identifiable

199
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,389
information there

200
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:27,750
and I won't know what the account was
and I could see the actual content

201
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,300
you're posing

202
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,880
you've still given me that information
so

203
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,500
there's lot of things in there follow
request that so like if you were

204
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,740
actually can automate your process a
sunny now follow request to people and

205
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,519
stuff like that

206
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:46,890
this would come back if you grab the
status had you actually sounds of it

207
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:50,310
this is a quick Python code this is how

208
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,730
how hard it is to get set up and that
this the first half a bit

209
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,360
is all because I'm grabbing API keys
from a different location

210
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,650
so importing my consumer key consumer
seeker

211
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:04,580
access token access token secret setting
up an of

212
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,700
so off the coast we pie of himmler with
the consumer key

213
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,680
super-secret offset access token and
then

214
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,370
I now have a Tapio

215
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,690
our Twitter API Eagles tweet by the API
passing and

216
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:23,260
passing my of tokens and I could use a
tap eat dog get user 30 some point too

217
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:28,030
and it's a user dots rename it starts
popping out information we've now made a

218
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,950
request to Twitter we've were
authenticated

219
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,770
anything we want to do this rock n roll
350 request an hour

220
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:37,830
we're good to go so its

221
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,930
really starts get really easy and you
can just play with my phone and

222
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,100
that's as far XD is we're gonna go into
the Python code with here

223
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,990
we're actually start looking at our some
%uh the actual things that you can do

224
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:52,750
this so the method to the madness that
we're gonna go through

225
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,780
met talk about the information that was
gathered

226
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:59,000
what you do need to develop the model
that I was I'm a show

227
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,630
we'll talk about the specific tools that
are used if I didn't use

228
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,930
if I use something other than Python
explain it how I use that

229
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:09,510
we'll take a look at the visualization I
created and then

230
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:12,440
do a little bit analysis on and try to
understand what it is that we're

231
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,330
actually looking at

232
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:18,450
so the first one I wanted to take a look
at what is my echo chamber

233
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:22,590
on Twitter work for anyone you can
target this you can say I wanna grab bar

234
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:26,910
JW gorelick and look to see what has
echo chamber is what sort of

235
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:30,920
yeah I'm sorry call you off are what
sort of information would be coming up

236
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,190
back at this person what would they be
seen just by sitting there just using

237
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:34,720
the service

238
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,730
gives you an idea of what sort of our
perspective or bias they might have what

239
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,380
sort of information that they choose to
C

240
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,130
so I grab the last 1000 tweets I've
everyone

241
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:48,270
the user followed in that case that's me
and

242
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:52,280
just a basic workout and all the tweets
straight up workout

243
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,190
found a list of our 5,000 common English
words

244
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:00,270
on Google and is excluded those so
here's my

245
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,760
my list of words and I threw it in the
world dot net

246
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,500
so if you not play with that site its
really cool allows you to take

247
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,530
are adult a text document it will count
all the words on it

248
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:14,570
adults make a visualization a look
something

249
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:19,700
like this you can if you want to do all
the work at a time do the work out

250
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,620
there's an advanced feature and you can
say word colon and then a number

251
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,920
and that's the waiting the the word gets
so when I ran this against myself

252
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,020
grabbing all the tweets are the people I
followed security

253
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,490
internet seance so I mean that's the
stuff that people were saying and

254
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,990
speaking about that I was seen

255
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:39,960
so that was my echo chamber was coming
back at me what what perspective do I

256
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,370
haven't stopped and this can be very

257
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:46,880
telling are depending on who you look at
very telling us to

258
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,930
what they're interested in and

259
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,930
I mean if you try to market to them what
products might they be interesting what

260
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,930
are you talking about what might they be
using sup

261
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:59,570
even from a social engineering
standpoint on that if i'm talking Cisco

262
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,340
ASA all the time all day

263
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,430
then there's a fair chance that I'm
using Cisco essays

264
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:10,320
so if there's a new father Billy Cup are
new export for ASA comes out

265
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,530
or maybe they're using it %uh IronKey
ass is a jerk without telnet or

266
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,070
something then there's a new father
Billy the drops and everything's

267
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:21,570
gonna be out where you can see if if it
was up there

268
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:24,760
that I talk about that a lot so
potentially work wherever I'm working or

269
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:30,840
in my own environment I may be volatile
something

270
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:35,730
looking the little bit I love a chart
that doesn't require as much

271
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,880
kinda just diving around and trying to
just makes sense the data

272
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,810
tweets per day what does it look what
does the person look like when they

273
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,590
tweet over just a week period you take
all their tweets

274
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:49,440
so grab the last 30 to 100 with two
that's all you can get and the pot those

275
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,300
just over a week

276
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,300
what are the most active what are they
not active

277
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,560
arm and I actually do this for
individual

278
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,740
and then for a community as well om
individuals last 32 art with the

279
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,400
community

280
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,210
it's actually interesting as playing
with the streaming API see what I could

281
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:05,600
do

282
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,940
and I tracked InfoSec over weekend so if
you've

283
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,050
tweeted with hash tag InfoSec between
May 18th

284
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:17,150
and 21st the three-day weekend and I
happen to catch the 1 percent of tweets

285
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,990
and you were in that

286
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,250
you're sitting in my database now what
you up and

287
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,410
fun stuff here but basically all due in
part the tweets over weekdays

288
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:30,680
and here's one individual looks like so
we have

289
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,400
actually pretty big bop this is Sunday
through Saturday

290
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,750
so Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday
lot more traffic for this individual

291
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,360
that it's been a week and maybe

292
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,420
maybe this individual works a job with a
really focus that begin in the next

293
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,090
kinda

294
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:49,390
not folks at the end the week maybe
there's some to their job where they're

295
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,830
traveling a lot then a week

296
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:54,060
I don't know but I do know this
individual

297
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,120
is partly InfoSec community so if we
look at the community

298
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,850
to the that are they not wire in the
community or do they fit right within

299
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:01,490
the community

300
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:05,310
if we look at this this is community for
InfoSec

301
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:09,350
and here's how we tweaked and I thought
this was pretty interesting we have

302
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,280
pretty much flat

303
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,320
and then Wednesday Thursday Friday
there's a BOP

304
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,570
in traffic and source that they're
trying to figure this out

305
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:20,780
and I racked my brain like the movies
come on a Tuesday night so I like

306
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:25,930
what are we doing just its Patch Tuesday
it's not past Thursday I mean like

307
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:29,640
what what is going on why would we have
Obama traffic there and

308
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,690
Sokol yet again Wolfgang because you had
the brilliant idea conferences

309
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,950
where we're at right now and what day is
it

310
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,940
were not at work were at a conference
it's a Thursday

311
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:44,400
I bet you there's a lot more tweeting
going out today than if you were sitting

312
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,930
at your desk actually worked out
something at least

313
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:51,430
that your bosses would hope so but the
in so I think that's what this is

314
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:55,360
it's the InfoSec community we have a lot
to conferences we have a lot travel at

315
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,740
the end the week going to a new location
for the next week or so

316
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,230
like that I think that describes a and
and since you actually

317
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,950
I you you have the tweet data itself you
could dive into

318
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,060
individual tweets you could say
conferences and you could dive in a look

319
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,540
at the actual conferences and say

320
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,010
okay that makes sense there is a rise in
conference traffic there and it kinda

321
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:16,400
describes that or does describe that are
no it doesn't let's dive in deeper and

322
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,120
find out why

323
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,060
next thing

324
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,630
what does the person talk about and hash
tags are interesting

325
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,910
is a user-defined don't have tax they
say whatever they want

326
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:32,080
its way of saying my tweet fits into
this book it this little category this

327
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,310
is what I think the South

328
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:37,580
or I'm trying to be ironic by using this
hash tag or something but it's a way of

329
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,490
classification

330
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,600
in the user's doing it for you so if you
look at hash tags

331
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,690
you have a pretty good idea of what the
person actually

332
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,770
is talking about so again last 32 under
tweets

333
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:52,410
include entities begin where us that
Twitter will parse all this for you

334
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:56,390
this is just awesome the parse it all
you poured out the Jason object

335
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:01,080
you're good to go you have a list gin
its hash tag lazy hacker

336
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,190
not going to do the work if I don't have
to arm include read tweets

337
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,100
and what actually I have a a slide where

338
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,490
I didn't include the retreat and there's
not a lot of information there as a

339
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,980
person actually didn't with a lot

340
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,790
himself it with a lot himself every
tweet a lot of information

341
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:22,100
so if you include read tweets this gets
a lot more interesting and here playing

342
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:22,610
with

343
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:27,830
are Google our visualization API if you
do a Google search for code

344
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:31,240
are visualization playground on Google
there's a nice

345
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,820
Ajax environment that you can just start
throwing information into into running

346
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,380
it arm

347
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:41,110
so this guy that I was looking at are
you could probably guess who it is

348
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:44,300
if you wanted to but here is his topics

349
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,690
here's what he tweeted about himself so
hash tag and a Samsung network security

350
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,720
monitoring

351
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,420
bro WS 2011 so it's a conference APT

352
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:57,100
security aryan this guy's probably the
network monitoring he's

353
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,130
probably doing some

354
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:04,000
yeah Seth APT that's an interesting one
I think

355
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,170
probably isn't so the government related
sectors some sort incident response

356
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:10,330
like that but this is just just his work

357
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:14,140
his tweets we look at what it looks like
with three tweets

358
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:18,400
so we have a little bit different
pitcher he's tween more about security

359
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,170
on in when you include for tweets

360
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:23,620
and now we're starting to get stuff in
force akin sick world and

361
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:26,690
DFI our stuff so we're starting a good
idea

362
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:33,690
on the community this guy has placed
himself in just by his is hash tags

363
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,570
moving on to read tweets replies this
gets

364
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,620
again weird last 32 our tweets to be a

365
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:44,300
same old story include entities include
three tweets

366
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,430
if you're looking for read tweets and
you don't include the re tweets

367
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:50,710
you're not gonna get read tweets so it's

368
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,760
it's something you run the code say I
have nothing

369
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,040
and then you look back in Houston define
so here we look at three different

370
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,980
charts we look at

371
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,940
are read tweets replies the best time
for spots

372
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,340
so this is actually my information so

373
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:12,260
who do I retrieve and says for better
people up there

374
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:16,490
arm I don't actually I was surprised by
the state I don't treat with a lot

375
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:23,490
in comparison the number two it's
actually signed up who are reply to

376
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,669
this gets interesting we start seeing
people that I reply to a lot but didn't

377
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:28,830
show up in the recruits

378
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:32,760
so I communicate with these people but I
don't send their message on

379
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,100
gets to be kind of interesting if you

380
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,679
take both are side by side you say who
but as a person retreating hutu the

381
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:40,429
reply to

382
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:43,450
now you've found the important people
they're spreading the message the person

383
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,070
agrees with

384
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:48,740
and they're also communicating with on
if you were to try to get

385
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,309
from a social engineering standpoint
these were the re tweets

386
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:56,370
and the replies would be a good spot to
look at if you want to send a message to

387
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,720
get to the person that you're targeting

388
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,340
who might come from if you had if you
had the ability to come from someone or

389
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,429
spoof someone's account

390
00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:08,669
arm maybe you take the a lot of
something to make a 20 something it

391
00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:12,470
looks like it came from the right person
it really didn't but

392
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:15,880
chances are if you pick someone up high
of the person's gonna see if they're

393
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,370
gonna respond to it and then

394
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:22,970
applies broken down over time this gets
interesting from AR

395
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:26,610
if anyone's ever done any source sales
done easily cold call stuff in years

396
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:26,919
like

397
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:31,490
people are answer the phones are not the
dusts would be really cool see when this

398
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,669
person just be most likely just reply to
me

399
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:37,390
when he does not waste anyone's time
just call on than or

400
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,510
when you are you back at my desk sets
when they gonna reply there to call me

401
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:40,890
back

402
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:44,890
so I took a look at %uh someone else's
information

403
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:48,429
and replies per hour broke it down we
actually have a BOP

404
00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:52,640
at about noon so kinda makes sense guy
goes on break goes on launch

405
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,700
biggest a reply to people then again the
the

406
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,750
and other day 3 for 5 o'clock ok

407
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:04,820
arm another reply at at seven o'clock
and then one right before he goes to bed

408
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,900
so big spikes

409
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,720
so if you were to target individual and
you want a response from them

410
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,020
maybe you would send it the hour before
the most active

411
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,929
so when they they walk on their Twitter
account and they look at all the

412
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:17,540
messages that they have the right there

413
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:21,250
you're right near the top so that
there's a good chance they actually see

414
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:24,730
your content combined with the social
engineering stuff I'll try to get them

415
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:25,790
to click on something

416
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:30,050
then maybe you would take from one of
those

417
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:33,250
are individuals and target a certain
time slot to get the

418
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:36,380
the most bang for your buck so just if
you sent this

419
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,820
a message this guy at eleven o'clock at
night

420
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:44,440
the earliest he's gonna reply looks like
67 8 a.m. in the morning

421
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,620
he's probably seen it on a messages come
across through their and your stuff is

422
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,740
to be lost the noise

423
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:52,230
so there would be a really cool

424
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:58,010
that's the way I would actually said
let's replies people so here we get to

425
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:58,559
something

426
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,350
kinda interesting can we take influence

427
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:06,960
can we measure that and yeah this would
be the time to further con- balls

428
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,110
worries clout to do this I

429
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:13,770
don't like Klout they change their
algorithm daily it doesn't make any

430
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:14,370
sense

431
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:17,900
and they give you they don't tell you
what the album is based on

432
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,179
and if you give them a Twitter account
you have so much clout

433
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:24,240
if you give them a Facebook account you
have so much more clout

434
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,110
so Facebook is more valuable than
Twitter I don't understand why

435
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:31,690
but they just want information that's
what the company does they market

436
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:32,370
information

437
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:36,230
and are the company's and the more you
give them

438
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:39,670
the more clout people have but if we
take that just as

439
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:43,270
this is a guideline we say we don't
really care that you're over there is a

440
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:43,900
perfect

441
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,090
and that is probably not someone out
there doing better and we don't want to

442
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,630
take the time to actually write our own

443
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:52,360
you can interface with the API and grab
any user

444
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,559
and see are what sort of Klout score
they have

445
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,370
and another cool thing that they don't
really they don't talk about I think

446
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:00,840
it's there

447
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:05,240
their biggest selling point is topics
they take a look at what our users

448
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,900
tween about or what other people think
the influential about

449
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,510
and show topics and you can grab that to
the API

450
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,880
so you could say if you pull up bar

451
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:21,360
Wolfgang K

452
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,380
hey I didn't mention that you brought it
up so since you did caps

453
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:30,410
right now Wolfgang stop topic is cats
you go look it up

454
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:33,790
I've might've bomb that database over
few months and

455
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:39,400
poisoned at but its cats otherwise it
would've been something more sensible

456
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,320
like business our cloud computing

457
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:47,230
security but if we take a look at all
the stuff import all together

458
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:51,880
we can do something with with all over
last 30 to 100 tweets

459
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,530
including all the things and Klout score
in topics

460
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:58,830
and using a formula

461
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:03,500
because if if I had a close score 50 as
on her clothes were 55

462
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,820
I just multiply that by the number of
times I interacted with someone

463
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:11,120
really doesn't show a big difference so
i squared the clock score

464
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,120
so if we have fifty versus sixty now
it's

465
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:18,910
2500 versus 3600 clock normalize the
data set in everyone's kinda grouped in

466
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,670
towards the middle it's all compact in

467
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:25,330
so I would rather see a more spread out
value simple squaring

468
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:29,750
makes those values explode now

469
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:36,750
we get to come out to the the actual
video six

470
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:50,120
quotes

471
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:58,490
so what i did. here's I took my last
tweets

472
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:05,490
with the interactions with people

473
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:11,650
ok the real

474
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:13,779
so from when I was active in

475
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:18,299
to on to the present which was actually
August legendary the star

476
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:22,580
and this is using Google's visualization
API if you look up motion chart

477
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:26,399
it's a nice interface you to schedule
data in and it generates it's all for

478
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:26,649
you

479
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:31,970
so you can change the time scales and
you can change what your axis is our

480
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:35,110
and the cool thing with topics on

481
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:38,429
I wish I had a live so we can actually
show you and of show it in the video but

482
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:38,679
it

483
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,970
be better just feel the arm click on
stuff but if we mouse over individual

484
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,240
here a little bubble

485
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,539
it actually shows the topic associate
with that person so

486
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:51,120
the people that are higher up a new one
is no what topic it was like interacting

487
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,260
with at that point I'm

488
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:56,809
you can just hover over the personal of
but and so the talk about it

489
00:27:56,809 --> 00:28:00,820
it's actually see what happens

490
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:05,860
so we have some movements I think up
father here a second show the the topics

491
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:09,370
om yeah so you can click on people

492
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:13,660
see their names and on the right hand
side show back in a second so as you

493
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,470
mouse over someone the topic would pop
up

494
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:20,040
on the right hand side and clicking on
names allow you to track individuals

495
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,830
so I was interacting with ire de Cannes
Miko are from a secure

496
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:27,620
and if we see on the right hand side
we've got full box

497
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,630
where we can't select individuals we can
click on that and you could say I want

498
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:31,880
to track these individuals

499
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,750
throughout the whole thing is to be
really kind any

500
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:40,720
and you can track individual people so
is reticent his influential the podcasts

501
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,260
up but have to sweep through

502
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:48,920
so Wolfgang but ima be sized Troy so at
that time period

503
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:53,550
he exploded when traffic and and we can
see stuff like that

504
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:57,830
if you to correlate this with actual
events so what where was the person at

505
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:01,340
correlated with the interactions not the
frequency that higher

506
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,530
interactions with different individuals
you actually a lot of information

507
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:09,780
so on visualization will go back into
the

508
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:13,770
presentation clients

509
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:18,460
so every tweet you sent out has a source
tag attached to it and that's what

510
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,280
client used

511
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:23,010
could be web it could be TweetDeck it
could be Twitter for iPhone

512
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:26,840
doesn't really matter what it is but by
knowing that information you play

513
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,140
you glean more information from the
person as to how they're actually a

514
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:30,840
regular stuff

515
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:35,160
so here i'm taking a look at an
individual grab the last 32 or tweets

516
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,220
and took a look at the total counts for

517
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:43,370
the client usage just snapshot boom I
have less 3200 watts account look like

518
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:46,760
and then visualize that again over time

519
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,120
to see if there's a reason to even play
with stuff over time

520
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:54,480
or if it doesn't matter so looking at

521
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,840
this individual it just a snapshot in
time Twitter for iPhone

522
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:03,070
the gate with a lot from his iPhone so
now we know he has and I lost device

523
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:07,640
Vegas is even more information if we
were to target him our web

524
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,660
soco everyone uses Web Worsley

525
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:14,180
we're looking at a client it no longer
exists now but

526
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:18,680
it used to be a application on I was
devised a large eat-in multiple social

527
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,980
media sites on one thing so

528
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:24,420
cool Twitter for iPad arm

529
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,630
watch list of Cam'ron I owe us

530
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:32,510
%uh court we all information that points
to Apple devices for this individual

531
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,150
just by looking at their place usage

532
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:38,010
now if we go back up to a year

533
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:41,880
visualization here

534
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:48,880
client breakdown wanna take a look at

535
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,870
inning

536
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:57,490
so I take a look at select all the
different clients I only grabbed

537
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:00,900
the top three here customer us towards
kinda not really use

538
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,409
so we don't really care about them again
visualize them over time

539
00:31:04,409 --> 00:31:08,179
I want to watch Bruce Lee and

540
00:31:08,179 --> 00:31:12,140
so right now his overall usage is
dropping down

541
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:16,279
and we see a huge spike up in looks like
a

542
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:20,620
June July of last year gets even bigger
cities get more active

543
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:25,059
coming back down web dropped off so he's
not he's he was using mobile for a while

544
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:28,740
almost exclusively bruce Lee goes up
comes back down

545
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,240
and here in a second

546
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,080
or gone

547
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,860
in order user

548
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:40,799
so if we looked at his chart as a point
in time just last 32 her tweets

549
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,320
bruce Lee was third analyst but now

550
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,480
it's no longer relevant to he doesn't
use it

551
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:53,360
hasn't used it for the last three months
and

552
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,400
spas

553
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,100
but the interesting thing there is as I
mentioned the client no longer exist

554
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,720
it was the developers for a well as the
messenger

555
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,660
they made this client and a law wanted
them to go back to work a name again

556
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:08,760
I don't know why but they did so the
client disappear

557
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,510
so if you were to target this individual
for social engineering engagement maybe

558
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:16,660
you have this really cool application
you just built for I owe us

559
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:20,600
that blows it him to integrate all of
its social media sites and

560
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:25,410
again together in one app and since he
was such a power user for your client

561
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,380
before Bruce Lee

562
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,560
is your developer from that team you
gonna give him

563
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:34,010
early access to this information this
client and now he installs

564
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:38,180
your application on his phone
potentially pain

565
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:43,480
I think that's kinda game over that
point but

566
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,720
we're not done yet we thank you

567
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,700
interactions with topics

568
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,700
so I want to go back and play with not
take a little bit

569
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,820
and some summer student I don't pay for
multi go

570
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,700
so I have community addition so it
doesn't allow me to grab a last-32 under

571
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,139
tweets someone I grab the last 12 I
think

572
00:33:03,139 --> 00:33:08,169
that's no good so in this case file was
made import Excel spreadsheets

573
00:33:08,169 --> 00:33:11,849
or CSV files so I could do that with
Python

574
00:33:11,849 --> 00:33:15,059
take Python we can go grab all the last
32 our tweets

575
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:20,019
including entities again and we can and
I didn't mention it were using cloud

576
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:21,029
again for the topics

577
00:33:21,029 --> 00:33:25,239
and we can set up a document that is be

578
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:30,340
the person I interacted with and then
the topic for that all the case file

579
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:33,369
and whatnot Eagle visualize it for us
this

580
00:33:33,369 --> 00:33:37,019
this demonstration actually took me
about five minutes the code up

581
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:41,019
it was literally just boom boom boom
done grab the information

582
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:45,369
grab the cloud information for Taylor
CSV import mail to: and visualize

583
00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:48,799
like 30 seconds and this is what looked
like

584
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:53,309
and so I get that you probably can't
read the icons

585
00:33:53,309 --> 00:33:56,440
right now swung to give you a full
overview of what it is

586
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:01,309
before resumed in the stuff know if we
can actually read this or not up for

587
00:34:01,309 --> 00:34:06,009
can we read the source is too small okay
so

588
00:34:06,009 --> 00:34:10,379
one person the front can see it people
the back and we will

589
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:16,750
over here and we will pull this off

590
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:21,320
same chart and we can zoom in and we can
see

591
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,840
different topics

592
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:27,060
so we have a big no dove information
security so the people that I'm

593
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:27,950
interacting with

594
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:32,300
most on Twitter are all tied to
information security

595
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,740
we have stuff like music so I'm I play
bass

596
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:40,200
the band cool we can start moving around
and see the different entities on the

597
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,760
chart and who are interacting with and
what their

598
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,910
influential about arm hacking technology
stuff and

599
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:50,870
to grab this information after the
script written is like thirty-seconds

600
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:54,240
and third multi-goal and boom you have a
really good idea

601
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,950
of yes

602
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:03,730
so actually this is this is actual user
names so if we so if we look at the

603
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:09,099
the yellow images and pulling also this
is a good one we have HD Moore

604
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:12,130
at some point I interacted with HD Moore
so

605
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:16,710
I pulled out the user names using
entities and put a parse that all for me

606
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:20,519
and so that we can see and we can
actually follow

607
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:23,640
the line coming of age the more and we
can see that

608
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,730
clout thinks AC Moore is influential
about packing so

609
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:33,400
pretty accurate network arm know it's
actually the clock topic

610
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,849
so if you were to go on the club's
website which yeah

611
00:35:36,849 --> 00:35:40,099
so its it's a site that allows you to
define

612
00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:43,609
influence of individuals and that maps
out the different topics that they would

613
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:44,410
be influential

614
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:50,220
yeah which is really cool cuz and I
don't actually have to calculate that

615
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:50,789
myself

616
00:35:50,789 --> 00:35:53,880
so if I were to pull out all their
tweets

617
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,109
and look at all the information do some
sort of Calton calculation

618
00:35:57,109 --> 00:36:00,900
I could figure this out and you could do
it yourself if you want to if you don't

619
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,650
use clout

620
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:05,660
but since they have it there it's
already done just leverage it

621
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:09,109
and so that's

622
00:36:09,109 --> 00:36:14,090
played with that

623
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:19,520
will leave will scale

624
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,500
yes I lied but

625
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,130
worse

626
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:26,630
fairly close

627
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,880
up there was

628
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,530
so

629
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:33,240
if my son isn't your cup of tea and you
still wanna play with this information

630
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:37,700
is a really cool website week steps
acecomm if it's of

631
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:42,109
which is a crapshoot it gives you a
tremendous amount of information

632
00:36:42,109 --> 00:36:45,690
but someone I'm not going to actually
showing it but it gives you all the

633
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:47,920
start breakdowns and pretty much
everything that I've done

634
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,530
isn't weeks thats Art Walk charts

635
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:54,609
if tweets that is enough you can make do
with what charts

636
00:36:54,609 --> 00:36:58,130
it's not as friendly all the information
is displayed one thing you have to

637
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:01,970
say I want this specific thing click on
it give the user name in it generates

638
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,099
that specific thing are

639
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:07,690
again clout what I was playing with
there's another site

640
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:11,550
competitor clout arc red run by I think
people soft

641
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:15,349
arm it actually it's a cool site if you
just want a footprint someone

642
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:18,579
are they give you a lot more information
about the actual things that they

643
00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:20,609
tweeted the actual messages they posted

644
00:37:20,609 --> 00:37:24,490
and who they interacted with its it's a
lot more friendly in that regard but I

645
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:26,760
think they're scoring mechanism is

646
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,930
crap in comparison to clout arm

647
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:33,650
sorry if you like crap but its its

648
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:38,880
it's not as great art social much in so
it's an interesting site you can

649
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,810
go to it and you can type in whatever
you want and it will show you all the

650
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:44,160
social media stuff that's talking about
that topic

651
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,650
so if you put in the username for you
put in a name there's

652
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:51,400
the potential you have some really
interesting stuff come back work role

653
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,500
YouTube it called Facebook called
Twitter and stuff grabs a whole bunch

654
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,980
information brings it back to you
there's a potential I put at the bottom

655
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,319
because

656
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:03,910
it's not very accurate are you really
have to sort through it but maybe

657
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,210
there's another gold in there

658
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:09,060
%ah fear not a fan of

659
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:13,040
well to go for your visualization stuff
network attacks

660
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,579
plane back in the Python stuff you can
define your own graphs

661
00:38:16,579 --> 00:38:19,670
based on notes and your edges and

662
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:23,990
really cool thing with that is multi go
classes all your addys in together to

663
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:24,730
make that chart

664
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:28,890
it didn't take into account interactions
so if we look at the number for Twitter

665
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:29,980
replies that I had

666
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:33,109
we've seen walking was huge but if we go
back to the

667
00:38:33,109 --> 00:38:36,339
the multi coach R will things actually
be the same size as everyone else

668
00:38:36,339 --> 00:38:40,280
as he doesn't have that many things
coming into a links the only had me

669
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,069
and then a topic so is the same weight
as everyone else so if you to play with

670
00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:44,880
network axe

671
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,000
you would define the way to the node
where the way the edge and you could

672
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,930
actually show

673
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:53,930
interactions with topics and so music
look like a big topic for me

674
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:57,060
I really don't interact on Twitter with
that at all that's

675
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,560
apparently some the people I do interact
with do talk about that their

676
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,420
influential bout that there's enough of
them

677
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,960
but I really don't do anything with that
so it's kind of a misnomer on that chart

678
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:09,339
but if you were to do a waiting up the
interactions

679
00:39:09,339 --> 00:39:12,920
then with the topics you would have a
lot more information

680
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,369
pertinent information about the
individual so

681
00:39:16,369 --> 00:39:19,530
thats

682
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:22,900
pretty much it that is my contact
information

683
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,950
student Eastern email me with

684
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:29,050
any questions or do you have afterwards
otherwise I'll take questions now about

685
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:34,120
anything

686
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:38,020
go ahead for I

687
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,230
art

688
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:44,180
yes

689
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:51,180
no how I if

690
00:39:56,030 --> 00:40:00,000
so I haven't played with anything else
but every other social media site on the

691
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,440
internet

692
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,980
has API's you can pull into I know
Facebook is pretty wide open

693
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,070
if you want to grab Facebook data for
people in their interactions

694
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:11,390
thats and lets the users have locked
down in this is the case here to with

695
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:11,900
Twitter

696
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,410
lets the users have locked it down it's
out there it's public information you

697
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:16,410
could grab all that

698
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:23,410
and you could add that into have a a
bigger fuller picture

699
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:33,780
so where's this going what's the
implications

700
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:37,370
so the started out as a project I've
just what is out there what can I find

701
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:40,300
but from AR

702
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,550
an audit standpoint are you want you
want to know what your users are talking

703
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,030
about

704
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:47,240
maybe your your you

705
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:51,000
you think maybe years you users are
leaking your your IP out there

706
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,720
you wanna know are they talking on
Twitter about your different things on

707
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,350
the designs and stuff that what you're
doing

708
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:59,700
you could really easily you something
like to reply and you could grab that

709
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:03,160
information this a give you a good idea
if they're talking about a lot with pop

710
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:03,640
right up

711
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:07,810
arm it's really a it becomes very
domain-specific

712
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:11,780
as to how you'd actually utilize this
but it's really

713
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:15,560
at this point it's a data mining data
exploration thing

714
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:21,070
and figure out from there what's

715
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:28,070
also the Python module art we pie

716
00:41:31,609 --> 00:41:33,330
no

717
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:38,180
for

718
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,520
maybe

719
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:45,510
i havent I haven't decided on that yet I
realizing it's all public information

720
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:49,390
yes it probably should just be open cuz
you grab this information yourself

721
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:52,390
but have open source in all that stuff

722
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:56,470
and making the tools that make stuff
like this possible raises the bar for

723
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:57,040
everyone

724
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,200
whether they want to or not so

725
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,350
we can talk afterwards but to

726
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:06,920
right now it's not I get help and if I
do decide to

727
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,529
it'll be 30 7.2 don't give up

728
00:42:10,529 --> 00:42:13,440
there actually the the clout one
interaction with clout in

729
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,319
interactions that is actually about get
help that specific one are

730
00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:24,319
butts otherwise most or not

731
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:32,930
that's the one that if I get help so
follow Fridays on Twitter

732
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:37,260
hash tag FF if you're not familiar with
that its you go out I every Friday and

733
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,930
you can go on there you can say these
are the core people I follow and I think

734
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:40,800
you should follow them to

735
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,500
so I got tired of picking and choosing
it felt like I was picking favorites

736
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:48,619
so I said if I enter a grab the last 32
or tweets myself

737
00:42:48,619 --> 00:42:52,740
look at just the last month's worth the
data and then if I interacted with you a

738
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,010
lot

739
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:57,880
then you're on for Friday if if you can
fit in the top two tweets are if I was

740
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,670
not to tweets

741
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:03,160
if you fit in there the great based on
your interactions were alone

742
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,819
so if you don't interact with me a lot
or I don't interact with you then you're

743
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:06,809
not going to fall Friday

744
00:43:06,809 --> 00:43:09,980
but if we interact it on well then
you're gonna be right up there

745
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:12,990
so it's automated this is a script that
this runs

746
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:16,690
and i no longer have to worry about that
what people whining complaining like a

747
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:23,690
