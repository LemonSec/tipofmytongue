1
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:12,840
it started

2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:19,840
I'm sent Center how to control

3
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,020
was axed have but

4
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,890
frequent no with Aires

5
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,579
interest or work

6
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:43,289
you next and work with that

7
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:50,289
just when does a straight okay

8
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:02,499
and then just a few more questions how
many

9
00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:09,499
you have to flights PCI credit card
serving Zack

10
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:17,479
right so

11
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,420
that is me a perspective tells

12
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:27,039
so I

13
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:30,450
I think you know most organizations we
find ourselves in in bed with

14
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,869
space for programming

15
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:40,090
for that also always platform with
mainframe

16
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,829
UNIX clinic Windows mobile devices

17
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:47,969
just the security challenges around and
ever

18
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:52,140
fortune 500 company how are they secure

19
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,210
privileged users to secure their general
as well as you're working for a vendor

20
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,530
interfacing large corporations so

21
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:07,460
I think something that we all we all
share we all have privileged access

22
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:13,310
you have to trust them right internal
users trust and so

23
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:20,200
we also need to be able to verify though
with users

24
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:27,120
generally in a perfect world we only
give

25
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,240
the privileges need as opposed to up by

26
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,880
and then you know we tried stack and you
know

27
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,230
every year technology comes out your

28
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:45,780
I am you know that

29
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,790
we gave a lot of people access to a lot
more

30
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:55,070
a lot more really just

31
00:02:55,070 --> 00:03:02,070
regulation other

32
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,710
out you know we've heard about those

33
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:10,950
20 military national security issues
cause the government

34
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:17,950
first separation

35
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:30,610
grant access to to all these are good
security principles

36
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,010
us to freedom all this information this

37
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:40,720
really drill down into secure

38
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,730
essentially

39
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:50,730
a lotta really good best practices
bility I got it

40
00:03:53,420 --> 00:04:00,420
and ensuring it sounds use

41
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:07,350
shared filing use ministry here

42
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,970
or said

43
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:15,600
I let the other guy to how my

44
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,100
to 3 right

45
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:27,100
for their left about also trust

46
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,980
there how do I go back verify what
somebody with

47
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:38,670
so

48
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,300
I people find it even if you don't
necessarily have

49
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:47,780
which there were some if you don't have
fight

50
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,840
practitioner

51
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,680
as opposed to student lesser approach
that missed

52
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,460
so it's easier to read it's easier to
understand

53
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:07,460
communicate others

54
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:17,650
what Street regs are

55
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,930
how since faisal

56
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:31,930
force on operating system

57
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:46,500
I

58
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:54,910
forcing tracking and monitoring

59
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:09,750
so

60
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,850
it's like more

61
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:18,980
slide

62
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,960
you so sent by

63
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,410
to enable just

64
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:35,410
but

65
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:42,960
so this about

66
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,570
we have talked about regs

67
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:53,570
things known store is really

68
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:00,780
our network everywhere we go wherever
this device

69
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:05,340
have access to

70
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,169
also

71
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:16,169
gotta left process

72
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,699
slow process I'm

73
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:24,160
today your system and

74
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:31,160
just serve

75
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,660
know everyone has a mobile device
ActiveSync

76
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,680
so on morning

77
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,880
devices servers works

78
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,300
how do you enable to ensure no

79
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,750
know what devices

80
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:57,220
force impulse protect

81
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:03,889
challenges just

82
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:07,889
the other Expo

83
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:13,470
there's ways two-story

84
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:17,790
story stored other

85
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:23,290
store the information that way

86
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:28,080
there and then using Active Directory

87
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,910
subject but

88
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:37,319
ways to store for

89
00:08:37,319 --> 00:08:40,599
work

90
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:44,159
more servers

91
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,360
all inefficient route done

92
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:53,420
data stores

93
00:08:53,420 --> 00:09:00,160
centralized manage

94
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,389
so traditionally Unix Linux world

95
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:08,269
1i el Papa sir

96
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:11,740
you a really

97
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,920
you want for over answer

98
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,220
first Xserve

99
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,980
Yelp

100
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,850
so spirit I information out there about

101
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,069
that's another challenge

102
00:09:31,069 --> 00:09:36,079
also me

103
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:39,439
of people have access still

104
00:09:39,439 --> 00:09:42,480
resources

105
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,689
I just love much access

106
00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:51,170
had better control you know enforce the
sex

107
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,769
all those regulations no get smarter

108
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:58,170
every year

109
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:05,170
questioning more who has access

110
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:10,559
has

111
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,490
I know some challenge area

112
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,189
lot

113
00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:23,829
filed maybe it's me

114
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:30,829
push it out differences I

115
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:38,179
so it's not really a centralized storage

116
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:48,929
yeah make sued

117
00:10:56,569 --> 00:11:01,429
when here a lot

118
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:08,429
this accessed there

119
00:11:10,689 --> 00:11:14,879
and so so privileges out

120
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,689
granted

121
00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:23,949
and in the last thing is

122
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:27,769
and also when I this

123
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:32,019
let people

124
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:39,019
once the that how many stores

125
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:46,230
for you know like

126
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:54,339
controlling fire

127
00:11:54,339 --> 00:12:01,339
those are challenged

128
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:11,380
user so you see

129
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:19,130
lot of people

130
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:22,520
stuff

131
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:27,770
lot of people are

132
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:33,850
just because they don't know how

133
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,320
so

134
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:44,320
just things to think about chance
they're out sure sure

135
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:09,490
your do things have Dave report out

136
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:20,260
sexy effect

137
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,230
first

138
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:34,180
sec

139
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:41,180
like enables so

140
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:57,080
officer also so that's

141
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:10,100
and resiliency 30 wave oliver's

142
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:23,660
extra machines also house

143
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:40,050
essentially

144
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:47,010
shell security to so us

145
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:52,110
especially any

146
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:58,740
sure certain policies from acts just
like

147
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:04,580
sure

148
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:11,580
companies great

149
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:22,220
if leveraged that's why instead of
setting up

150
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:29,579
side have you can set policy

151
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:36,470
joining so

152
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:43,470
just managing

153
00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:05,079
authorization we also have

154
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:09,619
leverage I

155
00:16:09,619 --> 00:16:15,910
sec so

156
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:19,269
and this is unique since Friday worse

157
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:24,809
I said fine

158
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:27,980
every well

159
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:31,529
well

160
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:36,389
enable and what getting a handle on your

161
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:43,389
especially but

162
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,300
in the use for isolating what's she

163
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,519
for you side

164
00:16:54,519 --> 00:17:01,519
specific greatest so you can

165
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:14,339
uses a server

166
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,309
just gonna just a sec which

167
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:27,900
event

168
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,150
I have I have a Windows

169
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:39,150
2008 and Obama next

170
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:43,350
so Windows machine

171
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,880
just just

172
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,370
like actor

173
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:57,080
and also

174
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,150
I sloughed

175
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:06,020
session all

176
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:13,020
sup really

177
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:23,059
non-intrusive organization act so

178
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:26,210
get several

179
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,450
Microsoft stack one is

180
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:35,910
act and know if your organization uses

181
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:39,230
uses vision that

182
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:45,460
or

183
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,179
show

184
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:56,179
so I

185
00:18:56,419 --> 00:19:03,419
she's Thomas frets uses units

186
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:11,470
so have about office account information
fight specified

187
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:25,460
here that would

188
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:30,179
and uses direct control

189
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:37,179
shows this takes into consideration

190
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,000
maybe I'm that one said

191
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,330
information one server it's like know
that

192
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:59,330
math different more importantly though

193
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:06,220
Active Directory so

194
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,390
it. later

195
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:16,390
actually

196
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:21,720
doesn't

197
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:28,720
this allows so I don't have to set that
up

198
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:38,540
sure last

199
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:45,179
but I think

200
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:52,179
face accessed

201
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:57,720
I have another

202
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:03,690

that

247
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:47,510
if 45 fewer users this isn't

yes how

250
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:01,660

okay shows have to get access and today
we do this for

257
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:53,830
unix/linux as a show we have a way of
defining

258
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:15,280
rights UNIX Windows right

259
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:21,840
how the Conexus standard unix/linux

260
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:28,840
thats and then the for

261
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,020
with the and this is just a a sample

262
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:47,020
when you signed my

263
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:58,160
whether rights something

264
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,980
no about so icky

265
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:08,600
Active Directory years said or I can
make

266
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:15,330
temporary aside I want server

267
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:18,440
somebody

268
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:25,440
for have 21 what do I do somebody

269
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,620
change but I don't want

270
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:37,930
have so the process sometimes

271
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:42,500
react highway

272
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:48,870
France the

273
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:52,570

anything about

280
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:31,300
repository

281
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:38,300

282
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,550

so first know it

293
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:44,970
security logs they show me

294
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:50,940
Fred have

295
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:54,730
so

297
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:06,160
checked out

298
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:14,440

301
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:31,940
me situation

302
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:36,670
I so many

303
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:40,930
playback session and

304
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:44,740

309
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:04,870
ever wanted if someone

310
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:11,190

with by

314
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:31,120
tried files in the directory

315
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,410
my way

316
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:39,270

I go into a lot of places

319
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:58,390
call some

320
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:03,120

have runs scripts

328
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:39,730
sized spreadsheet to figure out

329
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:43,370
get access

330
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:47,320
Centrify when she centralized

331
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,110
factor it's easy to show yours was
accessed

332
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:58,110
she you can get show one

333
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:02,940
with so here we go

334
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,350
so years

335
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:09,750
red see get access

336
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:13,680
every machine

337
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,880
and then you'll see you see he only has
accepted

338
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,820
and there's

339
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:28,840
show up this is Health Organization

340
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:33,550
save

341
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:40,550
so so all against

342
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:49,840
have

343
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:59,250
its

344
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:02,960
to the next pieces its

345
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:09,960
for example

346
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:13,900
seven sacks has

347
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:20,260

with and

350
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:33,050
ID unix/linux session

351
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:36,410
