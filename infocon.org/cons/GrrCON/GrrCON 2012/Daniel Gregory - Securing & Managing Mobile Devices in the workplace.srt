1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:03,280
if you're here for securing managing
mobile devices in the workplace in the

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:03,909
right room

3
00:00:03,909 --> 00:00:08,099
I'm aims being Gregory and I'm with a
firm culkin's

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,559
creative breakthroughs were consulting
firm in Troy Michigan we've been around

5
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:12,400
for about

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,510
22 years and I'm a pencil strategist
there have been there for about nine

7
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,640
and what I wanna share to yasser today
is

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,850
something it's a topic about a changing
landscape is changing all the time

9
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,830
every month certainly every year the
last few years it still new relatively

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,789
speaking for what it is we do

11
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:34,030
ominous true in general what people in
this room are paid to do

12
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,850
in this room so its as a liquid state
right now

13
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,700
lot of things going on I want to give
you guys a lot of food for thought

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,360
in a lotta strategies you can take back
to your organization's

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,440
in apply those in real in the real world

16
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,289
I've had the you pleasure

17
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:55,710
dealing with a lot a large vendors which
are here today

18
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,730
and we enjoy a very close relationship
with them

19
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,890
equity breakthroughs and as such we can
see how this landscape is changing with

20
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:04,900
the industry's going

21
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,670
now people are adopting mobile device
strategies realistically

22
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,689
and there's a lot of fight out there
there's a lot of concern

23
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:16,340
a lot of people who are

24
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,689
overly army engineering solutions are
under engineering them as it were so

25
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:21,970
we're gonna come to go through that is a

26
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:25,840
as a group you today have only got about
30 minutes so

27
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,060
gonna get through a lot of information
real quick and I thought what I've do is

28
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,240
maybe make myself available to you
individually afterwards if you like

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,439
arms is gonna go pretty fast download
content to cover

30
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,619
K margin to for today

31
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:43,340
quick company history which I basically
already dead some training Chapada

32
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,850
slattery defray get started

33
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,430
all devices in the works that workplace
there's a stated the state

34
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:52,290
kinda level said I wanna do with this
team here

35
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,680
on to make sure we're on the same page
there's and

36
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,899
definition of terms and the players and
strategies

37
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:02,040
and how the industry shaping right now

38
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,060
who's who in the zoo understanding

39
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,950
I what your options are on both
technically and non technically

40
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:13,250
comin although I spent in space some
strategists and scenarios

41
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,319
that I've developed here a couple more
walks through together

42
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:21,420
again get you to ask three questions
every team's back where you come from

43
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,060
your organization and how you really
want to adopt are matured solution

44
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,080
really go through that and some top 10
recommendations at the end

45
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,910
again leaving you with some things to
think about converting went over this I

46
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,709
history

47
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:40,269
I I can talk even more about that later
I want to be this one up like this and

48
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:41,870
try to get some time backers

49
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,530
only have about 30 minutes couple quotes

50
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,760
any presentation starts off with these
but these are really relevant in the

51
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,330
current

52
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,640
well the last couple months actually on

53
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,989
the one from Gartner actually is I think
says it best when it's the same most

54
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:00,599
radical shift in economic up quite
appealing for the business and species

55
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,250
to I it is something new to

56
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,540
corporate America today design a secure
robust

57
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,750
on unusable mobile device strategy

58
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,400
but it isn't something new to us society
and have been using mobile devices

59
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,709
for as long as I can remember my kids
will never know life without cell phone

60
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:19,340
a tablet

61
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,170
arm so it's it's already their in

62
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,819
the park space bringing all that in a
corporate America makes a lot of people

63
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:27,670
in this room

64
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,790
really their skin crawl including myself
on we're concerned about it

65
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,040
we don't do with the headaches have
someone bringing me

66
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,220
or bring you guys an iPad or an iPhone
or

67
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,849
droid saying I want to connect this to
the network and the whole concept

68
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:46,060
really arm is their leading us were used
to actually kinda reading

69
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,269
them it's uncomfortable for us so we can
talk about that here

70
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:53,580
as a group to next one is John Harris

71
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,319
is a chief architect global the penikese
tragic

72
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:00,370
michael smith kline pretty influential
guy

73
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,540
found a corporate IT form any says
really well here this actually just came

74
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,319
on the last

75
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:08,500
last 30 years or so the ones you succeed

76
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,819
in bringing your own device strategies
and I will be clear I'm not just talking

77
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:15,310
about BYOD here I'm talking about the
whole concept of mobile device

78
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,690
management and security

79
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,389
within the corporate space BYOD is
you'll see is only just want to hear

80
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:20,970
that

81
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,090
but he speaking specifically about Bri
BYOD

82
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,800
those that it is a paperwork for
mobility wave

83
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,360
making a reasoned decisions again
there's a realistic application of the

84
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,860
technology

85
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,560
in limiting the choice so it's all about
getting a controlled back

86
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,449
the curly right now we don't really have
completely

87
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:44,110
will offer you a device while of recent
technologies

88
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,310
but you have to meet us halfway is
overseeing to the BYOD years

89
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,500
for the world and that's fine there's a
middle ground there and I'll show you

90
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,720
that

91
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,190
stossel really good relevant courses on
offer

92
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,479
so here we are I'm steady-state

93
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,199
injured why that's

94
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:05,650
in okay switching statistics

95
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:10,690
arm in its a changing landscape and
mention in 2011 4.5 doing subscriptions

96
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:14,590
by the end of this year 6.5 billion and
in the next year 6.9

97
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,850
you can see it as an exponential growth
going on here that just means more

98
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:23,009
in more on BYOD type I'm situations for
us

99
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:26,240
and the fact that it's its now
globalization

100
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,389
it's done we all have it just outta
curiosity how many people here on

101
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:31,090
iPhones

102
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,220
show hands K now

103
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,699
droid people okay Singh now both

104
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:43,020
I'm if you have both it more than I
thought

105
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:47,199
right we all have a right now I talk to
the people who had

106
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,240
their hands upon the third question the
both both people

107
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,960
sales rose growth is up on Apple so the
$84 million iPad and take 2010 alone and

108
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,770
I just began

109
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:03,139
on Mac as I only 1i I love everything
just an interesting statistic when I

110
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:05,520
broke down to 160 in minute

111
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,050
since its release if you do the math and
that's got to be in the ballpark I don't

112
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,479
believe our statistics

113
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,229
but even if it's just partially true the
numbers are staggering

114
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:17,880
have all Americans on smartphones I
think they actually it's more

115
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,740
35 employees the wanna pay attention to
use personal devices

116
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,180
in the workspace for work-related
activity sure hands

117
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,900
how many people here use a phone for
work yeah I mean

118
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:33,699
you raise your hand then you're lucky
you really are very lucky person

119
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:37,169
by anybody have a phone here that flips
open anybody you know

120
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:40,680
no who

121
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,870
sorry about that yeah

122
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:48,120
really I Mike okay

123
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,470
average American has for mobile phones
agree my kids both have three

124
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:56,240
its nearly $13 to $15 so it's here

125
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,720
going anywhere it's only going to get
more and more and more

126
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,750
so r8

127
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,319
lesser the next three sides here and I'm
gonna go through them kinda quick is

128
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,949
again I wanna get some time back

129
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:14,330
really just categorize first mother's
the the organization's X

130
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,050
that this is Chris changing your
position experiencing with respect

131
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,979
alternative endpoint devices

132
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:22,169
okay we're experiencing significant
growth and

133
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:25,630
mater those two categories I was making
a large for the so more and more people

134
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,860
are bringing their devices into the
workplace okay

135
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,740
again of statistics should be taken with
a grain of salt because as we know

136
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,660
eighty percent of 66 are are wrong
ninety percent of the time

137
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,699
or those you get I

138
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:41,960
so this is %uh those devices employers
and organizations

139
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,060
on using them for processes specifically
relate to the industry that their in

140
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,370
okay so critical on an important
processes

141
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,490
I don't know the difference really here
between important critical but

142
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:58,490
this actually showing that a large one
of the organizations are allowing their

143
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,830
employees to take part in using their
devices either provided by the company

144
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,930
or on their own to support with the
company

145
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:09,280
does processes procedures anything else

146
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,870
and the final one here's what types of
data are the touching

147
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,180
for me this actually lands a pretty well
with my personal profile

148
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:20,129
are confidential data customer data
regulated data intellectual property is

149
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:22,360
the kind of things i touch every single
day

150
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,740
on when I stop to think about it the
information in the data you currently

151
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,479
have on those devices

152
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:31,300
that we all seem to have you in this
room on collectively

153
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,250
if exposed in the wrong arena into the
wrong people would be devastating

154
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,409
to those organizations we all have a
little bit at if it's not storing device

155
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:44,120
you devices access to in some way shape
or form

156
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,410
so the players I talked about the
landscape

157
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,680
and I'll use a lot analogies for sports

158
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,580
because I'm in the baseball a lot but
the you need to know your players

159
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,649
you need to know the competition the
other teams the rules are playing by on

160
00:08:57,649 --> 00:08:58,279
the field

161
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:01,940
in the capabilities that you have on
your own team or that you have excessive

162
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,269
s

163
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:05,830
accessibility to you those are the three
big things and applies here in this

164
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:06,940
space as well

165
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,540
so here's the players the players here
in this case there are literally making

166
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,459
up the rules

167
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:15,540
as they go along it's a newer space so
their technologies

168
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,670
are limiting us in providing us with the
capabilities we have to manage

169
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:22,220
in a mobile devices and things like that
that nature so here they are

170
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:27,130
this is 2011 okay solicits pass for a
little bit I went back to 2010

171
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:31,870
but there are so many locos really
confirm on here that make an actor

172
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,769
so fast for it now in 2012 we see

173
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:38,790
something to simply disappear get out
the space altogether now they're gone

174
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:42,140
for couple if a reason is that merge the
bar the companies they decided to get

175
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,570
outta space gone a different direction

176
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:48,060
but in 2012 3 place for the whole new
host love

177
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,100
companies in different products with
different capabilities because you're

178
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,410
still reading the market and finding out
what people do what they want

179
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:58,240
and it's like anything else it's new the
players change the Mersey by each other

180
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,820
out they get out the game you want to
get into the game

181
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:05,200
we're still in that process you get some
consistent leaders and innovators

182
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,500
but still the niche players are coming
to go on as the exciting part for me is

183
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,329
a whole bunch

184
00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:13,640
that are out there was a really cool and
unique opportunities to provide for

185
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,820
capabilities

186
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,110
but by and large these are some of the
bigger players

187
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:21,730
I park it added a whole bunch more if I
ask you get all three of names and sure

188
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,170
gonna get like another 50

189
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,670
on this Alice particular side the point
is this

190
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:30,529
the change the changing landscape on the
capabilities in the players

191
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:34,420
there are moving around right now so
it's hard to really

192
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,510
effectively assess it what you should do
first

193
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,930
if you haven't given gone into a mobile
device manager strategy

194
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:45,360
or if you're in the midst a bit and now
you're kinda wonder what the next step

195
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:45,870
is

196
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:49,560
that's what I'm awfully happy with for
the rest this presentation

197
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,670
okay we've seen the evolution mobile
device strategies best practices with a

198
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,630
few years

199
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,730
and I'm sorry I'm talking to you after
you carry out just 8

200
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:00,440
in the rooms a little warm in the words
policy and procedure up around the

201
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,670
screen so

202
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:05,700
bear with me I know it's it's a little
dry but it's really pouring

203
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,050
so in any successful prod project can we
all agree that

204
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:12,470
its eighty percent prep in 20 percent 50
percent execution

205
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:16,550
5 percent lock there about three this is
the prep part

206
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:21,510
it's all free on paper we wanna jump
right in the technology park it's fun

207
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,399
it's sexy it's the cool party it the

208
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:26,540
things are much my phone do certain
things tablets

209
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,220
but unless you've actually gone through
and we've developed acute strategy here

210
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,170
those devices that will be heavily
managed

211
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:37,000
light to medium level of management in
the unmanaged people or the BYOD years

212
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,560
you have to have an answer or strategy
for every one of them

213
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,310
okay registrant here

214
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:50,160
okay so for a each tier what we develop
their what we've seen in the industry

215
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,440
really lends itself to a heavy light
medium and unmanaged hearing

216
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,870
I'm application but you gotta understand
the rest resources time and money

217
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,000
associated with each one

218
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,880
said a happy record had your head around
what direction you in your organization

219
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,950
should go with

220
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:06,110
are you gonna be militant about it and
rule with an iron fist and say

221
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:10,360
everybody gets you know this device to
get in this way with these agents and

222
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:10,620
that

223
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,370
it anything else don't even bring it
into the building

224
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,570
field service executive tapes
proprietary applications

225
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:22,029
force with corporate out on applications
are accessible to them delivered

226
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:23,209
virtually

227
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:28,769
obvious certain sort MDM agent some
secure web applications as well

228
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:32,250
limited ability to store data locally

229
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,950
our man if you do you encrypt including
memory

230
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,990
corporate data plans are typically fully
funded or at least

231
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,180
partially funded some kinda stipend is
given to the employees

232
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,360
and there you go you get your company
label phone

233
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,800
which I would imagine why you have two
devices and some cases this is my work

234
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,050
in this is my life

235
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:53,970
I don't like a joy to get my phone or
vice versa

236
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,540
run into that you want that a lot this
is really where we see a lot

237
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,899
organizations

238
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:01,800
starting to develop their plan is a
light to medium managed plane

239
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,220
general office workers you get the email
countering with applications

240
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,350
on these at this level a partial sweet
for perhaps

241
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:12,810
some of which they can select and
download from the internal app store for

242
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:13,970
that organization

243
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:17,510
that are approved in control by an
Indian agent they have a very limited

244
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,120
Billy if nobility

245
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,510
whatsoever to store locally because
thats still half the time

246
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:26,820
that devices being used for personal
reasons if not more

247
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:33,779
data plan staple have some casual
provide finally

248
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:38,600
get the unmanaged the BYOD people okay
to bring in whatever it is they have

249
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,209
freight and they want to access okay
that for them to good corporate citizen

250
00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:43,779
they wanna work work work

251
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:47,100
I but they want to use their device

252
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,380
okay ninety percent time its use for
planning re birds or whatever it is

253
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,690
but they also access corporate email
right they were access

254
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,600
arm and then when everything they want
their cake and eat it too can't

255
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,730
generally have it most organizations
said

256
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:03,670
pushed back a little bit on this eugenia
left with very limited proprietary lease

257
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,470
applications web-based

258
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,170
I'm very secure applications are
delivered via the web no data whatsoever

259
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,389
stored locally

260
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:14,600
and there's a little bit more about
avital on what's up for that

261
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,670
that we've seen in the last couple years
arm

262
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:21,190
but it's also dangerous game to play so
think about this is your

263
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:25,240
kinda developing where you fall where do
you wanna actually start managing

264
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,329
devices heavy like medium or unmanaged

265
00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:31,880
we're gonna see this kind of eerie p

266
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,490
so here we go is the part where ask you
to bear with me policies

267
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,660
and then again right into the technology
side so

268
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,820
eighty percent of it really should be
spent doing scenarios

269
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:46,230
walk-throughs wakeboarding it's all free
on paper so develop it

270
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:50,680
with records to a tiered approach or
whatever makes sense to you

271
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,310
from that last slide and then jump right
into this policy standard Scalise

272
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,519
procedures

273
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,110
working with your our teams HR legal
first

274
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:03,040
thinking about developing a plan that
involves you providing hardware to

275
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,459
employees

276
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:07,829
there's a lot of rules regulations that
are out there in fact I got a really

277
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:08,800
good

278
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,820
like coming up regarding a new framework
specifically for smartphones

279
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,920
on some me heard about it but it's his
recently released in its

280
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,579
some pretty good stuff I get some links
reformation

281
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:24,790
so the Heineken Light managed device in
Ariel's what happens if we get this

282
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,769
this device out what happens if we
publish these applications with a

283
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:30,630
current level security in sophistication
and their infrastructure

284
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:34,120
walk through all those what happens when
employees how do you

285
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,120
get back information are you really
wiper reset the device so they can I did

286
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,570
you

287
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,019
was for culture in your environment lend
itself to

288
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:45,759
a large part of that actually falls into
the culture and politics

289
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,750
where you come from y'all know better
than i anybody else obviously

290
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,440
what your culture will bear theft loss
damage

291
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,709
what happens on the phone it's lost
walkthrough completes an area of

292
00:15:56,709 --> 00:16:00,839
an executive levels phone is lost after
using it for a couple years

293
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:05,990
what happens what's on that device so
developing policies

294
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:09,279
very early on in the process

295
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,500
once you get that done injured run
technology

296
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,959
simplement the technologies that provide
the following basic tenants

297
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:19,529
okay we're not gonna get specific your
yet we will further down

298
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:23,410
at a high level timing Kasahara
provisioning and the provisioning

299
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:26,490
so if you want a hand-out devices or if
you wanna except

300
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:29,730
the a limited list of devices on an
accepted list

301
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,790
or the BYOD I'm type scenario

302
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:36,160
you have to you have a cost effective
way provisioning caps

303
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,290
on their devices or provisioning the
entire thing are you working with your

304
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,339
carrier's

305
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:43,779
arm do you understand what they can do
with the costs associated with all that

306
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:44,550
is

307
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:48,680
than the actual cost love deployment in
supporting that entire infrastructure do

308
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,589
you wanna on it

309
00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:52,810
what you wanna outsource it to some
other organization like an AT&T or

310
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:53,329
Verizon

311
00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:57,180
have you but you have to have where an
answer for that

312
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:00,490
getting the devices out there publishing
absolute consistent way

313
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:04,079
the secure when access options Michael
sport all over them

314
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,439
some of them how they gonna get back
into your fish capture

315
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,240
do year VPN gateways have the Civic its
sophistication needed to you

316
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,679
filter out I recognize when a mobile app
is connecting our mobile devices

317
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:16,520
connecting

318
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,089
purses use traditional laptop connection
you need to know the difference between

319
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:21,110
the two

320
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:25,250
may not make sense yet another side
enforcing of Education

321
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:30,059
structures two-factor authentication ago
tokens analysts offer based opens a lot

322
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:31,260
of options out there

323
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:35,390
one thing I will point out there was and
I'm just curious

324
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,820
Harbour Base tokens for logging in
authentication how many people here

325
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,860
Curia heard

326
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,559
token on the right now okay

327
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:48,539
how many people in this room carry on
this harbor tokens five years ago

328
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:53,230
okay it's I think animal that look like
a little bit for to me so it's

329
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:57,140
by time I'm I can sit there is the trend
seems to be going down for Harbour Base

330
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,240
tokens

331
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,280
K suffer based tokens are easier to
cheaper you can deploy them literally as

332
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,429
a service

333
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:06,590
so think about you factor factor
authentication is absent run down the

334
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:09,080
smartphones think about how that
integrates with your mobile device

335
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,090
management strategy how you gonna roll
that out

336
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:16,480
highly recommended obviously

337
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,960
virtual application delivery based on
structured authorization classifications

338
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,400
so here's something

339
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,890
I we all hopefully most of us have

340
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:29,220
a structured user-based authentication
model for

341
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,220
I'm dating Gregory and I work I'm in
UNIX admin

342
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,770
okay I'll have access to certain
applications arm someone else in the

343
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,870
county would have completely different
applications and so on if you've not

344
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:39,720
developed

345
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,190
that are ready internally that's
something that really seriously consider

346
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,380
before you roll out and put another way
or confusion

347
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,730
known as mobile device manager top
everything tonight considering

348
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,370
integrating that

349
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:54,380
same methodology but remotely what
access do they have to

350
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,250
to certain maps K and if that isn't
already in place and solid

351
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,080
it's like having a bad DNS
infrastructure each other's gonna happen

352
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,169
reveals all the ugly stores and bruises
that your have

353
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:08,650
don't make your life harder than they
really are go through that

354
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:12,960
structure that what app surveilled to
what classification people

355
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,580
within the Yorkshire before you deploy
these things out

356
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:20,010
that is a big stumbling block for we
were helping

357
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,750
our clients the point in the AM in on
strategy

358
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,789
Asset Management recovery I am on
administer this

359
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:29,710
are you gonna provide any kind a
supporter administration whatsoever to

360
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,530
the end users

361
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:35,179
when I call you and say my phone just
froze okay if they're a BYOD person we

362
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:35,799
all know it

363
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,309
it up right but if they are heavily
manage arm

364
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:43,120
then you can have ap sports staff is
knowledgeable up device they have

365
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,380
with the problems I expands everything
else the helpdesk is now

366
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,740
or your support mechanisms gonna have to
expand to accommodate

367
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,049
all these mobile devices is another Big
Ten into this in another thing that a

368
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:54,940
lot organizations fail to

369
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,260
realize up front and they get a really
deep

370
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:03,230
and it becomes a big problem for them

371
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:06,750
okay so the lowest tier

372
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:11,150
will talk about just Pacific with the
BYOD Group right now for a minute

373
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:14,210
on strategy should not be dependent

374
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:17,280
any of the following things off your
considering

375
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,520
supporting bring me your devices

376
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,360
and I will you know give you some quite
some sort of access should consider the

377
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,260
following:

378
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:29,159
you know you gonna be met with a
completely different set of hardware

379
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:32,600
choices they needed a few actually the
play themselves

380
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,590
so ask me anything and everything sure
we have hundreds a different makes and

381
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:39,230
models of phones in the building were
here right now

382
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:43,030
you can support all don't tried
expensive unrealistic

383
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:47,730
so be prepared to support the generic
bottom-line lowest-common-denominator

384
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:51,770
on the generally works for liking your
major operating systems the Droid style

385
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:52,890
West such

386
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:56,200
corporate data storage a retention if it
isn't there you not to worry about it

387
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,940
said

388
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:01,419
make hard and fast rules set up security
boundaries to ensure that no data at all

389
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:03,850
is ever stored on those BYOD devices

390
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:07,610
that's a recommendation obviously arm
it's a common sense one but it's one

391
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,220
that you need to consider

392
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:13,080
because it takes technology and it takes
to policies behind it would force that

393
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,840
otherwise it leaks out and it happens on
its own

394
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,400
then use it here to secure the best
practices people are lazy

395
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,480
I am take the path of least resistance
I'm gonna file you security

396
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,070
best practices policies and procedures
fine

397
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:31,419
we're gonna put things in place that
limit your choices take away all the

398
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:34,710
sharp knives so you can cut yourself
even if you tried so

399
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,980
boil down again to the lowest common
denominator knowing that people will not

400
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,970
follow

401
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:43,419
any process and procedures for their own
device I know I would

402
00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:46,750
device availability jeff levine damage

403
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:50,120
against ready should not be dependent
upon the fact that somebody

404
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,740
lost their device their own phone I
can't tell you how many times I've lost

405
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,270
this phone the last few years

406
00:21:56,270 --> 00:22:00,059
and it will happen so plan on that as
being

407
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:04,830
fair and assume they're gonna lose their
phone or their own personal device

408
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:07,820
you don't want anything from your
organization on their that would put you

409
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,750
and your organization

410
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:12,120
rest scary options don't rely on
third-party

411
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,400
after they made downloader installer
heaven forbid the actual operating

412
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,820
system itself

413
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:20,809
I'm is just as flawed as any other
operating system ever was or will be

414
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:23,820
a lot of people in this room actually
enjoy finding those

415
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:28,330
holes and cracks in going after they're
always going to be there

416
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:31,520
to keep that in mind with the BYOD is
those your lowest common denominators

417
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,340
and those are the variables and those
are the rules that you have to play with

418
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:38,270
the cancer

419
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:42,130
okay what you're getting yourself into

420
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:46,789
so this really get technical we've
developed four main tenants at CB I

421
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:49,850
over the last few years working with
customers for deployment mobile device

422
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,090
management strategies

423
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:54,480
in the phone to any one of four
different categories yours may look

424
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,169
different

425
00:22:55,169 --> 00:22:59,690
but this is our actual version of that

426
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:03,929
so with mall management and provisioning
you'll be looking at technologies

427
00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:07,919
vendors on providers have solutions that
allow you to do the asset tracking

428
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,309
so this is for the heavy or media
managed and appointments

429
00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:15,230
the track and physically get a barcode
hey you know i mean you have

430
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:18,400
the costs associated with all that
management

431
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,830
you know ongoing turnover rate in
renewal

432
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:26,120
in upgrades inventory management relook
at the creation and provisioning

433
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,900
it's all part love management
provisioning access and security

434
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,720
enforcing policies and obviously known
talk about the security policies how you

435
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,890
gonna push those down on those devices
and ensure that the being

436
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,400
here too in a timely manner yet have
some sort of infrastructure that make

437
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,700
that happen

438
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,120
logging reporting obviously remote lock
& wipes

439
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,980
on this important one week X Aki back on
in a few more slides

440
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:54,679
local access infrastructures how they
gonna get to you have a connection that

441
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:58,870
delivering support the application
installation in delivering

442
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:02,440
that firmware over-the-air FOTA

443
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,450
that is if you on those devices or their
organizations provided those two

444
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,409
employees

445
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:11,990
troubleshooting remote control
administration backup data recovery

446
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:16,000
data and encryption including memory
level encryption in GPS tracking the

447
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,870
breadcrumbs

448
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:20,260
knowing where it is physically if they
lose it

449
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:24,020
okay something else it on here that

450
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:28,419
occurs to me now release a few weeks
later after

451
00:24:28,419 --> 00:24:31,809
redeveloping so we slide decks is
training you're gonna need to train

452
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:33,950
those employees especially for handing
those

453
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:37,980
out onto them or at least giving a
stipend cuz then you have ownership

454
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,330
which means you're on a date it's no
different than a laptop right we give it

455
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,679
to our employees

456
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:45,750
we always say this we own the data we on
the hardware

457
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:49,279
its ours we can say whatever policies we
work book for the bring-your-own-device

458
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,799
is

459
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,610
it doesn't apply anymore so you really
have to you know be careful what you

460
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,890
doing hey deploy that

461
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:59,909
again they want their cake and eat it
too

462
00:24:59,909 --> 00:25:03,130
it's hard it's hard to do that to the
use cases

463
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:08,799
so typically for device provisioning
secure mobile app delivery

464
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,049
there's a life-cycle love more devices
we

465
00:25:12,049 --> 00:25:16,350
give out a device or we get a device we
install applications

466
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:19,340
were allowed to connect the various
sources information in a secure way

467
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,539
hopefully

468
00:25:20,539 --> 00:25:23,890
on we interact with that data we can you
store it for it

469
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,890
arm and then at the end that life cycle
if we've moved on to another

470
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:30,720
organization and the phone was provided
we have to give it back

471
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,510
or if it was a bring-your-own-device I
somehow cut the cord

472
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:38,100
in as an administrator the organization
after sure that there's no remnants left

473
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,880
or the ability that we collect or use
the data

474
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,570
in ways that we did not intend for it to
be used

475
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:48,860
so devices being provisioned on some
sort of centralized management database

476
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,270
obviously nvm solutions

477
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:53,360
should help you do that use being
assigned to that device

478
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,110
and that's important to know is just as
important to know if the user has

479
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:02,809
laptop 123 as it is that that owner also
has

480
00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:06,770
phone number 123 have evas and inventory
management

481
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:11,000
it gets back to that user provisioning
of vacation who has access to what haps

482
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,710
what vices such MTV agents are typically
installed

483
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:18,419
when their provisions there's a lot of
different schools of thought on this

484
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:22,450
if you're going to deploy wirelessly or
you can ask everybody to bring in the

485
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:26,140
devices that you can synchronize it was
some sort of process physically

486
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,669
connected start happening give it back

487
00:26:28,669 --> 00:26:31,850
there's a lotta logistics involved in
the latter obviously but there's a lotta

488
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,390
risk involved in the first one

489
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:37,020
reno got there got in stock reclaiming
at the deal with a follow-up help desk

490
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,039
calls

491
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:41,169
a lot of different things going on there

492
00:26:41,169 --> 00:26:45,309
so was there agent is installed locked
down and forces

493
00:26:45,309 --> 00:26:48,799
the policies the technical policies were
talking about the things you want to do

494
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,480
now on the do we're gonna get into a GOP
discussion here near the end

495
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,820
we're getting all the more that locking
down those devices and ensuring that can

496
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,380
do the things you don't want to do

497
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:02,690
are allowed to do things are allowed
obviously

498
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:08,020
I SSL VPN clients STP STP last the
connective renowned

499
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,760
is then established like I said some the
more intelligent vendors

500
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,200
Harbor solutions a gateway solutions
differentiating between mobile device

501
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,179
traffic

502
00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:20,289
laptop traffic is a very big difference
between the two

503
00:27:20,289 --> 00:27:23,340
knowing the vendors in which ones
provide some good options as

504
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,450
key this then they're allowed

505
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:29,870
to you access the applications to which
they have access the suspect

506
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,640
authentication authorization

507
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,950
the launcher naps purses others

508
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,080
information is then display so that's
basically the premise that

509
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,380
every step with this requires thought

510
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:45,789
in architecture architecting
implementation

511
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,929
in a staffer people to support it or at
least on

512
00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:52,659
a group of people responsible for making
sure that this all happens BYOD

513
00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:56,480
heavy media related use it doesn't
matter a lot these tents are still going

514
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,350
to be there you have to think about how
your organization to provide

515
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:04,210
does

516
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:11,210
so the end of its life right we want to
decommission

517
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,059
more time than sorry a

518
00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:20,320
let me just get under one's life without
you guys leave you walk out

519
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,240
can actually just take this as take away

520
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,409
and there is one other I can give you a
copy this by the way

521
00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:31,289
I want to get down to you

522
00:28:31,289 --> 00:28:38,289
re there's a virtual

523
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:43,380
there was good keep track of time

524
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,840
here there is a new

525
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:52,159
smartphone framework

526
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,610
that other smartphone pen test
frameworks may hurt a bit spf

527
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:00,940
no it's it's it's really knew arm

528
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:06,470
if I had show you once loved ones one
slide

529
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:13,470
take away which means

530
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:21,400
it's a link

531
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:27,429
so

532
00:29:27,429 --> 00:29:29,309
wasn't like get the traditional way so

533
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:36,309
work for me course the last line

534
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:46,200
realized skid

535
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:58,510
have to give us have fund-raising happy
equity for

536
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:02,440
their prevent Penta streamer

537
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,330
Bob security dot com or read is Google

538
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:11,670
secured acecomm spf you'll find it it's
a very interesting

539
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:16,830
new framework sexy was developed to pen
testing in smartphones and its

540
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:21,010
open source 3 funded by dr.

541
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:24,360
and I know a lot of people living with
the Deaf like at

542
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:30,170
me senior about sorry no I ran a little
over time but

543
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,890
appreciate every comment thanks much
about make yourself available
