3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,330
it is morning ivan is raffling off and
you guys follow me

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,509
on Twitter I I'm

5
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:18,830
white Matt on Twitter I with HP and
apparently we have a booth United know

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,280
about

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,960
that happens were small company

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,820
on this talk is our is getting a has

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,090
it's getting more airplane ac/dc song in
the eighties

10
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:35,730
I am I i've I've done this a couple
times three times in last two days and

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,590
matter fact its it's an interesting
Genesis anybody ever done red team

12
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:43,110
exercises anybody anybody Buehler

13
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,800
Euler one guy in the back that runs the

14
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,000
spider labs red team hi Nick

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,100
okay so I'm gonna rock is

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:00,699
I that's already cellular so a policy i
think is a poor substitute for

17
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:01,550
preparation

18
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:06,100
on agree disagree anybody ever disagree
with us

19
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:11,300
good good start so how do you guys know
how to change a tire

20
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,560
okay how you guys actually change a tire

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,500
I'm you got to change a tire on the
roadside the dark was pouring rain and

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,009
your girlfriend or wife discriminated
hurry the hell up

23
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,299
right so you probably know there's a big
difference between reading the manual it

24
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:27,549
says how to change a tire

25
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:33,159
and doing it under serious duress yeah
and watch Formula One

26
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,990
and Formula one fans are NASCAR fans is
a

27
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:41,670
trait british so if you ever watch those
are those racing car type some vyvanse

28
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,220
you can watch in Formula One the kinship
take four tires of a car

29
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,640
and put four new ones onto a car in 2.6
seconds

30
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,890
it takes me that long to blink right it
is ridiculously fast you know what those

31
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,990
guys didn't get that way

32
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,270
by reading a manual they practice that
crap day in day out repeatedly

33
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:05,050
over and over till they can do it in
their sleep some of them literally can

34
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:05,810
do in their sleep

35
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,979
and some of them are still asleep
because they're tired from last night's

36
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:09,810
practice so

37
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,950
the question really is it can you change
the tires can you do it under severe

38
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:14,910
duress

39
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:19,060
and when the world is changing tires
have to do with security

40
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,820
while I'll tell you I'm you guessed you
like you practice security

41
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:27,020
get the fact that number is raising and
lowering

42
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,810
was a it was a real steal your

43
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,290
chief janitors okay so

44
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:41,290
if you have a little fun with this so
what is practice make

45
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,060
a Sony certainly before it practice
makes

46
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:55,060
although sons in whom I am well pleased

47
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,670
God

48
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,490
say you 0

49
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:08,290
the governor fended somebody

50
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:14,180
is that is was that you messing with me
back there at the microphone not funny

51
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,970
stress again so practice makes you

52
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,430
usually everybody around this part says
perfect nationally it makes good enough

53
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,290
so free practice

54
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,019
often enough and do it often enough to
actually get us to a state of good

55
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:26,530
enough

56
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,510
so information security

57
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:35,200
what is the goal seriously you guys are
boring

58
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,080
what's it all the fish security thank
you off

59
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,400
so it's lot of us are stuck thanks lot
officer stock in the eye

60
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,780
in in this mentality a anybody here

61
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,880
out there by show of hands wants to tell
me that they're here to their work in

62
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,970
the company coming to work for to
prevent attack

63
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,890
interesting about prevent a breach

64
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:04,970
interesting about prevent an incident

65
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:09,240
and those are different right kak

66
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,330
have up how many you guys are out there
to survive

67
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,470
an attack K

68
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,930
so you guys know the bear analogy right

69
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,150
two hikers one running away from the
verdi other ones tying issues gotta

70
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,790
outrun the guy behind him wrong

71
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,850
because in this world there are an
infinite number of bears and multiply

72
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,850
like bunnies get it

73
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,600
and their everywhere

74
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,700
it's got a real the funnier than that
geez

75
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,280
tough crowd yes killing me

76
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,010
alright so there is an infinite number a
bad people out there in the problem is

77
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:47,270
you're not gonna really run away from
anything used to run into the next

78
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:51,380
other thing right so it's not a matter
of can you avoid anything

79
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:55,560
i'd I'm gonna say this with all the love
my heart for you guys in the world to

80
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,860
raise your hand at beginning at

81
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,170
I when I asked but if you think you can
to prevent anything

82
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:04,550
I iPod Touch a little bit delusional
because prevention

83
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,330
in security is not especially in the
breach

84
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:12,530
area right you can't prevent attacks

85
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:17,070
it's physically not possible I can go
attack you right now it can prevent it

86
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:20,619
somebody in russia can go attack you
right now

87
00:05:20,619 --> 00:05:23,779
the guy next year your next door
neighbor can attack you right now you

88
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:26,319
can't prevent it there's too many
adversaries

89
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:31,109
you can't handcuff them all we've tried
so the nose notion

90
00:05:31,109 --> 00:05:35,879
I've resilience starts to come into play
and a lot of us can't define what this

91
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:36,449
is

92
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:40,319
so resilience really means what

93
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:46,150
particularly enterprise was a main take
a shot bounced back that's absolutely

94
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,710
correct

95
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:50,759
it's how do you get back to business
okay and those of us that have

96
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,039
I have lived in the IT security world
long enough

97
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:58,699
know that getting back to business is
number one it's like the prime directive

98
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:02,740
Star Trek nerds anybody anyway yes see
that gets a laugh

99
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,360
she sure it's a no money fight I'm never
gonna start racking

100
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,860
changes my entire slide deck to getting
back to business

101
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,699
is the one important thing did you not
to prevent anything

102
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:17,029
you're not gonna really even avoid
anything

103
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:20,830
I probably can promise you that during
the course of your time at whatever

104
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,089
company you work for

105
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:28,230
you my actually the likelihood of you
getting hacked is pretty good

106
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:31,090
the likelihood be noticing is actually
pretty bad the likelihood of you getting

107
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,150
cactus pretty good

108
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:36,919
so can you facilitate resilience how
many do you guys feel you can facilitate

109
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:40,310
resilience

110
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,590
me okay great so you're you're in a good
spot them

111
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:47,090
there's a I liked it I like to tell
people that

112
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,819
most of us probably can't not very well

113
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:57,210
because what we're all stuck doing is
security and security is a

114
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:01,000
rough thing to be worried about when you
can even tell whether you've been

115
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,069
breached or not excuse for

116
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:09,389
it's a 90 on me every cell

117
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:13,000
I quick another quick show of hands fun
poll

118
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,470
how many have you guys ever enterprise
security policy

119
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:20,139
k keep your hands up if you've got a
Center procedures for its a response

120
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:25,220
keep your hands above you have lots and
lots of confine controls

121
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,310
keep your hands if you've got tons and
white a blinky lights and technology

122
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:32,670
everybody's hands go up on that one if
you don't have any

123
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:38,920
if you have you had any on this 1 I'm
curious my question all you is so what

124
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,260
does

125
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,779
any a bit work

126
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:52,550
me feel confident saying yes

127
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,850
some

128
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:57,169
how do you know

129
00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:00,440
right the notion of how the hell you
know any this crap in the closet works

130
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,000
for the lights blink reminders

131
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,480
no bad guys a like button blinks red
when there's bad guys

132
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,780
kinda scary is that so

133
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,580
preparation i think is relative going
back to my family

134
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,830
Formula one example preparation turns
into a very relative thing because

135
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,960
you can practice something in practice
something in practice something in

136
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,840
practice something

137
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,070
and eventually

138
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,889
you'll get it right you'll be able to be
good at it right this is why

139
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:31,220
if you've ever watched at the Virgin
passed an airport where looks like as a

140
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,190
plane on fire

141
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,349
anybody's ever seen that for some ice on
its good how are you like what is going

142
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,190
on at the airport well that's the fire

143
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:43,099
that's the I is a response team
practicing they do it about once a month

144
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:46,540
they set up fake plane on fire Naidu
fire-rescue

145
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:51,029
roughly once a month all major airports
not because it's fun the setup at the

146
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:53,130
big giant now playing on fire

147
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:57,720
run inside it risk your life burning to
death but because they need the practice

148
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,480
and be damn good at it I def wanna won t
didn't get to 2.6 seconds on four tires

149
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,740
because they read manuals are they tried
it once

150
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,670
are somebody told them how to do it once
right David somebody's guys was an

151
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,399
interview done

152
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,480
these guys practice eight to nine
hundred times in the course of a week

153
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,520
if your job

154
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,490
on their formula 1 team is the guy
holding the gun doing

155
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,029
this that means you don't you've done
that

156
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:27,500
eighteen hundred times in the course of
a week

157
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,450
at if muscle memory doesn't take over at
that point you suck at your job

158
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,890
more importantly suck as a human being

159
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:39,000
right so preparation is relative lot of
us

160
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,100
prepare but what do we prepare for

161
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,360
you guys all know Josh Corman for mine

162
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,380
and we know just government curried some
of this stuff josh is a smart guy just

163
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,420
been around for a while

164
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,490
stringing a dinosaur like I am but he's
been around for a while and

165
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,279
he says that

166
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,980
the auditor is more your adversary

167
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,010
then the attack then the hacker

168
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:09,390
you know I this is true because the
auditors guaranteed to show up in can

169
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,100
disrupt your business if you pass

170
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,410
a failing audit the hacker maybe

171
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:17,820
the

172
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,589
the auditor turns into your biggest
enemy how screwed up is that

173
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:26,390
how much of a problem is that for
everybody easygoing here

174
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:33,390
when we're of fighting the big bad APT
so how many of us

175
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:37,620
Nick we r internet an Irish the
conversation last night a penetration

176
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,460
test anybody pen testing here

177
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:46,150
K so I said this yesterday in an
audience that really didn't receive it

178
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,540
well

179
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,310
apparently there's a lot of interest us
was in the audience I should have asked

180
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,880
first but penetration testing today

181
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,680
largely has turned into an absolute
freakin farce somebody runs and Nessus

182
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:01,730
cannon says hey i contested you that's
not a pen test

183
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:05,960
as an eight-year-old right

184
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,750
I was working with the guy I find a mine
who runs a at

185
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,160
a proper red team company

186
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,540
a company that does penetration testing
the way they describe it is a gal here

187
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,100
during gauge meant and we're good work
including a social

188
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,630
component to a human component to it and
he says

189
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,880
this I ask IDIS manager basically said

190
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,040
you know what the CEO on his staffer at
a bounce

191
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,550
sec'y it's a fishing us engage museum
but there are about to always fall for

192
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:39,500
it are you kidding me

193
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,140
don't have to look over there we know
that's bad

194
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:48,190
that kinda bugs me right these are
staged a tax stuff we prepare for if you

195
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:48,840
watch these

196
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,040
you know a government exercise when I
get a bunch of really smart people

197
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,810
into a room in a locked them in their
Nisei okay tomorrow

198
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:00,430
if we wake up and the phone great is
down what would you all do

199
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,320
and they come up with these awesome wild
ideas about hiding in the big red button

200
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,690
to turn off the internet blah blah blah

201
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,990
you know how much all that is bull crap
you know how much any of that

202
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:13,600
they don't know any of that actually
works because they're in a room playing

203
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,140
with paper

204
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,900
right this is where a lot of us are
today

205
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:22,110
because we fear the hackers over to give
notice

206
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,590
who why

207
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,870
and if you bought more blinking boxes
and

208
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:33,080
solutions and other stuff will you be
any more prepared than you are right now

209
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:37,550
these are all synthetic risk you guys
agree with me on this

210
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:41,410
right synthetic risks are worthless
that's like said it's like preparing

211
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,990
yourself for something that may or may
not happen

212
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,930
I in a controlled environment

213
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:52,230
like WWE now not know w/e fans around

214
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:58,420
saw funny if you know wrestling not that
interesting so let me ask you %uh give

215
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,339
you a what-if

216
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:05,899
we've got these low quality attackers
right they basically

217
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:09,430
somebody i cant download a script
planted a website

218
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:13,050
click Go and de dos a site

219
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:18,490
who or you can download like sequel map
in Florida website galaxy called a

220
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,880
critical data connections England agency
wants action

221
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,100
not hacking not in any plan I'm familiar
with

222
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,399
right these are low quality attackers
exist everywhere the easy to thwart

223
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,529
you put up one roadblock in the give up
in a good move on to something else

224
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:32,449
that's easier

225
00:13:32,449 --> 00:13:36,550
they have no determination that you get
the high quality attackers what we've

226
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,529
been talking about the security industry
for last twenty years a high-quality

227
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:40,260
attackers

228
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:44,070
what's the one sensory uses

229
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:49,320
now not that

230
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,260
it determined attacker will always what
when they're always succeed

231
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,900
this is true I know trust me it's true

232
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,180
determined to tackle always sexy right
so

233
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:05,070
we look at high quality high-impact low
probability attacks

234
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:10,230
issues that we don't easily have because
a high probability

235
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:14,140
high impact stuff shows up

236
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:19,650
on all the vendor material it shows up
in all the ABT defender v2.0 pro

237
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,020
kinda stuff but that would get a laugh

238
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,750
right but the stuff that we

239
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,800
that makes the world go boom and creates
a really nasty

240
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,930
issue for us that is it very likely
that's what we need to be worried about

241
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:40,650
because we can practice against that
because security might fail in fact

242
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:45,490
screw that security will fail at some
point and it's probably fail you just

243
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:49,420
haven't noticed yet which is even worse

244
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,770
so anybody seen Fight Club here every
fight club fans

245
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:56,220
the point a fight club is it did not
know to hit somebody they don't fall

246
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,450
down and cry right

247
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:01,420
it's not game's not over after the first
patch which brings us back to this whole

248
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,680
notion of resilience

249
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,770
people process technology everything at
some point will fail

250
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:11,180
trip over fall on its face the problem
is in the making

251
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,820
croat to the issue is key get the hell
back up and continue

252
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,410
beat upbeat away reich any continue to
fight

253
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,510
because everything at some point fails

254
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:28,250
alt resilient clouds Amazon fail super
super security companies are

255
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:34,180
hold the world secrets are safe ale
everybody fails

256
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,790
right every remembered show house doctor
house what is everybody do

257
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,640
and fail you forgot to fail

258
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:46,100
so it's really really easy with all
those policies procedures the training

259
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,160
we've all gone through the talks we sat
through

260
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,910
and the blinky lights we have in the
millions of dollars in investments that

261
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,360
we play it's really easy to feel safe it
really is

262
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,310
the problem is it's easier to feel
complacent so a lot of a

263
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:02,350
organizations feel very very complacent
that's a problem for me

264
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,800
so if you're not tested

265
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,420
I definitely think you're unprepared
it's right on I ask yourself so what

266
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,740
I've got there's four steps to making
this world a better

267
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:18,209
I think validation is absolutely
required in this case

268
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:23,600
right enough validate things like your
defenses you to validate your response

269
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,420
so it's not just that you need to make
sure that

270
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:33,020
that IPS actually is in block mode or
that your firewall

271
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:36,680
actually is in line with the network

272
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:42,680
you laugh but it's happened but you need
to validate what happens when things go

273
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,500
sideways

274
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,770
in a bad way on a Friday night when
everybody's hammered

275
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:52,390
then what he also need to validate your
technology has lot of us have

276
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:56,300
lots and lots and lots of things in our
wiring closets in our server rooms

277
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,420
that's all security technology that
really isn't doing us any good except

278
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,380
it's causing us

279
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:06,540
more heartache because more dashboards
the stare at so I'm telling you right

280
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,020
now that it's your job to go be attacked

281
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,260
so this is a good thing and

282
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,780
it's a it's a good thing to be attacked
minus all the cool restrictions

283
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,920
don't pen test me between the hours I
love spry day 7 p.m. term

284
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,079
Sunday morning you know I 8 a.m.

285
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,990
on these three IP addresses but hold on
not yet we're not ready yet

286
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:34,650
that's crap here's a target go after it
don't want to hear how you did until

287
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:39,710
you're done doing it and

288
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,640
right about this time usually people
stare at me like I just fall off the

289
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,030
planet

290
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:46,930
I got some really weird looks from some
lawn for some people yesterday

291
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:50,830
because nobody believe me

292
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:55,380
cell I i'm there's a bit of good but a
caution that needs to be used here

293
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,990
because random destruction of corporate
property results in something called the

294
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,060
resume generating a van

295
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:05,200
now the roads will be out of a job so

296
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,350
at the great teams if you have never
done a red team exercise we've never

297
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,430
hired a red team

298
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:14,080
any work in corporate IT not this is
something you start thinking about very

299
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,360
seriously whether it's

300
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,600
something you plan for or something you
literally go on do like

301
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,970
tomorrow in some school for fashion so I

302
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,920
it's really goal rather go home right
and testing as it is right now unless

303
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,360
you have a really well

304
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,550
armature pen testing company you're
working with it's probably

305
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:34,570
very little value for what you're paying
for unfortunately

306
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,650
should probably getting a rebranded you
know

307
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,770
scan report where somebody's you know

308
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:44,080
got the shell on your box yea

309
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,370
there's any is there any meaning to that
is there any context to that who knows

310
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,820
but they've got michelle you've been
exploited you're vulnerable girl pageant

311
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,800
life will go on

312
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,950
crap all self any reason we what about
Bob

313
00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:00,660
pop culture references baby steps bob
that's right

314
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,170
elmer if not seen the movie go see its
freaking hysterical

315
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:08,110
Bill Murray plays a great neurotic
psycho whatever the hell years he's

316
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:12,310
chemically being cookie but bob bob
basically

317
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:16,370
by psychiatrists talk to take baby steps
that so how we gonna get from where we

318
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,500
are here to where we are

319
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,520
to a company is more resilient an
organization is more resilient

320
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,650
now more secure not gonna catch me
saying more secure cuz didn't

321
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:27,740
the only thing I ask you something are
more secure the next question is and

322
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,230
what

323
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,730
what is more secure

324
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:35,400
right I if you're more resilient I can
actually quantify that

325
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,200
resilient is quantifiable how long can
you you taking punches

326
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,830
and get back get back up so validation
in this case is a journey

327
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:48,480
and listen this is how we're gonna do it
the

328
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,560
we got a couple steps here to avoid
being a deer in headlights a deer

329
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,890
go clipart we're gonna

330
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:58,970
get you guys through this initial
analysis paralysis could you ever worked

331
00:19:58,970 --> 00:19:59,890
for a large company

332
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,140
I have and you get stuck in analysis
paralysis that when you have meetings

333
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,680
about meetings about meetings but would
invite to the meeting with the meeting

334
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,520
and buy time to get around actually
doing something it's three years next

335
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,040
and

336
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:16,370
you got no value on it so here is the
plan in four quick steps

337
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:19,380
44 quick and easy steps as a major got
you here

338
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,490
and at some point you'll notice that

339
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,680
I think I'm there's a little
unconventional is in here hopeful

340
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:30,380
YouTube pick up on it so step one is an
assessment

341
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,450
your absolutely have to do an assessment

342
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,830
I assess it everywhere all the time the

343
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,840
first step to doing a good assessment of
you figure out where you are

344
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,830
in order to know where you wanna go you
gotta know where you're starting

345
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:45,850
right at La to those you are here maps

346
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:49,750
are important you know I'm map no idea
im maps are

347
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,490
are so important for us they don't just
tell us where we want to go let us where

348
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:56,059
we are now so we can get there

349
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:58,830
I that's a value having a good mapping
product not Apple

350
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:03,720
and it's really really really important
to make sure we get there right see like

351
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,659
sickness a subliminal

352
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:10,809
so what are your defenses

353
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:14,639
how much of your defensive posture do
you know

354
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:18,779
right now like what is it if you had to
see if somebody by St right now by said

355
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:19,659
everybody take a

356
00:21:19,659 --> 00:21:22,950
piece a paper out from underneath your
chair take the pan African researchers

357
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:23,429
released

358
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:26,660
this paper depend on the searchers out
that there is

359
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,630
a write down all the defense you have
right now how do you guys feel

360
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,030
comfortable that you do that

361
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:36,500
you be able to do that yes not
recovering

362
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:41,720
I there's a lot of stuff you do
defensively has lotta stuff that you do

363
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:47,490
unconventionally defensively yet to come
see a doc next but what are your defense

364
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,040
is here

365
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,240
what is a defense that you're looking
for right what is it today what do you

366
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,099
think it is today

367
00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:59,549
because you don't know yet this is what
you think how prepared do you feel how

368
00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:00,239
prepared

369
00:22:00,239 --> 00:22:03,999
are you you know how is there a red team
is there is a i

370
00:22:03,999 --> 00:22:08,169
redbook incident response manual other
procedures for

371
00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:12,889
when X happens do why at the get back
about 10 years in my career

372
00:22:12,889 --> 00:22:16,629
we had a fantastic incident response
process

373
00:22:16,629 --> 00:22:20,259
step 1: up any incident response process

374
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:24,659
after this after this transformation
went through log on to the a

375
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:28,349
there's a website there was two factor
authentication SSL

376
00:22:28,349 --> 00:22:32,119
mutually of beautiful thing right login

377
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:35,289
described the incident were
automatically route to take it to the

378
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:37,320
appropriate people page the right folks

379
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:42,089
restart reboot a large terminate process
is all automatically

380
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:49,089
and then sequel slammer head so step one
in the process login that await the

381
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:54,140
cracked the network's down

382
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:54,650
now what

383
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:59,679
or 10 a standing-room going I in Reno we
should do now

384
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,410
because nobody ever thought to say

385
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:09,130
hey what if this doesn't work we've
never been put in that scenario before

386
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,200
you know what we found out their crap
doesn't work

387
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,260
in the heat of battle that is not a good
time to figure out your stuff's not

388
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:17,740
working

389
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,820
I promise I give you 50

390
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,850
got fire truck that shows up outside
your house

391
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:27,740
finds out that their pump doesn't work
as your house is burning down

392
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,420
not good

393
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:34,550
a pretty sure you're not gonna be very
happy so there's another question it's

394
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:37,760
important to ask is it's not just what
tackle what could break

395
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,390
what breaks so there's brittle systems
and everybody's organization right so

396
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,240
there's two things that were curious
about here

397
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,360
defenses which is the hackable part

398
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,220
and then brittleness you've you've all
got these things in your organization

399
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,670
that started out as somebody's pet
project East

400
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:58,230
strong a couple a service together
borrowed some licenses borrowed

401
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:02,670
some licenses installed some software it
was just gonna be a prototype will do

402
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,820
security on it later if it works

403
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,030
lo and behold it works and now its
production you're not allowed to touch

404
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,400
it

405
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,800
right and if you sneeze anywhere near a
dull thing comes crashing down you're

406
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,310
fired

407
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:18,500
it's called brittle system everybody has
them that's for all the ugly words are

408
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,580
most of our company's

409
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:23,670
and then the major question is how bad
can it be

410
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,850
I so these are things we need to start
thinking how bad is it gonna be

411
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:30,390
what artifacts in the past you had you
actually have a pen test report that

412
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,350
somebody's done for you

413
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:36,360
that tells you you're out you know we're
pretty vulnerable you have 710 test

414
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,100
reports on the course in seven quarters
at all look the same

415
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,480
because all they do is print out the law
same thing over and over cuz im

416
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,190
fix a damn thing

417
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,760
any empirical evidence at this point

418
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,039
at the assessment phase will do what
word on assessing

419
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:57,460
right the basically the you are here or
you think you are here

420
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,560
that we get to the planning stage let's
figure out what we're gonna do next

421
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,280
how we gonna plan for this alright so
here's what in scope

422
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,440
if we're talking about planning a red
team exercise

423
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,110
your vendors your partners and yourself
pretty much

424
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:15,040
everything I have news for you if
somebody's going to come attack you and

425
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,220
I mean seriously attack you come at you

426
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:22,730
they're not gonna come knocking on the
front have your website they gonna go

427
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,100
hit

428
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,300
your kid on Facebook infect the laptop
that your kid browses

429
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,390
Facebook on or plays World of Warcraft
on

430
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:36,280
that you bring to the office every day
that's the easiest

431
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,580
that's the path of least resistance
that's the easiest way in So You

432
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,200
absolutely come in SCO

433
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,490
your neighbors becoming skilled the
Trojan your neighbors

434
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:47,980
because you go over there and use their
wifi all the time watch when I football

435
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,980
right when you go over BAM you're
infected you bring it back to the office

436
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:55,520
wallach your hacked bad

437
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,750
elements don't discriminate here there
is no rules of engagement for evil

438
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,860
it's all out right there's no rules

439
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:07,250
the good guys much like me if anybody's
got a military background you know

440
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:10,610
there's plenty rules of engagement right
pretty much can't fire on somebody must

441
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,970
have got to bulletin you already

442
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:15,760
unfortunately

443
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,490
they don't care they don't follow the
same rules so bad guys do not follow our

444
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:21,180
rules

445
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:26,270
and the fact that pen test teams do just
proves that little value that most

446
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,780
fantastic sir sizes provide

447
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:32,620
cell this tends to be very overwhelming
and it's a little bit scary to think I'm

448
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,150
just gonna go

449
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:38,639
randomly put a bazooka to my corporate
IT and see what happens

450
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:43,460
so strategizing tense that needs to
happen in little et/pt pieces much like

451
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,009
bob we'd take baby steps

452
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:49,130
and so we're gonna start with some small
parts

453
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:51,870
right this is kinda we're gonna take
many red team stuff

454
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:55,779
we're gonna start of we're gonna start
of

455
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:59,260
with many manager exercises small
incursions wanna make

456
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,840
that little ap that we don't think is
connected to anything that probably

457
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,029
nobody would notice

458
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:07,590
if it was down that'll be the first
thing I will tell their

459
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:11,010
red team organization bring back the
database for the

460
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:14,010
SA password or own that box induced

461
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:18,809
shut it down for if you can they well
but just know that that's gonna happen

462
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:22,700
start with something small and
insignificant as you don't wanna resume

463
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,000
generating about our promise

464
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,020
some something small and stand-alone
emphasis on stand-alone

465
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,440
how do you guys feel confident

466
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,310
at this is on confident that you know
the interconnectedness

467
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,470
evolve your applications in your data
centers

468
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:45,260
because you probably have this after
looks like a touch is nothing else but

469
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:49,320
if you really dig into a teacher's
databases like the ERP system because he

470
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:49,810
had some

471
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:53,140
left over capacity on that box and you
wanna buy extra license or whatever

472
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:53,480
right

473
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,890
be very very careful working in the
bigger units means that we need to start

474
00:27:58,890 --> 00:27:59,800
thinking about

475
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,990
now what's right working your way up to
the start with something small small

476
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:08,150
autonomous unit work your way up if you
work in a large conglomerate where you

477
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:09,740
work in a large organization

478
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:12,680
you probably have a business unit that
has some business units have some

479
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,650
business units have

480
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:18,230
we can keep going for a while probably
in severe cases even if your gonna small

481
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,060
company Starwood

482
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:22,470
at the very lowest google.com nanometer
at application-level

483
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:26,610
work up to department level eventually
work up the corporate level right the

484
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,000
entire business unit that

485
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,740
and eventually like in poker we go all
in at

486
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:38,750
what we'll figure out how to how we get
there as we've progressed to the rest is

487
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,190
this

488
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:44,700
but everything is in scope whatever it
takes this is the wite whatever it takes

489
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,880
execute that hack execute at
infiltration

490
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,130
this is just like real attackers do but

491
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:55,790
one small minor detail here

492
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:59,010
and the question is who do you tell that
you're going to be doing this

493
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:03,140
you don't tell your IT security team I
think that we agree on because you don't

494
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:03,740
want them for

495
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:10,740
prepared right so could you tell anyone

496
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,540
anybody

497
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:16,030
chief legal counsel

498
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:19,830
somebody sea level one or two people sea
level right senior legal counsel chief

499
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:22,799
risk officer maybe your CEO if you don't
have any those two

500
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:27,200
free so you gotta chief legal counsel
somewhere or lead attorney or something

501
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,760
it's good to be realistic because
somebody has to tell

502
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,510
but you what else few people as possible
rikers the pool what's the point every

503
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:35,890
knows

504
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:39,850
gonna happen but remember always cover
your app's

505
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:44,890
always trusted leadership is a good spot
for this

506
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:48,340
it going off in telling people about it
is a good idea

507
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:52,240
for you I tell somebody you trust a
trust issue

508
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,020
to do this and execute properly without
causing a calamity

509
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:59,980
and if you do they'll have your back
rights of a story on this

510
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,360
action lights camera ready the ninjas
and

511
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:10,020
start the validation so let's do this in
phases how to read teams operate rekon

512
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:15,520
understand your target acquire your
target figure out what the important

513
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,080
thing is that you're gonna go after

514
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,200
pics targets that are high value lower
risk

515
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,039
you don't want to be able to BC

516
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:28,369
right and be a fan have the a John
Cleese and that Monty Python gang

517
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:32,549
every see how not to be seen on and now
for something completely different you

518
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:35,470
don't wanna be behind the one bush in
the open field they know where you are

519
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:42,470
right if you not familiar with its funny
go look it up infiltration

520
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:47,059
find a way in not a matter of it's not
if that's how

521
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:51,340
right infiltrate getting their staff
which a beachhead find a base of

522
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,159
operations

523
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,590
this is scary because as you look
through your organization

524
00:30:56,590 --> 00:31:00,239
sometimes you'll realize that there are
dr. bases operations for people that

525
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:01,889
don't work for you inside your
organization

526
00:31:01,889 --> 00:31:05,899
either their legitimate like maybe
consultants or something

527
00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:09,009
semi legit a bit like consultants or
something or

528
00:31:09,009 --> 00:31:14,370
completely legitimate like consultants
are bad guys or something

529
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:18,830
it happens the next day we do after you
get a good beach head right

530
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:24,770
you got another not good base of
operations is you do more recog you do

531
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:27,430
more looking around maybe you find a
better target

532
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:33,870
reevaluate at Target day you had

533
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:36,790
and see if it's still the target you
want to go after

534
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:40,410
the sometimes quite frankly we find that

535
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:44,460
hey you know what my target is gonna be
this one database over here but you get

536
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,640
any look around you go

537
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:50,660
elective is nice but man that payroll
over there looks a lot better

538
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:54,280
right what's better to get remember

539
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:59,470
high-value low-risk targets exultation

540
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:02,780
is another key at work with I I got a
fun story

541
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:06,000
about from a call you mine

542
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,820
the infiltration part was simple right
the company was so bad at security

543
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:15,260
inbound that they had a beach
establishing like a day

544
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:20,620
it looked around but some cool stuff you
want their own attack

545
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:25,710
attacked it copy of an entire database
would take it back with that problem is

546
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:30,680
they couldn't get it out of the company
like X till part was hard

547
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,400
did manage a lockdown really well
actually

548
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,970
the outbound part about traffic

549
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:42,419
so much like any reading the improvised

550
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:47,440
the took it basically compressed all
that put it on the

551
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,549
receptionists machine in the front at
the office because that wasn't behind

552
00:32:51,549 --> 00:32:52,549
the locked door

553
00:32:52,549 --> 00:32:56,549
waited till after-hours came in with the
cleaning crew

554
00:32:56,549 --> 00:33:02,850
for USB stick into it copied it off
walked out easy sex filtration history

555
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:03,720
mankind right

556
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,659
log copy who walkout BRT had the
credentials

557
00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:13,159
while you never she wasn't rocket
science the idea

558
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:17,350
take everything is pretty important
right take find what you want to just

559
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,039
take all that

560
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:23,460
and obviously Leave No Trace don't get
caught acts

561
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,049
good bread team especially if you doing
physical RED team

562
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:30,450
don't get shot at where if you do

563
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:36,399
run faster the divalent here's the one
unconventional part that I'll tell you

564
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:37,360
that probably

565
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,619
you know this may be the first time you
hear something like this and make an ish

566
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:45,470
maybe even Shockey a little bit the back
I think personal opinion the bass red

567
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,289
team folks

568
00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:50,539
are not just the most technically
skilled was the smartest necessarily but

569
00:33:50,539 --> 00:33:54,750
they're the ones that keep the best
notes

570
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,360
from a value to me

571
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,890
the company that's ordering this red
team exercise perspective

572
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:03,450
I want somebody is gonna keep rediculous
the good notes

573
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:08,280
like OCD ridiculously good notes here's
the other party this

574
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,370
before getting the last phase which is

575
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:15,129
analysis I will see how

576
00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:18,889
who hears brainer so what do you guys
think is the one

577
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:21,980
super super super key one thing

578
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:25,210
the one thing that you absolutely have
to do

579
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:31,220
and if you do it incident response
becomes much easier

580
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:38,220
anyone gas was at

581
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:45,410
time synchronization

582
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:48,610
being able to synchronize all your
systems on one clock

583
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:54,530
one one basic lock right if you've ever
done incident response

584
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:57,750
or tried to figure out how somebody got
in

585
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:04,750
and you've got thirty seven servers all
off by about a second

586
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,780
at the rate packets travel

587
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:11,940
good luck because you'll be sifting
through gigs and gigs and gigs of tax

588
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,680
logs

589
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,040
or maybe even on a pretty shiny screen

590
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,250
but you'll be looking at things

591
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,800
in different time slices you have to be
on the same time scale that's the one

592
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,500
thing out I

593
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:27,680
from our from our defensive perspective
it's a response perspective

594
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,500
synchronize your devices have a good
time sync

595
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:35,710
so the prediction at the end of a red
team exercises stuff broke

596
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:40,480
not stuff got hacked stuff program does
panel systems we talked about beginning

597
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,690
now that stuff that jestes around
because it'll come crashing down and

598
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:47,150
some have to get fired

599
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:50,770
something during red team exercise
generally breaks

600
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:53,790
this is different than pen testing
because we try to avoid breaking

601
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,060
anything at all costs

602
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,920
this where we diverge its okay to break
stuff

603
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,860
why because during a real attack things
will break

604
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:07,270
you know how we find out what's the most
brutal and what to fix first

605
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:10,860
after its been broken not because Reese

606
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:15,990
that my room and thought about it a lot
so the questions you wanna start asking

607
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:19,500
yourself what broken wire at getting
that hacking he said this yet

608
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:25,190
what broke NY white did that server over
their fall over

609
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:28,320
when they scan this IP address I Y

610
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,360
literally I worked on analysis once
while back where

611
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:36,930
we had a server that was in entirely
different data center a database adjust

612
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:42,250
fell over for no apparent reason during
roughly the same

613
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:46,860
time frame as a infiltration exercise

614
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:51,930
way way on the other side of the earth
in a different complete different time

615
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:52,340
zone

616
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:56,040
different data center different
everything

617
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:00,390
the only common denominator between

618
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:04,760
the attack and I'll thing that fell over
was there was a database involving eat

619
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,030
like okay so your company

620
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:11,140
be IT people are these relate they're
not

621
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:17,160
what's not coincidence I could very much
assure you that now must be coincidence

622
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:17,610
now I'll

623
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:22,670
how are they were you're not serious it
have to be related somehow

624
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:26,489
dug into a turns out there's a little
database expert to happens over your

625
00:37:26,489 --> 00:37:28,739
gets FTP Dover your load over here

626
00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:33,529
this little bit a time shift rikers
packets have to travel get zipped

627
00:37:33,529 --> 00:37:37,519
so compressed dropped on FTP

628
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:42,049
internally transferred uncompressed
loaded to a database

629
00:37:42,049 --> 00:37:45,680
and will be corrupted stuck over here
this state this database could handle

630
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,289
corruption

631
00:37:46,289 --> 00:37:49,349
reasonably well I could do a retraction
stuff

632
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:52,979
this one over here was the brown one
nobody sees

633
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:58,150
and it is like proof magically die but
they were connected

634
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:01,769
they discovered entirely new link that I
T never really realized

635
00:38:01,769 --> 00:38:07,519
between a much different systems so

636
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:11,719
system resiliency failures happen pretty
often during the subs exercises

637
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:15,900
because we do Dr drills right but Howard
disaster recovery drills

638
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:21,069
always conducted organic gracefully shut
down these machines over here

639
00:38:21,069 --> 00:38:24,959
and then when a watches these over here
come up by themselves

640
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:30,109
is how realistic is that Hurricane
Katrina hits

641
00:38:30,109 --> 00:38:35,130
its gonna wait for you to power down
your system's no

642
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:39,549
its gonna just how you to do Dr is you
to walk over to go

643
00:38:39,549 --> 00:38:46,049
yank powers out now what oftentimes what
we find is all these really cool

644
00:38:46,049 --> 00:38:49,289
synchronization things that we've got
going on all these great fail overs

645
00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:54,319
Amazon all this great stuff hinges on
one piece that doesn't work if it's not

646
00:38:54,319 --> 00:38:54,979
done

647
00:38:54,979 --> 00:38:59,259
properly right if two databases come
back up

648
00:38:59,259 --> 00:39:03,670
dirty what happens what and state do you
end up in

649
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:08,160
how far back do you roll back

650
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,640
and he could be

651
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:16,369
15 seconds it could be however much
battery was in that cash before

652
00:39:16,369 --> 00:39:21,990
finish writing at the desk or could be I
don't know the databases that

653
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:24,550
all those are possible you know how you
gonna now

654
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:29,590
yank

655
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:35,750
Rob mock-ups E

656
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:38,960
so root cause analysis can be done this
before because now sees

657
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,829
if you have it's probably your least
favorite thing in the world

658
00:39:42,829 --> 00:39:45,980
because it takes up a ton a white board
space

659
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:49,460
it takes up a ton a brain power you
happy you can't do it by yourself

660
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:54,950
yet to go talk to a ton of people right
you have to understand how things are

661
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:58,790
connected this is well beyond the scope
of most IT security things

662
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:05,290
so how about this is moved to the attack
to detect succeed

663
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:08,740
I forget that yes it did that's the
wrong question

664
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:12,500
100.1 percent of attack sexy

665
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,000
just getting now

666
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,420
the question you want to ask ourselves
how successful was it right it's not

667
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,600
that they succeed or not

668
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,930
they most likely got it the most likely
got a bunch a good stuff and you

669
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:28,260
probably didn't notice

670
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,790
or if you did it was entirely too late
you could do nothing about it ago all

671
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:32,510
that sucks

672
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:35,630
as your security guard

673
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:39,369
was nice and helpful in that help in
that nice young lady cure that server

674
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:39,970
out the door

675
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:43,890
it's only funny cause it's true

676
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:47,010
so attacks rarely fail

677
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:50,360
there's three key measures here

678
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,630
caters three things that tell you how
successful attack was

679
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:56,680
and how good your security actually is

680
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:01,650
so who here has a a safe in their homes
K

681
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:04,710
so they're probably all fireproof at
some

682
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:10,390
fire resistant yes now the infinitely
fireproof

683
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:13,520
right so pay attention cell

684
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,560
there's three key measures one time

685
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:21,670
yes you need to know how long connecting
stand

686
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:25,300
in that burn before it turns into a pile
love

687
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:28,420
iron or whatever it is that saves turn
into

688
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,900
liquid metal do with all your

689
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:36,850
belongings in critical stuff inside
somewhere inseparable from what used to

690
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:37,660
be your safe

691
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:42,750
what's really funny is safe Center
battery-powered in the first thing that

692
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:48,130
fries is the external panel sure to say
still works

693
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:51,770
well the states till they weren't
supposed to be checking back into

694
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:52,280
anymore

695
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,200
so it's a matter how much time

696
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,210
how long did the attack take how long
did it take them to get in

697
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:04,200
how difficult was it for them right how
much time did you get

698
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,869
so you've got all the security
investment how much time did that by you

699
00:42:08,869 --> 00:42:12,020
you bought a safer you paid twenty grand
for it

700
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:16,630
how much time does that by you in a
burning building twenty grand probably a

701
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:17,080
lot

702
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,890
make sense

703
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:25,630
so this is kinda like that underwriters
as fireproof rating its

704
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:30,310
we don't think about security this way
for some reason it's baffling

705
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:34,780
it's like these fireproof ratings how
much damn how long can that's

706
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:39,210
fire burnin at what temperature so
what's the level up the attacker you

707
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:41,780
want to defend against high quality
versus low quality

708
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:46,340
and how much time did you by yourself
with your investment what's really sad

709
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:46,960
is

710
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,010
there doesn't seem to be a great
correlation between

711
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:53,040
how much money is spent and how much
time you bought yourself

712
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,660
SAV watch people with minimal investment
have fantastic

713
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:00,310
burn rates spurred tights right meaning
they could build that that attack took

714
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:01,880
forever to finally get through

715
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,050
like they tried X and Y and Z in

716
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:08,860
doubles Ian and they kept going till he
finally found a weakness

717
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:13,230
they finally found something say well
David attacks it have

718
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:17,380
completely gone down the it. spectrum in
it eventually had to resort to

719
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:22,200
hired basically infiltrating US it with
a person

720
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,170
like pointing in a janitor for example

721
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:28,500
or whatever dumpster diving kinda stuff
is your IT is that good

722
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:35,500
so minimal va I'm on investment
sometimes get to the hype long burn rate

723
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:38,980
but it doesn't correlate that a huge
amount of investment gets that

724
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:42,860
that much longer which is the scary part
for a lot of us kisses a plenty of

725
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:46,810
caesar's out there who have no problem
buying buying buying buying buying

726
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:51,410
and not increasing their burn time the
resiliency

727
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:56,020
so the next measure your next key
measures damage how much damage was done

728
00:43:56,020 --> 00:44:00,850
during this attack right how extensive
was it and basically the answer to

729
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:03,499
question how bad was it

730
00:44:03,499 --> 00:44:07,489
now damages two components it is both

731
00:44:07,489 --> 00:44:10,819
what broke and what got hacked

732
00:44:10,819 --> 00:44:17,309
make sense I how bad was a damaged along
that attack path the last one

733
00:44:17,309 --> 00:44:21,849
Lasky measures criticality how important
to you was the stuff that got

734
00:44:21,849 --> 00:44:27,819
that was got basically how critical was
the asset what did they get

735
00:44:27,819 --> 00:44:31,269
I they make off with

736
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:36,709
you're safe but they make off with your
external partner database or something

737
00:44:36,709 --> 00:44:37,549
less important

738
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:40,989
I we have a level of criticality
everything

739
00:44:40,989 --> 00:44:44,660
in your organization DeKalb e-class
classify on a scale

740
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:48,950
there are things that are absolutely
super important that can never get out

741
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:53,499
and there are things that if they got
out yes they be embarrassing yes they

742
00:44:53,499 --> 00:44:53,769
would

743
00:44:53,769 --> 00:44:58,459
hurt the company you know publicly yes
somebody might even get fired your stock

744
00:44:58,459 --> 00:45:00,209
price might go down for a while

745
00:45:00,209 --> 00:45:03,729
but in the end you'll recover

746
00:45:03,729 --> 00:45:08,079
there's a scale and now comes the hard
part this is why we keep

747
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,459
really really really really OCD good
notes

748
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:14,529
the fall root cause analysis

749
00:45:14,529 --> 00:45:18,170
but broke what got hacked how did it all
happen

750
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:22,699
why did it all go down and how do we
prevent it in the future that's the fun

751
00:45:22,699 --> 00:45:23,029
part

752
00:45:23,029 --> 00:45:26,400
so you follow this attack path

753
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:32,949
time-stamped at this time we attacked
this system using this exploit

754
00:45:32,949 --> 00:45:38,019
with the following result observed line
by line item by item

755
00:45:38,019 --> 00:45:42,239
where did your security fail which was
it at the texan

756
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:46,759
we just not able to detect the issue we
just not able to do provide proper

757
00:45:46,759 --> 00:45:48,699
analysis some things that were going on

758
00:45:48,699 --> 00:45:52,670
a lot of us see security events from
security

759
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:56,289
things that have no business context to
that

760
00:45:56,289 --> 00:46:03,089
this is a bad thing because an attack is
not in it is not an attack is not an

761
00:46:03,089 --> 00:46:03,650
attack

762
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:08,170
right it this is why context-aware

763
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:12,420
systems became so important I five six
seven eight years ago

764
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:16,939
when there's a sequel injection attack
being levied against no sequel database

765
00:46:16,939 --> 00:46:19,589
you probably don't care

766
00:46:19,589 --> 00:46:23,600
when people are lobbying you know I S
attacks

767
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:27,960
a Java web servers and who cares

768
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:33,390
right context awareness analysis what
about protection if you spent way too

769
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,410
much money to protect the wrong things

770
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:41,080
or did it even work was that people
failure people always fail but how much

771
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:41,980
do they fail

772
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:45,950
who failed in your organization

773
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:50,080
more often than not it's your security
folks here tired they're overworked it

774
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:53,970
got too many dashboards the stare at and
if it's not staring them in the face

775
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:58,840
there probably won't notice because
they're too busy doing security

776
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:03,630
was it a process failure I like in my
case that I run into step 1:

777
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:07,980
not available crap now what

778
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:12,020
the budget will stand around going out
well

779
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:15,720
step want to bring in that server backup
is go to this directory doesn't exist I

780
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:18,809
don't know what to do now

781
00:47:18,809 --> 00:47:20,859
there's a lot of Technology failures out
there

782
00:47:20,859 --> 00:47:25,190
we trust devices we should we leave
technology by something we put it in

783
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:25,869
line

784
00:47:25,869 --> 00:47:29,599
we assume that it's gonna work for ever
but we forget to care and feeding

785
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:33,160
if they did that with this issue there
would be no animals ago see

786
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:37,759
think about the stuff on your network is
living breathing

787
00:47:37,759 --> 00:47:40,460
things that have to be cared for they
have to be fed they have to be

788
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,130
maintained

789
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:44,170
an SMS to be rebooted all the time

790
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:47,229
but they have to be maintained

791
00:47:47,229 --> 00:47:50,989
and if you've got more things to
maintain then you have people you have a

792
00:47:50,989 --> 00:47:51,539
problem

793
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:56,749
you have an unsustainable position at
that point are talking about diana

794
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:57,640
blockbuster

795
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:01,430
if the ratio of dashboards to humans is
greater than two to one you've got a

796
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:05,020
very serious issue

797
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:06,930
is an enterprise intelligence failure

798
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:11,260
did you see a bunch of suspicious events
on a security dashboard because yours

799
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:14,180
but because your security doesn't talk
to database team

800
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:17,690
they never found out that the number I
have our records

801
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:22,370
return per query went up by it 10,000
per cent

802
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:25,230
in the database world it's like gee
that's interesting realization in the

803
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:29,150
security roles like gee that's the one
section

804
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:32,990
we think about it differently we don't
see it the same way lot of us are unable

805
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:36,100
to connect the dots in this because we
don't have the full context does not

806
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:40,130
the knowledge of what's going on around
and the difficult question what's the

807
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:41,980
remedy how do we fix this problem

808
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:46,190
yeah we got hacked we got hacked bad
crap broke

809
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:48,250
all over the place

810
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:52,059
business ground to a halt for a few
hours now what how do we fix this

811
00:48:52,059 --> 00:48:55,780
and unfortunately lot is goes back to
defense wanna want the tech to turn

812
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:57,579
respond findings get rid of them

813
00:48:57,579 --> 00:49:03,089
countermeasures fortifying our defenses
and being able to impact

814
00:49:03,089 --> 00:49:06,740
things with a minimal amount of change
in a maximum on a van packed

815
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:10,050
and we've been saying this for years
businesspeople telesis

816
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:14,260
make as little impact as you can on me
on my developers on my operations staff

817
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:17,559
my call centers on my budget but make
the biggest

818
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:20,750
amount have positive impact right Minaj

819
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:25,569
minimum change maximum impact you're not
gonna walk into a buncha developers

820
00:49:25,569 --> 00:49:28,859
who don't do good saw for security
practice

821
00:49:28,859 --> 00:49:32,630
and all sudden go by the way tomorrow
since you guys suck its offer secure its

822
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:33,670
secure code development

823
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:36,710
tomorrow on good implements a new steps
for you you know what's going to happen

824
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:41,900
guthrie out at second story window

825
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:45,609
so remember what your goals are you
trying to deter a casual attacker

826
00:49:45,609 --> 00:49:48,720
a trying to slow that down long enough
right

827
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:53,380
schools slow the burn rate give yourself
more time so that you have that

828
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:54,840
opportunity to figure it out

829
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:58,320
respond you want to be able to detect
and react

830
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:02,040
absolutely quickly and fortify were you
deficiencies are

831
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:06,530
work from a purse people process and
technology perspective an optimized

832
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:07,700
offenses that you have

833
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:11,220
you read teams are really never done
which is a great part about Red Team

834
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:14,820
what's your dog they come back in you
work with them to figure out where

835
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:16,940
things can be better fortified better

836
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:21,349
and when they're done they go on trial
again so find more holes

837
00:50:21,349 --> 00:50:25,369
and you come back and use exercises
rinse and repeat until you get to a

838
00:50:25,369 --> 00:50:27,020
point where you fields good enough

839
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:30,119
are you reach that level love I've spent
this much

840
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:33,580
it takes them this long I feel
comfortable with that let's leave it at

841
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:33,920
that

842
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:39,250
because things like business change
priorities change technology changes all

843
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:40,700
the stuff changes all the time

844
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:44,890
in real time right going mobile we're
going to the Clough

845
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:49,800
for bringing our own devices goggles
coming tomorrow if you can adapt with it

846
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,560
because your business is doing
acquisitions today that message urs

847
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,150
tomorrow

848
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:56,780
hiring today laying off tomorrow you
gotta move with the flow

849
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:01,020
attackers always change their
motivations goals

850
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:04,580
their mindsets their ages change right

851
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:07,710
they want different things some one day
they want to take you down

852
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:11,810
the next eight is one embarrass you a
little and your threats will always

853
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:15,330
continue to fall because you have to
have to test your defenses in response

854
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:19,250
using his real life types of attacks
because you don't want to figure out you

855
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:21,200
have major problems during a catastrophe

856
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,640
right so this is liked it Roll the chief
chaos officer as a final thought here

857
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:29,960
it's not something you to find on
monster yet I promise you the next 10

858
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,950
years I'll be some real have this role

859
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:36,310
in most organizations start thinking
about it now it's that person will be

860
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:37,119
tasked with

861
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:40,790
randomly walking around pulling out the
power in the most critical systems in

862
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:41,580
the enterprise

863
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:46,060
at you will be a good thing ask Netflix
how they do it they love it

864
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:50,040
if you wanna definitely fail at your own
hands and not

865
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:54,970
at your enemies have a catastrophe when
you're in charge now in somebody else's

866
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:57,920
and done hopefully on time thanks a lot
guys been cool
