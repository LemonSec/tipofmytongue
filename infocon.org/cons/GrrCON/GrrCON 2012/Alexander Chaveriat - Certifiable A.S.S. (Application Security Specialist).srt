1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,250
Alex I'll be giving a certifiable
application security specialist talk

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,330
are mostly contract a great contrast
being dumb asses and smart asses

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,469
on again my name's Alex I'd sort of gone
by a few names

4
00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:16,910
arm some call me cell side been called a
hacker I've been called a geek

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,570
and before the end the day today at
least

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:24,289
5 you will call me an ass straight to my
face

7
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:29,640
of so help for further ado on again this
is my ass presentation

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,809
feel free to ask all the ask questions
you wants

9
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:36,390
on it's gonna be mostly about security
testing

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,980
more specifically it's gonna be about
assessments and reporter

11
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,120
on assessments make sense it's important

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,450
I feel reporting is more important
assessment is obvious point

13
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:51,590
we it's what they pay for we do testing

14
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:55,530
we get results that's what we're that's
what we do

15
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,879
on reports always feels a little lass

16
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,559
important sometimes but it always take
every hates doing reports it takes up a

17
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:04,869
third of our time

18
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:09,330
however it's more important even than
the testing my opinion be is that

19
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,290
all they that's all they get former to
show for our stuff

20
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,080
if you're the best test in the world
into a crappy report then guess what

21
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,720
they get crappy results

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,869
on begin its gonna zoom in and out

23
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:25,619
my goal is to get you sick as possible
and at the end it will zoom out

24
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,970
in to go to arm naw

25
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,380
I'm just getting it its its needs its
actually it's been on

26
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:37,759
I on application security specialist
people tasked

27
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,530
software for a living there test web
again I'm sure generalizing a lot of

28
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,740
people into this category

29
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,810
a good application security specialist a
good ass a smartass

30
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,409
what would they're great people they're
funny on their

31
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:55,899
hot on like many people out there on
they help you be more secure they find

32
00:01:55,899 --> 00:02:00,549
on may find stuff his privates way then
fine hairs they find bugs they find

33
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:01,430
defects

34
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,649
on them stop you from getting own on

35
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:07,719
they help you fix stuff they give you
ways every meeting though

36
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:11,090
re mediating those issues the Gobi %uh
find

37
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,760
a normal dumb smartass who quote

38
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,090
show you a bog in and show you just how
to fix it there

39
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,760
get down to the root cause their show
your input validation Sox

40
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,670
you should do week training which which
will help stop this

41
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,140
in there make you a better developer
your help you create it now only a

42
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,230
testing plan

43
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,280
but even education plan will you know

44
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,980
this is a training this is a
certification missus of sense of

45
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,560
security

46
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,010
lab you can do which will make you a
better developer or a better tester

47
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:47,519
in their help you understand the data
again getting farther down to the data

48
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,760
incoming inclusions which are just don't
let a single quote go into the field of

49
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,430
dumbasses

50
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,730
are dumb application specialist of they
suck their stupid people because

51
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,640
they they really take advantage every a
flaw

52
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,920
insecurity because they make you think
you're secure when you're not

53
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,300
they make the rest of us look bad
because they overcharge their products

54
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,489
in in the take advantage of a security

55
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:19,040
testing flaw which is we don't know what
we don't know

56
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,200
now that sounds redundant what I mean by
that is on a plumber for instance

57
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,120
if he goes in your house any fixes your
leaky pipe if its leaking well guess

58
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,659
what

59
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:32,769
base socket their job because it's it's
leaking

60
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:35,840
now if we saw kenner job in WI

61
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,819
we don't find stuff we do and
infrastructure scantily nope you're good

62
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:40,440
at

63
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,540
then they might never know that vere
boned if someone gets the application

64
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,959
on it's there it's really that obvious

65
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,970
you can do a sucky test in still
presented a great way

66
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,760
this is a true I as i said reporting is
more important if you can publish a

67
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,049
great report

68
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:03,599
with you you can practically fake a
report without doing any testing and

69
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,409
make it look like you know you're
talking about

70
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:09,060
if you're a good reporter but again we
don't know what we don't know

71
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,950
so if if they make a good reporter

72
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,870
you know it its its gonna show for me
might not show

73
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,090
a half until hacker gets and over not
sure if

74
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:26,960
being smartass or I F assessments again

75
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,040
zooming out and zooming and as much as
possible on

76
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,900
what you get with a dumbass

77
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,250
a dumbass when their original
conversation starts and again I'm hoping

78
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,490
at the end to the stalk you have learned
how can I avoid

79
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,960
dumbasses at least in the security realm

80
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,820
on their savings accts all I need is IP
address in Valdosta

81
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,889
that's an OK thing again that sounds
good there

82
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:57,009
do it what I'm fat good all I need is
the IP address

83
00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:01,180
this will make a little bit more sense
when we get to on when we get the smart

84
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,669
a smartass

85
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:06,889
in when all he is the IP address remix
coping difficult

86
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:10,090
because you're trusting the client
actually know what they were know what

87
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:10,400
be

88
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,949
you should be tested New York I just
want the IP address

89
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:19,479
again who who's the say there might be
10 other IP addresses open to the system

90
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:22,360
that are open to the internet but they
don't know about

91
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,680
so that's always something which gets
you worried on

92
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,410
we do things like an attacker well no
you won't because you can't

93
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,229
you're on a weak schedule your from
Monday to Friday and you get as much

94
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:33,910
testing

95
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:37,620
done as you can and probably about at
least a day or two if that is reporting

96
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,620
because

97
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,229
I know about you guys but reporting
sucks for my job

98
00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:45,699
arm I do think it's going to get better
and that's something I'll get back to

99
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:46,070
you in the

100
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,570
become reporting on you will be hacked

101
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,850
know most likely you won't on if you do

102
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:57,060
infrastructure problems you get a couple
people who stand the entire internet

103
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:57,960
looking form

104
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,970
they get found a lot of the application
boggs

105
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:05,039
go unnoticed for years I mean you can
look at what in on this is on a Sony and

106
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,060
stuff like that

107
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,539
those issues that happen overnight they
didn't happen in a month they've been

108
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:11,819
there for probably

109
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:15,189
years until someone found on on

110
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:18,919
someday you will be haxor isn't always
the best the best argument

111
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:21,930
on but let's say you go ahead you're
Hiram a

112
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,569
yeah talks to be on

113
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:29,319
in its not a bit it's not your fault if
you hire your

114
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:32,319
a dumbass it's really because you're not
an ass

115
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,280
you don't know what to look for Sonos
again you want to educate yourself

116
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,330
just because they have a CISSP does not

117
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:43,659
mean they have a clue what they're
talking about I know people FCS a speech

118
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:46,349
to do I'm not say I'm not bashing the
certificate

119
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:49,960
even though you just have to memorize
some things and then you can get a

120
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,699
of there are certain out there which are
great again I don't work for offensive

121
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:55,169
security I use backtrack

122
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:58,789
a lot but I hope to search Annexure B
Myford soon

123
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:02,150
veer awesome they're they're great
search to have

124
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,810
is again you need you learn it there's
videos or slabs

125
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:10,190
and then what happens is you you
actually take a Hans on assessments

126
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:15,539
like the OSCE you know I think the
password is like 10 percent for ninety

127
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:18,580
percent the people they'll release about
ninety percent of people take it

128
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,009
their first time fail it and they don't
get the cert which is awesome

129
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:26,560
so it's a dumbass gonna do you hire dumb

130
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,389
well he's gonna run nasa us you know
love this is victory if you're lucky

131
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:34,000
Obama help you run now sis he'll run

132
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,509
and kill obsess over one finding the
issues so happy that he used a little

133
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:40,779
bit of which he has

134
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:45,250
to fine cross site scripting one place
and then find a million places all over

135
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,759
the application and he isn't

136
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:49,819
idiot because what happens exists one
place

137
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:54,490
the developer obviously doesn't know to
protect against a therefore is gonna

138
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:54,990
find

139
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:59,569
I mean he's gonna find every single form
field this is not a smart person does

140
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:01,050
are smart pastor does

141
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:05,589
if you're really lucky C minor cheap
poke around the application

142
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:10,169
on he might run it proprietary scripts
or something like craps

143
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:16,139
arm getting if you're really lucky day
might actually do an application step I

144
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:19,909
applications can most them IFE I've
talked to will do

145
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:23,490
infrastructure scanning and think it's
actually helping the application and its

146
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,009
not

147
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:27,690
infrastructure trust me is great but not
it's not the most

148
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:32,979
on important one this is an example very
poor I can you not this was pulled out a

149
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:33,709
report

150
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:38,270
in its not bad finding I'm not gonna I'm
not gonna hit that its unbranded their

151
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:38,969
pages

152
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:43,890
you hit 40 force for energy in the the
blackouts and stuff like that urges

153
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,329
I this is Rio I'd want to keep company's
name out about

154
00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:50,600
arm named as I used to work for any help

155
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,850
on 244 okay cool

156
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:58,360
you get your page so what they did is
they showed one screenshot

157
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,600
men they showed another screenshot and
others can showcase or two pages into

158
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,399
one finding

159
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:06,810
cool knows this isn't like sequence
action is just like

160
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,630
on ran this is default error message on

161
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:15,470
so you have a couple examples cool
that's okay on the view from the URL's

162
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,569
again I know I'm just gonna be blue
block

163
00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:21,089
by again I'm not sure on the URL's but
okay so

164
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:26,329
404 errors you get on when you go to a
page it doesn't exist so

165
00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:29,699
using the sky is an example if you point
and a star

166
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:32,760
bat ones there that was there what
they're doing here saying about

167
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,220
doesn't exist that you to slash QRS CV

168
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,640
one 89 die HTML okay that's a 404

169
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,079
i Mees as examples only make one other
number remember you out what ima do that

170
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:43,350
one

171
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,709
in a been one on and they give a few
examples

172
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:50,430
in a few more few more

173
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:54,920
invented coming this is four pages of a
report

174
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,800
for 404 errors this was a smarter
dumbass

175
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,540
they did a great stand-up the
application probably a burping got all

176
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,720
these results back and go oh my gosh

177
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,010
I need to put this on my part but don't
worry they gave a recommendation of two

178
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:10,870
lines for

179
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,800
or five pages wasted taxed awesome

180
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,019
you have the power to stop us first

181
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:21,970
you ask questions before you hire them n

182
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:26,089
every I I should have to say this but
every assessment don't make like some

183
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:27,769
10-year agreement with the Company

184
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:31,079
because in ten years they might not be
as smart as they were then

185
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:34,390
this is why you want to keep update how
do we keep updating do they go to

186
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,089
conferences like Kirk on

187
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:40,329
really set in their basement playing
World of Warcraft or something

188
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:43,949
on what esposito old reports

189
00:10:43,949 --> 00:10:49,100
like tell them I wanna maybe go although
fears proprietary information

190
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,160
Tom to strip if they wanna saw you on a
10 grand

191
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,199
penetration tester formerly assessment
they can strip better near

192
00:10:56,199 --> 00:11:00,620
to turn your money on you at the private
NDA signed written

193
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,630
anyway tom is the show and on

194
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:08,230
over Port after references on even more
importantly asking if they actually know

195
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,170
what they're doing

196
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:13,010
and let them prove it to you that's
probably the easiest do you know what

197
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,079
you're doing

198
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,569
and let let them tell you on

199
00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:21,100
if they talk about 10 this goes are also
without saying but they talk about tools

200
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,370
and scanning more than

201
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:26,480
about their process then should be
setting off alarm bells

202
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,250
also this is some point made last year I
forgot who gave a talk by one actually

203
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,260
column I'll

204
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,279
if this is the words we use proprietary
tools a lot

205
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,240
here you should be again dumbass alert
going off

206
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,680
on because it he made a good point last
year

207
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,949
if they're back good they would be
selling on and they want they won't be

208
00:11:45,949 --> 00:11:47,180
keeping an internal

209
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,600
proprietary scripts and what now that's
that's cool it's mainly because

210
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,620
most hackers are completely lazy like me
a

211
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,209
so I wanna script up as much as
everything I can do

212
00:11:57,209 --> 00:12:00,240
into one fan again if I wanted to you

213
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,839
DNS plan and that is all due diligence
stuffing sometimes

214
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,140
you up all and that be an ass a look at
the SSL Certificates all that you can

215
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,230
script that a lot so it's like one but
manner all goes

216
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,870
but again they talk more about tools in
scanning its

217
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:18,279
there's an issue where secular

218
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:24,610
and one assessments for smart ass now

219
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,750
awesome all

220
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,060
starting the assessment right off the
bat

221
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,079
they should be doing scoping and process

222
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:39,550
what should we be testing if it's an
extra one or Billy assessment IP address

223
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,170
is a great

224
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:43,260
I want the Rangers so I can tell you
what's there

225
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,740
how it works what we're gonna task and
also talk about what we're gonna do for

226
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,560
each system

227
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,500
just because no findings are found you
can actually listen

228
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,399
this is what I did on this IP address
this is the due diligence testing

229
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,149
I did on this %uh this system on

230
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:02,730
it was running on port 80 so I want it
you can you your leverage

231
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:06,019
tools to get more rap in your testing

232
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:10,519
on but its it's the right tool for a job
in the following methodology

233
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:15,160
addition to tell you I i I work of the
OWASP if the weather susman networking

234
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,029
sites and I use the OS STM

235
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:20,760
I use you know embedded whatever I mean
Apple Developer

236
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,200
security methodology any Evos in again
should build it

237
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,800
include them reporter hand it to you and
say this is what I work of %uh

238
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,560
all of these things were shocked they
can create things like this

239
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,820
ike again this is meeting cliffy in
about five minutes

240
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,480
and then the assessment you know the
smart asking or three years

241
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,500
we're gonna touch this system in this
system in the system

242
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,230
we're gonna look at the configs for this
router and then be very specific

243
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:51,699
if you're looking for something to do
testing few make sure their specific and

244
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:52,140
not

245
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,220
well we run tools are we do this sir

246
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:59,140
any make it may can be specific require
them to be specific

247
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,980
on they're gonna clear definition

248
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,769
goofy is an awesome tool if you don't
wanna buy Vizio

249
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:10,170
I don't like busy I'll arm there's a lot
of power to it

250
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,260
cliff awesome it's cheap it works great

251
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,220
it's very easy to share you export and
anything on

252
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,730
a smart ass hole do couple good examples

253
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:25,750
up one viability and move on they won't
just per sevareid over one finding is

254
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,709
they were no I know either way for cross
expecting some I find it all over the

255
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:29,560
application

256
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,970
in excess one place it's going to exist
other places

257
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,800
your job again is not to fight every
finding in my opinion is

258
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,079
I think urs free was speaking earlier he
said he's never finding that he's never

259
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:43,540
found an application to 100 percent
secure

260
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,660
we find something if that's the case

261
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:50,329
a gift unless the client asks for again
you come up front

262
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:54,720
you're gonna more fun one or two good
examples and move on because you can

263
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,199
then

264
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,319
creates strategy based off of those
things saying vintage the developers to

265
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:00,690
be the security analyst

266
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:04,420
pay this is how we found that this is
how we reproduce that you put

267
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:08,190
a single quoted this form to generate
some air fixer

268
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,630
and you can do that throughout the
application you on the show every

269
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,430
instance over

270
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:16,520
the best thing a smartass will do is he
will do it three types of testing

271
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,360
you look at the infrastructure
middleware in the application

272
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,709
dumbass really only looks infrastructure
and maybe middleware

273
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:28,790
if he runs Nessus will cool he hits to
Obama in that's

274
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,399
a lot of what I see in testing and
that's what my gripe is about why did

275
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,140
this talkative water testing kits
infrastructure and middleware

276
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:39,360
which is important but you don't have to
pay fifteen grand for an assessment

277
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,490
and if you're selling this I mean I want
this to go of your

278
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,800
if you can this one might be called a
mouse if you are shelling if

279
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,230
fifteen thousand dollar assessment to
run nasa's

280
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,779
stop doing it if you're making the rest
of us will look like acids

281
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:56,529
an actual last night application
security specialist

282
00:15:56,529 --> 00:16:01,459
on your goal your what you're being paid
force the test the application

283
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:05,899
his most tools can't tough that when
inspecting do some things

284
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:10,190
purple do some things but it's not gonna
look at any business logic France's can

285
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:14,310
I put a negative number and to buy
something and then get money back

286
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:18,339
on tried by a house for a negative
number in the application fashion know

287
00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:19,209
these things

288
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:23,649
so your goals to test the application
teach them how to teach infrastructure

289
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,420
in our

290
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,970
two reasons one because they can do a
lot cheaper

291
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:32,339
it's a wasted your time and skills im

292
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:36,880
evocation tough things a lot more fun in
your get your get more customers this

293
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,380
way

294
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,769
because they understand they can't do
that when they find out

295
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:45,430
like I found this new tool called Nessus
I can run and get all the same findings

296
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,730
they did why am I paying 15 grand

297
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:52,939
reporting something which is extremely
close to my heart

298
00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:56,559
dumbass reporting

299
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:00,079
now again I might offend someone a
dumbass report

300
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,159
is someone should concentrate on issues
in remediation

301
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:09,040
now a lot of reports like this one look
this way

302
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:14,329
they have shares cross site scripting
here's where it was steps to reproduce:

303
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:17,959
here's how to fix it that information

304
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:22,520
is great however have our reports if we
want to evolve and actually start

305
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,520
helping um

306
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,319
we have to not only teach them how to do
this it has never been reported and it

307
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,970
can be in the report out

308
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:33,000
teach some how to do this plus your
sales personal absolutely love you for

309
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,260
this when you say hey they cross site
scripting

310
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,730
they need this type of training you're
there infrastructure socked

311
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:44,190
baby patch management training or we can
sell them on a patch management server

312
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,250
it's brought brilliant on

313
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,960
a dumbass can amazingly have made up
issues

314
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,250
arm awesome

315
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,290
ability to exploit Windows
administrative account blah blah blah

316
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,409
blah blah

317
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:04,700
this is how they reproduce it connect to
the system %uh the remote system using

318
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,419
RDP

319
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:08,440
with encryption clearly that's important

320
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,040
once the system using the credentials
that were provided for the internal

321
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,899
assessment

322
00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:17,340
once the dust uploads open command
prompt right click on the executed well

323
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:17,940
and slept

324
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,850
run as administrator click OK for the
pop-up command pro

325
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,240
and the command prompt will load as the
industry without the need for a password

326
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,740
there's a username they ride to block
out on use this user

327
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,340
to install a back door and take control
the server okay so first

328
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:36,480
first issue 9 you this price it is in a
gym here pride is they would have fun

329
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,280
called out on it they were given domain
admin access for

330
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,429
internal penetration or internal on
ability assessment

331
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:47,490
that's what vets like me going

332
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:51,679
hey Matt I'm gonna hand you the keys to
my car

333
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,049
now I wanted to security threats and
tell me if I need an oil change or what

334
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:55,340
not

335
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,620
he'd goes in the car wash the car jumped
in the car

336
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:05,620
drives away in calls me on the phone and
say hey guess what I saw your car

337
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:14,080
in know how you fix this you remove the
gas pedal so i cant steal it anymore

338
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,110
real yes this is insane a

339
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:23,150
disable right click functionality on the
server so the user is unable to run as

340
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,890
administrator that's performing
administrative functions about a

341
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:26,680
password

342
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,970
you've gotta be shitting me are you can
you

343
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:35,430
look at this and piss you off work as a
tester this

344
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:40,510
still here's the keys to my car yet the
fix is to remove the gas pedal

345
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:44,810
Osama smartass

346
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:48,560
there is for stakeholders and

347
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,590
every vulnerability assessment
penetration test executives

348
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:56,480
other analysts like yourself developers

349
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,330
immense salesman believe it or not if
you work in a consulting business

350
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:04,110
even if you don't if you work in an
enterprise business you still short of

351
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,160
cellular sales

352
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,130
internally expression a huge enterprises
they can always go elsewhere

353
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:14,970
executives a smart ass and his report
would give

354
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:19,660
what's needed to each individual this is
were dumbasses go

355
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:23,710
problema remediation it doesn't help
executives

356
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,730
because they're the ones who spend the
money and they're the ones who decide

357
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,690
whether or not you go to Garcon

358
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:33,930
analysts like me what was tested what
was your scope

359
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:38,010
scope should be very specific in your
reports because when I come back a year

360
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,110
later and task

361
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:43,180
even if I morning did the task I'm not
gonna know what in the world was passed

362
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,190
in a year later views I have one week

363
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:48,910
developer again exactly once the No

364
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:54,320
what where do we go from here just is
this gonna hurt my pocketbook in any way

365
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,320
as discussed slowdown us going to market
with our product

366
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,090
at developer what's broken how do I fix
it

367
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:05,100
they're the key group to say here's the
here's what's broken here's how you fix

368
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:05,360
a

369
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:11,330
then how do I stop doing this in the
future salesman

370
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:15,350
they suck it input validation we sell

371
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,970
a secure you developer securing our
secure coding

372
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:22,490
training sell it to 'em

373
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:27,010
not again they're gonna get sold one way
or another that salesman is going to

374
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,220
call them and say

375
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,820
Paideia it's been six months let's get
let's do this again

376
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,520
but when he can call me saying hey based
on your last report

377
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,470
you had a lot of these types of issues
a.m.

378
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:43,300
we have a fix for that we have a
solution bit salesman a will make a lot

379
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,300
more money in your company will make a
lot more money leading you making more

380
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:46,700
money

381
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,110
but the clients who loved getting
meeting the salesman

382
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:54,030
because they know what they're gonna get
a raise next year because they can fix

383
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,410
the actual issues that were found

384
00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:00,340
root causes for vulnerabilities

385
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,640
again high in all of these how what's
the root cause of this fine

386
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:10,370
plans for the future the future holds a
lot of facts

387
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:15,230
who is still tracking issues and Excel
spreadsheets

388
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:19,080
I know I haven't really met company

389
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:24,370
who does really advanced bug tracker
maybe one or two who sell a product

390
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:28,100
but if it's like patching issues know it
gets printed in a report to get set down

391
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,130
and never remembered

392
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:32,130
until a year later once on see on up

393
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:37,010
goes bust of if they fix those issues
its tracking issues

394
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:40,430
what's open what has an infection why we
just accept it as the business where we

395
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:42,000
not gonna fix it takes too much time

396
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,010
I think unified unifying reports his
also coming next year

397
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:50,270
why because I know companies developing
a product next year

398
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:55,070
on work everyone here viability reports
is going to be shot together even if

399
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,270
manual testing is going to shop together

400
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:01,890
we can see all the information that any
given time metrics analytics

401
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:06,750
this term has been used all over
creation every small company I know

402
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,050
whatever metrics

403
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:12,560
why do we need metrics because we can't
answered the simplest stupidest

404
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,520
questions like

405
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,490
are we doing better we don't know

406
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:21,340
just because you're finding more issues
doesn't mean you're getting worse

407
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:24,640
it might be that you're getting more
coverage we're getting more clients

408
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,480
you know a lot of different factors we
also can answer questions we should we

409
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,010
do

410
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:34,970
a bunch of different assets unifying
reports and bring that together

411
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:38,130
mobile to answer questions like how are
critical you know ones which are

412
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,870
external which people can get out

413
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:43,210
however critical web service during an
input validation

414
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:47,230
questions like that we can't answer
because we print of reports

415
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:51,660
we need a better solution I hate to be
do this now

416
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:56,100
it be generic q1 next year there's a
really freakin cool coming out

417
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,540
a tool coming out the company has
announced that so much for reform

418
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:03,710
I was pulled in to consult on a its
freakin awesome

419
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:07,040
it will make reporting it instead of
waiting you know

420
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,830
till the end of the week even if you
report as you go in taking

421
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:14,940
you know for six hours eight hours
playing metrics together

422
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,500
her findings you all are you to create
reports

423
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:22,520
in a matter of minutes by dragging and
dropping issues

424
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,440
under this asset and this ending the day
anything that necessary data

425
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:31,960
cross-site scripting general Description
whatnot has a change in a long time

426
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:36,050
need an answer questions like that it's
designed for executives analysts

427
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:36,700
developers

428
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:42,400
and salesman saying hey sell the house

429
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,550
funny later for questions your question
i effing I talked about

430
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:50,960
even the application I i cant showing up
here but again I talked through it

431
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,410
on don't be a dumbass

432
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,780
make the smart ass is what better
