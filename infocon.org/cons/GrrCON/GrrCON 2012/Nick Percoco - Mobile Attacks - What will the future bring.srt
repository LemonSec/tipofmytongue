1
00:00:02,379 --> 00:00:04,210
okay everybody here me

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,059
you get him in the back okay great arm

3
00:00:08,059 --> 00:00:11,530
welcome this talk is mobile attacks what
will the future bring I'm gonna go

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:11,809
through

5
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:15,089
couple has a bit of an agenda see you
can see where we're going

6
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:18,500
his presentation and a little bit of an
introduction its mine who I am and to

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,380
where I come from

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,699
on we'll talk about mobile device
landscapes attack scenarios

9
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:25,900
arms from the historic attack scenarios
I have some demos

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,050
that's why I actually have three live
demos with a cross my fingers

11
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,300
across every everything I have how to
make sure that no plea

12
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,469
everything runs correctly there some
some self-contained stuff in there some

13
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,480
things are using things on the outside
as well so

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,649
are properly of the everything runs well
are more we'll see

15
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:43,219
and then talk about in the future stuff
some future looking things I've been

16
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:43,809
thinking about

17
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:47,620
arm and tree try and predict obviously
predicting things isn't

18
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,940
I was the best thing to do it security
conferences values he felt that but on

19
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,449
but try to come up with ideas around
where these attacks are going to

20
00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:58,660
and then with some time open apps from
some questions

21
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,950
so brief introduction so little about me
so I've been doing if a sack since the

22
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:03,540
90s

23
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,820
I'm started out my career during
penetration testing back in the 90s I'm

24
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:07,350
getting some

25
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,020
it's a response a friend's ex work arm
and then also and I also form the spinal

26
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:12,580
abstain

27
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm in 2005 so I much spin allies number
sitting right there

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,060
army in the audience here but on my
phone and in 2005 also in talks at

29
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,130
places like Def Con

30
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,350
are and black action given briefings for
the

31
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:28,100
Department of Homeland Security on US
search secret service

32
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,729
in all sorts of other places on there is
research some really interested in

33
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:34,869
so obviously my day job I i run the
global spiral abscam

34
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:39,140
arm in Trustwave but in mice or spare
time I guess

35
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,350
I'm interested in data breaches with a
lot of forensic investigations I like to

36
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,399
read those reports

37
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:46,910
understand what's going on in those
scenarios are also malware

38
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:50,850
I'm very interested in that in a mobile
computing on a very a mobile fan

39
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,590
and so this is where the stalk really is
for interesting to me I'm also the

40
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,130
primary author the trust with global
security report

41
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:01,690
we actually have its puts but is put out
every single year put out February

42
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,289
typically

43
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:05,759
we do some copies that are abused its
literally right behind that wall

44
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,330
arm and then of course you can find me
on twitter OMSI 75

45
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,920
on Twitter I'm a lot of beer on tweets
are many in

46
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,750
occasionally some InfoSec tweets get
mixed in there as well arm

47
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,390
a little bit about spiral out how to
spend really much time and yours is the

48
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,150
one slide

49
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,280
sorta commercial but where I'm from arm
this is truly what we're all about

50
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,599
Tom with in that blue box response
investigations analysis and testing

51
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,900
research and development that's all it
that's all that my team does within

52
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,590
Trustwave

53
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,680
and we takin threats we analyze on ennui
we sometimes discover them

54
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,709
ourselves and then also that results in
protections for our customers

55
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:45,170
no products are an SS arm and also our
partners that we

56
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,750
exchange information with on a regular
basis so let's jump into the

57
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,830
llegaste a mi to the presentation so
what I want to do is to set the stage

58
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,060
on from how I see mobile devices sort of
walking through

59
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,280
sorta might might might it sorta from my
perspective arm

60
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,260
we talk about you know the mobile device
landscape in the first thing that comes

61
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,110
to mind in

62
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,660
in in I guess in my mind is use usage
know how are people that you know what

63
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,300
are people doing with these devices are

64
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,490
you know what's going on with them so
the first thing we have there's you

65
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,010
really there are over a half billion
devices on 3G 4G

66
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,020
Ltd networks today I'm in fact arm

67
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,850
just on the stage there's a on a 3G my
life I hear there's a a 3G Samsung

68
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:27,920
Samsung phone I also might my phone in
my pocket I i pad on my back so i four

69
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,070
devices on stage

70
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,530
are many men you probably have new model
in your possession as well

71
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,920
by 2020 estimates to me about $10
billion devices

72
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,070
on that is for exceeds the more people
on the planet prolly by then

73
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,800
arm by Tom like I said him i four
devices just here

74
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,110
you prolly have money in your pockets as
well the other thing with my usage

75
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,800
perspectives that 60 percent abusers
carry devices at all times now few

76
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,530
you quit that people in this room it
probably is near 100 percent on the chin

77
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,340
your you not really turning off your
device you're not for your device in the

78
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,340
car and then going

79
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,850
in at night in going going to bed you're
taking advice with you putting on the

80
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,680
nightstand when you wake up in the
morning you're checking your email

81
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,550
you're taking a break this with you are
you're traveling with it so it's with

82
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,650
you with all time I all time so that
makes things very very different than it

83
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,500
in a PC

84
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,560
right so if you think about PCs from 10
years ago on

85
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,180
that more devices yet today actually
more powerful than those devices on the

86
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,770
always on network connectivity they have
GPS awareness

87
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,889
right so you can see where that device
is located anywhere on the planet and

88
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:27,080
have a lot more personal data

89
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,210
on those devices today so we think that
from attackers point of view

90
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,580
that's a pretty pretty juicy target if I
was a target no

91
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,509
you pick someone in the audience and
target their phone or other device and

92
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:38,490
get access to that

93
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,310
on there's a lot of things I can do
ratings will talk a little bit more

94
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,240
about that

95
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,180
also interaction we think people using
their devices

96
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,759
they're accessing highly sensitive
information know how many people here

97
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,009
check their bank account from there from
a mobile device before and fun have to

98
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:54,689
have the room

99
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:58,270
raise a hand so you you typically will
trust your mobile device

100
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,590
mom over something like it you know the
hotel here you know and

101
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,430
staying at the Holiday Inn that's down
the street here om there's a kiosk in

102
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,599
the lobby at the Holiday Inn

103
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:12,340
how he will he will check the email on
that kiosk get known as the hand right

104
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:12,659
say

105
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:15,770
you with the hollywood not you will even
log into anything crazy

106
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,840
see people using any sort feel bad for
the night as using a

107
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,009
in the kiosk you could be some trouble
in a couple hours um

108
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:25,110
and so basically users will trust their
smartphones with

109
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,479
over a kiosk and any other question is
do you really

110
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,729
rarely ever question the integrity of
your other smart figure smart your

111
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:32,990
smartphone or mobile device

112
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:38,060
how many people here at ever have ever
themselves or have had people and say

113
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,169
hey my phone just got a virus as anybody

114
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:45,650
anybody in the room no but we know
there's tons of mobile malware out there

115
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,849
you hear about it all the time

116
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:51,150
European eats no we we as an
organization fine mobile malware

117
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:55,409
there are two research teams on and and
so that's that's really odd rates on

118
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:56,770
three people here for people to have a

119
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:00,849
a virus on my computer right by
everybody raise their hand you hear

120
00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:01,620
about all time

121
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,909
my dad calls me up like every day as I'm
a virus what is this

122
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:07,860
you know you're getting these questions
and so arms that happens all time and

123
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,750
then the other thing from interaction
perspective

124
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,360
is that you have limited s top real
estate site not pull on my iPhone

125
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,439
on here and of course it now has a a
4-inch screen on it

126
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,199
but that's it and when I'm using it ap
it's Phil the entire screen

127
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,159
and so it's very different when you're
sitting in front of your 30 inch monitor

128
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:28,990
13 screen then you have model wendy was
going on your multiple desktops going on

129
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,039
if things are sorta running a ride you
have notifications and

130
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:35,169
a lot more activity going on you notice
it you have

131
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:38,569
UN divers running that pops up a pop-up
you have if you have little Snitch

132
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:40,360
running its Tony something's trying to

133
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,589
trying XQ send traffic of your computer
and you can notice it but on a mobile

134
00:06:44,589 --> 00:06:45,520
device you dot

135
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,969
onyx you don't have that means and then
also when there's messages that are sent

136
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:50,099
to the end-user

137
00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:53,860
dropping cryptic or misleading and we
were doing some SSL testing

138
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,389
on back on last year and every single
time you try to man in the mill

139
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:01,639
be free some absent and iPhone devices
are I was devices

140
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:04,830
we'll get popups they would say the
internet connections not available

141
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,969
well that's completely different than
what we're doing we're trying to

142
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,050
you know used his mouth on certificates
on

143
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:14,620
YouTube you try it try to causative so
we can intercept traffic

144
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,990
and they air message the user was your
internet connection is not available

145
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:21,849
let operated thats it made AVC they
could connect to the internet but there

146
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:22,959
was something else going on

147
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:28,180
no security warning in was misleading
the other area we talk about security

148
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:28,750
deal

149
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,029
div that a little deeper is that there's
no standard you why

150
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:36,330
for mobile app's so if you have you know
if your if you're on your online banking

151
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,709
account online banking you're checking
your balance

152
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,930
and then you go and you try to buy
something on a store future different

153
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:42,399
maps

154
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,139
there may be some security things going
on on within those ass

155
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:50,009
with they typically don't tell you about
it and you typically even if they did

156
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:53,620
its looks different in one app for some
the other so you know similar to like

157
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,789
when using your browser

158
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:57,940
every single e-commerce site did you go
when you visit your try to put your

159
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,019
credit card information and

160
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:02,449
there's the green bar the locketts
always standard and users

161
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:05,769
arch have been trying to understand that
at least eight week we hope they have

162
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:08,879
and so how does an end-user know when
using a mobile app

163
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,789
on that their date has been actually
been in cricket you going to check your

164
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:14,069
bank account upon all your details how
do you know that

165
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:17,709
it's an SSL connection you don't as an
end-user arm

166
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:21,029
and then reserved it did a little deeper
from a suffer development standpoint

167
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:24,129
the end users themselves or so did
suffer develop

168
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,709
suffer developers their 0 functionality
difference if I'm

169
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:30,940
developer in some hired me to bill a
online banking app

170
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,099
for phone and I go and build it and sir

171
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:37,019
enter username/password act on the
backend servers well I do everything

172
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:38,110
over HTTP

173
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,949
I show it to the customer and say here
look at work you can login

174
00:08:41,949 --> 00:08:45,010
you can do all these things and you
handed to them in there may be no

175
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,690
security where are they going to
implement the

176
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:50,180
send out to customers the
functionalities exactly the same

177
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,940
if if their customers are sending their
traffic over the over the network in the

178
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,510
clear

179
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,970
than if they were sent it over HTTPS and
so from even from us many saw for

180
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:57,579
developers

181
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:00,589
there's there's been cases you probably
all know about them where

182
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:06,100
absent week data as a developer Senate
data is over HTTP personage TPS

183
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,209
and then the other issue from a security
standpoint is when the are problems with

184
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:10,550
a mobile device

185
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,079
you end up how with in many cases if
those

186
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:16,980
at those applications are relying on a
library or something is part that the

187
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,600
last

188
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,579
those problems in cascade to all devices
all the applications on that device

189
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:24,730
we'll talk a little more about that as
well but you we think about your mobile

190
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,660
commerce people

191
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,730
ukraine these applications at the senate
sensitive data

192
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,939
what happens to their their community
weapons their population and user

193
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:34,709
population do they then have to do. send
an alert out the say

194
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:37,860
you're running an old version of I last
had a problem

195
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,939
need to upgrade or they just sorta let
it go and

196
00:09:40,939 --> 00:09:46,540
in in and hope that someone doesn't get
doesn't get on but because that problem

197
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,059
to not talk about some other mobile
attack scenarios on and so

198
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:53,160
what I have here is basically into
getting my mind on

199
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,149
the mobile market really breaks down
into into two two flavors regular few I

200
00:09:57,149 --> 00:10:00,199
last seen you if you have Android
obviously there's blackberry

201
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:04,000
on how the people here have a blackberry
okay

202
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,160
how many people here have a blackberry
because their employer bought it for

203
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,660
them

204
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,660
okay so it basically yes it means to

205
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,260
and then the other thing how do you have
a Windows Mobile phone

206
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,920
no one others one in the back

207
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,130
so either works for Microsoft threes
from finland

208
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:25,620
rates even if the Nokia guys so um

209
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,730
sexy estimates a base for the markets
you know i OS and Android

210
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,770
on forty percent fifty percent for the
differences here I i've seen

211
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:35,470
you know I West developed by Apple only
runs on

212
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:38,990
runs on Apple hardware and then you've
and right and that runs on anybody's how

213
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:39,829
we're basically

214
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:43,520
you go into an AT&T store he said one
app now when I Apple phone ago here's

215
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:43,910
East

216
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,929
two models and remodel we have you say
you want an Android phone the oh here's

217
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:47,179
use

218
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:51,559
87 models you can pick from and in just
sort pray that you get saw for updates

219
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,029
on

220
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:55,980
no six months from now for many those
models on

221
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,829
so let's talk a lot of the taxes about
this section here on out for a walk

222
00:10:58,829 --> 00:10:59,760
through

223
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,860
so the various attack scenarios arm and
then roll them we'll show you some demos

224
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,899
on some some different types in areas
with demos and things but

225
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,949
releases me sort putting on some company
I'm a hacker hacked

226
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:13,959
am saying what I'm going to target the
IRS committee how am I going to do it

227
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:17,230
right arm wanna the first thing that
comes to mind is jailbreak on abilities

228
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:20,800
sure everyone in this room knows what a
jailbreak ios arm but I sorta see it as

229
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,550
a sort of virtual

230
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,170
arm virtual arm race between the
jailbreak community an apple

231
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,589
prices you Apple comes out the new
version they can what I was six interest

232
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:29,829
trying to find a jailbreak

233
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:34,130
now for for trial Essex on and that's in
into for that community it's great

234
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,699
because people want to go and I wanna
jailbreak your device they want to be a

235
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:37,120
one-stop

236
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,939
ABZ they Apple doesn't want them to you
know it's not available in App Store

237
00:11:40,939 --> 00:11:43,949
you wanna make modifications they wanna
between wanna be a hobbyist

238
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:47,270
with their with the iPhone arm into
thats in mind someone

239
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,439
in service you know that the
non-security sense that's makes

240
00:11:50,439 --> 00:11:53,630
makes perfect sense for someone they
want to do that army put on the security

241
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,260
hat

242
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,730
and as an attacker I may be able to take
that same jailbreak

243
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:01,959
on portability and weaponized and in
launching in use it as a as a way to get

244
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:04,790
you know get initially access on
someone's device in the altered star

245
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,949
might now where in store

246
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:09,059
do things someone's device so obviously
you know you know

247
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:12,529
couple days after each its release comes
out even before release comes out

248
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:14,459
winners for the gold master that's their

249
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:18,959
arm people find jobs Joe breaks and so
basically no jailbreak is possible

250
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,059
but all I was versions others tethered
versus untethered on him but

251
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:26,770
we we actually took this back in a
couple years ago at work on twelve

252
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:30,149
on actually weaponized and we
demonstrate it to to the audience there

253
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:30,760
we took

254
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,140
the jailbreaking dot com on basically on

255
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,890
exploits don't have to close down river
stump crater on to locate

256
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,750
on the bay so we are able to show that
you visit this website we can now

257
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,429
install

258
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:44,569
is an hour on your device and get more
access to it so those things are

259
00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:45,880
feasible

260
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:51,130
from a tax perspective another way
against I West devices is something SSL

261
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:54,490
man in the middle now myself in a
colleague named Paul Kerr we're doing

262
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,829
research last summer

263
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:59,279
actual what last last spring and
basically on

264
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,140
our whole process research was to try to
find if there's any app status of Los

265
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,730
arm it turned out we're doing our
testing we ran across are doing I last

266
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,390
testing

267
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:11,130
and we're feeding it different have some
malformed SSL Certificates

268
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:15,100
and one of them worked like wait a
minute this is for I were actually met

269
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,730
in a million this

270
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,899
I West device via this malformed on SSL
certificate were able to intercept

271
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,829
traffic and so we start digging deeper

272
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:25,160
armor tested again we ask other people
inspire laps or to validate this force

273
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,610
so we think we're crazy before we
contacted Apple I went to contacting

274
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,319
Apple

275
00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:34,269
and the fixed in 10 days they went fix
the problem push to update to

276
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:38,699
160 million you and users out there so
the interesting thing there is

277
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:42,470
it also Apple did make a lotta news
noise about pregnancy a press release

278
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,410
you know hear much about this problem

279
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,709
when it happened on but it turned out
that on there was a citizen

280
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:53,449
base with the same flaw on that on thing
was in 2002 that Moxie discovered in in

281
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:54,269
IE

282
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:57,819
arm so 2002 basic constraints
vulnerability

283
00:13:57,819 --> 00:14:02,139
are in IE over st. using SSL and now
it's two thousand

284
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:05,449
2011 and that befall exist and I West
device

285
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:08,800
so when we notified Apple nom have see
if anybody's reported

286
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,050
for Billys Apple it's very cold breaking
email and get a robot

287
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:16,009
emails you back and that you don't hear
anything arm until you on plate

288
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:19,199
father phone tree on actually talk to
folks at on that that

289
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,910
sure we're signing that email Steve here
the Pacific

290
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:26,560
here's a guy who gotta sending as
talking to Apple but on

291
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,120
yes peace with that meant is that on any
device running for not 3.5 or earlier

292
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,190
is former to former bondable to this
attack so yes

293
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:38,509
this were asked this question how many
people here are running I was for a 3.5

294
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:39,470
hour earlier

295
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,919
sorry buddy

296
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:44,139
now so one thing that sort that's has
same guy with the

297
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:49,619
within Tom with the windows mobile phone
arm let's see so on super one thing

298
00:14:49,619 --> 00:14:52,839
interesting here's we actually
demonstrated this it def come last year

299
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:56,220
it and we we're an attached with as a
soil test site

300
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,489
and we thought well this dispatcher been
out for about a week and a half for two

301
00:14:59,489 --> 00:14:59,999
weeks

302
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:03,910
and we thought everybody in the room
would be up up to date by now

303
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:07,199
within you forget about the jailbreakers
right the job record on update their

304
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:07,769
devices

305
00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:10,839
so we actually ran the staff had people
visit what visit a website said

306
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:15,059
if you see the spider Labs logo on your
screen on raise your hand and we sorta

307
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:17,720
brought it up it's a reverse waiting he
wouldn't ask things

308
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,160
and we told you about the problem we had
I don't like 85

309
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,449
ninety people raise their hand in the
audience and they're all formal to this

310
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:24,910
attack

311
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,970
which we thought was interesting in fact
was a couple people who actually

312
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:32,089
didn't have are I West devices that were
sorties really cheap

313
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:35,410
com surfer away phones that actual
vulnerable to that as well and we've

314
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,269
been trying to get on the disclosure
pappa those

315
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,979
comatose with those vendors and its a
little little it difficult to get

316
00:15:40,979 --> 00:15:44,679
to get to get their attention arm so
basically you think about this warm or

317
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:47,759
it with this problem what we're mobile
banking an e-commerce

318
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,659
organization doing office probably
actually had some mobile banking

319
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:51,569
customers a farce

320
00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:55,109
call us and say you you know we you guys
told us about this problem

321
00:15:55,109 --> 00:15:57,819
what do we do and see put on the
security had to say well you got a car

322
00:15:57,819 --> 00:15:58,909
of all the customers

323
00:15:58,909 --> 00:16:02,519
are using for a 3.5 hour earlier he said
well then make sense was

324
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:05,579
let's see what that what the impact is
and they went in they looked and the

325
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:07,759
impact within ninety eight percent other
customers

326
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,279
home at that point and so they're like
that it's not gonna work and so they

327
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,319
basically went in

328
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:15,850
you know did some communication to their
customers and and try to educate but I

329
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,529
think you can still stay they probably
have a lot of customers their stuff on a

330
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:18,979
bliss

331
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:24,229
there's roll the dice from from a risk
perspective now talking about some and

332
00:16:24,229 --> 00:16:24,959
red attacks

333
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,019
some things that aren't you going on in
the Android world on

334
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:31,609
I was to find a happy attacker and I
wanna get some malware Kitzman get actor

335
00:16:31,609 --> 00:16:32,229
device

336
00:16:32,229 --> 00:16:35,539
I'm going to put an hour in through the
market

337
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:38,749
or or or a market now right achat write
a malicious application

338
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:42,209
summit will market whether it's Nick
whether it's Google's Play market

339
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:45,819
or most third-party markets really just
posted on a website

340
00:16:45,819 --> 00:16:48,949
and tweet about it see people and
download install and under Devices

341
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:52,259
on but the yet but the market hours we
focused on

342
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:55,739
specifically this summer om myself in
Sean Shilpi

343
00:16:55,739 --> 00:16:58,989
on did this research with bouncer
actually want to see if we can get an

344
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:00,679
application submitted through bouncer

345
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:04,600
get accepted it turned out we were able
to basically the way we did it is that

346
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,559
we use Tom

347
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:09,779
mused we enable that application to
dynamically download JavaScript

348
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:13,269
on into from from from our from a
command control server that we had

349
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:16,750
so anytime the bouncer actually went
scanner application we never served up

350
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,370
that code

351
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:21,049
are should to that to bouncer and then
when it gets million accepted a store

352
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:22,760
and we downloaded on our devices

353
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,699
with an syrup the coat I'm so actually
wasn't very difficult

354
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:30,059
on actually took a matter of minutes so
as a developer I actually went and

355
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:31,490
signed up for a developer account

356
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:35,480
I went and arm did everything fall the
rules actually use my real name in my

357
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:35,940
real

358
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,519
email address and I found out later that
wasn't a great idea on

359
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:44,580
and I in basically went and signed up
instead create a Google Checkout account

360
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,510
and everything just follow the rules

361
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:50,139
and this made an application internet
that shit it passed and showed up in

362
00:17:50,139 --> 00:17:54,760
in the store are eventually we we we we
kept trying to up the ante a little bit

363
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,620
on what we're doing we're in bouncer
national

364
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,779
did get caught between enable everything
all the malicious functionality to see

365
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,529
if they would catch it but on

366
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:05,610
but that being said you if if you know
if he didn't catch it

367
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:08,619
Google then still relies on user
feedback so it is for this cat-and-mouse

368
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:10,309
game if unable to build a nap in

369
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:13,929
summit through arm through the market
gets out there that all users

370
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:17,399
who's got it you can find that there's
an hour but users who do detect this

371
00:18:17,399 --> 00:18:18,659
public security people

372
00:18:18,659 --> 00:18:21,789
will report to win in the plan to the
store and then I just go and create a

373
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:22,450
new account

374
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:27,679
are and in then smits minute counts miss
things again arms or legs

375
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,490
moralist or here's a community research
don't use your own personal email

376
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,860
accounts actually found this out

377
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,690
arms the other day I was tryna by a
homebrewer China by bottle caps

378
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:41,019
online and um it turns out that Google
Checkout is

379
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:44,850
is a lot a meta-data it so I tried like
twelve different email address is my

380
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:45,419
name

381
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:49,230
excellent had and that having have my
wife by me are buying a bottle caps

382
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,740
because I just couldn't do it just kept
denying my transaction

383
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,380
with five or six different credit cards
and everything was pretty interesting

384
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,160
on so the other when you're talking to
Android devices

385
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,230
get a piece that were we look at her
things like rootkits

386
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,800
right so you know your kernel level on
kernel level

387
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,310
piece of code running running on your
device and it has access to everything

388
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,250
that the phone can do

389
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,450
right so what you can do things like you
snap photos if it wants to weaken

390
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,260
recorder

391
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:18,490
your conversations annual a whole slew
of things arm and also can hide itself

392
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,350
from the device from the panel itself

393
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:23,780
right so that makes it very very
difficult even if you were to write a

394
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:27,480
less level see anti-virus program you
would be very difficult for you to text

395
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,030
from

396
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:31,330
as well so we actually on which
demonstrate this well it

397
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:34,460
the deaf can 18 om this is a number of
years ago sir is a

398
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,440
you two years ago that we we
demonstrated this shows for the

399
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,240
capabilities

400
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,780
up the at I'll recap the other phone
ability that sort of

401
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:47,030
You Me At may or may not be familiar
with his and on and rid itself

402
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:50,130
om there's they allow you to do the same
things

403
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:53,720
yet what and read it SDK allows you do
things that you when essentially think

404
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,320
should pull out

405
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,150
up so the scenario you're the Europe of
it this is from week to week 12 the

406
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,470
focus joint liability

407
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,820
is that if you take you rubble device in
your

408
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,390
you're looking at your screen seeger
your typing along your your

409
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:10,590
email arm how how annoying would it be
that if you're in email your typing a

410
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,270
message

411
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:14,780
that Facebook will just pop up in front
and I would free knowing

412
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,480
or your your e-commerce application we
just heard a pop up in steal your focus

413
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,690
they be extremely annoying but you can
do that with Android I mean it's still

414
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:22,240
that you can

415
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,170
it's a legitimate apart are the STK you
actually in US you can create

416
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:29,840
logic within an application it says if
person is running

417
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,160
except location in the foreground put
another application into the foreground

418
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,380
and so do you think that scenario you do
things like credential stealing comin to

419
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,230
demonstrate that section 10 the demos a
half

420
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:44,210
are but we we demonstrate this adapter
19 on the search show this phone ability

421
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,520
on we submitted this to Google file this
for the you know full

422
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,740
full responsible disclosure process and
it's a Google they

423
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,890
on the they said yes we think is the
problem we're gonna put it into

424
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:58,130
are you know assertive larger system I'm
wherever they use to track bugs

425
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:01,670
and basically this they said they went
away for three weeks they then came back

426
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,260
as anyone have a phone call

427
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,580
had a phone call with this was so great
that you get tested out what to do to

428
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,550
prove a concept that you you know yet
what we see the problem

429
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:13,980
on but we can't fix it why can't you fix
it he said well as a feature

430
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:18,210
love a Mandrake on their switch in
applications using that functionality

431
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,740
and if we decide to kill it

432
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,090
its gonna break all those applications
so it still exists it actually

433
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:27,190
on you know I've you 22 running in this
happen anywhere but it does run

434
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,960
work in jelly bean on this the same
portability so you and user

435
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,840
could be sittin are using your online
banking account knowledge suddenly

436
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,290
loggins Frank pop up this as long as
your online banking account in

437
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:40,750
99.9 percent then users out there are
gonna type in a credentials and have a

438
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,950
scratch or shipped off to a

439
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:46,220
of 20 Thacker drive some demoss

440
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:50,000
Sony on let me jump into some demos here
this story when you pray for prey to the

441
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,790
demigods

442
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:54,490
on so its first demo start this up

443
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:58,650
and I'm gonna give props out too long to
Josh crimes week is in the audience

444
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,860
up so I've been giving on the steps to
talk for a while

445
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,960
comment one other demos I thought was
going a little stale sweitzer challenge

446
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,980
harassed Josh home to you are to

447
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,090
civic come up with something on more
interesting than what I was showing and

448
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:12,850
so he actually

449
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:16,470
went and we had a copy of in spy up for
Android

450
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:20,260
regular fit with inspires after curfew
you so

451
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,450
so fence by is a commercial basically

452
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:27,670
spy application you actually go there's
a legitimate company out there

453
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:31,210
was some religion and you can go and you
can pay them money and by this

454
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:34,490
by this malware and then go deployed on
people's devices and you can you do

455
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,110
things like

456
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:38,500
arm listen in on the microphone sort of
you you can record

457
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,100
calls you can get the SMS matches you
basically do whatever you want under

458
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,690
device

459
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:46,420
is that got it on your phone you'd be no
you've been a lot of trouble ready BLT

460
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,650
well-versed communicant role in this
field and learn everything about you

461
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:53,880
and what you're doing is you're doing it
so so Josh went in we got it we got a

462
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,700
copy of this

463
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,500
I'm it's running on this device into
work the at if we don't have all the

464
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,200
functionality sorta fully working we're
still digging into this

465
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,820
mom if you wanna learn more details on
it we just posted this morning

466
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:08,510
arm we just put into our block and so
there's actually more granular details

467
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,780
and I'm even gonna go through here

468
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,840
number one other interesting to talk to
show you is that

469
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,020
there was a configs there's a configure
actor in the ATK

470
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:20,010
inside the configs rectory there's about
a hundred om files within their

471
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:23,510
and you look at all those files there 0
bytes in life their spirits are bytes in

472
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:24,220
size

473
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:28,080
is basing look there's nothing in there
and so on Josh was was

474
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,290
was digging around in actually I'm found
out that there is actually

475
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:35,130
arm there's actually data in the headers
all those files

476
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:38,910
and if you take all those files and you
we combine them you actually can park

477
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:39,570
unfit

478
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:43,240
and so on so much bigger ones on these
so his commands here

479
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,330
and you can see this is like the hex
dump on that configured you can see some

480
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:48,990
strings are you can see to rise there
you can see me

481
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:52,490
so it looks like a phone number an IP
address in that configure that still

482
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,630
doesn't really help us

483
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:58,500
and so on so we go here no will reduce
when extract that again intro to a

484
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,720
a file and then we're gonna go

485
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,200
on and Josh 110 and wrote a

486
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,500
toward actually parts that can fix we
actually can see what's going on

487
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,620
so this actually parses the configs
sorta been readable format

488
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,730
as we can stroll back here in C you can
see things like on

489
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:18,440
more Trojan ID is derived so whoever
created this version

490
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,600
expense by actually put that in there on
you can see there's a call phone number

491
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,950
there's com there's there's other
information here as well

492
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:30,810
for all stored in here less adult user's
IP addresses for the target gateway

493
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:33,910
om IP address stored in there as well so
this is the pretty interesting this was

494
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:34,270
actually

495
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:37,440
near that the configs that restored in
these files with that was pretty sweet

496
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,440
we see a lot of now where we had seen
something similar before

497
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,640
arm that they would actually go through
that way to try to hide that can fake

498
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,530
are in any other thing to show is that
one when the malware start-up Miller's

499
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,520
running here that you run the services

500
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,200
on the Android device I one hours
running when it first starts up

501
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,550
it actually goes and send some data out
over SMS as well

502
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:59,750
so he has sort of to commit to channels
above

503
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:04,420
up command African air controllers
communication use as a mask and over IP

504
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:08,380
and so when it sends things are over on
over as a mass it sends these be 64

505
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,200
encoded

506
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,760
our messages to actually have on I see

507
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,320
show you what that looks like as well on
this with those messages look like

508
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,600
on we thought was pretty interesting
that they actually spell Android wrong

509
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,760
arm in their messaging its and read

510
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,160
or whether he would pronounce that are
but then you also have things like um

511
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,640
Mobile country code mobile networks
latitude and longitude because a run in

512
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,700
the emulator of the season to be
populated

513
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,090
on but some status codes and things like
that that sort of

514
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:39,190
map back to answer any other commands it
the that the command control me 10

515
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:42,970
things like battery life another other
information about the device

516
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:46,250
so then arm so go back here we'll show
you so then the other

517
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,820
other interesting is that arm we're
trying to figure out what are the

518
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,110
messages that sending

519
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:54,630
and we actually found out that actually
sends the messages using a yes

520
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:58,030
236 encryption Sowinski talked with many
control

521
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,770
on at spats pretty interesting most the
botnet on now where you see out there

522
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:01,940
doesn't go through that

523
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,430
level of sophistication in these as a
seller or something like that

524
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,480
so they're they're actually you know
very very guess concerned about people

525
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,630
intercepting these messages an arm and
the other other piece to note is that

526
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:16,510
arm there's just too static strings that
it uses in the encryption

527
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:20,590
and they just cant cabinets the on the
the Trojan ID on your to base initialize

528
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,940
that that encryption and use that

529
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,390
use that key

530
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:26,039
so what we have here is a as a listener
in this has been running since I started

531
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:26,549
up to

532
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:30,059
up the arm up to up the demo here

533
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:32,980
I'm you can see serve a heartbeat
actually I think I started up I was like

534
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,940
17 i think is what started this

535
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,799
arm in the snapshot armored every couple
other every 30 seconds or so it's been

536
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:39,850
sending this heartbeat

537
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:43,610
and the other thing that's pretty
interesting as you you could we know

538
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,090
what the two static strings are

539
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:48,110
on taking the on that device id: caton

540
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,840
those we actually can decrease the trip
checked the traffic as well as you can

541
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,690
see here

542
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:54,899
this is the arm this is basically the
traffic here's

543
00:26:54,899 --> 00:26:58,059
in uses using creditors the cryptid
here's the string D cryptid

544
00:26:58,059 --> 00:27:01,740
om and this year's actually what that
means if you sir translated to the

545
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,549
sortie the arm the the key that keyword
values and things that are being sent

546
00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:07,250
back and forth between the command
control

547
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:11,750
you say can you see the model targeted
ES Beltran you see device id: houses

548
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:15,059
emulator so it's not going to be there
subscriber ID our mobile

549
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:18,360
Bowl network code i think thats T Mobile
with that that represents

550
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,970
is an emulator dollar all the Android
emulators say their T Mobile

551
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:25,409
annexed East Atascosa very similar to
what was been sent arm

552
00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:28,110
over or as a mass but this is something
a heartbeat that is sent to the command

553
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:28,700
control

554
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,049
and onto the command control have the
ability to send things back

555
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:34,880
after controlling and we haven't gone
that far yet this is for a work in

556
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,470
progress

557
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:38,659
in fact I think this is you know this is
brand new posted a blog post on this

558
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:39,419
this morning

559
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:43,309
Armin josh Josh you hand them over to me
just two days ago

560
00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:47,850
says is this is Brenda stuff arm the
next thing I wanna show you

561
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:51,770
from adela perspective as for Disney a
scene that certification ups

562
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:55,590
love %uh really you know you mobile
malware out there

563
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,960
are it's basically like no back orifice
right to your back or something like

564
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,270
that from the 90's

565
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:03,940
are you that that has been but it's been
sold in being used by

566
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,659
arm by by by people who you want to spy
on people's devices

567
00:28:07,659 --> 00:28:11,010
the other thing on a show you is psalm

568
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:14,440
this polka stealing vulnerability and so
I described it to you

569
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,429
but I one actually show you as well sure
how dangerous it is an answer my mind

570
00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:22,260
if you think I've you're someone using a
mobile device if I'm walking around on

571
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,960
the street

572
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,320
and I go oh yeah I got a text message
for somebody I don't i've you open my

573
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,149
device nights

574
00:28:27,149 --> 00:28:30,640
to text message back and they are you I
want to update my a Twitter

575
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,669
om I want my Twitter account saying: on
head into this bar to try this new beer

576
00:28:34,669 --> 00:28:35,789
or whatever may be

577
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:39,270
and on the ice and then I put my phone
in my pocket and I pick it up and say I

578
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,770
wanna check facebook

579
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:43,770
touch Facebook and I look at it now
going to Facebook uncheck

580
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:47,610
my friends are doing I'm not sitting
there with the screen in front my face

581
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:51,510
at all times moving around you bring it
up if we've been around you put in your

582
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,070
pocket

583
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:56,700
and so arm display type: vulnerabilities
are things that are confusing are things

584
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,059
there

585
00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:01,370
for pulling your songs like magic point
smoking years over a are over over and

586
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:01,850
you sir

587
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:04,789
are very dangerous much more dangerous
in the mobile world on the on the

588
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:05,510
desktop world

589
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,740
so basically what we have here in this
demo is

590
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,200
said you so we have no said you could
gain you going to download this from

591
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,730
from say from the App Store on this this
version I've seen you

592
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:19,299
I would recommend you put on your phone
on it actually has an hour in bed into

593
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:19,600
it

594
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,830
common in our has that has that logic
that says if you're running

595
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:26,889
ap axe from a list absolutely we have
that in this malware

596
00:29:26,889 --> 00:29:30,260
then do something and so we actually did
is we took arm

597
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:34,179
some popular applications took the AP
case extracted the graphical on it

598
00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:38,789
in the AP case and reassembles widget
looking actually pixel perfect

599
00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:42,100
login screens for popular applications
for now if you have this

600
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,130
if you have this device on here are you
have this this your plans to you

601
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:49,610
on you and you don't use you touch
Facebook and you're actually going to

602
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:50,220
see

603
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,299
out show it to you actually to see the
real Facebook spring come up

604
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:57,529
and then a split second later you'll see
in a fake facebook sweet pop in front

605
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:01,059
a login screen and when the end user
goes types in there username/password

606
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:04,389
where then Senate over HTTP of a web
server that we control

607
00:30:04,389 --> 00:30:07,429
that's running back here sum to show you
that you could see you know show it to a

608
00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:08,169
few times

609
00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:12,779
you saw that animation s this animation
its or possibly once in a while

610
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:16,460
on but I shoot again as a couple there's
another animation

611
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:20,740
you notice that works late in from the
right om sir show it you can hear

612
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:24,100
now you notice comment so you think will
know how many users

613
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,039
you would would enter their their login
password how many times you updated an

614
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:28,990
app on your phone

615
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:32,899
that used to have you may be persistent
you know accounts in

616
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:37,240
armpit forget your accounts on you i
just i just upload updated untapped on

617
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:37,770
my phone

618
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:41,820
the other day and it now ass with my
username password so that's normal

619
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:46,020
right so that people and in use like out
for now I Pasadena type it in Sony gonna

620
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:46,700
type in my

621
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:51,870
user name here type in my

622
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,990
my facebook password

623
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:58,119
it's not really my facebook password I'm
actually gonna Facebook account I did

624
00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:59,409
for a short period time but Scott

625
00:30:59,409 --> 00:31:02,899
um summit enter that in and I'll see

626
00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:07,279
he sits been sent to the to the web
server now any of course in this demo

627
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:11,240
we were like an unknowing P so now we're
just keeps popping that screen up in

628
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:11,799
front of you

629
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:15,169
are but in the real world user Rd would
be logged in to Facebook

630
00:31:15,169 --> 00:31:18,470
they gonna cook NE Cedar time line in
the six login screen they are okay

631
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:21,919
taken me very passionate summit get sent
off to the web server

632
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,820
and then dominant it goes away we'll ask
for it again we put any sort of

633
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,879
sneaky logic in asap just continues to
do the same thing

634
00:31:28,879 --> 00:31:33,289
arm but we also have arm have it built
in the things

635
00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:38,009
you know also can look for for the
Amazon om Amazon as well so you gonna

636
00:31:38,009 --> 00:31:40,299
click on Amazon it says have been your
Amazon account

637
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:44,019
I can go and type in sketching taking
curvature om

638
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:47,010
take this and

639
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,460
and

640
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,100
sign in

641
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,429
should Senate as well and you saw that
it went away and came back there so

642
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:58,019
thats example it's a review the cert
what I sorta see is very dangerous

643
00:31:58,019 --> 00:31:58,880
mailer because you're

644
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,039
your tricky and user on and it's not
your next not nest

645
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:06,799
not as hi tack anything interesting is
something like in spy on but to me it's

646
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,260
it's it's just as dangerous when you're

647
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,500
it which is used for its purpose nose
and uses would not know this was going

648
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,019
on

649
00:32:12,019 --> 00:32:15,120
on they would know which application is
downloaded to have this problem

650
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,100
and then of course you know you never
use a mobile EV is an all sorts not

651
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:22,029
anyways on they would have nobility
detect this problem it's all they know

652
00:32:22,029 --> 00:32:23,169
is that all accounts

653
00:32:23,169 --> 00:32:27,440
Facebook see their online banking to
replace else lol the council being taken

654
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,760
over and they can't figure out why

655
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,850
what's happening so the arm

656
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:35,720
another demo I wanna show you analysis
this is the one that

657
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,690
arm hopefully sort of prey to the
demigods I'll take a little while for

658
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:41,409
this to get set up the arm because

659
00:32:41,409 --> 00:32:45,230
there's apparently some jerk on the way
WiFi network here on the lake city of

660
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:49,149
Dr everybody so are we actually had to
go and grab what my father tried it

661
00:32:49,149 --> 00:32:50,559
tried everything working but on

662
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:53,970
so what I have here show so this is what
we submitted

663
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:58,880
me sort of specialist heartbeat still
running yes it is okay cool

664
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,970
arm so what we have is some this is just
a screen capture from this device it

665
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:03,720
sitting up here

666
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,330
policy Android device and basically this
is the application that we submitted to

667
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:08,929
Google

668
00:33:08,929 --> 00:33:12,639
on and Google accepted in publishing our
store we actually called SMS block

669
00:33:12,639 --> 00:33:13,429
blacks or

670
00:33:13,429 --> 00:33:17,010
on it SMS blocker some I was actually
touched

671
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:20,230
here on so it's SMS blocker

672
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:23,190
as you can see it looks like a generic
application you can go and you can enter

673
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:23,559
it

674
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:26,909
hit the posse gang are fine but actually
legitimately works arm

675
00:33:26,909 --> 00:33:30,500
and on and so we we built this
application and this is the application

676
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,769
it's dynamically

677
00:33:31,769 --> 00:33:35,500
calling back to a command control server
asking for for new coat

678
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,909
very similar to like you know you
Facebook actually uses Facebook

679
00:33:38,909 --> 00:33:42,799
um until they went to native
applications om the style ass

680
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:46,559
not sure what they do on Andrew today
competently Sun and read at the time

681
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,549
arm they actually create each game of
five in javascript rapper basically

682
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:54,510
and download all the content dynamically
so we're actually using that same thing

683
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:57,960
Facebook is doing to anybody whose and
you people have Android with

684
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,130
have Android devices that are have
facebook itself

685
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:05,090
we got a handful so basically what we're
doing here Facebook if they want it you

686
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:06,870
can do for due to do to you as well

687
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:10,300
they could actually get and it pushed
out code that unsigned

688
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,470
at your device have to execute on it
with the same questions at the that the

689
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:14,320
application house

690
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,490
so um Sony show you here so we built
this communicant rolling

691
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:21,929
so looks really nice in do we friendly
armor basically

692
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:25,100
which you can see here's this is kelsey
is hardly going

693
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,899
I'm have it set for every five seconds
we get this is dynamic I could change

694
00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:32,040
the five hours after 12 but for the Dell
purposes at San checks and if

695
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,560
said it for five seconds especially
checking it every five seconds and

696
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,230
saying hey

697
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:39,370
is right thing for me to do anything for
me to do arm

698
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:42,030
if you click on here on you can see
basically this is the information

699
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:45,090
sending over now it's any over that it's
a Google Samsung

700
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:49,740
arm it says love it tenet visited in
basically that's it so we go back home

701
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:53,379
and so now we can do is we can turn on
functionality

702
00:34:53,379 --> 00:34:57,710
we can say hey I wanna grab phone rekon
from that device I go internet on

703
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:02,150
and if you watch we see an axe in week
on

704
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:07,070
everything works sir prayed Democrats

705
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:10,480
now

706
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,619
you not so let's move that's turn on
something else here

707
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:19,000
I don't know it does it's not checking
it the one at work

708
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,120
okay

709
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,620
so let's see

710
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:25,369
me launch the app for a quick get it

711
00:35:25,369 --> 00:35:31,000
force check in

712
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,200

713
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,970
you saw that it was chugging along
inside stop funny

714
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:43,970

C

719
00:35:54,700 --> 00:36:01,700

00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,800
arm okay so court so now he go back here
you could see nothing's changed on the

724
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,900
screen rate still

725
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:23,310
showing up in and it's pulling down data
from the device and I went through

726
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,130
jumped the gun here to study everything
work

727

00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:27,050
see hopefully

746
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,470
now hear this

747
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:31,329
yet so it did put on photos that's a
photo I just took a couple minutes ago

748
00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:32,269
when I was in the arm

749
00:37:32,269 --> 00:37:36,049
in the exhibit hall there arms that on
this phone so you can see sort it pulled

750
00:37:36,049 --> 00:37:36,670
on

751
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:40,339
actually the phone number on it om Tampa
don't call that I'm actually won't go

752
00:37:40,339 --> 00:37:41,400
the SIM cards out of

753
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,270
outta

754
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:45,530
has been topped up yet so on but
basically you can see through that

755
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,540
through the powers out the such devices

756
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:51,100
other and this has been so really this
is a piece I'm hours running on this

757
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:51,630
device

758
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:54,680
I'm often actually asked arm in

759
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,740
and I demonstrate this people ask for no
is this this a

760
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:01,820
AV scanners detect this activity three
security suffered you can stall detected

761
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:08,820
activity arm to see here see what this
refresh

762
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,400
not

763
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,840
like ok error

764
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,290
suits gonna call in second sorry

765
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:23,819
3 display pic

766
00:38:23,819 --> 00:38:24,770
rejected

767
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:27,010
have been rejected

768
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,370
policy again

769
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:35,370
I could hold it up and show you

770
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:43,160
on Forbes

771
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:50,310
from this again see

772
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:54,040
three checked again a lot so let me on
so you can see lookout is running on

773
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,460
here

774
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:58,630
these people the former can see I look
out says everything is okay on the

775
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,370
device itself

776
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:03,350
so I'm so you there is now running on
there it sits it's been accepted or

777
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:07,080
its its candidates everything being OK
so there's a demo to have an

778
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,890
the other things so we talk about Mobile
Spy Mobile Spy Kids I'm focused doing

779
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:11,580
now where

780
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:15,270
in full swing by and won the
functionality that on we also can do

781
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:18,340
which is gonna be really helpful with
the screen the screen like that

782
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:23,520
we actually have the capabilities love
going and on and this hijack piece here

783
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,840
actually can type the URL in there and
the

784
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:30,110
the phone sitting break you would
actually just go to a URL the browser to

785
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:30,840
have to be open

786
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,190
a browser opens up just as you're out
any you're all I specify

787
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:37,780
and in the botnet piece here which I'm
not going to run cuz that'll set to rate

788
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,910
this treaty pretty quickly

789
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:42,460
I'll we actually put the capabilities
and know that I can specify a website

790
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,890
and have this device and a lot of
traffic just continues he said traffic

791
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:47,760
at website now a device its

792
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,430
myself one device infected with this not
a big deal right so

793
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,780
traffic should be life and that of on
but if you had a hundred or thousand

794
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:58,190
100000 devices running this army would
it could be a problem

795
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:01,880
so on so let's go back to the

796
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:08,220
she yeah

797
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,460
see if I can get this time

798
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,910
show you

799
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:14,140
rejected no idea what's going on but arm

800
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,660
so let's let's go back to the
presentation here so talk about the

801
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,140
future

802
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:20,350
sort things that were that's for
prediction type things into the sink

803
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,780
maybe live out there but some things

804
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:25,120
are are completely realistic are in fact
com

805
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:29,440
one earth Future sorta future I
predictions I put in here before I start

806
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,010
talking with Josh we pulled the

807
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:34,440
in spite him into the into the
presentation as well so

808
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,530
your so the future so we know attackers
are retooling their skills

809
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:42,310
right to the use the target regional PCs
they started those subs devices the

810
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:44,160
retooling the skills to target mobile

811
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,140
army other's pins 5e before was on the
mobile platform was on he was targeting

812
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:48,710
Windows

813
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:52,080
Tom they they've now move some
development efforts towards towards

814
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,410
mobile because that is interesting

815
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:57,920
and in fact it on PCs I would sort of
officially s is becoming more scale

816
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,570
than on mobile devices on you may have a
you know your PC may use word

817
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:06,130
on you may use me email client easel web
browser on

818
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,080
but on your mobile device with a lot of
other information a lot access to a lot

819
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,400
more information just from that

820
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,150
mobile device itself and also you know
devices agree more

821
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:18,760
becoming more personal so no you always
on devices sitting in my pocket

822
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,360
om you know that's that's close to my
person right Nike if someone to get

823
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,790
access to the camera in turn on the PC
my face right now as I'm talking

824
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:29,340
are but also wearable computing you know
they've been talking about that for what

825
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,070
two decades

826
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:33,580
on your Google has a whole team working
on that right the Google glass

827
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:37,890
on project on grass where he put glasses
on right you'll see things

828
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:41,210
should in your I'm in reality and
possibly in Iraq with that

829
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:44,870
in certain ways so things are becoming
more personal and then market

830
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:45,780
penetration

831
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,940
in user granted visibility through a
clash

832
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:53,280
on the way I mean by that is that the
more people you have in the world using

833
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,380
mobile devices

834
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:58,770
on you the dahmer the devices have to be
from an interface standpoint rights you

835
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:00,220
have to dumb down the interfaces

836
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:03,410
so that someone who may be has never
touched the computer before

837
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:06,650
can go to the Apple store and buy a
device and start using it and they

838
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,300
certainly don't want to see a
command-line

839
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,710
button someplace where they can get you
know typing Unix commands

840
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:14,850
on they certainly don't wanna see all
the soda pop up when I was coming up

841
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:17,580
thing about security issues the Islamic
a phone call me when appeal buy

842
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:18,410
something online

843
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:23,150
and so those things for the clash in in
some in also manufacture don't use the

844
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,110
break thanks a lot of the control that
you have

845
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:29,530
and these platforms on outta the box
without rooting or jailbreaking um

846
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:33,040
are very very limited see a very so if
something does get on those devices

847
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,770
you have very little limited visibility
into into what's going on so here's some

848
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:39,050
sort some ideas

849
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:42,670
comments of the future so these sconce
above a sleeper cell

850
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:46,330
now you know we we we see a lot of these
obligations been right now the mail

851
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:49,350
route that if you've seen them all now
are sometimes are it's just really

852
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:49,870
garbage

853
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:53,740
right the interfaces with really bad
sometimes the spelling is horrible as we

854
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:54,240
miss on

855
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,270
in spite a commercial product mix well
and read wrong so on

856
00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:00,440
but if you really wanted to you can find
a legitimate

857
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,140
software developer something breaks
really great you know popular games

858
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:07,760
and say here's a lot of money you were a
government or were an organized crime

859
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,270
group

860
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:12,510
here's a lot of money create me game
that is going to become popular

861
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:15,770
sure you pay in and also

862
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:19,390
and there's that there's the and I'm
gonna pay you extra you put malicious

863
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:21,230
functionality into that application

864
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:25,700
but give me command control that and
I've got not gonna turn it on

865
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:29,340
until it becomes popular so if you
imagine you know see this happen in

866
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,450
Angry Birds world

867
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:34,400
for a on sitting the birds that offers a
really evil and he said when you're in

868
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,720
the birds and everybody's phone

869
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,300
and then one day before the switching
its gonna start doing something really

870
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,050
really evil

871
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:42,410
are that would be real big problem as
how he once you're having Rehberg's

872
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:42,790
under

873
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:46,020
on a mobile device well half so

874
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:49,330
so that would be no half the world's
population with mobile devices Angry

875
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:49,940
Birds at

876
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:53,310
that becomes a problem so then if you
think about serb attack

877
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:57,250
it's targeting you for hundreds of
thousands devices its dynamically be

878
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,370
turned on and off

879
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:01,870
imagine the investigation imagine like
your company

880
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:05,630
and you're like are website is being
attacked you know it's kicking do not

881
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:06,110
attack

882
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,760
from the hundred thousand devices and
you track it back in its like in the

883
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,900
Verizon network on the AT&T network

884
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:14,410
like will have to stop this and you
called those was networks in a civil

885
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:17,800
you know all hitting and we don't know
there's these mobile devices

886
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,330
now it's gone freight stop and then
another then three weeks later it starts

887
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:23,420
up again in school for different IP
addresses cows

888
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:27,290
were for roaming around around the world
and then even if you were to get access

889
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:28,790
to see the carriers in your book it

890
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:31,830
Apple or Android to work with you to
figure out here's these devices what

891
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:33,400
application is on those devices

892
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:37,050
they may have hundreds have applications
on those devices

893
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:40,410
and many of those maybe in common so
it's because it becomes a very very much

894
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:41,890
fruitless effort to try to

895
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:45,590
detectors and x-ray stop it if this were
to happen

896
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:49,040
on the other piece others for future
peace and it is interesting actor wrote

897
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,290
up the slide in and Josh

898
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:53,400
came to me and said hey we have spy I'm
on Android

899
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,000
on this is sort of few words ultimate
spyware I think it's the plan on

900
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,440
people's device is able to read

901
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:02,740
email calendar as a massive photos
identify locations the devices record

902
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:06,170
audio listen even video from the device
om in fact

903
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:09,590
if you have a piece of mail now on a
device you can have a

904
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:12,620
very very targeted courted attack
against individuals see you an

905
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:14,620
individual like a CEO of a company

906
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:17,750
and you have this peace in our spyware
on your device

907
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:20,700
you can be the counter know exactly
where they're going to have a meeting

908
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,570
with another CEO of the company

909
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:26,030
talk about a merger you see that on the
calendar you now have access to the

910
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:27,410
microphone interview

911
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:30,480
camera in the photos and you could turn
that on you could download all the

912
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,380
information

913
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:35,040
on-scene experience they want to turn on
the microphone at 2 p.m. on Friday

914
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,730
because I know they're sitting in a
meeting with

915
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:40,460
with other CEO any record that
conversation so these are things that

916
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:44,250
you we don't really see that much a
piece in the wild army chief in spy has

917
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,210
that capability

918
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:48,490
but I would say next several years you
can hear more more about this on this is

919
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:51,310
this is an avenue where this world is
going

920
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:55,070
and then this is worse things get so
more like out there sorta bleeding edge

921
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:58,310
on my circle talk about personal
connections arm

922
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:01,760
so you can cause in buyer possibly cause
environmental

923
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,700
issues around devices right so I
actually you overheated battery and some

924
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,090
other devices start a fire

925
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:10,330
now PMP smell you know where they're
located there in the workplace or in a

926
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:11,900
car either in their home

927
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:15,080
and you already there battering the
phone starts on fire that's causing

928
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,410
environmental damage sort personal to do

929
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:20,480
digital connections on it so that no new
taxes that

930
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,630
could benefit actually I was giving a
talk at Def Con this year someone's

931
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:25,660
phone did start on fire in the audience

932
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:28,630
so I don't know if it was now or what
but an Android phone at least are in

933
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:29,020
fiery

934
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:32,440
during the carpet in Lex burst into
flames on that's actually gave me this

935
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,210
idea

936
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:36,480
so if you can actually cause thats now
even a rumor people know you have you

937
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,310
know there's a conference going on he
say

938
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:41,730
here's an application download it and
%um our in there is talk cuz everybody

939
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:42,580
in the audience

940
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:47,410
own sister and fire thats sponsor
terrorism right via mobile devices

941
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:50,540
on the other P pieces you can sort book

942
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:54,120
physical harm us he so that's right
buyer pockets causing physical harm

943
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:57,570
but imagine you could play things like
IQ for towns other sounds

944
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:01,490
short in the back from other listening
to music the causes nausea dizziness

945
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:04,800
on someone's device so that could cause
news people

946
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,410
was indicted in Sanaa since missus
bombing great on everything that wasn't

947
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:11,330
it use these items they would be really
confusing with the doctors at

948
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:14,340
second doctor can figure it out to go
back on it but under had fun

949
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:17,940
tropica great so on so they would they
would cost i love u all kinds of

950
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,060
problems in society

951
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:22,370
that was happening on and then the sort
of new other things is like bleeding

952
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:22,820
edge

953
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:27,000
10 years in 20 years as for big gains
wearable computing devices

954
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,380
you go and you put on your Google
glasses right and it has sensors

955
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:33,550
obviously probably going to be complex
answers and things like that

956
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:36,890
army record possum you to reach will the
sensors record brain waves

957
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:40,610
maybe there's some technology that could
use a certain Yuji arm single-channel

958
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:44,000
you g-sensor on brain waves body heat

959
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,060
it even says emotions and in in mail
that into the Mallory have going on at

960
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:48,880
the vice

961
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,910
comic-con for a very powerful let's just
hope that something from future ideas

962
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:53,970
and thanks

963
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:57,830
so thing ever three minutes left right
now so so conclusions

964
00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:01,010
so your mobile in my mind is restored
infancy were like

965
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:04,260
break the beginning of certain your
society using mobile devices

966
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:07,260
on but also from a tax perspective what
began as well

967
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,900
on you really silly to think that the
attackers gonna stop with

968
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,930
are building a to elect like spy or
something like that it's going to evolve

969
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:15,410
in its gonna get more powerful and

970
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:19,060
at work at Billys as these devices get
more capabilities

971
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:22,770
and then also the mobile platforms are
not doing a great job love leading

972
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:25,770
end-users general and users are even
advanced end users

973
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:29,340
insure the devices are in fact secure
that's a big problem

974
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:32,560
so many factors have to do something as
well and then

975
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,280
know these capabilities are these
devices Woodbridge Rex recall the

976
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,190
physical

977
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:39,230
and digital barrier on things really get
very interesting

978
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:42,460
as at Barrett's forget blended together
arm and so

979
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:46,530
and buy online and mobile can enable
greatness on for society's but awareness

980
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:48,800
of the sub these risks and the stress on

981
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,230
are very important as well so with that
some resources that you can visit

982
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:56,310
our blog like I mentioned Josh just for
a blog post this morning

983
00:48:56,310 --> 00:49:00,530
on on fence by so you can check that out
arm and then on policy on Twitter as

984
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:01,580
well

985
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:08,580
with that thank you

986
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,560
next guy coming up in about a minute I'm
going to be
