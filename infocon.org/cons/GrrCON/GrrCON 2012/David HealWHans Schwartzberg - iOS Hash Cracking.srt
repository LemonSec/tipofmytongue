1
00:00:00,909 --> 00:00:03,610
seem to have a technical problem already

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:07,520
a better okay good so has already done

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,759
good gay think the room filled out a
little bit are you have that effect on

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:12,469
people but

5
00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:16,309
was the gonna make it fun and it's their
loss you guys here to hear about

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,850
I was hash cracking who here has heard
about that before

7
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:24,119
joy and few couple alright so if you've

8
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,460
never heard it before it can actually be
pretty cool few had heard that before

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,189
but never seen it which is usually a fan
of people talking to

10
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:33,250
then arm it's actually a little bit more
entertaining

11
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,380
to the the actual arm objective for me

12
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:40,960
as a presenter is for you to walk away
with something that you can actually do

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,950
on your own so we're done here you'll be
able to do this

14
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,829
in your own world any actually walk away
with the cooler base knowledge a tool

15
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:53,719
but you can do any kind of like pass for
testing a pen testing environment if you

16
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:56,690
want access to this president the end
come appeared in your email address to

battery so

20
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:10,299

24
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,560
but you get the same here as one of my
coworkers like to put it

25
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,259
guess which kid is be a having the most
fun the one on the far right

26
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,070
30 got a little bit a libation any

27
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,740
and we can't forget the baby the evil
Def Con baby hacker attack in your WiFi

28
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,119
in stealing our secrets

29
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,080
if you were able to read this baby's
mind

30
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,990
this cute baby scanner

31
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,020
creepy looking also you can read his
mind

32
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,330
what do you think you be thinking

33
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,270
by my daddy's book a plug their

34
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,800
you can also follow anything that we're
doing with technical inner-city for kids

35
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,180
this is the book for kids about the age
of five to nine or 10 depending on the

36
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,679
development that would get them started
understand technology

37
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,940
as we know it really kinda low-level not
just click here

38
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,980
touch this slide that it's really more
about how things work

39
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,310
and I also have some copy so if you want
to sign

40
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,070
happy immediate the so post both so

41
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,239
originally when I started my career I
went here we heard

42
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,970
Queens College not the one in the UK

43
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:38,570
one actually Queens New York not to
confuse me at all with this guy

44
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:42,470
so

45
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,540
when I was a Queens College I thought
I'd become one of these

46
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,920
somebody that sit around enters data

47
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,880
generate reports solos on a career path
to get one of these

48
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,300
you guys know that is right certified
public accountant sometimes pronounced

49
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,160
certified

50
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,530
pubic accountant also the exam that you
would know as

51
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,260
can't pass again so I kinda gave that
idea

52
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,250
halfway through up passing that examined
decided to get one these this look

53
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,450
familiar to anybody

54
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,760
if you view up there certified Novell
administrator

55
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,870
right active version 3 so then I took
the upgraded

56
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,970
exam at the engineering then

57
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,599
Microsoft was getting popular so I
thought I'd get one of those they

58
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,450
started thinkin

59
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:30,099
vendor-neutral heard about County IA
studied a bit

60
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:35,040
got to theirs done so then I studied a
bit harder and I really wanted the

61
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,750
elite exam you letters by my name back
then

62
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,450
I got this one but I have to attribute

63
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,510
all my success in all my hard work in
the ability to focus

64
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,950
to this coffee mass quantities of it I
drink

65
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,780
hot a half a day easy

66
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,990
well okay should be no I live in Chicago

67
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,870
in case you can tell from my accent I'm
originally from New York

68
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,200
but in no way shape or form and my
fandom and

69
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,010
Mets fan so

70
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,330
you really here to more you here to hear
more about data and data protection and

71
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,860
how things could be stolen so

72
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,100
if you think back to the days %uh Cesar
people

73
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,450
kept secrets right simple safer we'll

74
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,720
and they wanted to try to keep them safe

75
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,930
so when the messenger was running across
the country food being prepared and then

76
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:33,160
you know when they're killed the enemy
couldn't read it when you fast forward

77
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,360
two thousand years

78
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,450
we have more secrets than ever

79
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:44,040
and they're not safe

80
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,080
so the environment that I set up for
this crack

81
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,900
it's based on a jailbroken program which
control you know what that is and if you

82
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,520
we're here when Nick for Coco's speaking
he also mentioned jailbreaking

83
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,500
green poison is what I use I have a a
really all iPod

84
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,550
got a limited budget so I can after work
with what I have I said this

85
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,129
jailbroken ipod

86
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:10,009
give credit to the folks at did use a
tool called

87
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:14,319
I tunnel which is also built of the USB
multi-plex a demon which is something

88
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,539
that's available it's free

89
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:19,839
again this is for you to rebuild this
environment your home if you want to do

90
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,539
get this information I will provide

91
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:24,830
you soon to sit there and scratch a lot
I know it's kinda just enjoy the present

92
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:28,589
I put open SSH on the iDevice

93
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:32,550
after it was jailbroken am also using
open walls John the Ripper

94
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,409
to crack the passwords so have you ever
heard John the Ripper before by the time

95
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:36,919
you're done

96
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:42,599
with with this presentation you're going
to be very familiar with it so let's go

97
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:46,499
jump into it but before I begin who
thinks by show of hands the jailbreaking

98
00:05:46,499 --> 00:05:48,580
is bad

99
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,190
be honest come on some people you very
corporate you think it's bad to put

100
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,750
policies me getting MDM

101
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:58,280
stop jailbroken devices going on your
network right you probably think they're

102
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,020
bad

103
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:04,310
maybe from a corporate standpoint

104
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,600
so here's how this crap works actually
pretty quick

105
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,860
the believe it or not to the environment
I have

106
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,790
the white window here I'm terminal setup
with a command to launch I tunnel which

107
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,340
is the USB multiplexer

108
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:20,220
to set up the I port on 22 open SSH

109
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,680
and then the local port of 2022 because
they already have 22 running and

110
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,750
to prevent a collision

111
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,860
on this blue window I have open SSH or
the ssh command for the client

112
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,190
to login as root with the local IP
address and then

113
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:37,409
defining the port that I want to connect
on

114
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:40,070
and then here we can use John the Ripper

115
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,690
so the first thing left to do in for
saving time

116
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,930
I just found out that I had a lot more
time than I thought which is cool

117
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,539
trying to go over and we want to go on
your break

118
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:52,090
for the first thing I do invalid
directory

119
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,560
you gotta love it

120
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:02,560
user s been local headed to get there

121
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,580
this is the beauty

122
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,590
%uh live demo this was set up

123
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:19,590
was work

124
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,240
there you go

125
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,320
smooth recovery so what US multiplexer
did

126
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,110
is it set up a TCP connection on that
for 2022

127
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,080
and I specified earlier is waiting for
device but when the device connected

128
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,570
you can see the ID for the device if I
was to have another phone or iPhone or

129
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:52,670
iPad plugged in

130
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:57,070
you would have a different ID it's
really actually a pretty cool to love

131
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:00,000
you do any kind a pen testing of you
doing in the mobile security in your

132
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,550
environment

133
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:05,200
even though I've disconnected I could
reconnect

134
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,740
and picks it up really nicely recovers
pretty gracefully and then we always get

135
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,130
the No

136
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:12,300
found back in blue window we're gonna

137
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,210
shell and and you can see over here that
the USB multi-plex

138
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,120
responded

139
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,080
now the first thing that we're gonna get
a password prompt to specify one who

140
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,289
knows the default password on a
jailbroken device you can raise your

141
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:29,470
hand blurred after I had no doubt

142
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:33,930
Alpine all over the internet it's not a
secret

143
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:38,469
let's type it in and now you can see I
have root access

144
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:41,890
it wasn't that hard to get on there but
we're really here to look at password

145
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:42,599
hashes

146
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,399
even to an alas with the present working
directory

147
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,589
when a cat at sea master password

148
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:57,240
course so we looking at here

149
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,370
is the hash password for root of the
word

150
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:06,370
Alpine we wanna backed out and prove it
out

151
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,250
so we're going to do that okay excuse me

152
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,260
is in this directory I'm using it to
call Peco

153
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:18,100
serpico's like nope had in this
environment for anybody that's not

154
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:18,810
familiar with it

155
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:22,490
have a file called crack test and you
can see a rarity

156
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,560
have a hash which is the reason the fall
hash it was on this

157
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,990
jailbroken device but now I'm going to

158
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:33,990
take this hash Apia a sitting here

159
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,189
make sure I got everything control

160
00:09:37,189 --> 00:09:41,180
X exit yes enter

161
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:46,029
to rate its over sick at Pico or sorry
kak

162
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:49,979
cat cracked yes

163
00:09:49,979 --> 00:09:53,740
there it is you guys see right here

164
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,790
so far nothing too tricky mean the
Alpine part some people get stuff done

165
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,860
but a quick Google search

166
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,680
find to know if I type in John

167
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,809
crack test how long you think that's
going to take

168
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:13,660
minute couple minutes kinda

169
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,680
C

170
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,250
it actually took no time at all

171
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,410
didn't that easy pretty scary haha so we
ask you again

172
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:27,780
is jailbreaking bad

173
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,620
am NOT an advocate to be the 1i have a
jailbroken device

174
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,640
I like having that ability to do
whatever I want to the device

175
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,870
but then again what should you do to
prevent

176
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,270
this from happening if you have used the
jailbreak

177
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:44,430
friends or family have been changing
default password

178
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,680
maybe don't have them install something
like open SSH

179
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,970
work the really need open SSH then maybe
they should change his password change

180
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:55,320
the mobile password to do something to
protect it don't leave it at that. the

181
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:55,870
faults

182
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:01,429
that makes you much more vulnerable

183
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:04,899
some other things like you doing here
but I wanted to just jump back now

184
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:11,290
into crazy

185
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:14,540
so now we're talking to John the Ripper
so the crack you can see that's pretty

186
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,500
simple wasn't that big a deal he was
using traditional DES for hashing no

187
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,860
arm and it didn't take a lot of time to
know how John works

188
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,730
is actually pretty cool that something
that you'll be able to take away and

189
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,940
then if you have any UNIX systems Linux
systems

190
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,560
Mac whatever your environment you want
to go on there and make sure users are

191
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,930
not using things like

192
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:37,110
dictionary passwords were simple
passwords are password with the year or

193
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,680
something that's easily get Sabal

194
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,720
on John's a good way to test that
internally I'm not suggesting that you

195
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,360
use this on

196
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,120
anyone else the system's unless they
hire you to do it so the first thing we

197
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,480
talk about john is a platform support
was routed

198
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,220
recently developed back for the UNIX
platform and since then because it's

199
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,010
open source now you'll find it on

200
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:01,030
all those platforms and I found out that
it's even available

201
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:05,120
on arm and right now

202
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,730
you want a bill like an Android

203
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,769
and testing kit you totally put this on
their

204
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:12,899
are one of the things you do on your
device

205
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,320
is use John with the tests which the
check out the benchmarks

206
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:23,530
so if it looks like this

207
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,260
little kinda run through

208
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:30,360
some the different algorithm and give
you an idea up how many cracks per

209
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:30,980
second

210
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,070
that would take with your particular
hardware there's no module here that I

211
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,329
could take advantage of the GP you ship
it if you have a Linux or Unix System

212
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:45,329
totally take a to take advantage abuse
and have the cracking go even higher

213
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,040
is also a really cool tool for John
called on shadow so you know that

214
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,420
for a long time over 30 years now the
UNIX community has had

215
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,180
it's the password file and in shadow
file

216
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,710
and the usually kept very separate and a
shout if I was only gonna be used for

217
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:13,279
system processes are you not suppose to
go in there touch it but john has a tool

218
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,420
work to bring those two together and
look just like we had on our iPod

219
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,320
so now you don't need to go in kinda map
it or collect the

220
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:27,440
the hash it'll put everything in and
juxtaposed for you

221
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,130
john also as a couple different crapload

222
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,920
there's a single crack Mona the kinda
getting a little deeper these the single

223
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,670
crack know the word list incremental and
the external

224
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:39,460
arm so the single crack mode it's gonna
be looking at information

225
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,680
about the user that's the fine what we
just saw on my

226
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,410
my crack has filed said route usually
will be something in there like may be

227
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,450
rude group the user name

228
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:53,150
a group that their in a path for some
other information I G cost it's going to

229
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:53,780
use that

230
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:57,390
to try and figure out the password maybe
the user name use their user

231
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:02,740
name for their password like that
secured the word list

232
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,130
is the dictionary attacks a Johns going
to use so it comes to the password I

233
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:10,320
lst file you can go through their on its
gonna have the most common passwords at

234
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,190
the top that are used but then I

235
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,330
you can even customize it and your own
words your company name

236
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:18,700
things like that into the dictionary
there's also a lot over the dictionaries

237
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,690
available

238
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,779
publicly absolute worst URL's some
West's

239
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:27,190
incremental is the way John's using its
preprocessor

240
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:31,130
tu brute force through any other
passwords that might have some kinda

241
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:35,000
like hypertext or your letter
substitution or things like that

242
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,819
so now you can go from the dictionary to
actually be real word

243
00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:42,010
and in really had a power through that

244
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:45,350
and then last one is the external mode

245
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:49,000
which means that you can even build your
own method there's this

246
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,060
arm the project which was the on

247
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,220
on chichi actual just go to the next
slide

248
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,790
be CoreLogic rules that came out about

249
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:03,580
two years ago and DEF Cana 2010 they put
together a password cracking

250
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:07,290
contest and they have some instructions
on their website on how to use

251
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:10,750
their own like password list in their
their mangled rules

252
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,310
so Trustwave or six

253
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:19,040
more correctly spider labs sorta working
on the project recently in the optimize

254
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,320
the

255
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,880
and I was talking to Nick last night and
kinda put this in there so few folks are

256
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,070
looking for something else

257
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,260
then you can use these rules also in
your environment

258
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,020
to the external mode

259
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:35,520
you can see it's pretty fresh if I go
back mean it was up to late last night

260
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,620
when I looked at it was like

261
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,550
nine minutes ago now look at it like
this was earlier out this morning

262
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:46,180
9 hours ago so it's pretty fresh

263
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,040
so the other thing I meant to mention
before the kind of structure this almost

264
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,780
like a a classroom course with the
introduction

265
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,680
the intermediate level in the advanced
so when you get the more the

266
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:00,250
intermediate uses of John

267
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,710
so when you're working with John

268
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,960
so you got really nice hardware yet

269
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,970
18 cars all these different Jeep use
running and you can crack multiple

270
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,190
sessions at a time

271
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:13,250
would you want john to keep track of the
sessions for you

272
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:17,420
so how do you do that you can give it a
session name and now the which is with

273
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,950
the brown hard brackets

274
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:22,090
now that you have a session aimed you
can even check status

275
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,740
a which johnnie where john is and you're
all set on

276
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,780
was by even putting in that on dash dash
status

277
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,630
just by running John in another terminal
session the arm

278
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,820
dash dash crack dash status is to

279
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,400
have John output any the passwords

280
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,790
he's already cracked

281
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:45,279
while still in cracking mode seem kinda
get some output in

282
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,389
see some progress right away here's an
example that

283
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:52,589
you can see in the command you run John
and then use dash dash

284
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:56,169
incremental if you just when John the
way I did its gonna go through all those

285
00:16:56,169 --> 00:16:57,639
different modes in order

286
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:01,040
so then it just gonna go to the word
list incremental cetera

287
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,120
to hear specifying specifically
incremental

288
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,529
provide the crack status of the crack
something tell us about it

289
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:11,490
and then the format and yet the format a
bit more with your specifying

290
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:15,299
our ride Ashar 1 and then the file

291
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:18,760
with the hash I like to use John
sometimes just tell me

292
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,929
what that hashes sometimes you look at
something specifically like the crack

293
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:25,169
contest that these guys are putting on
their website

294
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:28,500
I was just putting in a file a John look
at it and see what I can come back with

295
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,019
can you give me an idea of what I have
to do with her and a break into a

296
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:34,850
reverse it and that gives you the status

297
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:38,039
I was kinda had this this hash cracker
going on for a while

298
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:42,850
like a lot hours as a what is it doing
us like learning how to use John like to

299
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:46,690
the picture that I say the tax I just
accidentally hit the spacebar

300
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,500
as a college pretty cool so the next to
read the docs little late but

301
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,330
I saw that you can hit any key pretty
much and John will give you status back

302
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,779
which i think is a really nice feature
and even including like

303
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:02,320
contract status and estimated time it's
gonna complete see so here one point I

304
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,200
thought I was gonna finish right after
Christmas

305
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,559
but then it kinda reassess and figured
it's gonna be sooner

306
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,970
I like the the humor these developers
never

307
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:15,789
so you want to continue that crack

308
00:18:15,789 --> 00:18:19,129
when you look at the format name if you
specifically know what you're going

309
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:22,340
and what you're attacking you can just
specify that from the beginning at

310
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,869
settling John try to figure it out

311
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,869
these are some different formats now

312
00:18:26,869 --> 00:18:30,110
at the box John I'll give you a bunch to
work with

313
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:34,049
with in the community they've developed
it to are jumbo

314
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:37,139
so this is version 1.0 7.9

315
00:18:37,139 --> 00:18:43,809
5 jumbo jumbo give you sixty nine
different types of formats to work with

316
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:47,009
that's a lot so you can go against even
stuff on Windows

317
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:53,409
zip is even in their PDF here's a couple
URL's forward list is even into one in

318
00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:55,799
SourceForge its open source you can go
in there

319
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:59,330
download it if you pay for John they'll
give you a lot of these wordless and

320
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,230
even up to like 20 different languages

321
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,259
but then there's also some these
projects that'll give it to you for free

322
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:09,129
but that's the file password out a list
he is where keep the

323
00:19:09,129 --> 00:19:12,850
the default password list now

324
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:16,239
when John is in the middle of a crack
and it has

325
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:21,249
already cracked wanna the hashes it
stores it in a password outfile

326
00:19:21,249 --> 00:19:26,059
so when these developers put it together
I don't know what they were on

327
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:33,059
smoking but they if the extension a poot
nothing wrong with that

328
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,490
as I have coworkers in the audience arm
the recovery file so

329
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:40,920
when we talk about having multiple
sessions were even if you have your own

330
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,540
and a pen testing kit urge the device
like my laptop and I wanna try to crack

331
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,040
some password hashes and

332
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,440
it takes a while but I need to shut it
down work may be interrupted

333
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,310
so if you given a session name like I
did here with the so for Star Trek

334
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:57,250
is a recovery file you can pick up where
you left off so instead of having to do

335
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,150
it all over again and then wait the
number hours or days for

336
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:03,550
more complicated crack you can continue

337
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:08,060
and it's really nice the default is John
Patrick and you can look inside their

338
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:11,310
I can read that file I try to figure it
out there's not a lot of documentation

339
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,000
on it to be cryptic

340
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,190
but it's a text file

341
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:21,150
looking at a a few more the advanced
features there's some prefixes and

342
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,960
suffixes you can use me starting to
build remain a word rules

343
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,980
I so the prefixes would be pre are would
proceed with the up carried and then the

344
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,789
suffixes would proceed with the dollar
sign

345
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:35,539
you can see some examples here so if you
want to look for the year

346
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:38,809
the current year beef in the beginning a
password

347
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:44,330
that's how we do it so it's very
explicit if you want to look for the

348
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:44,919
year

349
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:48,500
at the end up a password like sofas 2012

350
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:54,260
well the way the preprocessor works is
it's going to look at the last number

351
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,720
first it's just the way it is you've got
to do year

352
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,840
backwards 2102 but you probably just
better off doing

353
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,130
arrange is in this way just covers more
things incentive the current year the

354
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,200
previous year

355
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,730
it could be the year they were or else
we might have to go back forty years in

356
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:17,300
one right for the rules for that

357
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,500
substitution for kinda fun because it's
gonna take a look at

358
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,620
a little asses the operator and then

359
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:27,650
X is what you're going to be looking for
NY

360
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:32,000
is what you wanna substituted with so
I'm an example here

361
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,530
love ESPYs a substitute the letter P

362
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:41,330
with the word opening hard bracket so
anytime that p is found in a password

363
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:44,309
insert the word open an example

364
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:48,230
password if that's the password becomes
open ass word

365
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:55,230
should usually get a couple chuckles
especially this

366
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,410
and then here's some other will so if
you're looking at you know you might

367
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,990
have some people are using hypertext you
want to substitute

368
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:04,320
he's victories are the letter R over
zeros and then the years just another

369
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,360
example

370
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,630
toggles a pretty fun

371
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:12,090
about just also known as character set
our character conversions

372
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:15,340
so when you look at them here's a
different options that are available

373
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,910
min ago johnny's way so you do like the
TN

374
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:22,000
it's going it's harmful the number

375
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,010
so than the number affect the letter in
the words or whatever

376
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,040
like yours three its actually the fourth
letter

377
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,750
because John Stark County at zero so in
the war for example

378
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:38,260
the word open will yield open with a
capital and a beer

379
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:43,470
another one is are so it's going to
reverse it but then when you combine

380
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,010
them

381
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:47,330
like rt3 it's gonna take

382
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:52,740
open reverse it and capitalize the 0

383
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:57,940
make sense

384
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:02,220
so then when you look at on shift so
when you look at big ask the show you a

385
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,200
little less before

386
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,210
it's like you're holding down the shift
key on the keyboard

387
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:11,429
so open written like this open 69

388
00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:14,270
becomes this so all the characters

389
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:18,230
which ship case but even the numbers
it's as if you're hitting the Shift key

390
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:23,100
and pressing the number

391
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,950
so big are is shift to the right on the
keyboard

392
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:33,950
so Queerty will yield work you

393
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:37,940
left shift is to the left it'll move
everything to the left on the keyboard

394
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,809
my left your life this so password

395
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:45,249
234 would yield as

396
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:48,539
or even out that what I want to show you
is that

397
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:51,809
the big he the capital P stays capital

398
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:56,320
it becomes an 0 and since the a with a
next to

399
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,380
caps lock not something in the alphabet

400
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:03,150
it stays a so maybe the busy

401
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:07,530
it's Nick fish next shift with Stacy and
then the other letters would move

402
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:11,770
accordingly

403
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:15,750
now there's other rules arm this was
about 25 minutes or so to try to compact

404
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,690
as much as I could

405
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:20,490
into that time there's a lot more stop
you can learn a lot more about John

406
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,240
online

407
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,850
really did not want to have to like come
here like regurgitate all that I just

408
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,000
want to show you the things you can do
with John

409
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,049
and somebody a kind idiosyncrasies how
to work with it

410
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:37,660
so here's some homework for you so this
is what my colleagues Graham Cluley and

411
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,610
he's going through

412
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:42,429
better ways to create password so if you
have your user population that you're

413
00:24:42,429 --> 00:24:43,549
responsible for

414
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:47,150
to educate want to make sure that
they're not making mistakes Graham is a

415
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:50,780
great video it's about four minutes or
so we're not gonna watch it now

416
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:55,720
but arm the URL is available here where
you could show to users are just go to

417
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,780
YouTube and type in sofas labs and
you'll see the video in their

418
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:03,280
great way to make more complicated
passwords that

419
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,000
John would just take forever to crack so
they become really irrelevant

420
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,850
la URL's don't write these down you want
this stuff up

421
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:14,179
just give me a cardigan email whatever
you like arm

422
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,130
and then I'll send you the link for
president as a lot more homework a lot

423
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,510
more things you can learn more about

424
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:24,360
have used Jeep used to crack passwords a
lot of fun stuff out there

425
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,600
and then lastly here's my contact
information thanks for sitting through

426
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,249
this

427
00:25:28,249 --> 00:25:31,429
notes the middle the day its kind around
time to get some more power

428
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:34,580
who got coffee or you know you need your
afternoon goes use

429
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:38,429
are if you wanna link in with me feel
free you can follow me on twitter

430
00:25:38,429 --> 00:25:41,960
I use LinkedIn so if you want email me
you can email me through LinkedIn

431
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,409
I'll be at the SE congress in New York
and Chicago

432
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:49,519
in October and November respectively

433
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:52,590
so on we talk about some other things
that this so

434
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:59,590
you know if you're around there see you
then thank you very much

435
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:45,720
seem to have a technical

436
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:48,970
already a better okay good

437
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:52,230
so has already done good gay

438
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:55,320
like the room filled out a little bit
are you have that effect on people but

439
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:59,150
was the gonna make it fun and it's their
loss you guys here to hear about

440
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:02,750
I was hash cracking who here has heard
about that before

441
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:06,980
joy and few couple alright so if you've

442
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:10,320
never heard it before it can actually be
pretty cool few had heard that before

443
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,050
but never seen it which is usually a fan
of people talking to

444
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:16,110
then arm it's actually a little bit more
entertaining

445
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:19,240
to the the actual arm objective for me

446
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:23,810
as a presenter is for you to walk away
with something that you can actually do

447
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:27,810
on your own so we're done here you'll be
able to do this

448
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:31,700
in your own world any actually walk away
with the cooler base knowledge a tool

449
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:36,580
but you can do any kind of like pass for
testing a pen testing environment if you

450
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,280
want access to this president the end

451
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:43,270
come appeared in your email address to
cart and email you the link

452
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:47,810
and I've already time now because the
battery so

453
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:53,150
if you don't know who I am you've never
heard me before

454
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:56,090
this is my name this is who I work for

455
00:53:56,090 --> 00:54:00,280
is what I do for them is my customers

456
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:04,900
a Family Guy I like trout my family they
can always bring with me

457
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:10,410
but you get the same here as one of my
coworkers like to put it

458
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:14,110
guess which kid is the having the most
fun the one on the far right

459
00:54:14,110 --> 00:54:17,920
30 got a little bit a libation any

460
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:22,850
and we can't forget the baby the evil
Def Con BB hacker attack in your WiFi in

461
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:23,980
stealing our secrets

462
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:27,950
if you were able to read this baby's
mind

463
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:31,840
this cute baby scanner

464
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,890
creepy looking also you can read his
mind

465
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:39,190
what do you think you be thinking

466
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:42,150
by my daddy's book a plug their

467
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:45,660
you can also follow anything that we're
doing with technical inner-city for kids

468
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:49,030
this is the book for kids about the age
of five to nine or 10 depending on the

469
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:52,550
development that would get them started
understand technology

470
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:56,800
as we know it really kinda low-level not
just click here

471
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:02,270
touch this slide that it's really more
about how things work

472
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:05,079
and I also have some copy so if you want
to sign happy you can meet me at the

473
00:55:05,079 --> 00:55:05,960
sofa spoof

474
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,789
so originally when I started my career

475
00:55:09,789 --> 00:55:15,839
I went here we heard Queens College not
the one in the UK

476
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:21,440
one actually Queens New York not to
confuse me at all with this guy

477
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:25,349
so

478
00:55:25,349 --> 00:55:28,410
when I was a Queens College I thought
I'd become one of these

479
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:31,779
somebody that sit around enters data

480
00:55:31,779 --> 00:55:34,789
generate reports solos on a career path

481
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:39,460
to get one of these you guys know that
is right certified public accountant

482
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:41,020
sometimes pronounced certified

483
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:44,390
pubic accountant also the exam that you
would know as

484
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:49,500
can't pass again so I kinda gave that I
D up halfway through up passing that

485
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:50,609
examined decided to get one

486
00:55:50,609 --> 00:55:54,310
these this look familiar to anybody

487
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:57,620
if you view up there certified Novell
administrator

488
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:01,730
right active version 3 so then I took
the upgraded

489
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:04,820
exam at the engineering then

490
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:08,460
Microsoft was getting popular so I
thought I'd get one of those they

491
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:09,300
started thinkin

492
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,970
vendor-neutral heard about County IA
studied a bit

493
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:17,900
got to theirs done so then I studied a
bit harder and I really wanted the

494
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:21,610
elite exam no letters by my name back
then

495
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:25,320
I got this one but I have to attribute

496
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:28,370
all my success in all my hard work in
the ability to focus

497
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:32,810
to this coffee mass quantities on that I
drink

498
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:36,640
hot a half a day easy

499
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,870
well okay should be no I live in Chicago

500
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:43,730
in case you can tell from my accent I'm
originally from New York

501
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:47,060
but in no way shape or form and my
fandom and

502
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:50,860
Mets fan so

503
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:55,190
you really here to more you here to hear
more about data and data protection and

504
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:56,720
how things could be stolen so

505
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:00,970
if you think back to the days are Cesar
people

506
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:04,310
kept secrets right simple site for real

507
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:07,580
and they wanted to try to keep them safe

508
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:11,800
so when the messenger was running across
the country food being prepared and then

509
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:16,020
you know when they're killed the enemy
couldn't read it when you fast forward

510
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,220
two thousand years

511
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:20,310
we have more secrets than ever

512
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:26,900
and they're not safe

513
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:29,950
so the environment that I set up for
this crack

514
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:33,340
it's based on a jailbroken program which
I'm sure love you know what that is and

515
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:33,760
few

516
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,390
were here when Nick for Coco is speaking
he also mentioned jailbreaking

517
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:42,350
green poison is what I use I have a a
really all iPod

518
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:46,410
got a limited budget so I can after work
with what I have I said this

519
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:51,450
jailbroken ipod give credit to the folks
at did

520
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:56,680
use a tool called I tunnel which is also
built of the USB multi-plex a demon

521
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,400
which is something that's available it's
free

522
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:02,700
again this is for you to rebuild this
environment your home if you want to do

523
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,400
get this information I will provide

524
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,270
use enough to sit there and scratch a
lot I know it's kinda just enjoy the

525
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:07,700
present

526
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:11,450
I put open SSH on the iDevice

527
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:15,410
after it was jailbroken am also using
open walls John the Ripper

528
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:19,270
to crack the passwords so have you ever
heard John the Ripper before by the time

529
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:19,780
you're done

530
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:24,570
with with this presentation you're going
to be very familiar with it

531
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:27,490
so let's go jump into it but before I
begin

532
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:31,440
who thinks by show of hands and
jailbreaking is bad

533
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,050
be honest come on some people you very
corporate you think it's bad you put

534
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:36,610
policies and you get an MDM

535
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:41,140
stop jailbroken devices going on your
network right you probably think they're

536
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:41,880
bad

537
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:47,170
maybe from a corporate standpoint

538
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:50,460
so here's how this crap works actually
pretty quick

539
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:53,720
the believe it or not through the
environment I have

540
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:57,650
the white window here I'm terminal setup
with a command to launch I tunnel which

541
00:58:57,650 --> 00:58:59,200
is the USB multiplexer

542
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:03,079
to set up the I port on 22 open SSH

543
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:07,529
and then the local port of 2022 because
they already have 22 running and

544
00:59:07,529 --> 00:59:09,619
to print a collision

545
00:59:09,619 --> 00:59:13,720
on this blue window I have open SSH with
the ssh command for the client

546
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:17,039
to login as root with the local IP
address and then

547
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:20,269
defining the port that I want to connect
on

548
00:59:20,269 --> 00:59:24,140
and then here we can use John the Ripper
so the first thing left to do

549
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:27,779
and for saving time I just found out
that I had a lot more time than I

550
00:59:27,779 --> 00:59:28,789
thought which is cool

551
00:59:28,789 --> 00:59:32,400
trying to go over and we want to go on
your break

552
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,950
for the first thing I do invalid
directory

553
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:38,420
you gotta love it

554
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:39,630
user s been local

555
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:46,630
headed to get there

556
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,440
this is the beauty

557
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:55,800
%uh live demo this was set up

558
00:59:55,800 --> 01:00:02,800
work

559
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:18,100
there you go

560
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:22,170
smooth recovery so what US multiplexer
did

561
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:25,970
is it set up a TCP connection on that
for 2022

562
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:29,940
and I specified earlier is waiting for
device but when the device connected

563
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:34,430
you can see the ID for the device if I
was to have another phone or iPhone or

564
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:35,540
iPad plugged in

565
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:39,930
you would have a different ID it's
really actually a pretty cool to love

566
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:43,400
you do any kind a pen testing of you
doing in the mobile security environment

567
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:48,059
even though I've disconnected I could
reconnect

568
01:00:48,059 --> 01:00:51,599
and fix it up really nicely recovers
pretty gracefully and then we always get

569
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:51,980
the No

570
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:55,150
found spectrum blue window we're gonna

571
01:00:55,150 --> 01:01:00,069
shell and and you can see over here that
the USB multi-plex

572
01:01:00,069 --> 01:01:05,579
responded now the first thing that we're
gonna get a password prompt to specify

573
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:05,960
one

574
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:10,150
who knows the default password on a
jailbroken device you can raise your

575
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:12,319
hand blur that great deal about

576
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:18,059
Alpine all over the internet it's not a
secret

577
01:01:18,059 --> 01:01:21,319
so its type it in and now you can see I
have root access

578
01:01:21,319 --> 01:01:24,869
it wasn't that hard to get on there but
we're really gonna look at password

579
01:01:24,869 --> 01:01:25,460
hashes

580
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:29,250
even to an alas with the present working
directory

581
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:34,450
when a cat at sea master password

582
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:40,099
course so we looking at here

583
01:01:40,099 --> 01:01:43,220
is the hash password for root of the
word

584
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:49,230
Alpine we wanna backed out and prove it
out

585
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:52,110
so we're going to do that okay excuse me

586
01:01:52,110 --> 01:01:56,120
is in this directory I'm using it to
call Peco

587
01:01:56,120 --> 01:02:00,900
serpico's like nope had in this
environment for any but that's not

588
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:01,670
familiar with it

589
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:05,340
have a file called crack test and you
can see here already

590
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:08,420
have a hash which is the original the
fall hash it was on this

591
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:12,810
jailbroken device but now I'm going to
take this hash

592
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:15,910
happy it

593
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:19,130
a sitting here make sure I got
everything

594
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:22,920
control X exit yes

595
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,990
enter to rate it sofas the cat peco

596
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:29,570
or Sarika cat

597
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:32,840
crack yes

598
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:36,590
there it is you guys see right here

599
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:40,650
so far nothing too tricky mean the
Alpine part some people get stuff done

600
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:41,720
but a quick Google search

601
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:45,140
find to know if I type in John

602
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:49,960
crack test how long you think that's
gonna take

603
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:53,050
minute couple minutes

604
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:56,520
kinda

605
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:59,540
C

606
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:00,820
it actually took

607
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:03,120
no time at all

608
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:07,280
it that easy pretty scary huh so let me
ask you again

609
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:10,650
is jailbreaking bad

610
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:13,480
am NOT an advocate to be the 1i have a
jailbroken device

611
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:16,500
I like having that ability to do
whatever I want to the device

612
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:19,730
but then again what should you do to
prevent

613
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:21,730
this from happening

614
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:25,220
if you have used the jailbreak friends
or family

615
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:29,160
have been changing default password
maybe don't have them install something

616
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:29,440
like

617
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:32,650
open SSH work the really need open SSH

618
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:35,750
then maybe they should change his
password change the mobile password to

619
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:38,730
do something to protect it don't leave
it at that. the faults

620
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:44,290
that makes you much more vulnerable

621
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:47,300
some other things like you doing here
but I wanted to just jump back

622
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:54,150
now into crazy

623
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:57,020
so now we're gonna talk about John the
Ripper so the crack you can see that's

624
01:03:57,020 --> 01:04:01,360
pretty simple wasn't that big a deal he
was using traditional DES for hashing no

625
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:05,730
arm and it didn't take a lot of time to
know how John works

626
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:08,590
is actually pretty cool that something
that you'll be able to take away and

627
01:04:08,590 --> 01:04:10,800
then if you have any UNIX systems Linux
systems

628
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:14,410
Mac whatever your environment you want
to go on there and make sure users are

629
01:04:14,410 --> 01:04:15,790
not using things like

630
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:19,970
dictionary passwords were simple
passwords are password with the year or

631
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:21,530
something that's easily get Sabal

632
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:24,530
on John's a good way to test that
internally I'm not

633
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:27,600
suggesting that you use this on anyone
else the system's

634
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:32,840
unless they hire you to do it so the
first thing we talk about John is the

635
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,310
platform support was a real

636
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:38,080
recently developed back the UNIX
platform and since then because it's

637
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,870
open source now you'll find it on

638
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:43,890
all those platforms and I found out that
it's even available

639
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:47,829
on on and right now

640
01:04:47,829 --> 01:04:49,589
could you want a bill like it Android

641
01:04:49,589 --> 01:04:52,640
pen testing kit you totally put this on
their

642
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:55,769
what are the things you do on your
device

643
01:04:55,769 --> 01:05:00,189
is use John with the tests which the
check out the benchmarks

644
01:05:00,189 --> 01:05:06,390
sofa looks like this

645
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:09,120
little kinda run through

646
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:13,830
some different algorithm and give you an
idea up how many cracks per second

647
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:17,930
that would take with your particular
hardware there's no module here that I

648
01:05:17,930 --> 01:05:21,180
could take advantage of the GP you ship
it if you have a Linux or Unix System

649
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:28,180
totally take a to take advantage abuse
and have the cracking go even higher

650
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:39,950
is also a really cool tool for John
called on shadow so you know that

651
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:43,270
for a long time over 30 years now the
UNIX community has had

652
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:47,030
it's the password file and in shadow
file

653
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:51,569
and the usually kept very separate and a
shout if I was only gonna be used for

654
01:05:51,569 --> 01:05:55,440
system processes are you not suppose to
go in there and touch it with john has a

655
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,140
tool

656
01:05:56,140 --> 01:06:00,280
where can bring those two together and
look just like we had on our iPod

657
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:04,170
so now you don't need to go in kinda map
it or collect the

658
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:10,300
the hash it'll put everything in and
juxtaposed for you

659
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:14,070
john also as a couple different crapload
there's a single crack Mona the

660
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:16,990
kinda getting too will be for these the
single crack know the word list

661
01:06:16,990 --> 01:06:18,540
incremental and the external

662
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:22,320
arm so the single crack mods gonna be
looking at information

663
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:25,540
about the user that's the fine what we
just on my

664
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:29,270
my crack has filed said route usually
will be something in there like may be

665
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:30,160
rude group

666
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:35,200
the user name a group that their in a
path for some other information I G cost

667
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,370
it's going to use that to try and figure
out the password

668
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:42,190
maybe the user name use their user name
for their password

669
01:06:42,190 --> 01:06:45,590
I could secure the word list

670
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:48,990
is the dictionary attacks a Johns going
to use so it comes to the password I

671
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:53,180
lst file you can go through their on its
gonna have the most common passwords at

672
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:55,050
the top that are used but then I

673
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:58,190
you can even customize it and your own
words your company name

674
01:06:58,190 --> 01:07:01,560
things like that into the dictionary
there's also a lot over the dictionaries

675
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,550
available

676
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:06,640
publicly absolute worst URL's some
West's

677
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:10,050
incremental is the Wii John's using its
preprocessor

678
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:13,990
tu brute force through any other
passwords that might have some kinda

679
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:17,880
like hypertext or get a letter
substitution or things like that

680
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:21,680
so now you can go from the dictionary to
actually be real word

681
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:24,880
and really had a power through that

682
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:28,210
and then last one is the external mode

683
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:31,859
which means that you can even build your
own method beers this

684
01:07:31,859 --> 01:07:34,920
arm the project which was the arm

685
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:38,079
on chichi actual just go to the next
slide

686
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:41,640
be CoreLogic rules that came out about

687
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:46,440
two years ago and Def Con 2010 they put
together a password cracking

688
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:50,150
contest and they have some instructions
on their website on how to use

689
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:53,609
their own like password list in their
their mangled rules

690
01:07:53,609 --> 01:07:57,170
so Trustwave or six

691
01:07:57,170 --> 01:08:01,900
more correctly spider labs sorta working
on the project recently in the optimize

692
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:02,180
the

693
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:06,670
and I was talking to Nick last night and
how to put this in there so few folks

694
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:07,930
are looking for something else

695
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:11,119
then you can use these rules also in
your environment

696
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:14,880
to the external mode

697
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,380
you can see it's pretty fresh if I go
back mean it was up to late last night

698
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:19,470
when I looked at it was like

699
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:23,410
nine minutes ago now look at it like
this was earlier out this morning

700
01:08:23,410 --> 01:08:29,080
9 hours ago so it's pretty fresh

701
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,900
the other thing I meant to mention
before the kind of structure this almost

702
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:34,639
like a a classroom course with the
introduction

703
01:08:34,639 --> 01:08:37,540
the intermediate level in the advanced
so when you get the more the

704
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:43,120
intermediate uses of John

705
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,569
so when you're working with John

706
01:08:44,569 --> 01:08:47,830
so you got really nice hardware yet

707
01:08:47,830 --> 01:08:51,830
18 cars all these different Jeep use
running and you can crack multiple

708
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:53,040
sessions at a time

709
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:56,109
with you want john to keep track of the
sessions for you

710
01:08:56,109 --> 01:09:00,279
so how do you do that you can give it a
session name and now the which is with

711
01:09:00,279 --> 01:09:01,810
the brown hard brackets

712
01:09:01,810 --> 01:09:04,950
now that you have a session aimed you
can even check status

713
01:09:04,950 --> 01:09:08,600
a which johnnie where john is and you're
all set on

714
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:11,650
was by even putting in that on dash dash
status

715
01:09:11,650 --> 01:09:15,489
just by running John in another terminal
session the arm

716
01:09:15,489 --> 01:09:18,680
dash dis crack dash status is to

717
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:22,259
have John output any the passwords

718
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:25,700
he's already cracked while still in

719
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:29,509
cracking mode so you can get some output
and see some progress right away

720
01:09:29,509 --> 01:09:34,850
here's an example that you can see in
the command you run John and then use

721
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:35,460
dash dash

722
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:39,029
incremental if you just when John the
way I did its gonna go through all those

723
01:09:39,029 --> 01:09:40,520
different modes in order

724
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:43,900
so then it just gonna go to the word
list incremental cetera

725
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:47,000
to hear specifying specifically
incremental

726
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,390
provide the crack status of the crack
something tell us about it

727
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:52,210
and in the format and yet the format
