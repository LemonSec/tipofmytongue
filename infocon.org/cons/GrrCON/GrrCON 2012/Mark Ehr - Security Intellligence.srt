10
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:38,530
um...

11
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:42,910
i am a product manager which means that
you know i basically own one of the

12
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,570
product guidance carry or political
cheerios

13
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,870
and i'll talk more about

14
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,300
my product will be the product love it

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,330
but basically where do today

16
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,820
but they live about me

17
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,590
but my background is

18
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,360
uh... dialect but i called gary stuff

19
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,160
and uh...

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,150
the scary stuff

21
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:04,699
is it was a great thing about being
provided and that we have rupa

22
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:06,689
researchers call exports

23
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:10,110
and whatever curve export

24
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,340
exports is is a record of issues uh...
butter researcher tickets maybe around a

25
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,370
hundred

26
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,590
them primarily

27
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,110
and they have you know if i could pick
my job

28
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:20,990
i_b_m_ i would

29
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,590
probably one of those

30
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,460
is what they get to do is

31
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,780
if they just kind of watch what's going
on

32
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,110
you know watch for the exploits vote
abilities in the coming out

33
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:34,840
uh... and the really interesting one
with meryl last year the cat was uh...

34
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,600
when we expect snap i'd years ago

35
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,190
this vice-chair was due to itni right

36
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,619
let's touch that came out

37
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:44,369
they uh... actuarial a capture a copy of
it

38
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:45,200
in the wild

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,780
bring it into the lab

40
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,179
and pick it apart reverse engineer
figure out how it worked in and

41
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:53,350
publisher bunch data on out work out
spread

42
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,990
but this one the coolest jobs building
it

43
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,409
so uh...

44
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:01,830
anyway for what experts does basically

45
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,859
the just

46
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:05,809
their kind of an independent work
position they do whatever they want to

47
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:07,630
be published the results

48
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,889
free arc

49
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:10,059
say last week

50
00:02:10,059 --> 00:02:13,169
we published the harbin your report

51
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:16,090
and i've got some interesting staff have
about uh... side

52
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,309
story out with

53
00:02:17,309 --> 00:02:21,209
uh... and that's the scary stuff so talk
about those little bit

54
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:24,939
they'll talk about how you i can
mitigate some that scary stuff

55
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:28,819
and it's not going to see much of a
sales pitch is another still guy in on

56
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:29,849
the becky

57
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,939
uh... but i really i want to talk about

58
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:34,679
out a lot of people don't really
understand

59
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:38,999
how much security idea does how meat
products we have

60
00:02:38,999 --> 00:02:40,959
now review can use

61
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,239
i'm just gonna wanna talk about them and
focus in on a few products like happen

62
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,709
to know really well

63
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:47,289
or but

64
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:51,149
and thought i had talked about that in
and uh... some real world stories from

65
00:02:51,149 --> 00:02:52,759
the stuff that we're doing with it

66
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,629
uh... of you'll find that

67
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:56,609
someone

68
00:02:56,609 --> 00:03:00,530
this we have a relatively i mean i would
say it's a small crowd but it's uh...

69
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,760
rope

70
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,349
if there are questions throughout you
know

71
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:07,340
sometimes people say well can you just
wait

72
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,589
all questions julienne

73
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:13,289
what i have presents really really
important that you guys questions are

74
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:15,869
well i don't feel that way so if you
have questions please feel free raise

75
00:03:15,869 --> 00:03:17,229
your hands

76
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:21,199
whatever in and i'd be happy that that
the trident requested this appeal take

77
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:24,899
more than sixty second thing answer i'm
eager for it to the end we could talk

78
00:03:24,899 --> 00:03:26,070
one-on-one but

79
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,759
and not by more than happy profession

80
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,700
part of my guy crown so its

81
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,999
it's kind of scary to say this

82
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:36,839
i'm in my thirtieth here in this

83
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:38,759
and yes i started yelling

84
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,879
not quite that

85
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,189
i will say that

86
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:44,799
you know i don't think about this this
morning one of the very first things

87
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,760
that i did ally was in high school

88
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,309
antoine very first things that we with
which are due notes in computer club as

89
00:03:51,309 --> 00:03:53,449
a complete all nerd and i still am

90
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:55,459
perky whatever the picture

91
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:58,819
and uh... thought over first thing we
did three wrote a keylogger

92
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:00,169
that basically would

93
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:02,959
at back these were back in the days when
uh... everybody district learn

94
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,799
programming on minicomputer

95
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,049
sort rumbles

96
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:08,259
thought being myself right

97
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:09,529
that we were a keylogger

98
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:11,099
which would basically

99
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,569
put up a screen that look exactly like
the login screen and when they were

100
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:15,260
tight

101
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,699
in their username and password it would
return the generic error message

102
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:20,560
and one

103
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,960
they're using the password

104
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,100
and then it would send them to the
normal login sequence so than they were

105
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,259
sad to say all ads must of missed i'd
define it

106
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:32,020
so we wound up with virtually every
username password for everybody in the

107
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,080
school including the future

108
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,629
i can go any further into what we did
with that

109
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:39,930
aliases in ninth grade

110
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,719
you know when i did that so a cabinet
hacker

111
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:44,139
most of my life

112
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:48,069
so i can understand uh... some of these
challenges maybe more than

113
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:50,039
but some others

114
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,889
uh... anyway so

115
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:55,409
got out of these go to college jappy
fourteen years a graduate

116
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:57,139
to those working full-time

117
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:58,330
and during that

118
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:02,500
that period i was a programmer so the
softball per for about ten years

119
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,729
absorbing the infancy of security

120
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:08,159
help people back then and maybe even
today you can make yard with a lot of

121
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:11,050
developers don't think about security
intel

122
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,120
aper

123
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,319
well that was really the case back then

124
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:18,370
you really skinny think about here

125
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,539
uh... so i did that for about ten years

126
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:21,830
and i moved into

127
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,890
kind of uh... huh

128
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,930
insulting i thoroughly did support for a
while you may cancel thin

129
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,360
uh... point from that my own company for
five years and see if you know they're

130
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,659
and moved into the system management
here d at that point

131
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:35,400
uh... we've been also um...

132
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,710
industry analyst who work for an
apartment associates for about four

133
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,660
years and security area

134
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,380
at that point i moved into uh... won't
work for a little cubby of temple big

135
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,539
fix

136
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:48,410
which i've got whereby the employer
taiwan f

137
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,610
you provide the m

138
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,539
i wasn't and required outfit pollock

139
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:57,349
uh... that was a couple years ago in and
uh... justice bago removed from

140
00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:01,150
uh... big expert over into he won last
spring

141
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:05,879
bust my back

142
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,249
i love this picture

143
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:10,379
labig halloween guy itself field the
season

144
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:15,180
howland stuff we will begin to the
presentation here and there

145
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,690
let me talk a little bit rope with that
idea itself

146
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:18,879
you think about it

147
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,580
i_b_m_ was one out of it not be first
company who cover

148
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,169
make security foc

149
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:28,509
they think that mainframes

150
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:31,170
productive at like the nineteen sixties

151
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,659
you had to have security mainframe

152
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:37,350
right so i was kinda genesis of a lot of
the research

153
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,270
that i_b_m_ has been doing all
throughout the years

154
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:44,800
door looked inept forty fifty years
maybe of security backtrack

155
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,030
but most people don't think about him as
a security company

156
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,719
because i've been never really marketed

157
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:52,599
itself that way

158
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:54,970
and so what happened earlier this year

159
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,289
that somebody

160
00:06:56,289 --> 00:06:57,929
much higher than me

161
00:06:57,929 --> 00:07:00,939
dot a bright idea say well you know what
we should police are telling people

162
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:02,849
about what we do

163
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:03,699
itself

164
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:05,119
that's where

165
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:08,649
this term security intelligent came from
you got a call it something right i

166
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:09,850
don't particularly

167
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:14,270
like secure intelligence it's not bad
you got caught something so but for

168
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,060
security tell kids came from

169
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,650
since just the concept of

170
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,810
you need it you know if your company
like i_b_m_ we literally have

171
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,280
hundreds of security absence of products

172
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,690
that you can use what the different ways
yes or

173
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,069
thoughts what security don't

174
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:29,709
uh... it is a platform

175
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:33,129
and we are actively working on
integrating a lot of those pieces in the

176
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:35,799
platform i'll talk a little bit about
that later on

177
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:38,860
but um... bugs went give you a little
introduction to

178
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,720
you know it and get to thinking about

179
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,250
allied e_m_ uh... really has been
involved in a lot of the security

180
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,699
innovations over the years

181
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,759
heart posted on the scariest

182
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,669
for the mention this to stop it comes
out of exports

183
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:52,619
and uh... this

184
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:55,639
report is freely available you can
download it on the web

185
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:01,509
just gota ibm dot com slash security
find report out there

186
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:03,030
before i do that though

187
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:06,909
let's talk a little bit bout one of the
source of a lot of of the exploits and

188
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:10,590
and security issues out there meant is
that a lot of people go about their

189
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,819
day-to-day

190
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:13,110
existence

191
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:17,279
without ever taking about security we
shouldn't be a real

192
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,830
like my mother

193
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,560
my mother's always out

194
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,259
surfing the web in anytime she gets an
operative download some kind of utility

195
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:25,740
she download

196
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,289
so

197
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:28,969
i wind up rebuilding her machine about
every three

198
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:34,040
that she's just got all something on
them

199
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,599
and so you know it's abyss that are
information security professionals

200
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,780
sometimes

201
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,019
go about our lives without actively
thinking about security

202
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:44,400
and just think about what it looks like
a usb key

203
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,530
for example

204
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,980
you know expect that in your machine

205
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,460
who knows you know you copied my copy
confidential stuff on there that could

206
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,660
get lost

207
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,089
you know you might be

208
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:58,840
accidentally infecting the machine you
know what else stocks net spread

209
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,610
one of the backers

210
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,660
the point is

211
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,550
i love this

212
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,290
illustration

213
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:08,710
they blew their dug out the about
security

214
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,640
avid secret twitter bumpers

215
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,750
uh...

216
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,810
all right so

217
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,260
let's talk a little bit about the
expert's reports the last year exports

218
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,270
need twenty eleven the year of the
breach

219
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,780
and that was because of

220
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,420
very very many

221
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,180
hi the bility

222
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,020
hiking pack

223
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:32,120
reaches like the sony playstation the
bahcall from mark right

224
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,239
all these these very very large

225
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:36,970
things that have been part of that was
the fact that these

226
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:37,860
breaches

227
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,970
you know the whole

228
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,420
uh... profile of these bridges strategic

229
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,780
it used to be you hackers where you know
i clicked when i was

230
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,040
up through the ranks

231
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,519
uh... you know hacks were

232
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,840
auto refer

233
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,170
bragging rights

234
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,749
college kids content high school kids

235
00:09:56,749 --> 00:09:59,500
and i just wanted a place that you know
i could do this

236
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,630
through the streets of the deceased this
website but i'm not going to do anything

237
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,320
well so that we don't know

238
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,570
the nature

239
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:11,830
breaches becoming much more serious
because there are serious

240
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,790
financial gains to be realized from

241
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,970
so that's where

242
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,390
term h_d_t_v_ have persistent threats
came from

243
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,350
now where you've got beat increasingly
these

244
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:27,310
very well-funded highly technical
tightly naked teens that are

245
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,160
developing now where

246
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,410
specially for financial gain

247
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,260
so thats

248
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,020
tough part where that came from

249
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:38,860
uh... and interesting things to like you
know didn't like the eddie's

250
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,650
weekly all preach about passwords

251
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:45,020
and the need of changing passwords
analyst all it's worth it

252
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,580
to doctorate indications becoming more
more commonplace

253
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,440
now there's some really interesting work
on on more innovative ways of doing to

254
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,440
factor

255
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,280
uh... you know like uh... wheeled out of
the presentation

256
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,950
uh... later on were you burke you can
talk about

257
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,620
using your gate

258
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,590
right sue tied in a fight

259
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,760
it's a little kids interesting stuff
going on

260
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,010
but what's happening is because of

261
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:11,280
uh... it rapidly dancing social
engineering tricks loose data protection

262
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,390
policies

263
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,640
you know that uh... that still

264
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,890
really really easy

265
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,850
to find past

266
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:18,859
you know uh...

267
00:11:18,859 --> 00:11:20,569
think it was two years ago

268
00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:21,630
depan

269
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,960
they have my three years ago that patty
a contest

270
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,030
where they basically have cash prize

271
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:31,780
to the team that could cracked most now
half toward if it wasn't a forty

272
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,510
eight-hour here

273
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:37,010
and a winning team with a pretty good
prices like ten grand something like

274
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,370
that

275
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,870
if memory serves the the winning team

276
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,240
uh... cracked

277
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,400
it was fifty thousand half decrepit
forty thousand

278
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,589
these were all passwords that were
created

279
00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:52,999
using industry standard best practices
they weren't just deliberately some

280
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:54,740
awards fluently easy

281
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,990
these were all kind of

282
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,590
mixed case symbol what stuff

283
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,980
so you know i could talk for an hour
just on

284
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,560
after a policy

285
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,020
the point is that

286
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,900
nearly two packs are getting much much
more sophisticated

287
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,280
like this one here they've talked about
is really interesting where they

288
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,440
bypassed

289
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,300
they two separate education

290
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,260
scheme by basically calling up the
mobile phone provider

291
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,790
and acting stupid or said

292
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,680
i forgot my password you you reset

293
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,340
fully allow them to reset their

294
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,859
other voicemail password

295
00:12:24,859 --> 00:12:26,809
within allow them to get into

296
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:30,940
y'all voicemail and pull all kinds of
interesting data about that individual

297
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,650
which download

298
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,120
weldon you uh...

299
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,320
uh... hacked into their their identity
get their data

300
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,550
so in terms of actual attacks

301
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,870
for three point jack should remains a
top web attack

302
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,420
that should be ex-prime

303
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,310
what is really interesting

304
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:50,020
is that we also have prostate scripting
directory traversal

305
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,520
f separate attacks but they're also
beginning to being used yet

306
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,030
right so um...

307
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,430
here like over fifty one percent of all
the webapp

308
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:01,309
boulder billy's are classified as cross
site

309
00:13:01,309 --> 00:13:02,460
and a lot of them

310
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,730
as i mentioned

311
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:08,770
are her company graph

312
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,300
writes on turns up so what

313
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,910
exports does is out they have some
really interesting techniques for for

314
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:19,350
gallery all this data wanna techniques
on talkback minute but it's called uh...

315
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,690
basically we have a dark net

316
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,070
buttonwood park

317
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,109
for darkness is a series of

318
00:13:25,109 --> 00:13:27,959
of inactive i_p_ addressed nothing
running on them

319
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:31,700
there never has been anything running on
divide implement forever

320
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,560
there about twenty five thousand of them

321
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,510
never served

322
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:38,120
and basically so if someone is poking
around inside of that dark narrow most

323
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,199
likey addresses

324
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,269
they're up to no good because there'd be
no legitimate reason that anybody would

325
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:44,480
ever try to access

326
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,720
sobai mantra net dark net we can look at
all kinds of interesting

327
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,789
uh... in

328
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:54,370
look at like the signatures and big
people what people are doing

329
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,550
funny way from

330
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,599
from our research data showing to aruba

331
00:13:57,599 --> 00:13:59,970
the top high-volume signatures a of

332
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,090
of the exploits the darker

333
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:04,660
we also purse being i_b_m_ we also have
a

334
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,510
huge manage service uh...

335
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,480
practice

336
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,650
a lot of that is manage security which
carry our priest in center of all of the

337
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,339
world

338
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:15,940
we managed networks for many many
customers so we can also

339
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,080
leverage the data

340
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,459
collected megan non let's leave it

341
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,299
picking like that data from those
networks which gives us a really

342
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:24,670
interested viewpoint

343
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,690
into all the exploits attempted went
that route

344
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,860
so anyway which can see here is uh...

345
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,280
hannibal listen going downward so as i
mentioned sequel injection is

346
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,810
is the top wine you know

347
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,579
interestingly sequels glamour still out
there

348
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,100
number two

349
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,320
this just shocked me

350
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,840
a physical farmers bike ten years old
now

351
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,450
but it's still out

352
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,580
and nobody seemed to really know walk

353
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,109
no i think i can think of his

354
00:14:50,109 --> 00:14:53,699
yet because there's so many wanted
biggest challenges we all base

355
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:55,890
is keeping machines patched

356
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:59,069
right you've got shane stant got a very
difficult

357
00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:01,490
time sometimes happy machines

358
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:04,300
and you've got over machine in some
cases like i was just talking to

359
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,410
somebody so that they just discovered

360
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,820
uh... i think it was a winded and he

361
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,700
breyer member windows n_t_

362
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,300
uh...

363
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,460
doubt me too

364
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,940
they discovered a windows n_t_ box
running on their network and nobody

365
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,290
touched it in years they forgot it was
even there

366
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:24,290
so obviously and then patch so that we
have perfect ill host for

367
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,680
for all sorts of malware

368
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,400
i think that may be part of it is just
alder on couch machines that people are

369
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,240
for gotten about artist

370
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,580
whatever update

371
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,130
say that those people slammer still
around although they are they do say

372
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:40,370
that it's trending down it will probably
go away next

373
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,380
yourself

374
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,609
altman's but it was really interesting
this

375
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:47,540
p_s_ exact service access to nazi

376
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,060
uh... actually answer the real school
that microsoft

377
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,120
feltham so i could be given away

378
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,530
that's a systematic invalid units
estimation administration tool

379
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,670
or what happens

380
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:01,470
so it basically allowed you to remotely

381
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,340
execute services on a machine

382
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:08,490
the problem of course is that if you put
this on a machine and you can exploit it

383
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,230
for a week house were

384
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,359
you braithwaite

385
00:16:11,359 --> 00:16:14,730
you can do anything you want g

386
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:16,530
interestingly

387
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,129
a lot of that traffic course

388
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:20,290
could be a legitimate but a lot of it

389
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:25,430
that we're seeing on the open internet
it's probably people you know exploited

390
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:28,600
well that's one thing but what they are
on your network

391
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,470
if you can track army people using that

392
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:35,640
and uh... if it should be a she did not

393
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,030
now we've got the uh... beget dot dot
data exploit that's when the directory

394
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,630
traversal exploits

395
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,540
where uh... basically in uh...

396
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,810
gain access to

397
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:49,920
ill for a malformed man indeed an access
to all files that are on the web server

398
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,640
uh... fight

399
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,820
truett traversing the directory so that
was pretty popular

400
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,420
again sometimes those are combined with
a sequel injection in the crops like

401
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,690
scripting

402
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:03,400
uh... across sites been around for a
while

403
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,990
and then the rest of the user hannah

404
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,760
down there to so you know the s_ and p_
crap

405
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,980
uh... brute force attacks

406
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:16,390
and so on

407
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,679
so this is interesting to so what what
we did

408
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:20,610
here is we took a look at

409
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:24,150
the cross site scripting events and this
is starting laughter and going up

410
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,220
through june of this year

411
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:31,140
as well as the sequel injection of
infamous or applauded a moving average

412
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,630
this shows that first of all they're not
going down there bulk going up

413
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,789
plus this local both limits is very
similar

414
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:39,850
we still do that they're both very
active

415
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,500
both growing in the book growing at
about right

416
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:49,500
in are that needed because they're both
being used together

417
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,770
so interestingly so these are the bone
really disk

418
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,919
disclosures broke so in other words even

419
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:00,470
he publicly disclosed overbilling

420
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:04,669
uh... typically don't come from in
software vendors and so on

421
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:06,539
they wait in two thousand eleven

422
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:09,580
we're talking about well it's really
it's gone down some

423
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,870
you know went down

424
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:14,539
from uh... you know i've about nine
thousand body about

425
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:16,700
you know maybe vol fifty percent

426
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,610
so we're hoping that that was going to
be uh... downward trend will turns out

427
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:22,880
it was just a a anomalous

428
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,510
as it's back up again this year looks to
be

429
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:31,630
continued creek

430
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:35,520
right so this is the uh... growth of
obfuscation techniques

431
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,659
i know what that is

432
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:40,440
i'd agreed-upon together with exact
truth there talked about

433
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,160
this is now where which is using active
obfuscation techniques to disguise

434
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,200
itself

435
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,450
so that things like

436
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:50,669
uh... i'd yes and i d hean and us in
price

437
00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:52,450
do act

438
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:56,050
so that that involve doing things like
encrypting itself

439
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:59,490
using uh... s_s_ uh... whatever it might
be so that

440
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,040
uh... you know so it doesn't trigger

441
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,059
trigger that the ever work

442
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:07,710
and so that's growing at a very rapid
pace and those are big really difficult

443
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,409
to detect

444
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:11,529
and that's that's a lot of what uh...

445
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:13,200
uh... stepped in it did

446
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,640
itself modify itself script part of
itself and that really really or to

447
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,480
track it

448
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,050
if you just using like seeing signature
big strapping it's really really hard

449
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:26,390
two-track something itself modified
signature knows change

450
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:31,280
left very popular

451
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,600
here's another one that went down last
year for a little bit nance right back

452
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,860
up again to listen overall
vulnerabilities

453
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,429
without patches

454
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:42,090
so these are portability that have been
discovered

455
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,950
but there is no fix for

456
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,860
and so this is a combination of

457
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,410
offering system vendors

458
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:52,160
uh... application vendors as well as
uh... could be uh... custom-built code

459
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,110
well

460
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,390
but again so we're showing

461
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,600
close to fifty percent

462
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
uh... above owner billy's out there

463
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,860
that have been published

464
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:07,860
do not have packed

465
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:13,090
right right absolutely brother would be

466
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:17,490
some bro

467
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:20,780
isola talk about the darkness psychosom
that's pretty cool

468
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,970
so uh... you know something they called
a black hole network or network

469
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,190
telescope

470
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,230
and uh...

471
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:29,400
if it's really interesting some of the
the staff but you can get out of it so

472
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,030
we haven't aperture so it's kind of
drying the term aperture twenty five

473
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:37,140
thousand six hundred dresses have never
had anything running on

474
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:42,410
so denso we see traffic on their it's
most likely millage

475
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,800
so one of the interesting

476
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,600
trend is what we call backscatter
activity

477
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,429
and so what backscatter is

478
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:52,140
is and i think is another uh...
astronomy term

479
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,649
the idea there is that

480
00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:55,390
if you've got a uh...

481
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,630
uh... like if the u_s_ for the u_s_

482
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:00,130
attack that's using stripping techniques

483
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,720
will happen for civic modify the packet

484
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,419
and they put appalled at five p address
in the stores for the packet

485
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:08,230
and so what happens is

486
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,870
the vedic dumb perceives that the

487
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,840
often respond back

488
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,659
what happens is sometimes those who
dressed there using are

489
00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:19,180
addresses that are actually in our
darkness

490
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:22,980
so that's where the term backscatter
come from directing responses back from

491
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,620
these victims in in our dark net because
they put our art like the addresses the

492
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,649
uh... or one of our people students
uh... yes please

493
00:21:30,649 --> 00:21:31,950
source like you

494
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:35,169
so despite by mantra nist backscatter
traffic

495
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:37,190
we can see trends terms of

496
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:41,410
of uh... u_s_ in the u_s_ attacked

497
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,280
thoughts with this

498
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,690
graph shows missus turning up

499
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:51,690
very fast

500
00:21:53,409 --> 00:21:55,460
and this one's as shows the overall

501
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:59,430
emulation of avent look at that over two
hundred million events

502
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,980
twenty eleven

503
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,109
and you think about backscatter it's
almost like a random thing

504
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:05,830
it just happened to pick

505
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:09,830
one of our i_p_ addresses so this is a
very very small uh... you know

506
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,039
percentage of the born out of

507
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:18,250
of uh... of traffic

508
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,230
writes let's talk a little bit about
that you'd be teaser dance persistent

509
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,049
press uh...

510
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:25,230
as i mentioned earlier too bizarre
directed highly targeted

511
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,450
uh... efforts

512
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:29,249
they're very persistent and run
long-running so again if you look at

513
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:30,080
stocks net

514
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,200
or do you do which was sort of a spawn
sucks net

515
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,270
those were architect id

516
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:40,440
to spread very slowly very cautiously if
they didn't want to be tech

517
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,520
so will you do that goes by

518
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,540
like for example

519
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:48,720
one of the vectors that stuck to that
uses a usb key

520
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,179
and so if it was loaded on a usb he
would actually keep track

521
00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:53,870
of a number of hines

522
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:57,720
that it was insert into machine in the
cockpit itself

523
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,549
and i think it was after ten prime

524
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:03,520
destroy itself remove itself from the dr

525
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,600
exceeded basically ten tried and then it
would go away

526
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,910
we reasonable creases that was ever on

527
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:13,620
so that's one of the really interesting
things are profiting is he dot

528
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,190
the very

529
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,559
uh... stealthy

530
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,870
tax that are happening

531
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:24,130
and the you know they're designing take
months maybe even years to fully exploit

532
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:24,990
target

533
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,660
but the fact is that because

534
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,210
they the kind of fly below the radar
they're very

535
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:32,309
very difficult to detect

536
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:36,090
uh... so and again these these are
crated you know some of them are grade

537
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,080
by wait well

538
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:44,450
very highly technical people a lot of
times the have connections no inside of

539
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,710
like other companies like for example it
here

540
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:49,340
targeting if your victim is

541
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,600
company acts

542
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,269
uh... one of things that were the
techniques they've been using

543
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:55,830
is all actually come in

544
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:59,059
get themselves infiltrated into a
business partner

545
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:00,049
abet company

546
00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:03,940
you nowadays while business partners at
happen activity

547
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,799
into

548
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,570
their partners networks

549
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,600
and so what they did

550
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,300
is actually got thereby risking jected
into the software distribution mechanism

551
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,149
of a partner

552
00:24:15,149 --> 00:24:16,779
and then it use that

553
00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:21,240
to replicate itself across to their
apple targets now

554
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,260
really interesting crazy stuff going on
with it

555
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:28,519
another example that was with stocks and
again uh... one things they did it say

556
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:31,460
infiltrated us offer company in taiwan

557
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:35,370
and actually got copies of their
certificates use votes

558
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:38,529
uh... to distribute some so was actually
a valid sir

559
00:24:38,529 --> 00:24:41,779
uh... and what like the worded piece of
software up to a point when it was

560
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:45,200
finally disclosed in the revoke the
certs

561
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,920
again you know that's uh... the
literally had to have to zippel access

562
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:55,289
to that organization deal to get caught

563
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:58,500
right so even though he picked his
comprise or comp

564
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,210
yet for price compromise comprising
sprawl percentage

565
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,260
uh... breaches

566
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:06,100
the pixel business packet very very
large right because those are going

567
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,740
after highly targeted

568
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,260
uh... company looking at

569
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:12,010
very high value absence

570
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:16,860
so those tactics of as i mentioned to be
infiltration a crane custom out where we

571
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:20,270
can be spread through writing it means
including business partners

572
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,880
uh... using the social engineering
techniques and so on compromise user

573
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,830
accounts

574
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:28,860
lots of interesting things going on
social engineering course

575
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,659
point zero day border abilities

576
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:32,460
you know in a lot of times um...

577
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,760
what account is interesting about
exploits do it and this is truth stocks

578
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,450
in an addictive as well

579
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,860
a lot of the vectors than it used to
spread

580
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,870
warble they're not zero days are
actually boner billy said they're now

581
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:46,840
broke quite a while but nobody ever dot
around captured

582
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:51,950
i feel like a lot of machines are sparse
still avoidable simply because they just

583
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,639
you know lighten your organizations can
get around action

584
00:25:54,639 --> 00:25:57,630
for months at that time to time

585
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:01,309
technique any over covert channel so you
see a lot of things where you'll see

586
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:07,000
allah commanding control data going
across port eighty on a cryptic

587
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,980
that looked like regular old led traffic

588
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:16,250
saloon lots of interesting covert things
that way

589
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,340
so i think this life pretty cool this
really talked about some of these

590
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:23,019
targeted tax you know we are probably
familiar with the uh... the sony to

591
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:25,590
buckle that was the biggest one

592
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:28,510
you know that was primarily a sequel
injection impact

593
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:31,970
i mean look at this whose group of folks
out there and of course even arce got

594
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:32,890
hacked

595
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:35,600
uh... last year

596
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,370
f_-one with another big one

597
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:40,519
uh... nobody really still doesn't really
know how that that what happened that

598
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:44,790
was like you to lots of uh... of
information

599
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,880
so the point here is that you've got

600
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,620
lots of attacks are getting word order
terms of potential financial off were

601
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,010
terms of the number of wreckers
disclosed

602
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,760
in a few tactic pfizer

603
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:59,940
you know all over the board

604
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,690
here's my other howling reference so

605
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:07,200
but there is some good news that they
have the jackal

606
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,240
those tabs on the decline

607
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,140
now well yay

608
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,630
while the reasons that of course a big
they're getting a much more uh... if

609
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:19,100
there's anything down box net

610
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,100
right so

611
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,630
uh... anencephaly on the decline
although

612
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:26,730
uh... we find is that correct the type
of standards getting or more clever in

613
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,179
food house uh...

614
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:32,880
filtered will more easily

615
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,700
so boulder bailey's in terms of mobile
offering systems

616
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,800
really spite

617
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,970
you know between twenty ten twenty
eleven

618
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:44,600
dot down quite a lot sense that i don't
think this is necessarily tracked him to

619
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,100
continue down

620
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,080
right because

621
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,400
as we get more more more mobile opportu
stands out there

622
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,870
uh... more more very it's a panda rate
for example how many variants or

623
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:55,389
there've been a great

624
00:27:55,389 --> 00:27:57,139
hundreds probabaly

625
00:27:57,139 --> 00:27:58,279
every carrier

626
00:27:58,279 --> 00:27:59,590
with every phone

627
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:02,880
fence with suffer google tends to uh...

628
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,720
fully marquai and write three different
spins on it become occupation dinner

629
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,970
time they do that

630
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,000
forty divergent

631
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,820
you know uh... away from that standard
code base

632
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,080
and you open up its water bill

633
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,830
so gender i think it's is the scariest
one out there

634
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:23,460
you know and and uh... you know you just
gotta amazing growth smartphone as well

635
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:30,460
sort of market presence has been artwork
so i just can't see that them

636
00:28:32,529 --> 00:28:34,429
artfully positing questions

637
00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:37,210
oracle onto

638
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:40,340
with people are still awake that's good

639
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:45,800
you afraid if self at years

640
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,250
alright self

641
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:50,050
this is from the things that would what
we're seeing

642
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:53,030
within our customers field say we've got

643
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:55,780
data explosion so the age of big data

644
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,510
i remember back in the day

645
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,399
when you know

646
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,840
uh... like i can remember i was working
computer land

647
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,059
when the first part right showed up for
an apple

648
00:29:08,059 --> 00:29:11,500
cannot really do myself

649
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,880
that hard drive

650
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,350
megabytes of capacity

651
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:19,910
anacostia thousand dollars

652
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,180
the movement

653
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:25,080
today course we can go out and then by
uh... you know eight gig memory

654
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,780
memory stick for

655
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,510
two-dollar sometimes whatever is just

656
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,309
a nominal

657
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:34,730
now so if so we've got household after
bytes of dat da organizations

658
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,070
that have

659
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:39,480
peta bites and header bytes of data so
big gate is huge

660
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,029
of course the problem with that is

661
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:44,889
the more data that there is out there
the harder it is to secure it

662
00:29:44,889 --> 00:29:48,710
na part is to track them down excess
election

663
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:51,140
the consumers nation a bite to eat

664
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:54,480
so this this was a kind of a funny story
so i'd be and last year

665
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,430
announced that they're going to uh...
support

666
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:00,840
consumer urgently poorly on device

667
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,140
so that means if you have your own owner
you know your ikkada whatever it is that

668
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:07,590
you can bring it in contrast to the
network so on so far

669
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:11,179
and so what they announces they're going
to build limited deployment

670
00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:12,929
of of debt so if certain

671
00:30:12,929 --> 00:30:14,580
people within ibm

672
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:18,559
get access to it so present i_b_m_ scale
how big do you think a limited

673
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,830
deployment might be

674
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:24,120
five thousand

675
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,399
thousand to bite

676
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:27,250
yeah

677
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,510
you win the prize right

678
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:30,589
driver right here

679
00:30:30,589 --> 00:30:31,480
here

680
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,710
now hundred-thousand ashamed was a
limited the point likely to be a big

681
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,130
about i_b_m_ has

682
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:39,170
ordered forty thousand employees in
about another hundred thousand

683
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,720
contractor so that once you know twenty
percent probably of

684
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,799
of uh... of the work force that idea

685
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:46,629
anyway so

686
00:30:46,629 --> 00:30:50,450
that's happy not just by the end of it
happens at a at a and all technology

687
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:53,690
company like i_b_m_ it's happening
everywhere

688
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:58,690
and i'm happy that it does you know i
can have my iphone or at my nap

689
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,730
my work on

690
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:04,130
everything is everywhere course so we've
got

691
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,219
such a sporadic technology

692
00:31:06,219 --> 00:31:09,380
ailing corporate data is finding its way
out

693
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,500
further and further away from the data
center

694
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,160
no got

695
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,450
to be mobile devices you got business
partners the networks are becoming much

696
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,160
more force over time

697
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,460
so of course is just

698
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,170
getting everywhere

699
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,730
so we have to figure out how to control
that

700
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:27,010
net tax fifty eight o'clock about
barricades guilty

701
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,050
complexity and and uh...

702
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:34,490
prevalence of these attacks is trees

703
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:38,090
so what's become in you feel like you
secure used to be sort of one of things

704
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,100
where

705
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,570
uh... you know the if there was a c
celibacy so was

706
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:44,529
was responsible for it

707
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:45,429
but today

708
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:49,019
especially with all the high visibility
losses it's really become a boardroom

709
00:31:49,019 --> 00:31:50,049
discussion

710
00:31:50,049 --> 00:31:51,789
session we start talking about

711
00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:53,000
you know sony

712
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,169
potential one billion dollar long-term
impact

713
00:31:56,169 --> 00:31:57,950
from the playstation two bahcall

714
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:02,590
a hundred seventy-one millions million
dollars for every hundred customers

715
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,140
that lost their data

716
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,519
and so we start talking about

717
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,280
billions of dollars obviously that gets
people's attention now

718
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,190
uh... dot

719
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,230
we've got uh...

720
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:14,030
very very large customers on a roll

721
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:19,950
concern about this happening to them

722
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:22,559
but when we look at it died the m

723
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,049
there's really kind of four categories

724
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:26,750
i think you need think about

725
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,280
first of all you've got people involved

726
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:33,850
as you probably know people or brought
your number one security vote

727
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:36,370
yuppies if you have

728
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:39,610
a hundred thousand dollars to spend on
security

729
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:42,890
you know i would say you know and that's
all you have to spend

730
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:46,210
spend half of that educate your users
and you get a much better return on

731
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:51,159
investment and spent two thousand
dollars on something at city park

732
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:54,019
now from the guys at i_b_m_ probably
would not specially sales guys probably

733
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:56,400
would not agree with me on that but

734
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,670
just educating your users about proper
proper techniques in and data hiding

735
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:05,070
techniques ls were thinking go a long
way that to solving issue

736
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,850
so that's one aspect of it

737
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:11,070
in its part the people we have to to
worry about that's also exploded to not

738
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:13,789
only do we have to worry about internal
folks employees

739
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:17,600
but you've got all sorts of external
people business partners and consultants

740
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,149
obviously you've got hackers being even
terrorists

741
00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:23,159
a lot of copies it outsourced

742
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:26,159
so you have to worry about who's doing
your outsourcing

743
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,730
even prosperous out access in some case

744
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:30,409
in some cases to your network

745
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:32,230
but i think about all those different

746
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,649
aspect

747
00:33:33,649 --> 00:33:35,120
spars data

748
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,960
and we not only have to worry about
structured data but a lot of your

749
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,100
confidential data may be going
prostitutes on structure obviously when

750
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:46,890
it's unstructured it's even harder to
track

751
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:50,740
divided at rest which is obviously uh...
i was sitting inside your databases are

752
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,950
insider datacenter

753
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,040
as well in motion

754
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,550
i think about that

755
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,580
where is it being

756
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,480
transfer house being transferred all its
worth

757
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,549
on the application side system web
applications

758
00:34:01,549 --> 00:34:03,329
web two point out which is probably

759
00:34:03,329 --> 00:34:06,080
should be cool web three point oh by now
anyway

760
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,689
that uh... that while from three point
netfirms

761
00:34:08,689 --> 00:34:10,699
immobile outpatient

762
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:14,759
on the infrastructure side to all the
explosion of different platform and so

763
00:34:14,759 --> 00:34:16,079
on you think about

764
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,359
so point here is that

765
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,259
you can't just protect the printer
anymore back there are a couple years

766
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:22,509
ago i was talking to uh...

767
00:34:22,509 --> 00:34:25,349
the sea so the airport

768
00:34:25,349 --> 00:34:26,779
and basically

769
00:34:26,779 --> 00:34:29,709
what the air force is recognized

770
00:34:29,709 --> 00:34:31,999
a firewall is no longer

771
00:34:31,999 --> 00:34:35,809
they've passed is the is not proof
premarin

772
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:37,639
the printer have to be

773
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:40,690
at sat at the actual device

774
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,039
because

775
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,169
firewalls

776
00:34:43,169 --> 00:34:47,189
have to permit so much traffic nowadays
networks of them so soap or else

777
00:34:47,189 --> 00:34:51,149
they just came think about that as a
primary

778
00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:53,470
and furthermore first from an i_b_m_
perspective

779
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:57,119
now we look at a capitalistic play a few
wealthy across the board

780
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,559
on so we're looking at

781
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:02,089
how you protect all this

782
00:35:02,089 --> 00:35:07,469
one pieces

783
00:35:07,469 --> 00:35:08,859
price in terms of of

784
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:10,429
overall maturity

785
00:35:10,429 --> 00:35:12,460
of your security uh...

786
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,169
you know strategy here

787
00:35:14,169 --> 00:35:16,139
no most most folks start

788
00:35:16,139 --> 00:35:18,429
kinda down here

789
00:35:18,429 --> 00:35:20,150
in the manual reactive bay

790
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:20,950
you know it is

791
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:25,269
surprising to me even today how many
large organizations much less violent

792
00:35:25,269 --> 00:35:27,229
are still kinda down here

793
00:35:27,229 --> 00:35:30,699
so that means that you're doing allot of
minal intervention

794
00:35:30,699 --> 00:35:33,599
uh... you know if you have assumed
product it's a basic one-in-eight has to

795
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,469
do a lot management

796
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:38,380
wrote a lot of organizations start
walking management in the oval don't go

797
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,669
any further

798
00:35:40,669 --> 00:35:43,749
you know as you kinda move-up you can
become much more on a new much more

799
00:35:43,749 --> 00:35:44,730
proactive

800
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:51,730
not only does it give you better
security it also tends to dry pops

801
00:35:53,049 --> 00:35:56,039
so here's some of things and
characteristics and against banning

802
00:35:56,039 --> 00:36:00,119
these four categories that we like to
think about this on the basic side

803
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:03,599
you know if you've got to go directly to
be a little bit can encryption access

804
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,060
control you do not patients getting on
your outside

805
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:11,749
and renders security antivirus that's
kind of which are basic

806
00:36:11,749 --> 00:36:13,719
category

807
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:15,329
i think if we did a survey

808
00:36:15,329 --> 00:36:16,790
you know maybe of uh...

809
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:19,439
fortune one thousand u_s_

810
00:36:19,439 --> 00:36:23,549
uh... you find it surprising amount of
of copies are still at the sky stuck

811
00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:24,220
down here

812
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,959
basic well

813
00:36:25,959 --> 00:36:28,919
now to move up into the proficient
category that's where we start talking

814
00:36:28,919 --> 00:36:29,710
about doing

815
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:33,079
user provisioning actually doing strong
authentication

816
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:36,899
uh... putting in the sand dunes and
ideal off prevention type of stuff

817
00:36:36,899 --> 00:36:39,649
uh... you look at using updation
firewalls

818
00:36:39,649 --> 00:36:42,429
that so that's an interesting question
how many folks out there he is the

819
00:36:42,429 --> 00:36:46,159
application therefore wolf

820
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:47,640
yes pirate early

821
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,339
twenty thirty percent

822
00:36:49,339 --> 00:36:50,880
it's interesting trad

823
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,390
uh... i'm seeing in a lot in my customer
base but

824
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:57,949
very very large organizations

825
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,999
they're getting into that

826
00:36:59,999 --> 00:37:03,329
uh... then gilbert salacious curiosity
management

827
00:37:03,329 --> 00:37:05,799
uh... and point network security net so

828
00:37:05,799 --> 00:37:07,239
profession is

829
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:11,579
really where we shall all at least be at
at at a bare minimum today

830
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:14,839
manage to get into optimize that's when
he gets into some really interesting

831
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:15,589
stuff

832
00:37:15,589 --> 00:37:21,479
no i did e-governance uh... very
privileged user controls and monitoring

833
00:37:21,479 --> 00:37:24,969
you know various beautiful analytics in
governance

834
00:37:24,969 --> 00:37:25,630
frog attack

835
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,220
should that network

836
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:34,220
mondrian in forensics became
increasingly more important

837
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:37,749
so this has got a message that we're
trying to get across to everybody today

838
00:37:37,749 --> 00:37:39,049
to elect

839
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:42,690
i get security system is the only been
in the market that can cover all those

840
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:44,509
foresight silos

841
00:37:44,509 --> 00:37:45,500
with products that

842
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,949
that integrate with one another

843
00:37:47,949 --> 00:37:49,350
uh... we've invested

844
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:53,010
nearly two billion dollars and uh... in
technologies which includes companies

845
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:53,889
like

846
00:37:53,889 --> 00:37:57,739
uh... q_-one labs who work for now
twelve big fixing

847
00:37:57,739 --> 00:38:01,879
guardian askin marshall tucker sec

848
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:02,780
thousand

849
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,359
security consultants and engineers

850
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,179
uh... it we have exported to our talked
about

851
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:10,990
and we have the largest water billing
database in the industry

852
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,479
which isn't out

853
00:38:12,479 --> 00:38:19,479
output of the explores

854
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:23,770
how are you going to increased your
situational awareness to u

855
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:27,999
if you think about security kind of as
an overall timeline

856
00:38:27,999 --> 00:38:30,569
august like a had talked about this but

857
00:38:30,569 --> 00:38:32,400
now one of the things is to really

858
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,920
it's our arms around what's happening
right now which is your situational

859
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,759
awareness

860
00:38:36,759 --> 00:38:40,130
typically that involves using the sample
from the other products to really

861
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:42,829
understand what's happening on your
network today

862
00:38:42,829 --> 00:38:44,999
but when things were really working at

863
00:38:44,999 --> 00:38:47,109
and helping our customers work monies
ginni

864
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:48,889
head of the exploit

865
00:38:48,889 --> 00:38:52,209
that is so important you know if you can
prevent that from happening in the first

866
00:38:52,209 --> 00:38:53,099
place

867
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:58,219
then obviously there to reduce the
amount of potential exposure walks if u

868
00:38:58,219 --> 00:39:00,489
needed bridge

869
00:39:00,489 --> 00:39:03,329
so i'd be able to do that so riveted
integrated way

870
00:39:03,329 --> 00:39:07,180
and to make it easy that's that's a big
part of uh... what working on it if you

871
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,240
can do it right

872
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,879
you can actually do that you can save
money

873
00:39:13,879 --> 00:39:16,339
so in terms of our global coverage

874
00:39:16,339 --> 00:39:19,640
uh... i think this is a very interesting
slides because the shows

875
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,619
all of our security operation centers as
one near me helen number by the way so

876
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:25,639
we have a great big one in boulder

877
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:29,369
after the atlanta fell we can't have
worldwide coverage

878
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:32,819
uh... in terms of our research centers
are operation center

879
00:39:32,819 --> 00:39:37,219
um... as far as our managed services so
we have over twenty housen

880
00:39:37,219 --> 00:39:41,949
devices under contract unless it devices
you primarily security devices

881
00:39:41,949 --> 00:39:43,589
thirty seven hundred clients

882
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,349
uh... using our or uh...

883
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:46,409
services

884
00:39:46,409 --> 00:39:50,509
i would be and overnight billion events
a day or or our socks

885
00:39:50,509 --> 00:39:52,330
we were thousands patents

886
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:54,450
and uh... real hundred thirty three

887
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:58,539
countries that we monitor

888
00:39:58,539 --> 00:40:00,560
let's let's talk a little bit about
specific

889
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,129
examples here

890
00:40:02,129 --> 00:40:06,719
bus is a real marketing flight your
baby's all right so take these these

891
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:08,889
various tears

892
00:40:08,889 --> 00:40:11,710
knocking flows up into this thing that
we call

893
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,200
explorer plan

894
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,369
mark

895
00:40:16,369 --> 00:40:20,309
so yelled one of the biggest challenges
that i see out there is that there's so

896
00:40:20,309 --> 00:40:21,400
much dat

897
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,849
and they're so many different silos of
data

898
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:26,840
is how do you get that all in one place
that you can actually do

899
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,019
something with it

900
00:40:28,019 --> 00:40:30,859
but includes everything from you know
networking tivity

901
00:40:30,859 --> 00:40:35,639
virtual machines change in config yet
application servers security and user

902
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:36,420
activity

903
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:40,910
so you'd be able to the gift that gather
in one place that you can ran analytics

904
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,119
on it

905
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:45,949
and what we did so we do that personal
talked mostly about our arson product

906
00:40:45,949 --> 00:40:46,609
here

907
00:40:46,609 --> 00:40:49,569
so we can bring in all of those types of
things

908
00:40:49,569 --> 00:40:51,740
what we do have boiled it down

909
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,129
into what we call it off

910
00:40:54,129 --> 00:40:56,349
uh... offenses

911
00:40:56,349 --> 00:40:57,589
the result of

912
00:40:57,589 --> 00:41:00,480
not only collecting all this detective
watts assumes a really good at

913
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,939
collecting data

914
00:41:01,939 --> 00:41:04,339
uh... not so they send their so good
actually

915
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:07,939
trading actionable information from all
that data that they play

916
00:41:07,939 --> 00:41:08,770
entirely

917
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:12,369
people i've talked to the many you
mobile multiple million dollar

918
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:16,529
investments and send them yet they still
can't get the dated you want to go

919
00:41:16,529 --> 00:41:23,529
that we spent a lot of time a lot of
money gusting in you go about

920
00:41:26,289 --> 00:41:29,139
there's kinda how we split the timeline

921
00:41:29,139 --> 00:41:31,869
he start unit center here at the exploit

922
00:41:31,869 --> 00:41:36,339
so your traditional sim products and a
focus on the right side here

923
00:41:36,339 --> 00:41:40,529
so it's all about knowing what's
happened dispute capping on your network

924
00:41:40,529 --> 00:41:44,259
and figuring out how to stop what's
going on

925
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:46,210
which is good i mean you need that kind
of

926
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:50,609
comstock meets him prior to deal p and
all that to they'll do that

927
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:53,769
which also need to be able to get ahead
of its of the curve here

928
00:41:53,769 --> 00:41:57,869
to really get your arms around what your
systems are vulnerable

929
00:41:57,869 --> 00:42:00,129
power the vulnerable

930
00:42:00,129 --> 00:42:01,759
are the at risk

931
00:42:01,759 --> 00:42:03,549
of being explored

932
00:42:03,549 --> 00:42:06,410
that's really what you wanted to know
that i think the holy grail of bill

933
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:07,720
would not only no

934
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:11,650
which in these which your machines are
vulnerable but also which when she

935
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:13,909
picked first

936
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:15,169
because that's a problem

937
00:42:15,169 --> 00:42:19,469
right now you may have invested in water
more border belly scanners

938
00:42:19,469 --> 00:42:22,640
and so you can actually stand all your
machines and you can tell how many of

939
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,380
those

940
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,459
are are vulnerable to exploit

941
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:27,010
but at the end of the day

942
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:30,130
if you've got valves and her ten
thousand more more machines that need to

943
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:33,249
be facts which was any pics first

944
00:42:33,249 --> 00:42:35,679
we think about it if you can

945
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:37,809
and machines that are

946
00:42:37,809 --> 00:42:40,400
you know a haven't valuable very

947
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,449
uh... habit actual born herbal

948
00:42:43,449 --> 00:42:44,579
exploit

949
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:47,769
uh... and can be exploited because they
have a valid

950
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:49,259
half

951
00:42:49,259 --> 00:42:51,129
from either from the network

952
00:42:51,129 --> 00:42:54,639
from the internet from a business
partner if it's not ten issues and

953
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:57,969
they're not gonna duck all the others
their content

954
00:42:57,969 --> 00:43:00,009
heads of garlic a domino effect

955
00:43:00,009 --> 00:43:02,259
so that's really one things that we're
looking at is

956
00:43:02,259 --> 00:43:05,770
figuring out the best way to be old type
in the finals machine

957
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:06,919
and then

958
00:43:06,919 --> 00:43:10,309
actually burn mediators she very quickly

959
00:43:10,309 --> 00:43:14,209
i'll talk more about that

960
00:43:14,209 --> 00:43:17,429
beckwith this light up just because

961
00:43:17,429 --> 00:43:18,889
had night

962
00:43:18,889 --> 00:43:19,979
uh... like

963
00:43:19,979 --> 00:43:22,529
if you think about these are all of the
products

964
00:43:22,529 --> 00:43:23,759
that idea

965
00:43:23,759 --> 00:43:25,539
in the various here

966
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:27,559
not going to go through every one

967
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:32,799
but for me this was kind of an upset me
because i had no idea that ally softness

968
00:43:32,799 --> 00:43:36,529
how many different products like at

969
00:43:36,529 --> 00:43:39,719
i caught a few just a little of that i
know really well

970
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:43,410
of course that the key radar since i
work on this my product

971
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:44,979
career risk manager

972
00:43:44,979 --> 00:43:49,199
we have a very good g r c platform it
welfare although the pages

973
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:51,940
uh... guardians exploded a security tool

974
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:56,739
uh... basically attracts udeshi video i
should uh... before four p around that

975
00:43:56,739 --> 00:44:01,520
dop scan is a is a border billy scanner
and scan source code as well as uh...

976
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,419
as applications that are and profit
current production or

977
00:44:05,419 --> 00:44:07,899
available internet

978
00:44:07,899 --> 00:44:09,120
and we have big pics

979
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:15,979
which is a very good endpoint afton
figuration

980
00:44:15,979 --> 00:44:22,589
the weapons were doing i_b_m_ protecting
next flight that gets built effect

981
00:44:22,589 --> 00:44:24,979
so well that things were days were
working on

982
00:44:24,979 --> 00:44:26,100
uh... first of all

983
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:30,070
integrating all these together sleep is
starting to really interesting thing

984
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:32,819
exhibit use case for that

985
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:34,919
if you look at dekhti radar

986
00:44:34,919 --> 00:44:37,019
and dick pics integration that we just
yet

987
00:44:37,019 --> 00:44:39,379
so we have a lot of customers

988
00:44:39,379 --> 00:44:41,399
and invested you read

989
00:44:41,399 --> 00:44:43,030
and this visa for products that

990
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:44,529
that surprise that

991
00:44:44,529 --> 00:44:46,759
superior pursue the same product

992
00:44:46,759 --> 00:44:49,429
uh... you know also at risk management
product

993
00:44:49,429 --> 00:44:51,020
uh... so it's really good at it

994
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,000
taking in got thank you

995
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,179
it's really good kicking in lots of data

996
00:44:56,179 --> 00:44:57,949
but this couple things it doesn't it

997
00:44:57,949 --> 00:45:02,429
you know one thing does it have a hard
time getting vulnerability data

998
00:45:02,429 --> 00:45:05,819
like workstation windows machines server

999
00:45:05,819 --> 00:45:07,559
neck and stuff

1000
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:11,710
and also doesn't have capability wasn't
architect had to do any sort of

1001
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,579
remediation

1002
00:45:13,579 --> 00:45:14,500
that's what

1003
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,749
other tools

1004
00:45:15,749 --> 00:45:19,769
so what we're talking billing now
looking we just uh... actually did some

1005
00:45:19,769 --> 00:45:21,200
that we are integrating

1006
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,799
q radar

1007
00:45:22,799 --> 00:45:24,839
an operational level

1008
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:29,799
a number of these products of archit dot
the big exterior decoration so

1009
00:45:29,799 --> 00:45:32,990
in about a week with a released the
first

1010
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:34,740
version of this integration

1011
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:39,150
basically it's a big exit toward you can
have out on your on your uh... machines

1012
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:41,609
to do patch management our management

1013
00:45:41,609 --> 00:45:44,249
software asset management llc sort of
thing

1014
00:45:44,249 --> 00:45:46,289
it's it's really cool agent

1015
00:45:46,289 --> 00:45:49,380
and this agent and tell you almost
anything you might want to know about

1016
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,930
that

1017
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:55,079
so we've got integration between big
pics in few radar so that

1018
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:58,820
uh... the speak of these endpoints can
be

1019
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,210
pushed up from big pics

1020
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:01,639
insecure radar

1021
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:04,199
so examples of this could be

1022
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:05,700
things like

1023
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,569
virus infection

1024
00:46:07,569 --> 00:46:09,379
right so we can pick data

1025
00:46:09,379 --> 00:46:10,239
off of

1026
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:12,209
that that's being sent up

1027
00:46:12,209 --> 00:46:16,439
uh... that indicates which machines have
buyers active virus infections

1028
00:46:16,439 --> 00:46:18,400
or dad up in the queue radar

1029
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:23,329
radar being a sentiment poorly dot with
network that teddy

1030
00:46:23,329 --> 00:46:27,219
paper also then be able to past border
bilities from all those machines up so

1031
00:46:27,219 --> 00:46:29,859
we're not talking about the output of
the board of building scanner we're

1032
00:46:29,859 --> 00:46:31,949
talking about an actual

1033
00:46:31,949 --> 00:46:33,710
agent on that machine

1034
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:34,410
that can

1035
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:36,860
wary erp any property you might want on
that

1036
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:37,879
to determine

1037
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:40,039
uh... if baltimore

1038
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:43,739
so this isn't just cock is it's
configurations that could be guilty any

1039
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:46,089
number of things

1040
00:46:46,089 --> 00:46:47,660
which then up into a sand

1041
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:49,410
induce in advance correlation on it

1042
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:52,129
and start to get really really interest

1043
00:46:52,129 --> 00:46:56,619
combined that with our capability of
understanding the network topology

1044
00:46:56,619 --> 00:46:57,700
now you've got

1045
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:58,880
border billy data

1046
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,679
coming up from the endpoint

1047
00:47:00,679 --> 00:47:02,049
coming into the stamp

1048
00:47:02,049 --> 00:47:06,059
the sentiment or leaked out with full
network activity as well as the network

1049
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:07,289
topology

1050
00:47:07,289 --> 00:47:09,709
can give u_s_ absent

1051
00:47:09,709 --> 00:47:11,670
those devices that are or will

1052
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:13,439
that are ones that are

1053
00:47:13,439 --> 00:47:16,129
uh... at higher risk of the exploit

1054
00:47:16,129 --> 00:47:20,709
because we can't figure out which of
those machines ap attack past

1055
00:47:20,709 --> 00:47:22,660
and our actually below normal to

1056
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:23,979
to an attack

1057
00:47:23,979 --> 00:47:24,720
we can and

1058
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,939
pass that

1059
00:47:26,939 --> 00:47:28,119
the big fix

1060
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:33,049
bigflix could then use that three
mediators owner abilities

1061
00:47:33,049 --> 00:47:36,030
kind of that where we're going with this
uh... fielding some

1062
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:38,539
loosely packed remediation

1063
00:47:38,539 --> 00:47:39,640
so that uh...

1064
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,920
you discover bonneville your or dot the
dual correlation you push it back down

1065
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,010
and

1066
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:51,010
very quickly

1067
00:47:53,249 --> 00:47:56,640
price let me talk to stop kids ample
fears from the cool stuff that we've

1068
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,619
done

1069
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:02,409
filled one case obvious to the customer
where uh... they had a competing some

1070
00:48:02,409 --> 00:48:06,349
product but it is we've down five
hundred homes that had a virus that

1071
00:48:06,349 --> 00:48:09,599
every other security product that they
had installed miss

1072
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:11,719
chevron the really cool example

1073
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:14,019
uh... they add that two billion

1074
00:48:14,019 --> 00:48:15,339
login events

1075
00:48:15,339 --> 00:48:20,419
that with a competitive product was
generating thousands and thousands of of

1076
00:48:20,419 --> 00:48:23,019
whatever they call offenses in that
system

1077
00:48:23,019 --> 00:48:25,979
and is that they could do anything with
because there's just too many

1078
00:48:25,979 --> 00:48:32,979
so we were able to to reduce that down a
twenty five per day

1079
00:48:35,059 --> 00:48:37,150
and hoping that uh... we've got going on

1080
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:38,659
is uh...

1081
00:48:38,659 --> 00:48:43,359
conserving consumers issued by t and
uh... mobile device management

1082
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:46,419
so that sports become really big focus
lightly

1083
00:48:46,419 --> 00:48:47,500
the ability to

1084
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:48,559
incorporate

1085
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:51,670
the management of all your mobile
devices so thats regardless of gender

1086
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:54,179
fit and royer outpour

1087
00:48:54,179 --> 00:48:55,730
ando deliver might be

1088
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:58,130
and be able to integrate that back into
your

1089
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:02,239
overall security strategy without having
to get the point

1090
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:06,019
so uh... through the the big picture by
the way is also known as i demand point

1091
00:49:06,019 --> 00:49:08,039
manager rose bowl tickets

1092
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:09,099
came from

1093
00:49:09,099 --> 00:49:12,399
but uh... that product as a really nice
mobile device management capability

1094
00:49:12,399 --> 00:49:13,149
email

1095
00:49:13,149 --> 00:49:14,059
which uh...

1096
00:49:14,059 --> 00:49:17,609
you know it allows you to use the same
chili with you use for catching your

1097
00:49:17,609 --> 00:49:21,179
windows machines are your unix machines
to also manager

1098
00:49:21,179 --> 00:49:26,569
imo

1099
00:49:26,569 --> 00:49:30,489
sought the best light up mainly because
of kinda fun to talk about i_d_ ems own

1100
00:49:30,489 --> 00:49:34,719
deployment of of our own technology when
things that's really or used to work for

1101
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:36,450
a competing vendor of i_b_m_'s

1102
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:37,789
i won't name

1103
00:49:37,789 --> 00:49:41,029
but uh... this color management vendor
and

1104
00:49:41,029 --> 00:49:42,189
at one point

1105
00:49:42,189 --> 00:49:44,870
i asked right met the c_i_o_ the company

1106
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:47,829
this is a fairly large copy billion
dollars

1107
00:49:47,829 --> 00:49:50,499
and that the c_i_o_ had to tell i'm
really interested 'cause i'm really

1108
00:49:50,499 --> 00:49:52,429
really like to tell our customers

1109
00:49:52,429 --> 00:49:53,400
how many

1110
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,639
of our own products were using
internally

1111
00:49:56,639 --> 00:49:57,880
and he does uh...

1112
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,749
don't answer

1113
00:49:59,749 --> 00:50:01,309
yeah

1114
00:50:01,309 --> 00:50:03,939
if

1115
00:50:03,939 --> 00:50:08,549
so anyway i_b_m_ porch lead us we do we
are about to review his oral products

1116
00:50:08,549 --> 00:50:13,609
and what a good example is aptly but big
six six months after the acquisition of

1117
00:50:13,609 --> 00:50:14,639
big day

1118
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:18,079
we had deployed the product to four
hundred thousand machines which was

1119
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:19,109
virtually

1120
00:50:19,109 --> 00:50:22,469
all of the primary workstation in the
entire company

1121
00:50:22,469 --> 00:50:26,650
dates actually closer to seven hundred
thousand we've all woman servers and

1122
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:30,309
