1
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:07,560
thank you

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,019
a it's great to be here in Grand Rapids
it just

3
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:14,870
short 45-minute Drive from my home in
grand ledge

4
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:20,439
and wanted to first bodice a little bit
about my background is stalking are

5
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:21,699
looking at the agenda

6
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:26,500
and looking at the topics that's how you
gonna be hearing about the next two days

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,439
this is a little bit different and most
the topics or around

8
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:34,540
the technical I think it was the is the
with the people process and technology

9
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,600
rate

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,410
and most them around the technology how
you grow

11
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,520
on in that area and you're here for that

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,930
arm lot about process in this is really
more the people side so

13
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,770
when that you are coming from four star
of the County this up

14
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:54,699
we're gonna cover in the next 45 minutes
and they don't open up some questions

15
00:00:54,699 --> 00:00:57,070
maybe take about 10 minutes a questions
from the audience

16
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:01,010
I am the chief security officer for the
State and Michigan a background as I

17
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,559
started the national security agency in
washington spent about six years there

18
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,930
was in England for seven years with
Lockheed Martin man second intelligence

19
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:08,630
community

20
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:12,110
on been a cig government in a wide
variety roles

21
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,330
with CISO MCSO now we'll see to:

22
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,799
on in Michigan arm director of our

23
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,070
about technology back in the 2000 time
when we launch Michigan dot gov

24
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,600
that's my background i would tell you
that for this reason

25
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,700
um what we're gonna cover today

26
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,829
is really are some things that I wrote a
couple years ago

27
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:38,600
when I became CT on Michigan and I you
know went from the security team

28
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,390
over that through the infrastructure
team the technology team and as I was

29
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,360
there

30
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,460
and I listened to the director networks
and and data centers in a lot of

31
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,320
different people

32
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,710
I looked at what arm are the things

33
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:58,350
that make security pros successful and
what are the things

34
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,729
thats on are causing them to fail

35
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:05,439
what the good the bad the ugly and
careers

36
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,690
that help you in your success so most of
it just

37
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,420
quick question how did your students
raise your head a lot of

38
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,489
okay maybe a third students how many
have you been in the

39
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:20,319
IT security field for arm up to maybe
five to 10 years treasure here

40
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,480
a lot okay how many more than 10 years
good

41
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,959
well hopefully wherever you're at arm

42
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,160
I wanna take you okay you're in the room
today

43
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,370
you're obviously at a hacker conference
you get a lot of technical knowledge

44
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,430
arm and I wanna tell you walk you
through

45
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,610
are the standard check this is an end of
7 surprising problems that are

46
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:48,340
sabotaging your program and your career
and your teams because teams in security

47
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:48,940
teams

48
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,150
fundamentally are made up of what people
so

49
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:57,250
what got you in the room today you know
traditional views have security

50
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,530
and and and how you can you know get a
security job

51
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,110
are whatever you want to look at

52
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:09,409
arm I wanna be a caso in five years I
wanna be the head director Rolf

53
00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:12,989
this I wanna be a better hacker whatever
it is you want to do and you know

54
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:14,150
obviously hopefully

55
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:18,010
make more money growing the career maybe
work for other companies may be worked

56
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,940
for three letter agency in washington

57
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,870
maybe get a clearance whatever those
goals are I think we all have goals

58
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,200
we typically think of okay well I need a
degree

59
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,379
only multiple degrees maybe a master's
degree come if you have certifications

60
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,360
raise your hand okay most view

61
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,430
so you get certifications maybe

62
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,430
maybe the job you have now the choir
should have certifications we have a CIS

63
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,790
MRC ISP CISSP

64
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:47,650
arm or your cum the security conferences
are some people say you know I want a

65
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,340
job

66
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:54,019
rocking go arm and there's executive
level by and the management gets it

67
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:58,030
let's have a joke in there in the si ESO
community that says

68
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,909
I want the security job right after a
major breach I want top job because what

69
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,659
happens I'll ask I got fired

70
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:08,620
you walk in management's all ticked off
right

71
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,209
and they want to give you the money so
here's the budget we gotta fix this and

72
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:14,349
you're the guy to fix it you know

73
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:18,690
sounds good but I've seen people with
executive buy-in

74
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,750
with all the things on this list fail
miserably

75
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,100
and i've seen others that have nothing
on this list

76
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,070
and do very well theirself trained

77
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,080
they're great hackers they know what
they're doing

78
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,910
and they're very very well respected in
the industry

79
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,800
sup what do the things that I saw as I
look at

80
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,699
are this topic and by the way just case
you want to learn more about this

81
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:49,430
are you can go to sea ESO magazine just
google the topic why security pros

82
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:53,630
feel a little pop right up is a block
series on this right go into detail when

83
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,350
there's also an overview article

84
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:59,250
that was a fun cover si ESO magazine a
few years back so you can you can read

85
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,720
more about this if you want to learn
some other background this topic

86
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,630
so number one for somebody's you may
have heard

87
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:11,759
they become kinda cliches in the
industry by one explain a little bit

88
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,830
security pros are known as the Sabres

89
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:21,380
they're the ones who say no we can't do
that

90
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,289
and then you've heard corollary we need
to be. neighbors and I'll talk about

91
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:25,960
that a minute

92
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,710
but i wanna start off with the story and
tell you how I learned this very

93
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,289
personally in my career

94
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:35,620
so the years 2004

95
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,949
go back about eight years I was about a
year in a CISO in Michigan

96
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:45,210
a tear to Chi was the CIO at a time
terza kaya

97
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:48,430
many of you may know Terry she went to
see a on Michigan for four years on the

98
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,410
governor Granholm

99
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,680
she went on to be you see I O in
California under our arnold

100
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,639
schwarzenegger

101
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,060
and then she's going on from there she
was she's now the CIA on the department

102
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,190
of ECE

103
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,319
so $35 billion dollar budget currently
terry has

104
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,080
so Terry arm was the boss we're in the
conference room

105
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,449
and the topic was Wireless rock Wireless

106
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:14,300
and and and the execuse round the table
we all have the staff meeting in Terry

107
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,900
are Terry said mill ok she did the topic
was

108
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,350
we're gonna put wireless and all the
different convert rooms in the complex

109
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,150
across a government like twenty to
twenty to thirty conference

110
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:29,770
at and I was supposed to be evaluating
this is the CISO so my team had done the

111
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,650
research and I was or into

112
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:36,870
you know II had all the way papers I'd
look at NSA CIA dian although

113
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,259
although three-letter agencies in
Washington I had you know all the

114
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:40,970
background

115
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,090
I'd even go on this I going all these
other web sites

116
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:48,280
what did they say Wireless is a bad idea

117
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,090
can't do wireless why were driving

118
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:57,210
and by that we were driving arm were
driving you can hack into its not secure

119
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,539
its not encrypt it is not this it's not
that

120
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:02,770
I have all

121
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:07,289
the information to back me up you know
the checklist the white paper's the

122
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:08,090
sheets

123
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:11,330
the cheat sheets the articles the
headlines executive summaries

124
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,530
and they're all stacked up and I was
handed a map

125
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,729
in this is why we can't do wireless

126
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,949
so what happened teary

127
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:24,530
arm who I but tell you I just tremendous
respect for two issues outstanding

128
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,180
executive and leader

129
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,690
she says at the time she said a

130
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,860
everyone leave the room today

131
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,810
so they all walked out of the room this
wasn't very uncomfortable

132
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,970
she looked me in the eye claude was
closed and she said and a

133
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:46,759
if that's your answer you can PC ISO in
Michigan

134
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:49,870
acid what and she said

135
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,949
you can't be CIS up if if if you're
going to

136
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:58,500
have that view and I said why and she
said I had just come from dow

137
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:04,210
Chrysler GM and fork and they all have
wireless in the conference

138
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,680
so what do they know that you don't know

139
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,949
I'm gonna give you one week you go
figure it out and come back

140
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:16,069
and then we'll decide if you can be the
CISO miss you

141
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:19,629
so guess what I did I

142
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:22,849
you know I'm not gonna get through this
the whole story but the bottom line is

143
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:23,620
that we have

144
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:28,020
it was a it was a the two say a paradigm
shift for me

145
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,669
in any really began a journey over about
a couple year period

146
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:35,099
about how I approach this and this idea
that

147
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:38,419
you were known as the party poopers many
times

148
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:42,200
and that I i'm standing to me people
written blocks against my

149
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,850
ok on this topic insists there are times
it just like a policeman pull somebody

150
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,600
over on the roads are times when

151
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,860
CISO those have to say no I get that

152
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,640
but by and large the answer should be
were coming in we stop saying no

153
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,920
and be known as enablers know is
somebody

154
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,529
you know cover are you bringing problems
are you bringing solutions

155
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:06,330
are you coming to the table with 10
reasons why we can't do something

156
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:09,760
or you looking around and finding out
how other people are doing it

157
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,910
and then bringing that's your to UT to
your management

158
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:18,779
to business areas are you someone who is
seen as an enabler or as a disabled

159
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:21,950
and I understand just like a policeman
poor people over the roadway of

160
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:25,070
have helped that feeling you know the
red light you know pulled over to the

161
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,940
side you know we're not too happy to
have policemen at that moment right

162
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,180
but we're all say that is a role for
them in there are times when you have to

163
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,990
kindly say that may not be the best
answer but bottom line we have to be

164
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,990
neighbors so that's the first area

165
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:46,089
number two

166
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:49,430
security pros are known as

167
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:52,790
one-size-fits-all types of professionals
was at me

168
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:57,800
it's either encrypt it or it's not it's
secure or is it

169
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,890
if you're either its yo check the box

170
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:04,279
it's done or it isn't done for and up

171
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:07,930
the challenge is a lot of times I good
example earlier it's funny you when

172
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,910
something like cloud computing came out
a different technologies come out

173
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,029
now the latest one lot of talk about
bring BYOB

174
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:17,990
um brick bring your own device to work
BYOD on some call bring your own

175
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,510
disaster all security magazines are
saying

176
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,149
why this won't work and everybody else &
Technology magazines are saying

177
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:27,399
you know go for cloud computing same
kinda thing

178
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:32,620
so the question is when you offer
solutions Segal business meeting

179
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,940
and you say here's the architecture and
and I'll

180
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,140
you say okay you sit back and watch

181
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,790
listen that a more present their stuff
and you say okay

182
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:47,760
alright fine we can do this but we've
got a by XYZ product with these 14

183
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,380
differences you know things

184
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:54,310
are I've done this research its I don't
like it but you know K find you've got

185
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,360
past number 1 I'm gonna be an enabler

186
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,870
so here's how you do it boom

187
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,130
and everybody in the room looks at you
and says oh my goodness

188
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:08,089
that's gonna cost a million dollars this
is a hundred thousand dollar project

189
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:11,990
how we gonna do that isn't there another
way

190
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,399
although there's not one way to do it
and be an enabler I learned that lesson

191
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,959
I'm telling you we can look but get its
perceived by the business side is what

192
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,170
you disabling again why because you're
given me a million-dollar solution to

193
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,870
one thousand dollar problem

194
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:32,300
an interesting one disc a practical
example Google how many views gmail

195
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,459
so gmail just came out with the solution
if you're

196
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:39,720
worried about people getting in your
Gmail account from multiple PCs in now

197
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,720
have a a way that you can turn on
latitude level security for free

198
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,910
that will send you a tax a six digit PIN

199
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,930
if somebody tries access your account
from a different computer that's not

200
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:50,920
trusted

201
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,500
i turn that on my computer simple little
thing but guess what

202
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,970
two-factor right because now it's
sending you something you know

203
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,269
for free pursue something you have

204
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:05,339
or something you know two factors for
you have been something you know

205
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:08,920
so bottom line is second point offer

206
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:15,149
alternatives gold silver bronze approach

207
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:19,320
that is think about flying to California

208
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,440
Chicago to LA we typically have three
options

209
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,149
you can fly coach you can fly business
you can fly first class all will get you

210
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:29,450
there safely

211
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:33,209
but maybe the very different experience
along the way

212
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:36,550
now that may not work in security arm

213
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:40,800
every Nalla G but that they do usually
or multiple different approaches

214
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,610
there's there's maybe a best way but
maybe your business can afford that

215
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,990
offer alternatives may be different
companies may be different

216
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:51,350
options and help management understand

217
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,839
the good the bad and the ugly about each
option they're taking more risk if you

218
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:56,269
go with the bronze approach

219
00:12:56,269 --> 00:12:59,529
but maybe they're willing to take the
risk right so

220
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:04,079
something to consider given the full
scope cost functionality risk

221
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,339
but offer options be seen as somebody
who's a trusted consult

222
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:11,470
who's bringing options to the business

223
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:15,360
number three humble pie

224
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,600
so another perception of for
professionals in to get where do I get

225
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,529
when I get this is

226
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:24,170
I largely got this list and I ran it by
a whole variety people both within

227
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,310
government the private sector around the
country a chance to travel around the

228
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,100
world

229
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,510
ratify people in South Africa and Europe
arm

230
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:36,120
and other places and and and these with
these with common perceptions

231
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,269
security staff

232
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:43,010
dare I say it im gonna say the word are
arrogant

233
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:46,010
arrogant what does that mean

234
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:49,050
the company meetings

235
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:52,550
and they they just kinda they got the
drum corps

236
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:55,740
whatever you say whatever you do they're
gonna slap that poppy down at the right

237
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,350
moment in the meeting

238
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:01,250
you know they're just kinda like you
know is this somebody who's a partner

239
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:01,889
mine

240
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:06,399
or is it somebody who's like the other
guy in the room that nobody talks to

241
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,019
you know that kinda perception arm

242
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:14,279
the thing I would say here's this why do
we have security

243
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:18,399
think about this a minute why we have
secured a very basic level of

244
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,399
when it was work for brought a wide
variety businesses here in Grand Rapids

245
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:22,279
an all-over

246
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:26,089
maybe Michigan Ohio Indiana where you
come from Illinois

247
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:29,130
and you there because we're trying to do

248
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,170
what we're trying to do government
services

249
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:36,240
we're trying to when an airline were
trying to get people from A to B we're

250
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,300
trying to

251
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,730
sell a product we're trying to whatever
security

252
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,790
is a service as well okay

253
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,730
keeping that in mind it seems obvious
but a lot of security pros especially

254
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,829
after you go to

255
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:54,010
tons and tons of security compasses and
hang around with security people all day

256
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:57,050
often come across as always right

257
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:01,089
and not understanding the bigger picture
so

258
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:05,370
I think the kept the challenge here is
professional excellence

259
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:08,430
be good at what you do that's why you're
this conference learning the latest

260
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:08,920
techniques

261
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,630
understanding how people are hacking
into your system I mean that's great you

262
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,260
need that that's why we're here

263
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:20,089
but also knowing that whatever you
promise and I see people do this

264
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:23,449
I've been meaning two people say you
know you give me this product

265
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:26,670
I promise you on onward already

266
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:30,970
I'm scared site here that to Austin

267
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,310
in one year will never be hacked again

268
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:39,160
really the bad guys are out there
getting better all the time

269
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,750
girl or whatever your whatever water
putting up whatever security protections

270
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,560
for putting up

271
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,740
they're gonna try and get around this
and they're always going to be creating

272
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,589
new ways of trying to break it right

273
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:53,699
so knowing that the bad guys are getting
better

274
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:58,540
and that they're continually trying to
improve be careful what you promise

275
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,380
and know that look at blind spot so how
do you see which a blind spots are

276
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,579
when the ways I do that as I try and ask
people you know you know

277
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:08,889
every one of us not get along with
everybody of best friends and good

278
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:11,519
friends and hopefully you get along with
materially enterprise

279
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,870
but they're going to people that you
perceive as

280
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:20,500
maybe I don't see adversaries but maybe
people when the organization that you

281
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:20,750
don't

282
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,060
yeah maybe not referred find the ones
that you respect but maybe

283
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:29,320
have a difference of opinion on you ask
them get together for lunch task

284
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,170
you know what can I do you have the the
right professional

285
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:37,370
perspectives are people listen to me get
different perspectives

286
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,610
and trust me to provide a balanced
solution

287
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:46,870
number four this leads right into the
last one

288
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:51,790
a lotta people why I see this a lot with
our team some are sewn staffer here in

289
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,310
the room that they can relate to some

290
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:57,160
this we have a security man there
liaisons in there working

291
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,449
and a lot of times I hear people say
this and I've said it before too

292
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:06,419
so I'm not munis you come out at the big
meeting for the big new hundred million

293
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:08,530
dollar project

294
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:13,559
and you're like security is an
afterthought

295
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:18,199
these people don't understand they don't
know what they don't know

296
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:23,069
the customers clueless they don't know
what they're doing

297
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:26,370
they don't understand that this medicaid
system gets hacked

298
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:30,590
you know we're gonna come to an end they
don't know that's the mentality

299
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:35,580
and so then the creates a divide almost
between the customer

300
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:40,970
and the security team i've seen this in
most organizations in america today

301
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:45,760
its unusual that security team is a
total equal partner at the table

302
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,049
during those big requirements meetings
where the building them one you know the

303
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:51,320
million two million $5 million
hundred-million

304
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,370
$300 million billion dollar project I
heard about this

305
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:58,720
friends at the HS DOD NSA same kinda
discussions

306
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,330
so for that's the elephant in the room

307
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:06,230
the problem is they've got the money did
cut the budget the Project Manager works

308
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:09,440
for them and by the way you're one that
teen

309
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,419
so you always going to be the guy
sitting by yourself a woman sitting by

310
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:13,020
yourself

311
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,210
who's not a part of the team so what do
you do

312
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:20,340
do lunch do lunch literally

313
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,850
go out with people I tell people one
person I know I'm not gonna names

314
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:29,500
work for it. acid I said you don't does
your company have a softball team

315
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,720
the Cydia silver plate on it no

316
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,900
arm I like Sawyer dude you like softball

317
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,100
yeah love softball playing softball team

318
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,240
gets a toxic crazy advice right

319
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,450
a security professional best thing you
can do is play in the company Saab

320
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:49,230
get to know the business get to know the
other people in the room

321
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,539
go to lunch with your sick with with
those other people

322
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:56,100
that your work meet with your customers
sit down with the

323
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,510
this is 101 stuff from marketing right

324
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:03,250
this this may not be rocket science if
you are marketing conference for sales

325
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,270
conference

326
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:07,559
this is the first thing they do it's all
about lunch it's all about the

327
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:08,600
relationships

328
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,250
unfortunately for security pros this is
feeling into a lot of people

329
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:17,580
so they don't have the relationships in
the business and therefore

330
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:21,140
they are very successful arm build trust

331
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,860
and there's an article in CS own CIO
magazine I love a few years back said

332
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,750
forget security just build trust

333
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,250
I don't agree with that out these just
forget the security but the point is

334
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,720
it's written is it a good point point is
truss

335
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,830
are you trusted

336
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:41,110
and that leads right into the next topic
hackers

337
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:47,809
undervalued ethics and accountability
Ellery something

338
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:51,080
so this was from an interview i did not
going to name names to give any hints

339
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,820
about where this came from but it was a
real person

340
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,539
and they gave me their view their job

341
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:01,210
the front lines at the net that's where
most of us spend our time

342
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:05,020
life gets crazy out there a virtual wild
wild west

343
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:09,580
almost anything goes in cyberspace I
like your online world to another

344
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,950
American Gold Rush

345
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:15,070
the new frontier it's true the history
seems repeat itself

346
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:18,270
we boldly go where others or freighter
ill-equipped to go where the white

347
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:21,580
knights the few the proud the ones
willing to stick our necks out and get

348
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,320
over 20 hands dirty

349
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,940
or if you prefer we living in 1930
Chicago all over again

350
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,330
with mob rule is minimal policing going
warning people often take matters into

351
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,600
their own hands

352
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,990
it seems like an impossible task but
when the going gets tough you find out

353
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,390
what you're made of

354
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:40,510
we do we do to survive in this
dog-eat-dog digital world

355
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:44,860
we didn't create the situation I'm not
happy that I was dealt this hand

356
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,750
by making the most of it it is what it
is somebody needs to protect the

357
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,110
homestead right

358
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:54,880
truth be told things are getting worse
out there cyber ethics

359
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,500
hello most actors I know think those two
words an oxymoron

360
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,059
rules are for kids are people we need
keep in a box

361
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:07,890
what policies are you kidding me those
rules don't apply to us

362
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:11,710
sure pros understand the children need
to be protected child porn is wrong and

363
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,470
yada yada yada but beyond that

364
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:16,809
I don't have time for lectures but let
me tell you something we're dealing with

365
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:17,549
experts

366
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:20,650
hardened criminals we fight fire with
fire baby

367
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,840
but this is the big leagues at some
single a foreign team out there in the

368
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,590
bushes

369
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:28,220
were not some global game Halo we've got
real work to do

370
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:32,210
the bad guys are getting dangerous real
dangerous they don't understand or civil

371
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:35,350
respectful way of life they just keep
hitting us hard

372
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:39,330
sure its car from tyre there are no
timeouts we get a little sleep when we

373
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,220
have time

374
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,990
but them right back or night we have to
be right every time

375
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:48,030
cyberspace never sleeps this is war baby
cyberwar

376
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:51,220
all's fair in love and war

377
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:55,840
now there's a group

378
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,600
here probably will worries hands or ask
questions that that that's their view

379
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,100
that's they're kinda their worldview

380
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,130
this is what I wanna said outsider
ethics you know you talk a whole the

381
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:11,190
whole conferences on this topic but it
was a few things

382
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:14,460
the better you get at what you do

383
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,770
you learn what the hackers do your
learning the techniques in these

384
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:21,030
next two days your you you your your

385
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:25,909
you perfecting your craft your
understanding the underworld

386
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:29,909
you understand the attackers the better
you get what you do

387
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:33,100
the more you learn the more skills you
develop

388
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,179
the more you're gonna be tempted

389
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:40,650
and why mean by tempted tempted to go to
quote unquote the dark side

390
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,740
what I mean by that is this that

391
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,230
think I've somebody Houston whose
arresting

392
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:53,309
DIA no FBI arresting drug drug addicts
drug lords whatever it might be

393
00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:57,840
and they find a stash of cocaine they
find a stack of money sitting there the

394
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,049
table

395
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:02,049
and they're tempted to take some

396
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:05,400
that was lookin stack a hundred-dollar
bills I'm only makin

397
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,460
man I'm not making enough tough man

398
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:13,929
you know there is

399
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:17,690
same thing in the cyber world it's a
slippery slope

400
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:21,600
cyber ethics is key

401
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,840
and I see people you say you know were
exempt from the rules

402
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,230
why we are arm

403
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:33,809
you know we're we're the administrators
were overseeing this stuff we have to do

404
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:35,760
a BNC I understand that

405
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,730
you have a job to do and you're and your
your next door to do it great wonderful

406
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:43,380
but you take it to the next level do
that you are after not the popular

407
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,779
those rules about visiting inappropriate
sites those rules about looking a file

408
00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:47,610
cm

409
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:50,919
course take big you know which got
promoted Alyssa

410
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:54,440
how its own so God for their raise you
know and before you know it

411
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,850
sure slippery slope and they find
themselves Douro know why do I say this

412
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:03,860
people feel I've seen people in state
government walked out of the buildings

413
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,909
with handcuffs or

414
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:10,000
i've seen respected pros

415
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,400
arrested in jail felonies

416
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,440
yes and the thing is

417
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,340
its always somebody else right you know
who's worse you know we will compare

418
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,289
ourselves to Hitler

419
00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:26,179
you know we all occur is always somebody
worse than us so we never have a problem

420
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:27,250
in this area

421
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:31,919
so what do I wear where I recommend USA
do you still file for call it

422
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,520
downloading do you bend the rules
acceptable use

423
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,929
you know insider threat are you an
insider threat

424
00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:41,029
to your company realtor

425
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:45,950
I've seen people bring down a company an
organization a reputational

426
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:51,429
you know you know up a whole group
because you get a bad rap

427
00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:56,820
coupled by someone told me that the the
sport the end

428
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:01,950
find a mentor by somebody you trust
whose maybe or maybe more advanced in

429
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:02,270
the

430
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:05,890
in the industry be accountable to them

431
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:09,110
and I were talking accountability for
just the second people I think in our

432
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,590
society

433
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:14,070
have the views accountability is for
losers

434
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:18,049
if I'm good enough I need to be
accountable to anybody I'm a lone ranger

435
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:21,640
back to the store I'm you know I Y Y
West man out there it's me it's me I

436
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,520
guess everybody it's me

437
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,909
me you know me in the and the prairie

438
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:32,480
cider trary problem with that is think
about life

439
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,600
the best quarterbacks in football have
football coach

440
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:42,080
the best quarterbacks and they have
somebody who holds them accountable

441
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,500
did you do the exercise did you throw
the ball 50 times today did you do this

442
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,370
did you do that

443
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:50,059
the best musicians the best on the best

444
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:53,240
gets a B-one accountable I'm

445
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,929
really good I'm the best at University
Michigan and guess what I get to now be

446
00:25:57,929 --> 00:26:01,299
under the top PNS in all of North
America

447
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:04,490
and I'm gonna go be with them for six
months

448
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:09,840
right right the hackers know this the
bad guys know this the dark side knows

449
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,220
what

450
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,390
I'm gonna go work with this person is
the best actor in the works I'm gonna be

451
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:15,190
what accountable to that guy

452
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:18,429
you need on the positive side as well we
need to be camp

453
00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:22,929
I need to be accountable sea eso se the
Michigan I need to be accountable

454
00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:26,700
people think that way I'm that's four
and the probably most view

455
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:30,840
maybe not but I have to say having a
mentor have somebody to talk to

456
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,250
practice virtual take whatever book or
virtual integrity in the neck in a

457
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:38,470
push that but you wanna go free to talk
with us in a lot of detail cider ethics

458
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:43,230
I think it's very very important I've
seen it bring down entire programs

459
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:47,590
and individuals and careers people who
were very very good

460
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:51,730
below it so what do I mean by that word
about integrity we all talk about

461
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:53,760
integrity we need integrity

462
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,750
you know the sea elephant in the room
doing the right thing when no one else

463
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,960
is looking

464
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,320
we talk about core values ethics
integrity professionalism honesty

465
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,090
excellence respect

466
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:07,620
responsibility how do you do these
things in cyberspace I'm not going to

467
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,240
give you an answer today do this you
gotta figure that out what your values

468
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,659
are not trying to pose values on you

469
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:16,730
but whatever your values or I'll
challenge you to have a mentor and be

470
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,720
accountable to your teammates

471
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:24,340
and and and ap ask them whether or not
you're living up to what your standards

472
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:28,279
and constantly ask this because
otherwise we'll be going down this %ah

473
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,250
graphic slippery slope

474
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:33,299
you know we talked to some something
cartoons here you know

475
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:37,350
for me it was an embarrassing YouTube
video unemployment due to stupid

476
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:40,120
personal stuff I put on my Facebook page

477
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,510
you know just you know talk reputation

478
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:47,549
you on this room away be on this but I
mean clearly

479
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:51,760
there's a lot of self-destructive
behavior that's gonna hurt your career

480
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,779
on what do you have to lose you got your
job you've got your career

481
00:27:55,779 --> 00:27:59,279
you put a lot of time into it like I
said I've seen people that were fired

482
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:04,149
I've are I've got a family the relies on
me for income I R for Kidz

483
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:08,539
on I've an example and giving I got my
bachelor's degree my master's degree I

484
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:11,270
put all this time in

485
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:15,750
and I could sacrifice my future I think
about this every day

486
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:20,580
every day because I've seen people below
it for 10 to 15 to 30 minutes in

487
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,559
cyberspace

488
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:24,960
i've seen i've seen give it all up to me

489
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,340
marriage family divorce whatever might
be you get you have to decide

490
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:35,070
where that line is number six

491
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:40,370
bernau now I'll say this:

492
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:44,570
one thing about this job honey i've seen
um die hard 4

493
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:49,080
tired for it's great he does a lot of
good cyber movies out there a lot to get

494
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,669
into this field because they have that
view that see that's what it's like to

495
00:28:52,669 --> 00:28:53,419
be inside

496
00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:57,549
you know to be in this business is you
know Bruce Willis and you know he meets

497
00:28:57,549 --> 00:28:57,880
the

498
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,890
the hacker kid that you know you know is
gone

499
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:03,899
well all these different um

500
00:29:03,899 --> 00:29:07,360
friends that on them you know hacker
world and they kinda bring down the

501
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,950
infrastructure in Washington DC

502
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:12,529
acceptor a on and and and in the city
michigan

503
00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:16,880
you over the last 10 years almost every
year we've had some major incident you

504
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,419
know back

505
00:29:17,419 --> 00:29:21,590
you know I would think the power outage
but that two major malware outbreaks

506
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:25,140
major incidents where our team is in
there some that you in this room

507
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,230
had been in are kinda bunker are back
cave

508
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:31,370
forget 0 for 18 hour days or maybe a
week

509
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:35,490
just you know nonstop Louis thrown pizza
over the wall because they're just

510
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:38,700
you know doing stuff that needs to be
done

511
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:43,110
to protect the enterprise I'm not
talking about that

512
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:47,240
someone you love that stuff I actually
had reported to my family doesn't like

513
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,039
it so much

514
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:51,610
but it's actually that was like a rush
because you're in the same Cup

515
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:56,190
as I say my block in those cases usually
afterwards management you know this you

516
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:59,000
know thank you for saving the enterprise
and you know

517
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,080
like Star Wars you know there's an award
given in everybody get some got a bonus

518
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,270
in or some kind of in a certificate from
the governor and

519
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:09,289
you know we all march upon the stage in
to take a week off for

520
00:30:09,289 --> 00:30:13,940
whatever you know it is that is part of
the job

521
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:17,399
what I see happening with a lot of cyber
pros

522
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:21,669
is they lack a sensor work-life balance

523
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:24,890
and this is a challenge I just what I
don't believe this point we all have to

524
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:28,429
figure out what this is for sale would
be exercise eating right those kinds of

525
00:30:28,429 --> 00:30:28,840
things

526
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,909
again this is basic working 101

527
00:30:31,909 --> 00:30:36,789
but I think what people miss is this and
the cyberwar the security were

528
00:30:36,789 --> 00:30:39,789
is they think they're in a sprint

529
00:30:39,789 --> 00:30:43,010
they think they're in a one-mile there
are there are there in the 100 yard dash

530
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,039
may be there in the quarter mile other

531
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:49,610
the mile me fight a fire at a marathon
not a marathon runner I do run

532
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:54,350
not say I IQ if I read as fast as I
could I could probably keep up with a

533
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:57,710
lot of the Grand Rapids marathon group
for about two miles

534
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:02,169
maybe then I collapse I'm at I did in ID
on the graph

535
00:31:02,169 --> 00:31:05,460
and they just keep going right they got
25 miles to go

536
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:09,260
intake that's the problem is people are
springing

537
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:12,250
so from the from an executive
perspective would this look like from

538
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,669
the CSL

539
00:31:13,669 --> 00:31:19,019
it looks like this I've seen people who
were super stocks

540
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:22,760
for six months the alleged

541
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:27,039
you know I love sports you watch sports
somebody baseball player you see this

542
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,919
every now and then a rookie comes in

543
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:33,140
why guys incredible patent 380

544
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:37,159
40 home runs and all the sudden shoes

545
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:40,539
you know of the radar just you know 180
know you know

546
00:31:40,539 --> 00:31:44,960
everybody's their Fig the leak figured
out he can hit a curveball

547
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,950
right and now this you know just falls
off the radar nobody appears from

548
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:52,210
again happens in cyber world you know so

549
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:55,590
what does that look like have you know
notebook for warning signs again have

550
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,809
friends ask you

551
00:31:56,809 --> 00:32:01,960
Strasse Wacom at season's prepare for
that

552
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,590
take a few career as a marathon have a
strategy be willing to adjust

553
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,080
and stick with it so the some tips and
blog about how to cook to work life

554
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:09,980
balance but

555
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:13,070
think about that sometimes they say take
a step back

556
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:16,700
and again at i'm looking brought a few
than just your job in your career i'm

557
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,929
looking at family I'm looking at

558
00:32:18,929 --> 00:32:22,610
you know what are you involved in the
community I'm involved in my church if

559
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:24,399
people have all the different things I
mean

560
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,940
and and and i've seen this be a problem
for people

561
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:31,320
number seven too much

562
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:38,320
inside the box thinking to a movie do
something

563
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:42,049
this is um only be for the predator
principal

564
00:32:42,049 --> 00:32:45,500
for few some you probably noticed

565
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,760
80/20 rule but

566
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:53,500
it says this and it's true it works John
C Maxwell has a book on leadership 101

567
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:57,070
what every leader needs to know and I
think what every cybersecurity

568
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:00,700
or hacker needs to know as well twenty
percent of your time

569
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:04,860
produces eighty percent of the results
twenty percent of the people take up

570
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,549
eighty percent of your time

571
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:09,590
twenty percent of your work gives eighty
percent

572
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:13,299
love your job satisfaction twenty
percent of the people will make up

573
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:15,409
eighty percent above the decisions

574
00:33:15,409 --> 00:33:18,450
20 percent the presentation produces
eighty percent

575
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:22,490
the impact which means most viewed this
rumor going over

576
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:25,820
remember twenty percent to this in your
gonna forget eighty percent okay

577
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:29,630
I'm said that's the way it is that's
what the 80/20 rule was

578
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:32,700
he goes on 101 or it's a great list of
stuff you know

579
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,029
twenty percent of people with eighty
percent of the food 20 percent it goes

580
00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:37,370
on and on or

581
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:41,070
but it but it's true for and eighty
percent to 20 percent

582
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:44,500
to the challenges to look at

583
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,480
your role and and and what you doing now

584
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,620
and maybe you're very very good at it
but think about you know where you wanna

585
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,840
be talking five years out

586
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:57,299
eight years out ten years out

587
00:33:57,299 --> 00:34:00,840
is is is move beyond your position
description

588
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,990
so first and foremost

589
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:08,270
I wanna say this you gotta respect the
box placed around the position

590
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,780
description so what I mean by that

591
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,879
I start off by telling people that you
have a position description you have a

592
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:14,490
job

593
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:18,950
every one of us has a job I have a job
if you don't do the basic things

594
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:22,629
in that job you will be viewed as lazy

595
00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:26,190
and you'll be viewed in the enterprise
is somebody's not productive

596
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:29,980
and that we all know people bottom line
right we know people

597
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,859
that are great do they always the run in
the the fun team they're doing this they

598
00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:36,260
doing that they're all over the
corporation but they're not doing their

599
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:36,780
job

600
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,119
so you don't want this to be a problem
to you need to know this

601
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:43,349
respect the box and make sure your boss

602
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:46,829

with the right price and the right
salesmen

633
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:42,220
and the right person you're trying to
sell to

634
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:45,359
their different renditions of this but
it's got to be the right person at the

635
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,010
right place at the right time

636
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:51,050
the right silverman so does that look
like I have a great idea

637
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:54,710
somebody appear in the front row need to
buy a watch it's a great watch it

638
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,800
awesome what's

639
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,750
just what they're looking for is a great
price

640
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,800
I like them they like me and they say
and i cant buy

641
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,030
why spot one last week wrong time

642
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:11,450
rate or great products great product

643
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:14,920
great salesman wrong price

644
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:19,140
too expensive I can't afford that I
can't pay for that it's too much

645
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:22,450
or where they say great product

646
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:26,250
great price great time that guy is a

647
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:30,740
like a blank black I am not buying
anything from him

648
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:34,480
wrong person right products right price

649
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,460
wrong person so what what I tell you
that only from this

650
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:42,010
we gotta think in these terms is for
sure it is many view in this room and I

651
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:42,960
mean this

652
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,540
many view this you have great ideas
could help your company

653
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:51,359
great security ideas you're thinking of
something right now maybe you think

654
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,829
you're starting your own business

655
00:37:52,829 --> 00:37:56,980
you've got a great idea but do you know
something you say well I tried that a

656
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:00,940
year ago I tried that two years ago
nobody listened to me

657
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:04,650
and I'm not I'm not ever gonna go to my
boss again ever bring that up again

658
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:09,690
why maybe it was the wrong time

659
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:13,690
are you the right person to deliver the
message they trust you are you trusted

660
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:14,760
messager

661
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:19,070
maybe to get a friend to help you on
saint is thinking these terms

662
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:22,579
because these are the things that I see
impacting people's careers

663
00:38:22,579 --> 00:38:26,300
assembly some you're probably thinking
is basic stuff

664
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,609
I'm trying to help you in your career
that's what this is about helping you

665
00:38:29,609 --> 00:38:32,650
individually injure teams be successful

666
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:36,099
because I see this of limiting people

667
00:38:36,099 --> 00:38:40,550
I see it limiting why are they making
that decision it was so obvious that we

668
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:41,950
need those new firewalls

669
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:45,640
wise management not buying that
equipment I don't understand what's

670
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,579
going on here

671
00:38:46,579 --> 00:38:49,869
what the heck is happening

672
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:54,680
really really

673
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:59,050
what did you do last week to that person

674
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:02,140
no wonder that listen to you

675
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:05,650
a relationship with this team nobody
knows who you are

676
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:08,890
we don't trust you be delivering the
right message

677
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:12,400
these are the things I see happening
okay so I just try to go with that

678
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,800
couple quick things I think some
questions so hopefully you've got

679
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,270
questions about five minutes 7 a.m. open
up some Q&A

680
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:22,630
arm these or in the blocks but I would
just challenge you to measure your

681
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,650
success

682
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:27,530
if you think you got these things they
oh and by the way well to wrap up here

683
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,720
in a second

684
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,849
I know that everyone in this room
doesn't have all the seven issues

685
00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:35,609
if what have you if you walk away with
one or two of these things to work when

686
00:39:35,609 --> 00:39:37,070
I think you will be a success

687
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:40,400
I'm not trying this is everybody's got
all these problems that is not my point

688
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,089
today

689
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:45,880
okay I need to improve in these areas
these are areas we can all improve it

690
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,609
but I'm my point is is that picked one
or two and work on it

691
00:39:49,609 --> 00:39:52,859
measure yourself do benchmark UT

692
00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:56,990
do you benchmark your career do you look
at people around you

693
00:39:56,990 --> 00:40:00,200
I was just energy yesterday a chance to
spend some time

694
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,599
down the new facility down there and
it's Lenny

695
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,640
awesome team their 850 in a very good
1400 people

696
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,089
if you're looking for a job she is
hiring like crazy said it can't find

697
00:40:11,089 --> 00:40:13,630
enough good security people

698
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:17,630
so I mean they did they are their higher
so

699
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:21,270
the guest guys laugh in the back or even
see I

700
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:25,970
aka I'll so I'll give you some pretty
nice appraiser

701
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:30,020
sabers partnerships what I mean by this
will quickly

702
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:34,290
book it's tough out there many people
unemployed

703
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:37,450
we can't do everything well

704
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:41,790
nor should we try so Michigan security
market of others

705
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:45,470
this I was asked to speak about I offer
up some other things I would do with

706
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:48,290
miss you can do about security at
although the presentation

707
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:52,109
I was actually speak to you about your
career and in these topics today

708
00:40:52,109 --> 00:40:55,200
but but we need a partner

709
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,380
with others we partner with universities

710
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,750
we partner with Department of Homeland
Security we partner with other states we

711
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,460
partner with law enforcement we partner
with the FBI

712
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:08,240
we partner with the park you know wait
to break down the list

713
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,599
we've had other governments and other
countries call us

714
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,869
can we partner so

715
00:41:14,869 --> 00:41:18,160
the point is this give you one example

716
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,069
threat intelligence we don't do it very
well

717
00:41:22,069 --> 00:41:25,260
working now with the FBI and Department
of Homeland Security

718
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,690
we're gonna be doing some things with
some private sector companies in the

719
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:28,819
next few months

720
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,980
to the point is working together

721
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,800
we can be more effective and I think
it's kinda goes without saying

722
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:41,099
but but again it's a mindset you will
not be able to take warren the People's

723
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:43,270
Republic of China

724
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:46,420
by yourself I it's not going to work

725
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,540
now they're always our enemies or
friends or Chinese love the same

726
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,849
there are there are very organized
groups that are attacking our

727
00:41:52,849 --> 00:41:53,950
enterprises

728
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:57,240
and we have got to partner with them

729
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:01,119
with others around us

730
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,940
talk about mentors benefit cements
remark in a dive into this but

731
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:08,359
here there's a lot of benefits if in a
few never even thought of this before

732
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:12,220
go out and spend 15 minutes about
mentors you know having a mentor

733
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:15,349
you know one thing is sure: lhasa 26 out
there this is all

734
00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:19,510
kinda soft stuff but its it's pretty
amazing

735
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:22,670
when you look at the numbers and hard
numbers

736
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:26,540
that if you have a mentor you like three
times more likely to get promoted

737
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:29,740
you three times more likely to achieve
your career goals are five times more

738
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,200
like

739
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,550
its weight down unless it is their
studies on this stuff

740
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:37,680
okay I'm not making this up this stuff
is out there you can research the

741
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,680
numbers

742
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,950
meant that being a mentor and some me
miss you love your dick 1 I'm going to

743
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:44,440
retire in three years I'm beyond that

744
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,010
I i'm really I'm at their I'm at the
Twilight in my career I would hit the

745
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:49,030

00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,410
things like social media and kinda the
new you know like this

754
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:18,950
that's pretty cool idea as well so it's
a two-way street I think managers gain

755
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:21,000
from it as well

756
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,540
these the personal professional
satisfaction this organizational

757
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:27,410
benefits it's really alternately a
win-win

758
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:31,930
arm its its it really shows that you're
thinking about the future

759
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:35,579
serologist wrap-up by saying really

760
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:39,089
arm its were ever your act

761
00:43:39,089 --> 00:43:44,490
in your career this last slide
expressions

762
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:49,390
wherever you're at your career take an
honest assessment of yourself and look

763
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:52,089
at the seven areas

764
00:43:52,089 --> 00:43:56,310
people see you wish to disable or be
known as an enabler stop saying no

765
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:59,960
make things happen offer solutions you
always hear that do you bring me

766
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:04,420
executives are you bringing me problems
are you dreamy solutions

767
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:09,560
that's a common state you probably over
fifty times but its very basic

768
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:13,339
people who knew it we got a big issue
dan I love to hear

769
00:44:13,339 --> 00:44:16,869
I know exactly what we need to do here's
why

770
00:44:16,869 --> 00:44:21,520
his workers support I D here's what I
need to get this taken care of

771
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:25,220
love it go-getter arm

772
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:29,619
not enough alternate solutions research
were other people around you doing are

773
00:44:29,619 --> 00:44:32,060
you the first one in the world doing
this

774
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:36,800
probably not who's doing it around you
can I learn from them can I are gonna

775
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,990
see plagiarized

776
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:41,599
can I can I call somebody as a partner
and use what they're doing and I learned

777
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,099
from that

778
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:45,520
not enough humble pie general liability
professional excellence

779
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,069
the customer is clueless are the really
clueless

780
00:44:49,069 --> 00:44:53,349
maybe should go to lunch with them what
do they know that you don't know

781
00:44:53,349 --> 00:44:57,550
they probably know something you know
prove the relationship build trust

782
00:44:57,550 --> 00:45:01,740
are you an insider threat think about
your ethics

783
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,230
it's a slippery slope maybe you're fine
now but you're headed in the wrong

784
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:07,569
direction maybe need a coarse adjustment
their

785
00:45:07,569 --> 00:45:11,579
are you burned out persevere to work
life balance member your career is a

786
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:14,880
marathon not a sprint it doesn't and
when you're thirty

787
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,940
its gonna go on think long term and that
if your perspective is stuck in the box

788
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:23,720
move beyond your position description
bill teamwork skills and larger network

789
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,190
in the industry you here today that's
good

790
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:29,160
what got you in the room is it enough to
be successful you need to look in the

791
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,690
mirror and recognize that you are the
biggest hurdle

792
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:35,569
make yourself remember the team step
back to be honest this tortured journey

793
00:45:35,569 --> 00:45:38,760
okay 16 questions got 10 minutes made a

794
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,089
five minutes first questions the hardest

795
00:45:42,089 --> 00:45:49,089
your question there

796
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:17,600
sure so are questions about political
where I presume you not talking

797
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,530
political democratic republic in your
talking office politics

798
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:24,300
so some you involved in politics some
work I'll leave that out of the species

799
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,430
if you know whoever you gonna vote for
President or whatever but

800
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:30,900
but the office politics sure you're
absolutely right i mean clearly picking

801
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,520
the right man sir is key

802
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,650
i mean i i you know knowing somebody
hugh

803
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:39,690
you respect is respected in the industry
somebody who

804
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:43,700
you feel like you watch the way you know
you know hopefully you

805
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:48,200
you know them or you you know you you've
watched them in the industry

806
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:52,170
and you respect them and who has
demonstrated

807
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:57,160
I would say through their career that
they are successful and they have

808
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,500
successfully navigated the politics

809
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,660
because you're absolutely right i mean
it is a challenge it is a

810
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:06,390
it is a challenge in government is a
challenge in the private sector

811
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:10,080
there's always office politics going on
and I think

812
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:15,440
just one other thing I'd say on this
that's the kinda Frank solution

813
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,270
that a mentor can do because the thing
I've seen with my mentors

814
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:24,190
is I could pick up the phone and just
say let's chat let's talk about this

815
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:28,130
it's not like it's not based upon do
they know this factor that fact they can

816
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:30,370
look it up on the Internet I'm not
talking about

817
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:34,240
you know how to how to hack this act
that mean i'm talking about.

818
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,540
somebody who can help you with your
career you trust

819
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:41,510
you can have a very open honest
conversation but I certainly agree with

820
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:42,050
you

821
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:46,080
your pick the right answer and you've
got to have somebody who

822
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:49,600
on has demonstrated has a track record
of success

823
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:54,620
right you know so young professional
sports you pick somebody who

824
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:58,180
has been there done that you know if
your quarterback you're picking somebody

825
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:59,290
who's been an all-american
