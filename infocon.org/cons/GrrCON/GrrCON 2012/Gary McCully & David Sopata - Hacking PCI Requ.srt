1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,359
alright so we're going to start of

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,750
we've got some a problem here

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,920
and I we're gonna so

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,740
basically our problem with PCI standard

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,900
are one of the problems worse of course
nobody has a lot of problems PCI

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,100
when we side is our focus on what's
requirements 6.6

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,769
and essentially that the problem is

8
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:31,869
you have to do some sort where
application assessment

9
00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:35,270
or you have to have some sort of web
application

10
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,399
firewall or weft in place %uh veer
payment applications that are extremely

11
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:43,710
excessive arm so the problem that we're
sorta seeing with

12
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,489
definitely with other assessments is
when we go back and do more technical

13
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:49,219
assessments on these web applications

14
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:52,890
are still vulnerable and and lotta time
sir simple

15
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,960
vulnerabilities that could be picked up
by simple me

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,370
so here's a little agenda about are

17
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:06,510
our presentation so we're gonna go over
brief discussion on PCI standard and

18
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,060
also requirements xxx

19
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,290
so it's kinda boring part for yet that
at that

20
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,570
at least get you some the knowledge in
some the background knowledge but then

21
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,189
we start going into our fail section

22
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:20,150
and as for Gary comes his basic gonna
start showing some

23
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,950
instances how in real situations that

24
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:28,180
these are simply of course arm but a lot
of times I we going to organizations

25
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,329
and were able to actually make these
different things fail

26
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:34,979
or we bypass these different things such
as however location firewalls

27
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:38,380
application scanners I

28
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,340
pure code reviews except and then we're
gonna have a little discussion about

29
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,979
arm some my view points for a PCI from a
QS a

30
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:49,310
and then gary is gonna talk about some
his point views from

31
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:56,310
application sasser ORAC alright so I am
my dear mccauley

32
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:03,090
today I will be playing love after I'm a
security consultant

33
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,229
secure state on and secure stay I do all
types upon

34
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:10,800
fun things I get that perform physical
penetration assessments we actually

35
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,620
tried to break in

36
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,170
organizations visible locations with
sons

37
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:19,420
guards also perform internal tech

38
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,800
penetration assessments external tech
assessments wireless penetration

39
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,950
aspen's alt believer not even do some
more dialing from time to time

40
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,420
all those remember what that is and then
also

41
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,319
one thing I've been working on lately is
i'd developing implementing

42
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:41,830
a boner programs so

43
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:45,680
I am david spock and I am now E

44
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,730
XQ essay so meaning that I have

45
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,450
come soon not recently had left secure
state

46
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:56,400
pursued another type uva environment and

47
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,230
but what I did is actually says
organizations for the PCI compliance

48
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:04,690
I for a while level 1 merchants and
we'll get into that

49
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,810
some other sturm analogy and so the
other slides on

50
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,720
also a lot of the other work that I did
to you was other risk assessments

51
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,459
understanding love different types
control frameworks from

52
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:19,840
risk to you a vulnerability assessments
to

53
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,390
understanding like hip I so 27001 into

54
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:28,280
exciter so

55
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,920
a little disclaimer sense I no longer
with secure safe and also work for

56
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,549
another type

57
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:36,049
employer on this is why those this where
is that they always have you do you if

58
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:36,470
you

59
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,269
work for imported doesn't like you
representing that so essentially

60
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:43,370
this says that a know these

61
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,989
not this presentation arms I love my own
opinion and do not reflect any

62
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:52,620
past present or future employer do not
actually represent a passer present

63
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,060
positions on the PCI Council QS a
company's

64
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:03,060
or payment brands for small puppies so

65
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,900
for those you have not been living under
a rock this is actually look it up on

66
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:13,900
if you haven't done PCI I organ so

67
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,509
what is PCI well what end up happening
was

68
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:21,859
all the car brands they wanna try
prevent fraud so what they did

69
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:25,320
is a developer to security standards and
so from the security standards

70
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,720
the actually are did eighty

71
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,310
the made all the emergence actually do
all this so if your merchant you

72
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,040
actually took

73
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,040
visa/mastercard express you actually
have to do

74
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,389
security assessments for all three those
car brands

75
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:45,860
that was very cumbersome so with the old
is he also to get together and create

76
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,860
one big standard call the PCI DSS

77
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,419
or data security standard

78
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:58,070
and PCI stands for the payment card
industry

79
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,699
see so essentially depending on how you
process credit cards and how many levels

80
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:06,930
love critic how many credit cards
actually process and how you credit

81
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,160
process credit cards is depend upon what
type of reporting have to do

82
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,520
so either one you have to do a level one
rock

83
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,620
which you actually have to have a guy
like me or who I used to be

84
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,710
up go onsite perform assessment do an
audit

85
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,880
and then say either pass or fail or you

86
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,060
do a we call a self-assessment
questionnaire one SAQ

87
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,000
and so from that you'd actually just say
you know I'm good game to your bank in

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,710
bank says

89
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:37,020
okay let's get to me

90
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:42,000
right so there's little to catch that
out the first part

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,590
level 2 merchants in some cases they
have the ability to have

92
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,729
econ ISA or a information security
assessor

93
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:54,060
so if you see actually stands for a
qualified security assessor

94
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,210
I'm an ISA is someone that's internals
your network

95
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:03,490
may be part of an audit team that takes
the same training that ok USA would take

96
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,789
level-1 level-2 level 3 level for those
are the different levels

97
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:10,620
%uh merchants so your little ones are
like your Walmart you know before sorry

98
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,090
mom and pop shops they're just taking
credit cards with Nicholas

99
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,110
or maybe even with the card card swipe
machine

100
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:21,210
arm those will determine arm

101
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,370
what I process what you have to do now

102
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,949
in some instances of your level for
merchant you could potentially actually

103
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:32,490
be required to do a level one assessment
or perform a rock for I have to come on

104
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,050
site do an assessment because your bank
considers you will

105
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:40,460
high-risk and this happens when you
become breached

106
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,479
so little about the actual standard
itself has a lot of controls

107
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,729
has over 220 some controls so

108
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:51,000
try and find that your organization and
making a fit within your organization

109
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,870
it's pretty rough arm also

110
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:59,590
there is some qualifications as to how
you process your credit cards

111
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,889
depending on how you actually processing
your credit cards will depend upon

112
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:07,380
how many controls you actually have to
potentially prove your compliance to you

113
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,289
generally they always say that you have
that complied all the controls but

114
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:14,949
on your health report on some so for
instance if your chest

115
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:17,940
I'm doing what what I call the not
knuckle Buster redo a card imprint

116
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,880
machinery just swipe it over and it
doesn't little imprint carbon copy

117
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,389
that would be what we call Saqr
self-assessment questionnaire

118
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:30,160
a subset %uh requirements out so that
would be about 20 controls

119
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,030
SAQ be is when you have all those credit
card machines are hooked up to a

120
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:39,050
phones phone jack or something like that
so just swipe it

121
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,740
that's probably closer to about forty
controls essay QC and CVT

122
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,900
are pretty similar but a little bit
different SAQ seat

123
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,199
is when you are you have 8 validated
payment application

124
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,289
you're using to process credit cards and

125
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:58,780
you have to buy by about 60 controls are
so SAQ CVT

126
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,830
is when you're using a terminal such as
like

127
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:06,190
any computer that goes on to a web
browser that then connects up to another

128
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:10,990
payment system online somewhere else so
all those systems are using to process

129
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,870
credit cards

130
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:15,150
have to have compliant controls on them
is about six contracts

131
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:19,979
and then you have your Dez set the great
the people get when they're

132
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:23,710
and they're doing their PCI compliance
but what it is is all the controls

133
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:27,360
so that means that you're storing
processing and transmission credit card

134
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,099
information

135
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:31,370
and that's very key with understand the
scope of PCI so

136
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:35,060
PCI the scope of it is all about credit
card information

137
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:39,080
a pan which is a their personal

138
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,419
account number which is your credit card
number and

139
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:45,269
the expiration date technically those
are the only two things you need to

140
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:48,450
process a credit card however a lot of
merchant merchant banks

141
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:52,250
and processors require you to also use
the week all the CVV code

142
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,750
several different versions are names
love that CV cobras the three little

143
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,440
digit

144
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,860
number the sauna back to credit card

145
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,529
so let's consider the meat vote were
kinda talking about says for the

146
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:06,600
background a PCI and some other high
level stuff guys have questions or

147
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,899
whatever you can feel free to talk to me
after the

148
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:13,160
presentation but right now are focusing
on one control

149
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,250
and so this controls about publicly
facing applications that process credit

150
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,380
card information

151
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,930
you have to have either some sort love
arm

152
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:26,360
application assessment or application
vulnerability assessment

153
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,600
code review or you can have what we call
a web application firewall

154
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,450
install in front of here web application
on

155
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,570
so if you look at what I highlighted

156
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:43,370
public-facing web applications so that
means the only thing that's required a

157
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,560
be assessed stuff is facing publicly

158
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,589
doesn't necessarily mean the census
facing on the inside

159
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,730
but you have to have stuff externally
facing

160
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:56,430
definitely has to have a more
scrutinized assessment

161
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,640
done to it

162
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,860
so the next the intended the control

163
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,220
was really to try to ensure that

164
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:10,790
we're protecting credit card information
access for this is about fraud

165
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:14,230
art and here are the things that we're
trying to protect against

166
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,730
you see the requirements 6f I

167
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,829
base we talk about all the different I
stuff if you are

168
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:25,209
familiar with all lost it is a standard
for

169
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:28,360
sure that you doing SecureCode practice
and

170
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,670
these are this is just a high-level
overview of some other different things

171
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,200
are looking for such a sequel injection
cross-site scripting

172
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,380
the usual suspects arm

173
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:42,220
an additional layer try to find
additional vulnerabilities

174
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,899
are is your normal other assess the
other tie in from PCI standpoint

175
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:49,410
now depending on how your processing
credit card information you may not be

176
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,060
required to do

177
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,170
penetration test finally susman except

178
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:57,329
however with this one

179
00:10:57,329 --> 00:11:02,060
that a lot of times if you don't have to
if you actually store credit card

180
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,200
information

181
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,420
your penetration testing and all that
stuff you have to do it

182
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,420
just kind of amazing my my opinion arm

183
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,779
reason why lies patrols exists because
something happened such

184
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:18,279
as the Hartland payment systems they got
breached

185
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:25,279
so when that happen some these other
control sorry came around

186
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:30,300
so sure the four options that you're
allowed to do to meet that requirement

187
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,450
so we have men love you application
source code

188
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:37,810
peer code review I could also be third
party review your code

189
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:41,600
could also even be are sir static code
analysis

190
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,880
which is that the second one as well

191
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,880
I V CAST you some sorta manual
vulnerability assessment

192
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,410
so you can actually Papa through some
sort of vulnerability assessor

193
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,930
to whatever I also

194
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:58,510
another thing is I that you can also
potentially do you

195
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:04,519
is you some sort of automated scanning

196
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:08,240
so here's all the things from a web
application firewalls

197
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,279
this is the or part so when you have the
revocation firewalls

198
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:15,980
these are the all all the capabilities
post a half

199
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,190
I'm not gonna see here in the small out
for yah but

200
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:22,300
you know some other big ones is
definitely have few

201
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,320
at least protect against lost top 10 or

202
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,970
assess things to make sure that you're
looking for the lost top 10

203
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,220
vulnerabilities

204
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,380
arm try to prevent data leakage try to
prevent

205
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:37,680
inspection page content underlying
protocols

206
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,850
also making sure that

207
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:44,829
you feel open also has the capabilities
love

208
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:49,560
prevent session detect session token
tampering et cetera

209
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,130
away or thing is he was being able to
place it in the correct position

210
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:56,500
so if you if you put your web
application firewall in the wrong place

211
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,320
second people actually inspect the
traffic so

212
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,060
if if you're everything's great to just
going through the web application

213
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,920
firewall

214
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,610
well then you're basically knowing the
point of having a web application

215
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,680
firewall yet to try to put it in the
place for

216
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,089
the encryptions been terminated you can
actually see the traffic this

217
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:18,660
come in for so

218
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,470
gonna turn this part of the Gary and
this is where things get a little more

219
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,779
interesting sense

220
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:26,570
he gets to show you how he's bypass all
the stuff

221
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,910
alright so let me turn to give you look
context

222
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:35,360
why this became me well you see all the
stuff right here right i mean

223
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,180
I I see these web application firewalls
you're supposed to be for these PCI

224
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,760
applications and

225
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,820
I see a young web application scanners
are supposed to be in these web

226
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,800
applications

227
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,470
and then what happens what I go to
perform external penetration assessment

228
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,760
you know what I find

229
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,740
I find all takes a vulnerability is all
over these web applications

230
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:57,430
so I have to take him back one the
world's going

231
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,810
I thought this post these are these are
externally

232
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:05,730
piecing applications are your processing
transmitting

233
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:09,010
I'll are credit card data here

234
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:13,130
like what in the world anything I would
expect these to be

235
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:17,320
really secure things in the environment
right mean if these are lockdown

236
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,519
we got some major issues here so on

237
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:24,199
that's kinda pique my interest so

238
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:27,910
on this is my so my rights here with

239
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,949
with the standard number one many
scanners a web application firewalls

240
00:14:31,949 --> 00:14:34,949
they're not finding now lost top 10

241
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:37,970
their on blocking Texas

242
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:41,360
on are preventing

243
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,740
process scripting and see action attacks
in

244
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:49,160
different things like that now actually
going to fail give you a few examples

245
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,529
how these web application firewalls
applications

246
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:56,649
you and arm and as a byproduct

247
00:14:56,649 --> 00:15:00,350
you get a bunch organizations have a
false sense of security right

248
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:05,220
like okay well we just we just the
weather application with Aki next we

249
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,490
should be OK from here on out you know

250
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,620
we have nothing to worry about meantime

251
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,980
I there the web applications covered his

252
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,199
had some instances these vulnerabilities
can be exploited

253
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:23,529
show on operating system some big
problems

254
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:26,660
so for my little experiment okay well

255
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,959
Web Application Firewall alright let's
let's take a look at some of these web

256
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:31,079
application firewalls

257
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:34,720
already out there let's see how well
they actually do you

258
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,850
at preventing the most the sixth form

259
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:41,100
across expecting are now the most basic
form

260
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,529
in my opinion was this I'm able to
inject into

261
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:47,579
arbitrary location in the HTML

262
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:51,019
and all I'm trying to do is get some
sort of stupid alert

263
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:54,660
the pop up on my screen so that sounds
you know

264
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,870
I access or color are you now hacks or
something

265
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,870
basically in this is crossing scripting
one-on-ones

266
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:05,990
I'm not trying to do anything advanced
here running inserting into

267
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:11,769
I either HTML existing HTML tax which is
a formal process

268
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:15,310
are hijacking on II are ready

269
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:20,529
II already on Cody JavaScript that's
another former process

270
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:24,070
of I can inserted directly into jobs

271
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:30,380
sorry online essentially this is what
I'm at the most basic stuff here

272
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,459
so let's talk about the first our first
one here

273
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:36,509
Logic Pro France so now

274
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:40,040
now let me give you a disclaimer this is
out of the box configurations

275
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,519
okay because let's be honest that's what
most organizations are doing right

276
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:48,290
they're using at the box I
configurations for these

277
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,829
whether on web application firewalls
they're putting from the web application

278
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:54,910
and then they're washing their hands
well why are they doing

279
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:58,230
wall arm let me let me show you why here
all

280
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:03,100
take a look at this for here province is
a soft appliance which installs in

281
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:03,600
minutes

282
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,799
and any standard server converting to a
full-featured stand-alone

283
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:12,400
web application firewall to prevent all
are provides full compliance with the

284
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,990
PCI DSS

285
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:17,169
and complete lost ha her body

286
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:20,620
protection this is definitely

287
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:24,900
marketing at its finest so you always
see this with any type of software

288
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,630
application whatever yes yes if anybody
tells you that something's

289
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,799
will make you will make you fall come
fully compliant

290
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:35,130
or is fully compliant always question

291
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:38,929
yes now the thing I like the most West
quote here that says

292
00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:43,049
minutes on because I mean this is in
minutes so

293
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:47,700
so they're assuming a default
configuration here so I

294
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,100
if you go through and use this this Web
Application Firewall

295
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,510
actually do some whitelisting it would
it would be a decent web application

296
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,410
firewall

297
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,570
my how many here can configure
whitelisting within minutes

298
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:03,830
that's that's why I'm a task that takes
I days or weeks

299
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:07,559
sometimes so weird I might default
configurations here

300
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,570
I and i got this from away be proud on
CNN's

301
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:14,020
website here I laughter so let's see

302
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,049
how how how how well the stars here

303
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:21,039
so at alright I'm I started off pretty
well here right

304
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,000
locks and block script alert access ass
crack

305
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,679
so I might good for that for that they
know how to code

306
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:35,549
web application firewalls however didn't
block

307
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:39,160
does anybody notice the difference

308
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:44,200
nap that is all that it took to bypass
this Web Application Firewall

309
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,200
its default configuration is that not a
problem

310
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,370
his anybody else this is concerning

311
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:58,260
I so so chalk one up for that the
hackers and in 02 web application

312
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,850
firewalls at this point the talk

313
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:03,510
and also the other thing is to ally
these different you know

314
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:07,650
solutions are signature-based and so
this is just a prime example of

315
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,539
something being signature-based

316
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:14,250
yes it's all is looking for is just that
that other tack

317
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:18,169
I thought let's go take a look at the
next so I I'm keeping my fingers crossed

318
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:21,809
next alright so this one again out of
the box configuration

319
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:26,390
ap hear that under are now this is this
is something I actually got from their

320
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,240
website

321
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,320
hello Is this that defender now only
meets application

322
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,250
your firewall requirements PCI yes a 6.6

323
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:38,070
but also offers comprehensive protection
against sequence action cross-site

324
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,860
scripting

325
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,480
and scores a other application I level
attacks

326
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,039
right out up the box I wanna quit now

327
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:49,380
right out of the box that's the key word
so once again

328
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,900
you take time to do some whitelisting
maybe this isn't the case but they're

329
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,080
claiming that outta the box is doing
this

330
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,890
so what does it take to buy passes I C
you can see here

331
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,080
there's a configuration people security
profile

332
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,669
art now let's take a look here of kinda
how I found

333
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:11,210
on how to to get something to their
across expecting XQ

334
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,270
so first I use the word II script

335
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:17,409
okay ep okay that's good

336
00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:21,360
I used the word iframe and

337
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,159
so it blocks iframe I HTML tag their

338
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:28,870
however it did not black yet

339
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:32,070
did HTML see them but it did

340
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:36,190
block this next one this next one is a
formal process for

341
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:39,820
for you actually

342
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,780
style at review and actually search jobs

343
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,980
style attribute their okay but a block
thats

344
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,320
alright now I tried I Titanic

345
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,620
couple changes in my results

346
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:58,510
executed is anybody noticed a difference
between these two

347
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:02,309
okay I'm gonna give you a sec alright so

348
00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:06,500
there's the one before here's the one
now

349
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:12,000
and I just changed the word a word

350
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,880
to the working for I gotta pop pop

351
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,690
re: so and and this is a really
important thing to grasp here because

352
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:24,830
we all know that hackers right malicious
javascript with the word

353
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:28,070
I that's that's just a no brainer right

354
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:31,130
and I'm just of course

355
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:34,130
an attack doesn't wanna learn you to
what they're doing

356
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:37,390
that we just had to be selling right so
this again this is

357
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:40,429
signature-based web application
firewalls at their finest

358
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:45,539
their obviously on the word color
filtering on the words iframe

359
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:48,970
they're not filtering on the word here
and

360
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:53,280
were confirmed thing is to ascertain its
back to some the other assessments

361
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,140
so your automated tools a lot of them
gonna try these different types

362
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:00,289
have simple expressions and what we
gonna do

363
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:03,690
going to use the word where use the word
you know

364
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:08,000
cross-site scripting X s so a silly
thing to

365
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,130
they're kind of making these tools that

366
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:16,679
to pass simple vulnerability assessment
tools

367
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:20,720
so let's %uh let's take a look at the
final one this one was the 1i had all my

368
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,409
money

369
00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:25,340
I was a betting man I would all my money
on this there's a couple reasons for

370
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,190
this

371
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:29,840
number one is so the box configuration

372
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,270
said that locks a top threats like seek
injection cross-site scripting

373
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,490
and many more by up policing thanks

374
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,720
tactics a playa but this is what really
got me

375
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,860
PCI compliant from for this is amazing

376
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,240
I mean maybe he was PCI compliant number

377
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,500
by I for one so on same while

378
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,140
this is gonna be top rank firewall
action here and nap

379
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,650
miracles and magic code bypass I'll take
the stock

380
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:03,929
so let's see what happens I so there we
go there's the configuration use

381
00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:07,740
I did the box figuration you see it up
blocks ego in check

382
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:11,730
scripting directory browsing in all
types fun stuff

383
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:15,419
so my car I let solid roll up our
sleeves now

384
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:19,179
i right here we go first for shot
blocked it

385
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:22,740
okay iframe source JavaScript alert

386
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:29,740
bingo are score one for a for the PCI
compliant from birth people

387
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,419
that fail

388
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:36,570
this executed just by arm

389
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:40,820
does anybody even notice the difference

390
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:47,169
right there that all it took to bypass a
PCI compliant Web Application Firewall

391
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:50,880
from for very surprising so

392
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,770
so so you can kinda see no more I'm just
a little bit disillusioned

393
00:23:54,770 --> 00:24:01,169
by some stop that you know I read about
the PCI stop

394
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:04,370
I I don't think it's it's really doing
its job very well

395
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:07,970
but you can see how this would give
companies a false sense of security

396
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:11,000
i mean they're saying hey I a

397
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,299
I got a PCI compliant for what number I
don't have to worry about anything

398
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:19,470
and and then all that someone has to do
is remove the final script

399
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:24,470
final bracket execute so this is kinda
scary

400
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:28,289
so let's go into another example here
alright so now let's talk about

401
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:31,520
on by the application scanners alright
so

402
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,330
this is an example thought that this is
an example page I create

403
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:38,360
okay on I'm I i'm not the best

404
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:43,390
creating web applications as you can
tell but its it's the basic point across

405
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,010
right

406
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:47,580
so you see here that says please enter I
your name

407
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,440
and then if your new user just the word
new user in

408
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,730
right and that is is that %um your
employee ID

409
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:58,299
you're rollin you submit your submit
your query alright

410
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:02,940
now you might think that this is silly
but this paper stuff really happens

411
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:07,409
if you view I perform hundreds a web
application assessments

412
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:10,870
and many times there's directions on the
screen that's just like

413
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:14,340
if you are you know the president Iran

414
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,840
you should Iran something like that I
mean

415
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,340
that this type of stuff occurs

416
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:25,480
where actually tell you on the page do
you a specific action

417
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,400
alright so let's see what happens if we
obey the rules all right we put wall

418
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:34,260
now we put bob in here alright so what
happens once is welcome back

419
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:38,110
and that's all it happens nothing
nothing exciting

420
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:42,820
right I so let's go to I now know what
happens if we put the word new user in

421
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,380
there

422
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:47,890
alright well guess it reflects the
employee ID

423
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:51,000
now if I'm an attacker I'm able to read
the screen

424
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,159
I'm gonna say you know what if it tells
me to put the word

425
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,779
use I know that something's up something
that's going to be happening on the

426
00:25:57,779 --> 00:25:58,360
backend

427
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,390
this web application that's gonna be
different

428
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:04,710
then if I the word new user in there so
you know how i met us the web

429
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,600
application

430
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,120
want that ass I'm gonna performance to
put the word new user

431
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,600
and as a result employee ID gets
reflected back well because of that

432
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,419
you can hijack employee ID because
there's no filtering going on

433
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:20,799
and you get your your pap here your

434
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,010
alert access to pop the point is

435
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:27,140
weather application scanners are not
finest

436
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:31,549
ability you know why when application
scanner scam

437
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:35,190
they're unable to read or unable to
figure this type of stuff out there

438
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,070
unable to

439
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:39,740
read the pages okay new user that
something I should try and

440
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,270
next time with running my next on my
next class but this stuff is real

441
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:49,500
this these real everyday examples things
I encounter

442
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,950
are right now this is on I'm not going
to go into details on this one this ones

443
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:54,380
kinda

444
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,779
II fun on I exploit I

445
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:02,480
on and using a lot more lately on so
it's a form a sequel injection

446
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,529
in which you're able to whole contents
on

447
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:08,610
Oracle Database and you're able to do
this type of thing

448
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:13,150
I literally string concatenation on so
it's based off a true and false

449
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:17,230
better base of the way that website
provides information back to the user

450
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,230
base of

451
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:21,570
true parameter in a false parameter on
things like that

452
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:25,610
now what I've noticed is this is a
pretty

453
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:30,080
sequel on but it works and I've been
able Paul

454
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,970
Otto on various databases using the
state's attacks before

455
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:37,570
a lot a web application scanners the not
gonna be

456
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:41,690
on intelligent an offer they don't have
necessarily the right

457
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:46,149
on signatures for a particular
situations allow web applications

458
00:27:46,149 --> 00:27:49,490
gonna miss this type this form a
sequence action which is something that

459
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:54,630
an attacker who knows what they're doing
is gonna find

460
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:58,250
are and then finally this is %ah this is
like a logic

461
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:01,250
law okay so and this logic for you can
see

462
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:04,390
real-life okay this is the fake whether

463
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:08,020
but this is based off a real-life
example of something I've encountered

464
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,830
in in the field okay so you'll see here
that

465
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:15,360
the rule okay is set to user right

466
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,110
and it says welcome to company for oh
hello you don't have administrator

467
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:19,789
rights

468
00:28:19,789 --> 00:28:23,149
okay on what do I do while since I'm

469
00:28:23,149 --> 00:28:26,600
attacker I'm going to play around with
that war parameter there

470
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,760
and if you change it to something like
manager you're now greeted with a lotta

471
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,880
additional fun information on

472
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:39,370
now the key to this is on it's once
again it's the logic it's the logic for

473
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:43,210
web application firewalls not an attack
this tape recorder ability

474
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:46,659
the reason being is because if a manager
login to the site

475
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:51,340
they should have them manager access so
it will look like a valid URL

476
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:55,520
user logs in to the site where it says
user that the user should have that tape

477
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,179
access that CP Allen URL so either case
it's a valid URL

478
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:03,549
it's just that I i it's just that its
its I

479
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:07,100
there's a logic and so that's the main
problem

480
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,730
on weather applications and they're not
been identified the staple

481
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:15,330
ability even if they happened to figure
out the word manager

482
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:18,770
you know even additional information all
would look like it's valid each you know

483
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:20,010
that pops up on the back

484
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:26,010
anyway so web applications again are
going to get the side

485
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:29,929
alright so we kinda taking a look at
some other

486
00:29:29,929 --> 00:29:33,330
some these problems on I'd another thing
to know

487
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:37,690
is actually I install honorable

488
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:41,169
saw vulnerable to like different forms

489
00:29:41,169 --> 00:29:44,190
and i cant bypassed wheels

490
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:48,120
do that as well including firewalls
other

491
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:52,260
just surprising is at a pretty high I'm
Application Firewall

492
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:56,470
so it's not just crossed the script I
want to keep it to cross site scripting

493
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:00,299
I wanted get one example by this can
also be applied

494
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:04,100
different see Jackson well on

495
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,850
so this is so so now let's talk about
this

496
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:11,000
white what exactly's wrong here with

497
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,010
with PCI 6.6 I so

498
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:17,140
the first thing that kinda concerns me
and

499
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:22,390
on is is so they say you can't do these
web application scans

500
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:25,590
and you meet the end 6.6

501
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,909
remember we're not talking about you
know I A in H

502
00:30:28,909 --> 00:30:32,600
our site has disappointed garbage on
we're talking about

503
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,520
web applications they're doing something
with your credit card

504
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:41,250
okay so you take a look here

505
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:44,760
PCI doesn't even require that the skins
beyond panicky

506
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,630
okay it doesn't it doesn't layout any
sort of guideline

507
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:52,909
so how many of you have gone to website
says

508
00:30:52,909 --> 00:30:56,149
and then you create your own account and
then you're dropped into you

509
00:30:56,149 --> 00:30:59,480
the four site hi to your account

510
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,899
well PCI dozens doesn't complain and say
hey by the way if you can do all this

511
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:04,470
stuff

512
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:07,720
in the past been authenticated scheme on

513
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,440
sOooo that's a problem because a lot of
times we can to get this Eminem security

514
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,000
right

515
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,649
to the login page is all crunchy and
hard run your application Skinner

516
00:31:15,649 --> 00:31:16,500
against that

517
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,779
web applications can find nothing
however when you log into the website

518
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:24,580
you're greeted with all types a fun your
abilities you know it's a playhouse upon

519
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,860
our abilities

520
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:30,510
see Jackson crosses all over the inside
the app

521
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:36,539
you're not going to find on outside so
me that's that's a problem

522
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:39,549
so

523
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:44,440
here's my response so currently there is
no standard for

524
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,630
how these things are actually completed
so there is no standard

525
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:52,669
love a code review the guidance the
additional Ganesh is just says

526
00:31:52,669 --> 00:31:56,529
do peer code review have a third party
look at it another good

527
00:31:56,529 --> 00:32:00,149
example love a good review would
possibly be sold in a static code now

528
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:02,190
such as like Erica

529
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:05,730
I am the the problem is is that

530
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:09,190
there's nothing sorta saying hey I know
how to use my tools

531
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:13,360
or be I have these tools I know how to
use them

532
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,590
but no one saying that I have to do this
so what i do is i encounter a lot

533
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:21,269
as a QS a would be organization access
to

534
00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:24,909
have a web occasion vulnerability
assessment before

535
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:28,529
well winds up happening is they just
look at that

536
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:32,070
one for spar that webpage and they don't
look anything else

537
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:35,950
and from a PC i've seen. point comply

538
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:40,140
rescue standpoint you not comply so
money always things I always preach to

539
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,110
people when they're going through PCR
process

540
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:45,240
is fleiss's not always able security

541
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,269
I another issue that always comes up

542
00:32:48,269 --> 00:32:52,169
is resource availability so you mean I
always have

543
00:32:52,169 --> 00:32:55,149
the ability to hire someone to do all
these code reviews if you're a small

544
00:32:55,149 --> 00:32:58,419
organization cuz there's a lot of small
organizations at

545
00:32:58,419 --> 00:33:01,840
take credit cards and

546
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,649
a lot of times too they won't have the
resources actually perform code reviews

547
00:33:06,649 --> 00:33:10,470
so in some cases yet to sort identify
you know was the best

548
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:14,289
case scenario for your company can you
perform all these stuff Kenny

549
00:33:14,289 --> 00:33:17,519
by these tools can actually

550
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:22,220
Kaposi's type the code reviews and in my
my quick response to that would be

551
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:25,669
know on the bottom here company 42

552
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:29,970
out this correctly that I don't think
they should be taking the credit cards

553
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,179
at all

554
00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:35,350
because quite frankly there my
information

555
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:42,159
so I thats

556
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,909
if can for

557
00:33:45,909 --> 00:33:49,260
up and then finally appearance

558
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:53,120
on yeah organizations are performing
these web applications

559
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,320
on their and they don't know how the
jewel

560
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,409
works correctly this point the scanner

561
00:33:59,409 --> 00:34:03,269
web application class away more than

562
00:34:03,269 --> 00:34:07,820
PCI doesn't you allowed right I mean so
it's just saying hey perform some

563
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:12,750
assessment on the web application so it
doesn't say that

564
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,820
doesn't give you a lot allowed there so

565
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:22,820
lasted scanner

566
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,589
so basically your thing is just a tool
exactly

567
00:34:27,589 --> 00:34:33,109
on this is the only thing here is up PCI
ID SS 6.6 is

568
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:36,329
protecting applications from right so

569
00:34:36,329 --> 00:34:41,250
I showed earlier how we can change user
to the word at

570
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:44,750
manager we could make some sort of
change like that

571
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:48,389
and can access a web application and
these are real life scenarios

572
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:51,679
so for example I was performing a
assessment

573
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,980
just the other day and it said

574
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:58,150
here's your receipt okay I got this r/c

575
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:02,250
there's a buncha sensitive information
see I take a look up in the URL

576
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:06,130
says first you know it it's like number
goals

577
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:09,180
11 wine some

578
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:12,290
okay well what happens if I change it
one

579
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:15,609
for sure enough somebody else's mercy
pops up

580
00:35:15,609 --> 00:35:20,480
but if I change 1113 another see I'm
like wow this is fun

581
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,450
so I know whether help her against web
application proxy

582
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:28,310
I just are every all those number

583
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:31,460
all this sensitive information

584
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:34,970
and best real and I i

585
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:38,220
across that all attacks talking about

586
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,500
hypothetical lab situations here

587
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:45,980
will stop of so it's not check

588
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:49,099
haitians if

589
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:54,420
firewalls walk what's

590
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:59,359
so II point-blank let's be honest
scanners cannot

591
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:03,180
after and

592
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:07,800
whether ish if I want

593
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,619
so your thing is is that so my responses
hold

594
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:15,910
argument is you know all these different
tools or assessments are supposed to be

595
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,020
looking for one thing

596
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:22,270
expose be looking for vulnerabilities
identified within requirements 6.5

597
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:26,180
these requirements tied to on the lost
top 10

598
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,740
on the also can't I sees a look at
what's a fuel use other

599
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:33,380
standards you can also use CNC w/e top
25

600
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:37,640
you can also use the circle secure
coding practices as well

601
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,040
on and once again the standard itself

602
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,770
doesn't say look for business logic
flaws too

603
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:49,260
because they there's just no good way to
identify that title vulnerability

604
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:52,530
there is a CVV code on burgers not a a

605
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:58,349
sebe database business logic
vulnerabilities

606
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:01,380
your thing is hopefully if you have to
do at work

607
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:05,109
cation viability assessment some reasons
are being identified using a penetration

608
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:05,810
test

609
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:09,400
this also goes to back to is your
company that's doing a penetration test

610
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,010
doing a good penetration test

611
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:15,359
can they find these things that these
normal automated tools can find or said

612
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,859
it could now scaphoid

613
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:20,119
and so hopefully that's that's the part
where

614
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:23,700
I think they're trying to in to work the
different types of assessments

615
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:28,550
however and many cases i've seen for
penetration test

616
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:34,030
I'm where someone just basically dove
our body scanners at a span test

617
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:37,980
once again it's all about striking a
balance between automation

618
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,460
and some a real person doing the work

619
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,869
and and let's be honest sadly a lot
organizations are gonna go with the

620
00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:45,369
cheapest

621
00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:48,869
company and the cheapest company gonna
take nasa's

622
00:37:48,869 --> 00:37:53,440
last external website say there you go
there's your check box

623
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,790
X rations so

624
00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:00,750
what's sad is PCI 6.6 isn't doing its
job

625
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:04,540
and now neither is the penetration
testing

626
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:08,900
requirement as well so I that could be a
completely different topic

627
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:13,990
last allied let's just leave it

628
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:17,660
II objection 3 next problem

629
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:21,000
based off my examples web application
firewalls

630
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,290
and scanners when it comes to a stop

631
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:27,910
nakanaide I'll

632
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:34,390
base of my samples couple it's just the
way it is

633
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:38,020
so my point here essentially

634
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:42,750
your whether it's me or or on me
assessments being performed

635
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:45,810
resource to be something that's gonna be
missed because that's just the

636
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:51,140
nature of our business we have a bunch
of all abilities 30 is your day taxed

637
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:54,349
things are going to be found I'm
something is gonna pop up

638
00:38:54,349 --> 00:38:57,369
so there's always going to be something
new it's gonna be found

639
00:38:57,369 --> 00:39:01,810
arm just like any others have a firewall
network based firewall

640
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:05,170
there are going to be false Senate where
you can bypass just like away

641
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:08,430
cation farley can bypass it just like
gary was showing

642
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:11,750
arm that the problem is that we have
that

643
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:15,890
uses a layered approach not one thing is
actually gonna be able to solve the

644
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:16,550
issue

645
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:20,270
even what say the technology for however
cation firewalls

646
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:23,810
improve significantly significantly
within the next year or two years or

647
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:24,900
three years

648
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:28,310
they're still gonna be issues that you
can find that those

649
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:31,609
applications just might have people look
maybe they will look for business lost

650
00:39:31,609 --> 00:39:34,849
maybe we'll be able to implement those
technologies will be better

651
00:39:34,849 --> 00:39:38,960
with better weightlessness blacklisting
and maybe they'll have better signatures

652
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,160
we can find stuff

653
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,160
bacillus gonna be other things that
could be found in in

654
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,750
at this point I'm I'm just gonna say
this is let's %uh

655
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:50,560
let's go ahead and on bring this to the
level of zero-day

656
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,800
I'm so yeah I can see that there's
always gonna be ways around this web

657
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,170
application firewalls

658
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:59,070
around just like there are network where
for Pete's sake

659
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:04,109
should be removing a rack let's let's
get this down to the level where

660
00:40:04,109 --> 00:40:07,660
where it needs to be let's start doing
some whitelisting how about PCI makes it

661
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,180
so that

662
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:11,599
whitelisting that standards sparked

663
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:16,230
listings that thats let's let's make it
a little bit more difficult for the

664
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:19,200
attackers

665
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,000
arm finally our this one here and this
is the 1i

666
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,230
real that really bugs me is so the web
application firewalls web application

667
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,240
scanners

668
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,829
there's little guidance the PCI Council
skip

669
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:35,619
guidance as to why is an acceptable web
application firewall

670
00:40:35,619 --> 00:40:38,770
what's next step nations and this is

671
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,869
this is what really gets me so I I have
to do this yes

672
00:40:41,869 --> 00:40:45,599
recertification thing every year secures
ask me

673
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,790
which means that we have to perform
these external

674
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:52,890
scans against the against organizations
PCI

675
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:56,960
and I have to jump through so many hoops
in order to get this certification

676
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,270
are how come help one application
scanners

677
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:03,599
web application firewalls don't have to
go through some sort of certification as

678
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:04,410
well

679
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:08,150
how come they don't have to stand up a
web application horrible weather

680
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:09,099
application

681
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:12,339
our web application firewall say how
many of these attacks

682
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:16,849
in a black today I mean where is this
where's the certification

683
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:20,000
of make certification

684
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,300
and let's certify these things as well

685
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:29,150
I can agree with this one they really
have any issues with it but

686
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:32,619
the things I start fining to is

687
00:41:32,619 --> 00:41:36,359
especially when it comes to application
scanners

688
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:40,089
or whether it be a web application
assessment code review additionally

689
00:41:40,089 --> 00:41:40,950
whatever

690
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:44,500
up these the thing is is that the
guidance

691
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,800
such as was provided in the previous
lights

692
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:51,510
they just basically have a list if thou
shalt do with this

693
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:54,760
they don't have any guidance or better
understanding or better guidance

694
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,750
on what you should do for a procedure
standpoint if you don't have those

695
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:00,970
procedures people going to the bare
minimum they're just gonna meet the

696
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:05,710
highest level love the requirement and

697
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:09,140
it's kinda sad in that regard that
people don't think I've

698
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:12,710
I'll this is just thou shall and I
really need to make a

699
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:16,730
a better process internally to run these
types of assessments are these tools

700
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:19,890
this vulnerability code review

701
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:24,089
and once again payment application
center

702
00:42:24,089 --> 00:42:28,990
final visa PCI Powless or visa service
provider list what have you

703
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:33,020
the Arts go through certification
process so CSV scam process where

704
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:36,300
all is survivability skin doing any
external site

705
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:40,310
so if you're using his head tools and
they have to be validated

706
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:44,990
earth are these tools not valid in some
way shape or form

707
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:48,650
all right and we're working to quickly
wrap this up

708
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:52,050
here so let's I as good quickly here

709
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:55,410
so what's the answer well

710
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:59,210
grew quickly compliance that's not legal
security

711
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:03,250
your head but starr thing about we can
actually secure organizational using the

712
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,250
thing to its not necessarily in our
heads

713
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,760
is really in the management says in
essence fight that I was always fighting

714
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,260
with

715
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,420
within PCI every single time ago an
organization

716
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:17,720
you not secure unite PCI compliant to
expose be doing

717
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,579
they don't care because it doesn't
affect their bottom line and so I think

718
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:21,530
once again

719
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:25,089
as I for it and several other
presentations and different

720
00:43:25,089 --> 00:43:28,490
organizations and high castle have you
it's all about communicating that Upton

721
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:29,470
up management

722
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:32,880
they understand the compliance not
people security or that compliance is

723
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,260
not

724
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:36,310
the bare minimum at least possibly

725
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:39,730
it needs to be communicated at the risk
assessments understand what their true

726
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:41,480
risks are and what they really should be
doing

727
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,560
above compliance to me their security
needs

728
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:49,040
then this size the second one here we've
already touched on that

729
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,050
the 31 here better secure

730
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:55,450
software development life cycle
companies really happy

731
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:59,339
SDLC a place where there betting out
these awful

732
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:04,349
processes me should actually are very
help

733
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:08,470
very design all

734
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:12,440
real still see on there's

735
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:16,200
Kevin Johnson

736
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:20,310
security and your SDLC that he presented

737
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:23,319
what and then also this layered approach
to security

738
00:44:23,319 --> 00:44:26,630
so don't shouldn't be Web Application
Firewall

739
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:31,069
or manual assessment or of her body scan

740
00:44:31,069 --> 00:44:34,470
for something else ship all me

741
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:38,589
really wish layering security

742
00:44:38,589 --> 00:44:42,540
its like a few other things on that
other par the software development life

743
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:43,230
cycle

744
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:46,470
so just two examples are some things I
could definitely improve that

745
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:50,270
is and these are some the ideas that
Kevin Johnson also gave out

746
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:53,670
you know perform those whether the
cation vulnerability scanners likes to

747
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:54,780
take those tools

748
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:57,920
and run 'em in pre-production fortunes
after

749
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,560
software I'm get the low-hanging fruit
as fast as you can

750
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,810
before you start pushing out the
production or staging environment

751
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:08,390
arm your thing is to is to discover
refuse to those other things

752
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:11,430
in combination I'm so that when your

753
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:14,280
systems about for your application
Archos gonna get pushed out to

754
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,079
production or staging environment

755
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,180
then you actually have someone that
knows a little bit more you can find the

756
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:20,670
more

757
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:23,800
high-level things or are more
complicated things

758
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:28,829
that those South that that's all for
those tools just can't find

759
00:45:28,829 --> 00:45:32,650
arm once again that goes back to the
layered approach

760
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:36,750
it's not just one thing is all these
things because all these things combined

761
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,270
they're going to equal

762
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:41,700
something as a love affair the book
currently doing arm

763
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,839
when we go back to the layered approach

764
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:48,710
and basic channels manual assessments
its its is really a shame that we don't

765
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:49,500
think about this

766
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,170
and once again it goes back to the the
financial issues

767
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:57,170
and management issues %uh measure saying
hey

768
00:45:57,170 --> 00:46:00,599
you we don't want to do this was just
gonna cost much money

769
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:04,550
so once again it's doing all and maybe
even assessing whether or not

770
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:08,369
all maybe all them you can't do all them
at least pick up the best ones ok it's

771
00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:11,740
the best bang for your buck alright well
thats

772
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:15,750
we're gonna wrap this up now we thank
you guys for your time and

773
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:20,410
here let's go out make some us secure

774
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:23,460
applications whatever

775
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:23,730
