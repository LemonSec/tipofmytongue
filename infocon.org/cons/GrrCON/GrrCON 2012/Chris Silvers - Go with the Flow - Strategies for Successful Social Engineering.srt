1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,080
do it believe it or not is somewhat of a
fee to get my name right

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,250
have been I've been called Chris slivers
Chris silver

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,610
all my life so thanks for getting it
right

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:15,059
hike or so up some shameless plug that
you'll see later

5
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,560
as well but I throw them out there cuz
my boss

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,109
pace for me to be here are the actual
title this talk by the way is called go

7
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:26,330
with the flow and the subtitle

8
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,689
was is strategies for successful social
engineering

9
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:33,250
so you'll see why I named it go with the
flow in just a little bit

10
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,010
I for small for those

11
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,550
I have not had the pleasure meeting my
name is Chris overs

12
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,989
my day job is I work for found stone

13
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:48,309
I do pen testing I'm also the practice
leave for our social engineering

14
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:49,020
practice

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,940
which is kinda led me to a more research
in

16
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,320
and interest in this area I'm aspirate
I'm I love to fish

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,699
I I love to speak publicly arm

18
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:04,500
I consider if i'm talking more than
three people that's public speaking

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,070
so he credit for that are also mentor

20
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,760
young people so like tonight at the
after party if you're into that

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,960
kinda thing I love yeah I'm trying to
give a claim here

22
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:24,299
mentoring I used to say messing with it
than that then really a

23
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,960
mentoring young mines

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,090
okay people he is wow

25
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,390
okay anyway I didn't realize that was ok
but anywhere

26
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:39,500
anyway whatever I I'm all about that's
one of the things that

27
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,570
like if you look at some of the I the

28
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,899
the security leaders have today

29
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,290
they you know the Moxie Marlins bites
and the guys are doing like the really

30
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,149
cool research

31
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:54,159
arm if you if you get an opportunity to
talk to these guys

32
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,969
art in a lotta cases you're fine that
when they were

33
00:01:57,969 --> 00:02:01,509
teenagers they were hacking into stuff

34
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:05,030
they were you know dollar PBS and and
and all that stuff

35
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,080
and imagine had they gotten caught

36
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,330
interested and you know turn to a life
of crime

37
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,200
and we would never get to benefit from a
lot of the research that they've done

38
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,560
so arm so it's kinda an issue close to
my heart

39
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,580
that I that there are still kids out
there that are that bright

40
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,440
there just waiting for somebody to
mentor them and keep them outta trouble

41
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,440
long enough so that they can get in the
professional world and do great stuff

42
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:37,650
orange tree so anyway are but moving on
I've been in this industry for a long

43
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,450
time

44
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:42,849
are before I got into this industry I
actually work in the janitorial business

45
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:45,970
so it kinda proves that

46
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:51,650
that I even if you've had a previous
career you can get into security

47
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,709
I it's not too late to to get into the
security industry

48
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:59,959
are because things are changing so fast
that you know we're still all learning a

49
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:00,390
lot

50
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,010
so it's kinda cool arm probably what I'm

51
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:08,420
best known for a to people who know me

52
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,540
I is in the security anyway was

53
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,060
I in 2011 I competed in the I

54
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,150
Def Con 19 social engineering capture
the flag contests

55
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:24,230
really cool contest lot of fun II came
in second place

56
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:29,970
so up with which was convenient this
year I compete again but

57
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,349
I decided to go a little different
technique and just have some fun

58
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:36,610
are s your place for no go figure

59
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:41,519
right sometimes you get lucky I but
realistically

60
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,519
mmm I'm really just an old country boy

61
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,780
from a little town in North Georgia
called kennesaw II

62
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,610
wonderful and by applause who knows
about 10 assault georgette

63
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,689
go hey okay authorities have one and
that would be

64
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:02,099
funny but okay so we are like five
people right

65
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:05,530
so what is known about Kennesaw Georgia

66
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,000
gun ownership

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,939
the gun law 1982 i don't realize it been
that long

68
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:17,669
so so was I like our whatever 1980 I was
16 at the time

69
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:22,300
do the math right I'll this guy named
Garrett Meyers

70
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,419
is the nickname is wild man as you can
see

71
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:29,100
and he runs the civil war surplus and
herb shop

72
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,250
in the hounds at kennesaw yeah at

73
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,610
he sponsored this bill that said today
anybody who lives in the city limits

74
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,199
have kennesaw a must own a gun

75
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:41,610
I how crazy is that right so I'll

76
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,310
so use all before yes I do technical pen
testing also

77
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:50,060
but we really comes down to it I'm just
an old country boy from Kennesaw Georgia

78
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:55,389
I have leverage this really to the T and
I highly recommend

79
00:04:55,389 --> 00:05:01,270
leveraging whatever characteristics you
have whatever you were born with

80
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,910
into a career if you can do that and and

81
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,199
you know pair it with what you love in

82
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:11,620
you're lucky person and you live the
life like I do because I love it

83
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,919
I absolutely love it so

84
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:18,180
um so this is essentially what we're
going to I

85
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,880
cover today hopefully I was also a run
at a time and I i King

86
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,960
avoid rambling on I

87
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,750
I want to give you a little background
how I can I created this presentation

88
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:34,270
I and then we're going to dissect a
social engineering phone call

89
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,810
so this is about social engineering but
it's really honed in on

90
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:43,520
telephone-based fishing I some people
call it visioning

91
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,530
out don't really buy that too much but
its telephone based social engineering

92
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,570
okay away can you guys hear me OK in the
back yeah

93
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:56,150
okay cool I are we're gonna dissect a
social engineering call

94
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,389
into different phases right arm an

95
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:03,220
I'm gonna give you an example love a
call now

96
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,180
keep in mind these calls done right and
you'll see

97
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,430
you'll see the the pretext in a second
done right

98
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:15,009
they take anywhere from 20 to 30 minutes
I'm not gonna play an entire call for

99
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:16,710
you cuz that would take up all the time

100
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,520
me give you some snippets but arm but I
think you get the point of it

101
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,389
so wat will go through a good call and
then we'll talk about different things

102
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:27,560
that could go wrong at different phases
of the call

103
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,120
and and play some recorded are examples
are those

104
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,050
up then we'll do something I like to
call quiz time and so

105
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,380
a we'll see how that goes I haven't
tried that yet

106
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,460
and then possibly some some call
bloopers if we still have time

107
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,690
alright so as I said 2011

108
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:51,479
up displayed in the social engineering
capture the flag so just over a year ago

109
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:55,759
and after the competition I really had a
good time in

110
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,190
and met Chris had Maggie he's a great
guy you know

111
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,860
if you get up to meet him take it
because he's a great guy

112
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,310
great to talk with and we got to talking
about

113
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:10,699
the fact that when he does his social
engineering phone calls he records all

114
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:12,479
the phone calls

115
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,069
well I've always been a long shot about
that you know Georgia

116
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:20,099
is a one-party state that I i kno nevada
is a two-party stay

117
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:23,220
so you have to have two-party cassette
Concetta

118
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,490
to record the phone calls but when he
was explaining to me was

119
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,740
well that's true from a person to person
call

120
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,199
from you know if you're calling a
consumer but if you're calling a

121
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,449
business

122
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:39,060
you you actually only have to have the
permission love the company

123
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,940
that you know the business that owns the
phone other words your client

124
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,050
you don't have to have each person's
individual our permission to record the

125
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:47,780
call

126
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,970
now I'm not a lawyer and if there's a
lawyer in the audience that wants to

127
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,080
refute that

128
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,389
feel free are but I did talk to the FF
lawyers about it because I didn't

129
00:07:57,389 --> 00:07:58,220
believe him

130
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,740
when he said that and they said yeah
that's right I was like okay well

131
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,270
this work it's worth a shot arm so

132
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,759
every contract since that I have

133
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,849
you know during our little kick off call
our talk to the client

134
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:16,349
and I tell them that you know we can
record the calls for you

135
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:20,699
and will give you the recordings so when
you go back to your employees

136
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,889
and you're trying to explain to them how
someone scam to you

137
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:28,419
you can actually play the recording the
call phone calls

138
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:32,610
and you know it'll help educate your
place other that's a great idea

139
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,289
well so a couple things started
happening

140
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:39,630
as I started recording calls and then
arm

141
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:44,540
going back in listening to the
recordings I started noticing

142
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,550
where my mistakes were right cuz he

143
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:51,170
you hang up the phone and you think back
to that call you think gosh you know

144
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:55,450
why didn't I get that person's password
or why did I get that person's password

145
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:59,610
you use or try to remember and you you
don't really pick things up

146
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,470
short listen to the recording the call
in all the sudden all the little

147
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,140
intonations up the other person's voice
and all the

148
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,680
arms and hers that you said that you
didn't realize you said

149
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,980
come through on the recording when
you're listening to and you realize

150
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,459
with G it's starting to make sense as
how this works in

151
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:21,180
why I was successful or why was
unsuccessful right

152
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,560
so arm so that started happening in Iran

153
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,220
we started getting unit fails then we
started getting more

154
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,980
social engineering gigs especially
telephone-based

155
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,709
and there were times when I was unable
to

156
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:39,310
to do the work so we had to have other
consultants do it

157
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,890
and a lot more really not very
comfortable mean is there anybody in

158
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:43,510
here

159
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:47,240
who does telephone-based social
engineering

160
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,440
okay so so you know it's a little
stressful

161
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:56,510
right yet I doing here has ever done
telemarketing

162
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,740
okay a couple that's pretty much what
it's like

163
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,640
you don't still do tell marketing to you
that's why

164
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,610
I hate it stopped but I'm at all right
that's or what this is like it's that

165
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,620
stressful

166
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,279
and and a lot of us most of us in the
room are not all that social

167
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,790
to begin with so you know it stands to
reason

168
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:21,269
so so anyway so I started using these
recordings to train

169
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:24,890
other consultants just to give them an
example you know here's

170
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:28,500
here's a good call on what it sounds
like yours bad calm what it sounds like

171
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,959
right are while the earned time goes on
line

172
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:36,430
I and recording over a hundred phone
calls in this past year

173
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:40,519
right arm in I was sittin around 1 day 8
hours

174
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:43,870
I was you know put I was looking for
some recordings to help another

175
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,100
consultant

176
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,209
and I started actually seeing some
patterns

177
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:52,810
I'll develop within the calls that I was
making as I was listening to

178
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:56,890
right and that's kinda where I came up
with

179
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,140
these sections of the call the greeting

180
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,649
portion the building up the trust the
identifying the problem

181
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:07,600
and in the going for the gold in its
basically built of

182
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,649
this particular pre-tax now

183
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:13,730
this is a pretty common pre-tax it it's
very effective

184
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:19,470
I noticed it in the social engineering
caption fly contest

185
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,480
and essentially it's basically you
pretend to be a help desk person

186
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,829
you call a typical user you describe
something

187
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:31,310
in their environment that has changed
okay whether its specific or general

188
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:36,310
whatever you describe something that has
changed and that's why you're calling

189
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:40,640
and that hopefully builds up your
authority and you know your knowledge

190
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,620
your trust

191
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,860
and then at some point during the
conversation you

192
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,269
you're asking the the user to check on
something and there's a problem

193
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:52,810
there's something that that they tell
you

194
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:56,480
are is X and you say oh that should be
why

195
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,480
it doesn't really matter what arm you
know

196
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,490
is different theories on on how
technical should be

197
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:06,190
but at some point there will be a
problem right

198
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:11,100
and so then you move to the the truth
the troubleshooting stage where you

199
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,000
you're trying to determine why it is
that their system is not configured

200
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,139
correctly

201
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:20,029
right and that's where it really starts
getting as technical as you can

202
00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:24,019
and at some point now whether you force
this

203
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:27,240
or or it's prompted by the user which is
my

204
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,649
my preference up at some point

205
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:34,019
somebody's going to get impatient and
you're gonna offer

206
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:38,120
a better solution how you can fix their
problem

207
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,630
because now that you convince them that
they have a problem that you're here to

208
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,630
fix

209
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,940
right you're the nice guy coming in and
fix it

210
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,950
then then you're going to use some

211
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:54,410
you know portal the you know support
portal you'll hear that a lot

212
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:58,709
in the call holes up to remotely fix
their problem

213
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:02,180
so that you don't have to you not
wasting any more their time

214
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,450
right and once they start feeling like

215
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,820
a I'm get tires phone call that's when
you're ready to

216
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:14,170
to to go in for that and then of course
whatever portal you're going into

217
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,720
a you can't log into it because the

218
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,120
there some kinda password issue where
they need to change the password

219
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,720
right are we do have consultants who
actually ask people

220
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,200
arm for their password

221
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,260
I'm just not a big fan of that because I
just don't think it's realistic

222
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,690
I think if I were an attacker and I
could just get the user to change their

223
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,139
password to a value that I give them

224
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:42,860
what that's going to work so much easier

225
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,970
and more consistently than asking them
for their password

226
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:49,050
then I might as well just do that right
are

227
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:52,110
and you'll see sometimes it you end up
in the past for anyway

228
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:57,300
so arm and if you go through all this
trouble shooting pretext

229
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:01,130
and you don't get to the point where you
feel comfortable even asking them to

230
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,070
change the password or whatever

231
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,339
you still get autumn information Adam is
well

232
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:11,709
that you can use on the next call to to
make it sound like you know a whole lot

233
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:15,329
right so it's kinda over a another way
to do

234
00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:19,139
kinda reconnaissance extra
reconnaissance on right

235
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:22,209
okay so putting it visually and

236
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:25,839
this is why the talk was called go with
the flow

237
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,360
up because I created a little flow chart
as you can see it's a very simple

238
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,320
flow chart are which I'm sure could be
expanded and

239
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,079
you know feel free if you if you have
ideas I love to hear

240
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,060
but essentially go see these four phases
UHV you know the greeting

241
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,760
and you know did I get a good response
did the person for example did the

242
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,139
person when they answered

243
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:51,699
did they say their name because some
people just say hello and in some people

244
00:14:51,699 --> 00:14:53,399
say hi this is Jamie

245
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:57,649
right are you know when I when I
introduced myself

246
00:14:57,649 --> 00:15:01,860
did they pause when I said hi this is
Chris with the help desk

247
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,680
did they go a K

248
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,209
you nor the acting suspicious just right
from the get-go right

249
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:13,180
are and of course you know if you get a
bad response you you exit the call

250
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,790
now if you notice it's got one box
appear to exit the call

251
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:21,040
but that doesn't mean that you use the
same technique to exit the call

252
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,790
if it's during the greeting for example
you might say

253
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,230
I'm sorry I was trying to get in touch
with Jamie for when tears

254
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:32,269
this is Jamey Johnson I've must have the
wrong number or call somebody else

255
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:36,519
right if your way down here in ready to
go for the gold

256
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:40,009
and they say well I'm not comfortable
doing whatever it is you're asked me to

257
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:40,920
do

258
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,540
and you make up some other exit but the
key here is to develop

259
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,940
army at least one exit art

260
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:53,529
technique for each one of these phases
so that you don't get caught off guard

261
00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:56,970
you know you can to it it's kinda little
give-and-take in your

262
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:01,050
you're listening for their for the
response in trying to

263
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:04,290
judge whether it positive or negative it
is negative

264
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:08,709
you go in your exit script if it's
positive you move on to the next phase

265
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:11,940
right make perfect sense right sounds
easy okay

266
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,120
so let's hear an example hopefully

267
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,350
love when it goes well yeah exactly I B

268
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:23,139
economic nafta calling okay I this is
Chris with the help desk

269
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:26,509
government disability a bolivia

270
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:30,079
I have to be a 100 hi serbian

271

275
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:49,839
sir hmmm I was calling to make sure the

276
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,320
everything happened over over the last
few weeks about the

277
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,100
about the upgrade got here that and we
pushed an update last night I want to

278
00:16:59,100 --> 00:16:59,959
make sure it

279
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:05,630
everything was working okay some even
temper the new bookings but

280
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,780
issues me you mean in terms of the new
bookings but

281
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:14,480
year routines I am the only problem that
I've run into is that after I

282
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,949
after I to permit them like complete and
submit them my copy haven't been popping

283
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:19,890
up

284
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:23,480
print out for my record okay

285
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,289
yeah me get a gift he's given me

286
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:30,320
stuff split

287
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,900
I don't even have to continue doing with
switch interfaces reason for that is

288
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,570
that the web-based interface with

289
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:40,710
yeah that would be the Internet Explorer
no okay

290
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:44,960
I know that I called and I'm had
somebody help me one time per

291
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,700
retrieve it just because I like to print
a copy for my own record

292
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,370
but what had happened was I admitted it
and I think the pop-up blocker block it

293
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,350
from popping up

294
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,770
to allow me to protect yeah that's what
i was thinkin

295
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:01,020
was probably is at what's been happening
with a bunch of people

296
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:06,200
public like that for it thanks anyway

297
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,200
week in phnom we can take a look at that
begin with version

298
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,070
the Internet is were using for me I
think it's just the thing that everybody

299
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,130
else is using

scheme

342
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,730
and by the way I'm

343
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,900
unlike sit in my pajamas at home doing
this right so

344
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,080
yet that's what the typing noises make
it sound like aunts

345
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,860
the lipid no

346
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:06,990
some trouble logging in there is some
left and you

347
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:10,559
having to change a password I'm

348
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,919
pretty recently yeah

349
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:19,929
cuz I with this new system is if your
password expires switches

350
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:24,640
it doesn't really tell you okay if your
passport expires you end up having to

351
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,539
change it

352
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:29,860
before you can actually login so I say
what do you know how to change a

353
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,070
password

354
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:34,270
I you can i just give you my password
are sure

355
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:38,220
by ready for it

356
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,230
if it would be me

357
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:47,669
are so

358
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:51,340
I I think up like that alas address and
password you but you get the point

359
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:55,510
racket yeah of

360
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:59,230
I you know we make fun we lap

361
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:02,270
its it's pretty common okay it's that

362
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,490
you know once and really this particular
call

363
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,289
was was a particularly good wanna and by
the way that's one reason I put that

364
00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:13,179
you know that I feel recognize that
picture from

365
00:22:13,179 --> 00:22:16,820
I was a pillow talk the movie pillow
talk with the worst day in

366
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:20,510
rocket anybody old enough for that yeah
okay

367
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:24,100
of anyway yeah here

368
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,179
well i i wasn't there at the screening
of the movie

369
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:32,299
they here I anyway so so why did that
call work so well

370
00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:35,850
okay from the from the very get-go she

371
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:40,720
she asked me how I was doing right and
it gave me the opportunity

372
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,980
to say well things are kinda crazy

373
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:49,390
so I get garnered a little sympathy
there you know sympathy goes so far

374
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:54,090
in social engineering to Macy's to me
it's more powerful than the whole

375
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:58,919
you know a fake authoritative kinda hey
this is the CAFO

376
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:03,250
Bob Loblaw to me said that the is more
powerful and mostly because I think it

377
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:07,049
it it gives people a good feeling when
they help you

378
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:10,370
instead of being afraid to not help you

379
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:14,360
they feel they want to help me so it
makes them feel good about it right

380
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,020
arm you know she with when we started
talking about the application

381
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:22,820
I knew a little bit about their
accounting system

382
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,320
course I didn't know about the booking
slips which worked really well

383
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,270
and of course you know she's been me the
information and I'm just kinda

384
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,200
confirming in confirming it

385
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,230
for her to make her feel yeah yeah
that's exactly what I'm talking about

386
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:38,630
right a lot of times people just give
you the answers are you have to do is

387
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:39,620
agree with them

388
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:44,320
right if you give them an opportunity
arm the the problem here yet

389
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,600
she gave me a freebie that because there
was an actual problem

390
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,539
but it's amazing how many times you call
a Windows

391
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:55,350
user and you ask them if they're having
a problem

392
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,570
many times they yeah yeah have I've had
a problem

393
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:02,799
I mean have either been meaning to call
the helpdesk or I call the helpdesk

395
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:09,909

another call I was on

396
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:13,250
arm one lady said I'm not having a
problem but this other ladies have a

397
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:13,980
problem

398
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,690
she actually transfer me to the other

399
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:17,840
ticket number

400
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,830
and told me who she talked to at a gay
actually I just talked to him

401
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:25,059
and that's why I'm calling you know us
yep

402
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:28,299
sometimes you just get gets like that
right arm

403
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:31,610
you know making the user feel good about
about

404
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:35,390
not knowing about computers alright

405
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,409
avoiding making a field arm is good
right

406
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:42,929
you know I'm sure she this lady was very
knowledgeable and something

407
00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:46,750
right for the business you know a lot
about computers that's okay

408
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,169
I probably don't know jack about what
she does so

409
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:53,990
if I make her feel okay about that
although I'm just a computer geek and

410
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,690
you know that's all I really know

411
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:59,490
she'll feel good about giving me all
this information if you feel okay that

412
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,480
she's not for me

413
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,029
with right arm in a course you have to
be ready to explain

414
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:08,590
anything in plain English are win

415
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:12,860
you know when you get prompted so if a
user says well what is a homie

416
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:17,870
what is dns well be able to explain to
him you know it's like a phone book

417
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,990
right that that your computer looks up
when you type

418
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:25,159
Google dot com in it translates these
things called IP address

419
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:28,620
be all good inpatient because the whole
point here

420
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:33,080
is is for her to get impatient not me to
get impatient

421
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:37,559
it's almost like a negotiation the first
person who gets impatient loses

422
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:41,220
right cuz I got all day you know this is
my job

better to do it and it's kind of fun

424
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:49,299
arm and then of course and then of
course being you know

425
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:54,350

00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,529
hung up the phone

453
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:39,100
just click right I hate to do that I've
done it before and I hate to do that

454
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,330
because it kinda

455
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:44,169
makes the user little even more
suspicious right

456
00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:47,899
I mean obviously a bust and I go through
this

457
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:51,200
this process if you noticed the first
call that

458
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,529
that I played for you I used my name
Chris

459
00:27:54,529 --> 00:27:59,270
now she never asked my last name I'm
pretty sure on that engagement

460
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:02,580
I didn't know a person named Kristen I T

461
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:06,820
so I probably would have said silvers
and she asked me my last name

462
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,870
arm but you know it's always kinda

463
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:13,419
a balancing act whether to spoof an
actual

464
00:28:13,419 --> 00:28:17,809
employees or not right are you'll see
some these calls

465
00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:21,960
at if you do it right and you've done

466
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,220
another reconnaissance arm to know

467
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:28,539
to can get an idea of who knows who in
the organization

468
00:28:28,539 --> 00:28:32,059
then spoofing a name is perfect but

469
00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:35,860
like in that case if he didn't do enough
then you didn't realize that the person

470
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,029
you're calling

471
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:41,149
might be sitting right next to the
person you're faking to be

472
00:28:41,149 --> 00:28:45,210
I've had that happen the let the lady
said no this is not johnnie

473
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:48,360
I'm sitting next to Johnny and he's not
on the phone you

474
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,029
yeah a yep

475
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:55,950
yeah I think that was battles the one
time when I just click I got nothin

476
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:59,000
you know F so I I'll

477
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,200
but the thing is I've had actually work
really well for me one time

478
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,669
and that's why I put down here professor
corn blossom

479
00:29:06,669 --> 00:29:11,049
because I I was doing reconnaissance and
this was obviously a a university that I

480
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,330
was calling on

481
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:16,370
and arm now the this scenario was a low
flipped

482
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:20,100
I was pretending to be a user and I was
calling the helpdesk

483
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,440
and I was basically trying to get them
to go out to our website you know

484
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,809
credential harvesting can I think arm
and

485
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:30,770
I wanted to pretend to be one of the
professors

486
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:34,039
well when I look at the the faculty list

487
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:37,190
and I wish I was going down through it
all sink in we'll you know who cannot

488
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,159
spoof

489
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,750
well this university was up North

00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:15,090
it's painful listening to it right
because I'm just trying to backpedal on

545
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,040
the sly I

546
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,390

stall techniques

548
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:27,070
I had an org chart alright Lisa hedda
unemployed list

549

interest right have fun and games in

550
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:32,890
crap amis like to easily

551
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:37,910
so arm so so this goes to building trust
I mean you know

552
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:41,700
when the guy answered the phone he was
nice enough but when I started telling

553
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:45,180
what I needed all the sudden he just
turned into this

554
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:50,160
you know interrogator right are as far
as who I knew in who I was and

555
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,760
you know like like you heard you know is
this a fishing attempt to write

556
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,930
so arm so sometimes

557
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:00,020
you know there's just no shortcut for
thorough

558
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:05,520
reconnaissance right you you really have
to know what you doing so

559
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:09,179
by the way just a quick side note arm
for the parent company

560
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:12,240
Mac for ya know ya know doug is talking
it Focusrite

561
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,530
here okay it was really really

562
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:20,169
let's just ask me how can I help you I
certainly how are you

563
00:34:20,169 --> 00:34:23,690
get every new I'm good thanks they are

564
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:27,750
Stephanie are you 00 where
SuccessFactors upgrade that we've been

565
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:30,840
pushing out this is Brad from it. in the
Inglewood offer

566
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,919
on so our users are reporting problems
and i was just wondering if you're

567
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:35,640
having any

568
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,090
I am for which system

569
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:42,120
are for 6 SuccessFactors

570
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,210
are you SuccessFactors user you know
what I don't

571
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:49,700
think K we r I

572
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:53,429
marine let me transfer your virtual
feels like you believe that

573
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:57,410
system which i think actually are sure
yet great president of

574
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:02,550
just a moment so so in most situations
getting transfers bad thing

575
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:06,660
by the way sometimes it works out okay
especially if there's

576
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:11,120
a if you prompted if you say oh
everything's fine with you

577
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:15,290
could you transfer me or if they say oh
well somebody else has a problem

578
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:18,770
those companies in most cases though
transfers are not good because you're

579
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:19,560
not ready

580
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,690
for that new target you've done your
econ on the target your calling

581
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:28,420
you know about them you have no clue
about who you're about to talk to so

582
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:33,090
the the lesson here really is in the
building trust pays when you're

583
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:38,530
talking about the their application they
got upgraded Bob Loblaw

584
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:41,730
you need to know that environment and if
you catch one

585
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:45,360
that it's just not applicability down to
them

586
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:51,000
then you're stuck and there again use or
to get into that balancing act between

587
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
talking about some general peace love

588
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,580
application that they use light out
worker Internet Explorer

589
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:02,130
versus something specific like you know
maybe they call something cop net

590
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:05,310
or something like that right in the more
specific

591
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:08,520
usually works out better but you never
you never can tell

592
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:13,170
I so the last one the last kinda one
that let me know if you have a few

593
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:13,670
minutes

594
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:16,750
with are let's check your

595
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:20,410
your service pack while so this is like
a minute I'm about to go into a meeting

745
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:45,869

749
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:55,630

00:45:55,630 --> 00:46:00,740

whole list for people to call

751
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:04,610
on Alka if you don't have time I can I
think awesome idea

752
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:08,470
okay thank you now no doubt there's
technical ways

753
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:12,510
you know to do all the phone looping and
all that stuff for the call back but

754
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:17,400
that's a big hassle I usually don't get
that so it's really not worth it but

755
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,650
that's one defense by the way when
you're talking your users

756
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:24,100
just ask the person asked to call the
person back right

757
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:27,440
and then hang up look up there for

758
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,250
if they give your phone number ignore it
look at the real extension

759
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:34,970
or call the help desk and say hey I was
just talking to so-and-so

760
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:38,260
can you transfer me to or whatever right

761
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:41,470
nine times are 10 that's gonna for

762
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:44,550
most phone phishing attempts

763
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:48,240
really if you just year well first I'll
put on hold

764
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,570
while you look up stuff because that
makes them nervous I know it makes me

765
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:52,080
nervous

766
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,100
because I have no clue what they're too
and while I'm on all

767
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:58,200
way I think this is the last quiz here

768
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:05,200
you guys are spot on if it plays

769
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:13,890
okay maybe some technical difficulty

770
00:47:14,799 --> 00:47:16,559
yep apparently yes

771
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:20,039
it was good alright will call so we have
a little bit I'm here

772
00:47:20,039 --> 00:47:26,479
yeah at waterfall go israeli we carved
out some extra time good

773
00:47:26,479 --> 00:47:30,289
for some bloopers I hate a home

774
00:47:30,289 --> 00:47:34,979
and by the way that outta I think later
they got

775
00:47:34,979 --> 00:47:38,619
a house on the in the Hamptons or
something II

776
00:47:38,619 --> 00:47:43,099

777
00:47:43,099 --> 00:47:46,289

778
00:47:46,289 --> 00:47:49,489
too long miss it he says is password
supplied does not meet them

00:47:49,489 --> 00:47:54,089
on minimum complexity requirements place
like another pass for that meet or the

780
00:47:54,089 --> 00:47:55,119

only yeah I was the yeah yeah

807
00:49:31,959 --> 00:49:36,140
that out there always reminds me that
old Seinfeld episode where

808
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:40,539
when Kramer was people get confused
between him and the movie theater in

809
00:49:40,539 --> 00:49:44,059
any and and he was trying to act like an
automated attendant and then finally

810
00:49:44,059 --> 00:49:44,400

cool yet iight so that's all I got

814
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:59,650
here

815
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:05,300
are ob obvious shameless plugs appears
if I have any questions why we got

816
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:12,070
five minutes or I don't week from the
fountain account but

817
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:16,060
I want to the found some guys does and
sometimes he the reach weeks what r

818
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:19,330
to or sometimes I email him and he tweet
stuff

819
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:24,200
yes here the front you think

820
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:28,630
yep I'm just more successful with I
don't know what it is

821
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:31,750
out of its a a guy/girl thing I

822
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:35,600
yeah I think the southern voice

823
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:42,600
yes a definitely physical when I do bud

824
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:48,080
yeah I'll leave it at that yeah your
question

825
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:55,080
welfare toma de absolutely makes a
difference in this is from those have

826
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:56,750
you done telemarketing

827
00:50:56,750 --> 00:51:00,970
when's the best time to call I mean okay
at home

828
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:04,170
it's dinner but if you were calling
professional people

829
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:08,640
you call in the morning morning local
time people in much better mood

830
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,770
you know they're ready to talking give
you all can information yes

831
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:16,110
from the back out day in the week

832
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:20,270
arm I don't outta I'm not really found a
lot a difference

833
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:24,450
are I mean I would probably do

834
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:27,460
Tuesday through Thursday just because
your

835
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:31,300
you'll be able to contact people a lot
of times like customers all say

836
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:35,080
I want you to call 10 people and always
have to clarify that

837
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:38,780
you want me to make ten phone calls are
you want me to actually talk to 10

838
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:39,320
people

839
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:43,290
because if I'm gonna talk to 10 people
you need it or I need to come up with a

840
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:43,760
list

841
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,240
up at least 40 people because it
typically takes

842
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:50,310
for phone calls to get in touch with one
person

843
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:54,840
you know normal business environment
right okay I think we had one other

844
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:55,980
question over here

845
00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:00,010
up I'm sorry success rate overall

846
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:04,920
arm I haven't really done the hard
statistics but

847
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,350
and and there's a question UHV you know

848
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:12,000
if I make it halfway through the call
and I get all this great information but

849
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:12,460
they don't

850
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:15,630
reset your password is that considered
success or failure

851
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:19,210
so but I would say it's gotta be

852
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:23,120
it's got to be in the nineties year I i
mean

853
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:30,120
year pretty easily here yes

854
00:52:37,869 --> 00:52:41,680
yes force have people react to the
southern thing arm

855
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,489
its single enough I used to be a little
intimidated when I would call somebody

856
00:52:46,489 --> 00:52:49,910
in New York thinking you know they're
just gonna

857
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:54,209
but actually actually I think it works
better

858
00:52:54,209 --> 00:52:58,319
when I call people who were in the north
versus the south

859
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:02,859
and in fact they had one play D who I
just got back from Derby Conn

860
00:53:02,859 --> 00:53:06,029
when I was making this call and she

861
00:53:06,029 --> 00:53:09,930
she was somewhere Midwest and she

862
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:13,449
and I was pretending to be somebody in
California right

863
00:53:13,449 --> 00:53:16,449
and she picked up on it she said wait a
minute you said you

864
00:53:16,449 --> 00:53:20,319
your cone from the California Office you
don't sound californian

865
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:23,949
acid really what do I sound like she
said well you sound like you're from the

866
00:53:23,949 --> 00:53:24,549
south

867
00:53:24,549 --> 00:53:29,259
acid that's uncanny yeah I'm actually in
from the south I just moved out here

868
00:53:29,259 --> 00:53:33,099
she say she said I'm really good with
accents acid

869
00:53:33,099 --> 00:53:36,400
are really where do you think I'm France
he said Kentucky

870
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,390
you I said we'll all be

871
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:45,410
from Kentucky specifically local

872
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:49,440
cuz I was just a little as we a so she
starsight she said well I'm from

873
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,329
Louisville real out really have you been
to so-and-so

874
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:55,420
whatever Bart was we you know we're at
night you know

875
00:53:55,420 --> 00:54:00,099
and we start on outlaw and from that
point on she just she was just totally

876
00:54:00,099 --> 00:54:04,299
use mine I'm making yet we we were yeah
we we were we were buddies

877
00:54:04,299 --> 00:54:11,299
yet are so well

878
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:15,490
yeah

879
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:19,619
arm yes sums I me we have consulted to

880
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:23,710
will say I feel bad cuz I felt like I
just scanned my grandmother right

881
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:27,210
arm n enya sometimes

882
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:31,320
but but the point of the exercise is to
make the organization

883
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:35,330
you know more secure and hopefully

884
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:40,430
I can't I can't I mean I don't know the
100 calls and I made I don't know if

885
00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:41,330
those people

886
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:45,580
got reprimanded or fired or whatever I
mean I don't hang around but

887
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:49,780
I do consult with the client that to
explain to them this is an education

888
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:51,920
process it's not this is not something

889
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:55,630
for disciplinary action right especially
if it's like the first

890
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:59,400
time this person has been tested you
know if they just really yr

891
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,550
bad okay maybe or or you know whatever
but

892
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:06,320
the purpose of this is educational us
are we at a time I'm

893
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:09,970
yeah I don't I'm sorry thank thank you
