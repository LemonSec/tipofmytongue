29
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,700
I so quick disclaimer so when I first

30
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,189
I was asking this presentation I was the
CISO

31
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:51,820
of parochial Salesforce I was a CISO all

32
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,840
a cloud service provider tenneco's
really a caso

33
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,200
although report up to me but that was my
title so

34
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,509
when I first were are was scheduled come
get this presentation

35
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:05,500
I was a hundred and biased right I was
gonna come %uh took the company line

36
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,538
cloud is safe we love the cloud all of
that

37
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:13,209
since then I've left Salesforce I can
say whatever the hell I want now

38
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:17,430
so you ask me I will to hell you I have
no problems with it

39
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,840
so yet that is great for you guys here
is my shameless plug this is the only

40
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,970
say most part I think in the entire
presentation

41
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,050
i've a new company box security we are
hiring

42
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:30,750
those positions on hiring if you you
know what a job if you wanna talk it be

43
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,940
known about the job referral fee

44
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,370
that's what I'm looking for right now
really we're hiring

45
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,590
me just make sure this is very clear
we're still hiring there's a lot of the

46
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,150
perks right that we have its

47
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,080
really cool stuff okay I so now Wireless
enemy

48
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,780
this is basically the hey look at me
this is why I am up your own states like

49
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,200
right

50
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,000
and so this is why I'm qualified to talk
about clout in security and whatever

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,970
had been in this game really really long
time how many people were around for

52
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:58,420
these

53
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:03,239
me you know all these acronyms yes I
thought government if your heart

54
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,470
so back in 99 I started my career well

55
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,830
size fits all civil government before
that 99 it for my corporate career

56
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,099
at for coming up TRX we launched on

57
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:17,090
that travel management systems city we
lost Expedia we lost orbits are part of

58
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:17,629
orbits

59
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:22,819
we were a SASE before existed right but
back then we call it ASP

60
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:25,879
application %uh solution provider and
then

61
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:29,560
well that was bad nobody like that so
we're OST were outsource

62
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,190
also also sounds better some reason
right are crap and that was about a

63
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,989
couple years later so we are hosted
solution provider right

64
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:38,989
is all markings the same technology same
terms everything

65
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:42,220
sass on as does the ass

66
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,260
yeah an impasse okay much much later
sorry

67
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,750
been it's about ninety nine unbeaten
security companies in dealing with

68
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,080
clout right I sino la tobacconist have a
lot of acronyms

69
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,040
is unfortunate Sunday's depend on the
conversations you follow on Twitter

70
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,580
but it is what it I so first before we
really getting

71
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,319
let's talk about clout what is clout how
we define clout

72
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,470
if you read articles about cloudy
talking about clout such a character

73
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,480
nobody knows what it means is like a
cloud is indigo

74
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,890
our easy to where your client Salesforce
o'clock go

75
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,259
you know what is a so we'll talk a
little more clout first and then we'll

76
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,139
start dive in and and see where we go

77
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:23,290
so first have a car we have the lowest
level right is

78
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,520
Infrastructure as a Service
infrastructure services you're bringing

79
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,509
hardware

80
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:30,740
or rainy instances a run on hardware so
this is like Iraq spaces

81
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:35,180
easy to use stuff like that how many
people employ some kind of a system like

82
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:35,800
this

83
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,919
in there I enterprise right now sick

84
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:43,699
not many surprising usually you wanna
talk to people that much much higher

85
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:46,930
they're all kinda moving to augmenting
their

86
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,800
their infrastructure was some kind of
all are rented hardware

87
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,139
then if you move up the stack one level
you have Platform as a Service

88
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:57,210
prices were her Roku rain right so when
I was a sales force

89
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,039
division Iran was a Roku and so this is
where we're at. so we basically

90
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,070
ran the on you allocate a little down

91
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:08,270
so our application services right so the
web services databases whatever

92
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:12,440
you are you go to our platform granite
hopefully it will hurt

93
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,770
sometimes it didn't but completed and
you know we took everything else

94
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,860
and then if you go up a level you have a
most people will call clout right so

95
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,539
sassy

96
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:24,270
when moved to clout mostly thinks that's
right this is a

97
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,840
it's a service as an application out
there I'm gonna go use it and

98
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,750
hopefully everything's gonna be good
where is this is your workdays your

99
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,130
Salesforce is your

100
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:36,139
you know whatever's right so how many
people are using some sort of sacks

101
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:39,479
in their environment okay almost there
right how many people are using

102
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:41,080
something like a pass

103
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,940
a Roku I Google a

104
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,139
App Engine whatever's calls it like that
okay

105
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:52,090
like two or three okay balance still
very interesting not he was moved out

106
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,030
model yet K that's the really dangerous
mark as you can see for yourself

107
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:01,440
alright so then white really happens is
what you look at all these you realize

108
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,199
that this is really work loudest

109
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,610
cloud is always really combination of
services I it's a stacking up services

110
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:13,270
so community assessment or somebody uses
right now

111
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:18,919
really any right always your answer use
aspin there's no way as an example

112
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:22,180
type box box

113
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,190
okay so her summers a box I think I
don't have on thoughts go with that

114
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:31,050
you a month so if you look at box right
in your call to your website you look at

115
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,630
you know where their porn images from
where they're storing things

116
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,930
you realize boxes accommodation services
go to Salesforce

117
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,759
your workday go to any these guys you
realize their combination services

118
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:45,530
their stories stuff on easy to other
store stuff on Amazon's s3

119
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,949
using Rackspace's occupy using all these
other services to come together to bring

120
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:52,090
one big service that they didn't give
you

121
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:56,330
such companies and services so cloud is
really a service effects

122
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:00,080
right it's a bunch of things and the
sting stack up

123
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,949
to be the clout that you think that the
service for and that you don't have to

124
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:04,680
audit

125
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,470
and deal with right very simple right
and so the Wii

126
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,639
once we understand that there's a a
stack of things right there's a

127
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,030
as all the things that go into it and we
understand the types the cloud services

128
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:15,590
they're out there

129
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:19,289
we can start on what a reserve risk I
see you have the infrastructure stuff

130
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:23,120
if researchers the lowest level they
don't build an application for you

131
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,400
there are running a website right it's
your application is offenders

132
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,729
application whomever

133
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:31,810
in so what you really concerned at this
level is was the security of the

134
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,970
hardware the fertilizers are given the
other people are there internal security

135
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:35,889
policies

136
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:39,060
and that's what you have to deal with
when you talk to these guys now if you

137
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,720
go up the stack to somebody like

138
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,099
I have a Roku and you look at the pass
now they provide you an OS

139
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:49,169
they're providing you the II you know
web server configurations

140
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:52,660
the Friday the database now you have to
worry about that level security and yet

141
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:52,979
to start

142
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:56,550
auditing now I so as you go up the stack
gets more complicated

143
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:00,800
then you two sacks and sass now is where
most people are used to auditing

144
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,020
most who are used to thinking about
clout

145
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,580
so they're like oh the process for teens
in the second actions in the whatever's

146
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,389
in the world this is where they start to
think

147
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:13,180
right it so as you move up the stack
have to worry about different security

148
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,629
levels

149
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:17,759
but in the day really to think about all
a bit because

150
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,280
its just you know a service of things

151
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,910
so how many people right now our
auditing cloud vendors

152
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:30,419
as it is my number people same wanna
love you okay shame

153
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:34,370
so arm let me ask somebody if he doesn't
mind sane

154
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:37,190
and we'll try to actually come for the
real thing but this time %uh someone

155
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,959
who's not

156
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:41,769
auditing their clout our staff and urs
can't we shout out why they're not doing

157
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:46,660
that right now

158
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:51,560
axle love that answer somebody else is
doing it that's the best kind of work

159
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,310
right there was somebody else does okay
anybody who's just is not getting done

160
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,760
it all on a shout out why

161
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,470
general I think if I was gonna go for
answer that question okay in

162
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:07,080
alright so I when we start talking about
cloud security and we start our audience

163
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,010
and you know what the security problems
are and how we're gonna break in the

164
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:10,890
clouds

165
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,500
you know we there's a couple things we
have to think about first in the first

166
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,519
thing is we have to think differently

167
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,459
right we on a cloud we gotta look at a
cloud service

168
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:22,459
the technology is the same stuff we've
always say

169
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:25,390
car is not new it's not unique spin
around for a very long time that's why I

170
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,500
started this presentation my story out

171
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,519
back in 1999 I was doing clap

172
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:34,190
right it's been around a long time all
the technology stack has been around to

173
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,060
go look at parochial

174
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,080
Salesforce I'm when its sovereign
systems

175
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,940
post press database run for Nash are run
Apache

176
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,170
but always different you know services
all stuff that you've seen everywhere

177
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:45,980
else

178
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,970
but that differences that somebody else
managing its bottle differently

179
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,529
its integrated with the budget other
services is to think differently about

180
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:55,589
it when you look at it in your approach
it

181
00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:59,440
right but the technology is all the same
so the first thing i would tell people

182
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,610
here's my go out or a mistake if you
should ever second

183
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,459
is accept the transfer risk whenever
you're looking at a car servicing like

184
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:08,190
oh I want to use this call service but

185
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,399
you know the security and a concern in
in all this

186
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:14,829
you have to let go either we can be
control freak if to step back a bit and

187
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:15,450
say

188
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,700
oh well somebody else's managing this
campaign them to manage this

189
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,920
I have to realize that I'm gonna give up
something I might give us some control

190
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,890
just like if you're a vendor any kind
event if you're selling a product

191
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,740
service on a service whatever

192
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:32,100
to another company they're giving up
control for you how eager consultants

193
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,269
okay smallmouth okay so consoles know
that's right consoles coming to an

194
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:38,450
organization and they say oh we need to
do this when you do that whatever

195
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:42,480
and the internal IT guy insurance
carriers info

196
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,329
like this is my thing is what I do you
know why why mess in my playground right

197
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:50,200
and the songs like one here to help
right and there's always love or not

198
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,350
always but many times is little friction
right

199
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,430
same happens in clout got a step back in
africa is OK

200
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:59,720
was not the you know vendor manager
security and do what they did

201
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,800
and it always work out a little bit
better and then

202
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,410
the next thing to think about is that
once we get over that we have to say oh

203
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:10,490
not all vendors are the same how many
have you have security audit checklist

204
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,040
that you send your vendors

205
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,399
I wanna was more than than that I know
because I've been on the other

206
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,070
I've been on this idea too many times I
know that at least 75 percent of you in

207
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:20,329
your

208
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:23,800
have some questionnaire that you sent to
vendors there's like 300 questions

209
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,310
in Excel has absolutely nothing to do
with what your auditing but that's what

210
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:30,000
you're gonna send them to piss them off
anyway

211
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,140
you all know that alright have been on
the site way too many times

212
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,279
so don't be that guy I so the big not
parse

213
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:41,019
to him think ever is when when I work
for these vendors

214
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:45,459
and I get this questionnaire Scott 11
tabs in Excel's way too damn big

215
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:48,649
got 11 tabs three hundred questions per
tab in the light answer all these

216
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:49,810
questions on my

217
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:54,480
n/an/an/an/a and then i get some email
back from a risk analyst don't

218
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,649
you are not allowed to answer these and
a well

219
00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:01,899
they're not help but to me tell you I
course make sure all day long whatever

220
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:06,000
care finance if you are whatever right
it don't be that guy I think about it

221
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,480
before you do this right

222
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,480
I'm getting you to walk through it when
you when you order the services you need

223
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,279
to think about it

224
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,570
in rationalize the rest musical with the
risk each services so that when you go

225
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,990
in there you say okay

226
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,010
on a threat model the shower quick are
and say okay

227
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,899
here's the restore it to my business and
we go enormous asset from heart this

228
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:24,720
urge you know

229
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,589
on asylum tempor nec checklist whatever
is

230
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:31,690
but it needs to be relevant so you know
to come in and ask a thousand questions

231
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,930
%uh PCI for something had nothing to do
with that

232
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:37,709
don't ask a thousand things out windows
on is all an action or whatever

233
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:41,350
this is the biggest thing that holds
many organizations backing clough

234
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,380
is that they send these ridiculous check
with something all the field checklist

235
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,910
well the problem was that the security
defender the promise that im checklist

236
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,560
in the first place

237
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,110
okay you know that much less RAM II have
to get out ahead

238
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:56,380
checklist paid and and I'm response for
bill have the same thing so

239
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,639
I it I think full

240
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:03,170
I so next thing is we move into know
thyself right so now that we understand

241
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,910
that we must think differently

242
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,370
and we must approach differently we have
to kinda start to think about ourselves

243
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,000
what we trying to get

244
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,260
out of our security program what
actually matters to us what do we have

245
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,820
to dress in the cloud right

246
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,070
and so with to develop our security
baseline we have to say

247
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,970
you know these are things that we care
about these are things that we're trying

248
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,690
to achieve these are things that we're
gonna make our vendors achieving this is

249
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,540
how we're gonna

250
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,820
approach it now if you go look at like
our class security alliance in

251
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,410
Co other random organizations out there
trying to do stuff trying to help with

252
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,240
this from a bill that based on a bridge
that gap between

253
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,540
traditional okay here's our new standard
in whatever reason enterprising

254
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:42,260
hearsay kinda Taylor the wording on the
presentation and everything to the cloud

255
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,199
services

256
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,250
is too young right Werner infancia that
by it

257
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,310
you know we're making strides their
again technology has a change Weezy

258
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,630
change our mindset how we approach it

259
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,420
and so as we figure that part out then
we understand the different kinds of

260
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,310
services what we just talked about

261
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:01,300
it's only going to assess something we
go okay what kind of service so we

262
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,399
actually assessing

263
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,709
why do worse assess that's why was it
Roku we're platform as a service right

264
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:12,300
so platforms as service we ran the stack
you going to put your code

265
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,779
numerous organizations daily would call
me and say

266
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:20,310
hey we got to a single injection Marco
moderate damn thing was going to echo

267
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,010
what do you do it

268
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:26,180
they were so surprised the streets like
whoa whoa whoa whoa what up her office

269
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,220
clout

270
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,339
you know protection from suggestion now
you protect yourself

271
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:35,269
probably not scheduling for me to do it
I write the code was in my coat a

272
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:38,480
manager was there code right but they
had no concept of what they were looking

273
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,360
at night

274
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,760
I had 18 come in and do a are secure

275
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,070
right came and they did the are in the
paper star from whatever rise doctors

276
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:46,899
find a row

277
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:50,860
the broader Ely and testers and the
Pentastar stop ago

278
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:55,120
out ya to write the code you ownership
to write the code work

279
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,470
far as a Service as great monies film
and cater for the client right

280
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:03,399
so understand the service that you guys
are looking at before you get there are

281
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:04,660
ways we sponsor money in

282
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:08,079
one feels timing you know I know if I
can remain but well you would have known

283
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,350
works are not there but

284
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:13,760
you would've are in so you know this is
still like the largest ball that I see

285
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,339
right here

286
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:17,769
understanding really is at rest and who
owns what

287
00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:20,980
it seems to be very confusing for many
companies these days and we as in

288
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,279
diffusing get better

289
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:26,310
communication around that I think on and
then I again we talk about the

290
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:29,750
acceptance transfer rest I put on here
twice because still a really really big

291
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,120
thing

292
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,529
we are for we're are control freaks by
nature in this industry right which

293
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:37,899
hey we need to be I'm been as
interesting fifteen years and

294
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:41,160
I'm different control freak an essay but
works for me

295
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,560
a home but we have to step back we're
talking about cloud how certain vendors

296
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,630
and partners

297
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:48,610
to step back a little bit which is hard
to do rikers our security is our baby

298
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,910
and that's what we do and we love it as
a job in

299
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:54,360
of it goes upside down with plenty of

306
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,100
hey I have this concern are hey what's
the biggest

307
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,089
insecure thing you know about me cloud
services whatever as we've got social

308
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:18,019
things out

309
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:22,459
and let's awake the recipe was mike is
this guy was your sleep in

310
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:28,139
its leader either arm %um Cisco the
assessment phase that area as he woke up

311
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:31,160
welcome hey I know this morning I could
I

312
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,839
okay so the first thing on assessments I
am DXR

313
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,509
um so first thing on assessments you not
getting everything for eight dollars a

314
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:39,300
month

315
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,360
I so there's a CEO of this cloud
provider

316
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,440
and when I used to write for
InformationWeek part-time

317
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,579
do interview with them and I'm like a
what if I wanna come in I wanna says

318
00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:49,199
your service

319
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,000
he owes sure because I get these
documents or send you whatever you're on

320
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,230
a pen task whatever

321
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:57,250
have fun I don't care okay we focus your
data center with a touching staffer

322
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,430
phone look two-year

323
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:01,870
you know everybody's against do him
eight dollars a month

324
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:05,939
yes of as lovely what he said to me it
was like I personally got balls

325
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:09,329
second all you're right I think that was
a month how much security to every

326
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:11,199
dollars a month

327
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,980
not very much for me now very much so
quick

328
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,039
so yeah I you know it Eagles Michael
expect everything

329
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:21,579
right so look at the kind of service and
if it's like eight dollars a month don't

330
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:24,039
expect that likes me super badass
security

331
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:27,230
unless the company is very progressive
and you know

332
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,690
whatever it is I'm awesome security in
like like the guys a box like another

333
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,910
secure got a box like they're really
awesome there's a lot of shit to do for

334
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:34,380
you

335
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,549
for the 15 or so dollars a month they
charge per user

336
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:40,960
there's a limit right sort of remember
that accidents things work with the

337
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,620
provider

338
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,299
how many have you have ever truly try to
work where

339
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:51,360
I an external provider like us ass your
cloud vendor whatever

340
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,059
on their security to truly understand
you know what they have

341
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:59,100
and give them feedback as well every
okay and every given a feedback to be

342
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,190
like hey this is what I would like to
see the light

343
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:08,190
non-confrontational like hey I wanna
talk to you

344
00:18:30,139 --> 00:18:33,929
it was gonna cells was a X says I went
off a nose for

345
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:36,950
well cells or cells was also on of

346
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,360
now so those guys ago so with so this is
a great case

347
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,470
most people I talk to most people that
came to me we're like

348
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,269
oh my god I'm big enterprise and here's
why security checklist and we're gonna

349
00:18:47,269 --> 00:18:50,399
run up on a bill to suspend or gonna
tell you how your security is knowledge

350
00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:50,850
might

351
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:54,929
go whatever as they come back in like we
should do this business on right now

352
00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:58,299
might but they never want to have a
conversation or dictate to me

353
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:03,250
my do my service I run service your
customers you can talk of tumors or your

354
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,230
customer customers they

355
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:07,529
they want the service kinda Trump you
here

356
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:11,590
I can provide me with what they want
like SB ensemble I'm the business

357
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:15,399
they want this so dictating to me
probably not really gonna work so much

358
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:16,200
but

359
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,159
having a conversation with me and saying
hey how about this or could we do this

360
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:20,529
are

361
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:24,269
help us to understand this I had any
tire guy on my team

362
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:27,450
senior principal engineer dedicated

363
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:31,700
to go talk to customers just for cool
shit just it was the senior

364
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,529
where r senior principal security
engineer caution i think is what we are

365
00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:36,470
surprised his car

366
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,630
you would literally just go out and talk
to customers and cuss words like

367
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,659
yeah we'll really lights up your back
all over locks

368
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:45,960
cool what does that look like you want
to syslog what you want you know this

369
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,289
cuz

370
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:49,909
one cuz was a no really what we want is
wanna be able to run

371
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:53,299
agent on our side to subscribe to a
queue on your side parts at all so we

372
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:55,570
get real time we don't open the firewall
all this

373
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,679
right call for five days later is in
production

374
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:02,149
right had eight senior principal
security engineer cool shit like it was

375
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:04,370
an awesome job I wanted it cuz

376
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:08,380
he had your paperwork that I had to do
those quiet nights so ima

377
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,460
work with your vendors like most will
never try to actually really work with

378
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,240
the vendor so these guys they went out
the door to Salesforce were hit by nine

379
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,490
know what they told you

380
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,610
I know the exact story exacted on the
other side that comes in

381
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:23,019
as ellsworth so I know exactly what they
said their kinda exxon I want on

382
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:26,039
but now and plan to sell source spy now
on

383
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:29,789
so who is to work with your vendor most
is cloud vendors

384
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:32,799
a really open if you approach them in a
like

385
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,809
collaborative manner and don't try to
position as

386
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:38,879
hey I'm big enterprise ihe on the
customer if you

387
00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:42,639
his work with us to hear some quality
shit I want most the security teams

388
00:20:42,639 --> 00:20:46,720
will talk to you and it's very very easy
a smaller vendors to more defensive

389
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,100
because marketplace second sucks and
when you have those conversations

390
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,950
community intent not implementation when
somebody would come to me a climb come

391
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:55,909
to me and say

392
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:59,360
hey you have to implement this you have
to use have been what I'm gonna say

393
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,250
you have to implement these firewalls
and here's our standard was lighted

394
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,690
I mean the clout how you gon ASA in the
cloud warheit

395
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,730
he do that that's an amazing feat Cisco
I there from you

396
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:14,769
from like think it doesn't work and they
could not grasp is like what you have to

397
00:21:14,769 --> 00:21:15,639
stop essays

398
00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:19,830
Mike when you're white missed holiday
this

399
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:23,929
a sure whatever me the cut if the
context pick it up I will go by serving

400
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:25,889
as a system a days and I can't do
anything but

401
00:21:25,889 --> 00:21:28,929
whatever out do that whatever you want
it

402
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:32,080
the problem was they were trying to tell
me the actual implementation how they

403
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,669
did it not be in 10 what they want if
you talk in 10

404
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:38,230
you realize Rd added right I really was
doing all that

405
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:42,080
so I had another customer call me and
talking about web application security

406
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,570
and he tried to tell me about to go into
action bodies were about that as I can

407
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:50,360
and I was explained what we do and how
we're not vulnerable and and all this

408
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:50,990
kind of thing

409
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:54,580
and he could not grasp it because we
didn't do things the quote-unquote

410
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,789
traditional way

411
00:21:55,789 --> 00:22:00,039
and what what he did tell me that I did
not understand sequence action

412
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:04,860
fast forward right now the guy who
discovers ago injection

413
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,129
heads up my research team at my new
company I

414
00:22:08,129 --> 00:22:12,039
understands you go into action inside an
hour it's not a new concept like

415
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:15,600
I get this but go back for months and
there's a guy tell me that I have no

416
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,419
cost for this because my

417
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:21,200
implementation was different than hits
right that is so damn annoying

418
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,460
so work with your vendor and communicate
that intent

419
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:28,500
as you're going through it cuz it'll
help you tell your assessment as well

420
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,580
to understand how did they implement
things what are they doing

421
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,240
where you really need a threat model
their business and how do you really

422
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,370
focus on are the true security there II

423
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:41,769
you know hour from architecture
everything else so

424
00:22:41,769 --> 00:22:46,119
where to start art so as we want to hear
from you guys cum targets of rights

00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:03,269
everybody's holler it technically
started around 6:30

449
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:08,330
the I day there's a start in the bar and
just uses continuation treatment I for

450
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:08,889
is really bad

451
00:24:08,889 --> 00:24:12,570
it us for a couple years later I'm at
this conference in watching this guy's

452
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:13,879
some work on maybe

453
00:24:13,879 --> 00:24:17,019
RT on seven Atlanta and he's on stage

454
00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:20,200
any is literally drinking at a four
beers at one time

455
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,499
and people are throwing shoes I don't
know

456
00:24:24,499 --> 00:24:28,059
I don't understand why I was there the
entire day it was not like

457
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:31,919
on the agenda throw shoes now I like I
don't know shoes to start off line

458
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,649
what guy said it was really interesting
to me right

459
00:24:35,649 --> 00:24:38,730
he was talking about whether application
security he's got a huge bag I know if

460
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,100
you guys know well guess you're the

461
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:45,129
the speakers Billy of it and so Billy is
a thirties talkin and he saying okay

462
00:24:45,129 --> 00:24:48,669
where do you start menu assess whether
occasion people are like

463
00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:52,169
oh you scan it you spider you do all
these things just

464
00:24:52,169 --> 00:24:55,860
now you read the fucking manual first
he's like you forget what this offer is

465
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,340
what it does the mangled normally tell
you the most

466
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,499
love what you need right off the bat so
do you understand the application to

467
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:02,639
find all the weak points

468
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:06,720
clough services in the same thing they
have about pages there FAQ's

469
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,450
Health Bureau kubrick wasn't hired
developer section on the website

470
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:13,610
that he talks about the code however
ron's all this

471
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:16,919
you either get her page there's all
kinds open source projects that actually

472
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:17,320
run

473
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:21,220
in production it's like your road map
for hacking them right there

474
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,490
the most awesome thing ever now course
from my role when I was it was not lost

475
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:24,860
on

476
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:28,960
because I have this platform that
anybody can write ha style code:

477
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,379
uploaded to apply for execute a platform
like me

478
00:25:32,379 --> 00:25:35,899
thank you just attacking from within my
platform also

479
00:25:35,899 --> 00:25:39,080
about but two weeks into that job of

480
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,139
held I take this job okay so it's the
reader may not but not only do you read

481
00:25:43,139 --> 00:25:45,080
the manual you read the menu of all the
things

482
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,429
right so if your gonna go when you gonna
track when the services are you gonna

483
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:50,750
try to pen testing to audit you okay

484
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:54,149
only to look at the whole ok apply for
what is Oracle user group uses

485
00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:58,869
a.w.s services members on ec2 s3 all
these things 00 uses ready to go

486
00:25:58,869 --> 00:26:02,490
all use the same grid is always our
services I so now I'm gonna start a

487
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,490
manpower and say

488
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:06,690
oath here's all the touch points here is
everything it uses

489
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:11,049
utilizes Michael read all the manuals on
Nos to fully understand what they do how

490
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:13,210
they integrate and start to find my
weaknesses

491
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:17,600
this is the week is the cloud services
cloud services almost like really code

492
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,169
for saw any redevelopment here

493
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:22,419
actually revolver sock I

494
00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:26,250
so the problem for developers are

495
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:29,429
they don't write anything new and okay I

496
00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:33,200
voy a team Ruby developers and I given
this shit all the time

497
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,240
because I supporting a Java developers
as I love the subtle Java really works

498
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,549
quite interesting for me to watch in the
day my skype chat so it's fine

499
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:44,490
for me so much for them but it if you
look at the review world right

500
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:48,399
in the rupee world nobody really writes
new stuff everybody built upon other

501
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:49,100
people stuff

502
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,119
so I what you talkin to me is coated a
and i'm looking at this

503
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:55,559
are so Klein right to make a calls to
the south so papi

504
00:26:55,559 --> 00:27:00,960
yeah when I actually got down to the bar
which is noblest cellblock

505
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,639
I'd go through three a TCP
implementations to get there it was so

506
00:27:04,639 --> 00:27:05,210
quiet

507
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:09,549
on supplement ACP client what up in a
steep decline on top of the native Ruby

508
00:27:09,549 --> 00:27:11,470
issue because i dont have open SSL

509
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,740
that's a cloud services or crap like
Rubicon on swype

510
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:19,169
so but that's ok cause services or their
hot spot in the stack up a budget thanks

511
00:27:19,169 --> 00:27:22,200
so if you wanna find the weaknesses and
you wanna know where to attack

512
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,960
you just figure out what in this month's
service is comprised of

513
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,950
and you start picking off pieces my same
as if you're auditing

514
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,340
you try to find the rest of the class
service June with the biggest risk

515
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:37,840
is not the vendor your actually talking
to if the vendors willing to sell to you

516
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,859
is an enterprise

517
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:42,889
they thought about security it was up 12
in the back room the keychain to the

518
00:27:42,889 --> 00:27:45,440
task to answer security questions as
least that guy right

519
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,820
but what your real risk is is what
services they use a solicitor class

520
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,279
service

521
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:53,820
and they're using messaging system a
queuing system recovery because these

522
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,169
days

523
00:27:54,169 --> 00:27:57,399
maybe these are ready to go really
really common

524
00:27:57,399 --> 00:28:01,619
a lot because services offload there are
two systems to register your

525
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:05,149
so maybe these neurons to go of you ever
noticed

526
00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:09,009
rest ago doesn't sell to the enterprise
there's a reason they don't sell today

527
00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:09,529
at a price

528
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:15,250
readies itself is not secure res is self
doesn't support kept a transmission boom

529
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,769
there you go their dad is a weaker point
and say

530
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:22,289
perot-gore Salesforce I want the front
doors that you're probably already so

531
00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:25,539
if you if we go back now I understand
why spend so much time on this

532
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:28,590
i've seen hey call services are stack up
thanks

533
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:31,970
understand what's in there think
differently on your approach don't think

534
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:35,129
it is like assessing this one box is one
application

535
00:28:35,129 --> 00:28:38,609
it's a hodgepodge up some good some crap

536
00:28:38,609 --> 00:28:41,539
that's in there so you have to start
thinking about that %uh same goes with

537
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:42,649
by all the email

538
00:28:42,649 --> 00:28:45,659
sending providers email sending
solutions in the cloud

539
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:48,789
that's a that's my favorite want to
attack those he's

540
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:52,139
really fun okay now if you wanna know
where to really look

541
00:28:52,139 --> 00:28:55,509
like to dive into it actual disc one
single provider

542
00:28:55,509 --> 00:28:58,869
this is allissa starts with so we talk
about the things right a look at all the

543
00:28:58,869 --> 00:29:00,000
things that make it up

544
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,200
and I still think that's the most
support says we're gonna find your

545
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,049
weakest links

546
00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:06,580
and that's where you're gonna be able to
attack one thing and then out through

547
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,779
to get back to the more secure service
or more secure service

548
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:13,500
that they're trying to sell you but the
others things start to look at

549
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:18,210
is were data stored how is stored house
transmit this is a big one in the cloud

550
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:18,859
crime

551
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:23,009
on in the enterprise for a very long
time we've had a methodology of

552
00:29:23,009 --> 00:29:27,299
I if you had a website as a CPS we're
gonna terminate SLR load balancers are

553
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:28,200
front and

554
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,359
and they're gonna go play nice to be
back to back in right now there's a

555
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:33,119
start to change a bit as

556
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:36,779
are it's less expensive you for us all
to rewrite the code does not it is

557
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:37,990
expensive anymore

558
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:42,460
are to do but this is still is pretty
like a scene in stays in place in many

559
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,250
organizations

560
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:47,169
well the problem is that same like the
design carried over the cloud many times

561
00:29:47,169 --> 00:29:50,740
so then when you start looking to cloud
providers and you realize oh well they

562
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,759
one on top infrastructure providers like
easy to

563
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:57,539
with your data is flowing in on purpose
on a public network

564
00:29:57,539 --> 00:30:01,539
which is a sense is a problem ever right
BC to now easy to my body is a easy to

565
00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:05,309
secure tell you oh we tag packets we do
all this and secure whatever

566
00:30:05,309 --> 00:30:08,359
somebody's gonna screw up right it's
gonna happen

567
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:11,359
arm was about least six months ago

568
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:15,659
easy to screwed up the load balancing
fixed and responses were coming back in

569
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:18,179
the wrong pages from different customers

570
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:21,419
so there is a perfect example right
there right isn't is no longer a what if

571
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:22,879
it's no longer theoretical

572
00:30:22,879 --> 00:30:26,950
it actually happened so any by that was
that was transferred ATP

573
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:30,200
stuff its comeback you get the wrong
response is it was crazy was

574
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,389
chaos right but the people that were
flowing for ACPs all the way through

575
00:30:34,389 --> 00:30:35,710
their stack

576
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:39,139
didn't have this problem because it was
a possible for to happen and that's an

577
00:30:39,139 --> 00:30:39,659
area

578
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:43,429
so no which took a theoretical made it
real so understanding

579
00:30:43,429 --> 00:30:46,750
incise a I love where your date is is a
calming old

580
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:50,289
are with other customers of one customer
laws on application exploit that they

581
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:51,359
get your data

582
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:54,929
II network configuration same thing I a
is your day to suffice I was somebody

583
00:30:54,929 --> 00:30:56,049
else

584
00:30:56,049 --> 00:30:59,460
the Wii you know in that move back into
the increase aside and not just from the

585
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,450
trans aside

586
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:03,700
of the backups where the backups in the
cloud are they stored in the cloud

587
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:08,230
off-site all this car stuff are they you
know cryptid all that kind of thing

588
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:11,830
same with the data storage at the stone
often things like rights rescue system

589
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,940
hugely popular in the cloud services

590
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:17,359
it's amazing and other guys it get hard
when other guys work day and all these

591
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:18,210
companies

592
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,389
in they all use cut the same technology
stacks which is really really

593
00:31:21,389 --> 00:31:24,580
interesting so if you listen to very
specific things I talk about

594
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,940
that your road map for attacking anyone
of these harm

595
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:32,240
but I the you know they all kinda have
the same somewhere weaknesses which is

596
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,639
always funny and the next thing is you
get down to the architecture right we

597
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:37,169
all know architecture reviews we are we

598
00:31:37,169 --> 00:31:40,960
we all go through there we talk about
okay how's the setup or whatever

599
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,230
but one interesting thing is I love to
point this one out again like my story

600
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:48,840
is was the true rest Cove the various
things based on architecture

601
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,049
so frances if there's a single injection
in a fun and

602
00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:55,259
are application process provider

603
00:31:55,259 --> 00:31:58,359
is a possible for that attacker to get
to your day right

604
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:01,440
I see some heavy ass season had snow is
like me

605
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,840
I don't know the question is you don't
know what to do the architects review

606
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,450
because it may be multi-tenant
environment it may not be

607
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:12,210
it they may use ever database accounts
to access data per customer

608
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:16,629
they may not you don't know sequin
Jackson in itself is not always

609
00:32:16,629 --> 00:32:20,419
dangerous to you you just don't know yet
don't know more about it

610
00:32:20,419 --> 00:32:23,429
so I was taught her body make sure that
as you go through their you start

611
00:32:23,429 --> 00:32:24,230
looking at

612
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:27,529
the actual architecture how these things
stack and

613
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:30,570
are how the risk actually affect you

614
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:33,829
now anybody wanna anything

615
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:37,190
what was the number one thing you look
at you if you are in a cloud service

616
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:40,629
heard some are some from down the side
earlier

617
00:32:40,629 --> 00:32:44,070
now nothing location okay

618
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:47,659
so like physical location worst restore
as a great one right

619
00:32:47,659 --> 00:32:51,659
so physical he's a physical location of
where your data store right

620
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:56,070
so you have residency issues you have oh
my god is my data being stored higher on

621
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:59,309
what are they doing with it yet safe
harbor issues with you

622
00:32:59,309 --> 00:33:03,289
all these great things right I me
personally me I

623
00:33:03,289 --> 00:33:06,659
use cloud surprise that North Korea feel
secure the gonna clear weapons and stop

624
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:10,639
I get it up

625
00:33:10,639 --> 00:33:16,000
whether I so um and the last thing to
assess is does the vendor to assess

626
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,730
it defended as assassins get their
assessments from will save you a lot of

627
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,529
work to make sure you look at the scope

628
00:33:20,529 --> 00:33:23,919
%uh those assessments too many vendors
say hey we're PCI compliant and they

629
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,599
walk away

630
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:29,440
you have to work for the environment PCI
compliant those controls carry over to

631
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,190
the other

632
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:33,250
party environment generally no PCI

633
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:37,159
toll environment PCI all environment so
whatever that it's all

634
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:43,240
marketing shit example no punches
carpenters I love these guys

635
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,779
height so I want to start talking about
that then we get in the car the

636
00:33:46,779 --> 00:33:48,220
protection side of things

637
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:51,349
so on you know how to protect yourself
in Harry you know

638
00:33:51,349 --> 00:33:54,829
properly utilize cloud services so

639
00:33:54,829 --> 00:33:58,529
arms to skip the first one talents
pretty obvious you guys get that

640
00:33:58,529 --> 00:34:01,679
I but the next one is that the audit so

641
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,269
this is a really interesting one to me
so

642
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:09,389
most cloud providers don't provide a lot
of audit logs for you

643
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:13,119
they don't lie to pack all the some that
are so sales for princess

644
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,720
they're working on our be much more
transparent a Roku are they

645
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,029
send along a three-tier by today to de
Justin logging data

646
00:34:20,029 --> 00:34:23,609
I you can explore all your data there
get real-time streams it's easy

647
00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:27,790
but the XOR is a newer more progressive
thoughts are most providers don't allow

648
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:28,409
this

649
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:32,290
and segal creative sometimes but you
can't really do things with the

650
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:36,740
API's I monitoring different
transactions change of state a setting

651
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,779
means you're crawling

652
00:34:37,779 --> 00:34:41,429
but it's usually very close to my
solutions I but they're there are

653
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:45,440
something resources are to come on the
market to help with this thank goodness

654
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,149
but this is very important and then
continues on how do you guys to continue

655
00:34:49,149 --> 00:34:51,020
sorting right now

656
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:54,619
how many people understand the concept
continues on it

657
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:58,109
okay was from spin cycle now in it okay
so continues on it

658
00:34:58,109 --> 00:35:03,210
so I wrote a framework a bow as the two
years ago when I was a CISO it either

659
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:06,369
or former his cock cock cock kept it was

660
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:09,420
are continuous continuous up

661
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:13,230
continues automated auditing now
continuous audit controls

662
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:17,270
automation that's what Scott so cock and
the concept behind Kaka

663
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:20,279
its rates a name for market approval
because it was the shit

664
00:35:20,279 --> 00:35:24,690
thank you on a you guys were getting
their songs like i

665
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:27,770
lead the horse to water make you drink
you're okay and %um

666
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:33,099
so arm the Casa behind this was I was
tired of my staff spending so much time

667
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:37,560
on auditing every six months when some
random ass order came in my office

668
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:41,579
and I was tired of finding are on
discrepancies my controls

669
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:45,650
analyst hired are spending so much time
on responding to

670
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:49,200
trivial attacks week's been already from
work to do all this force

671
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,839
ago our as much sex as a monitoring
system it go out to check control

672
00:35:52,839 --> 00:35:56,119
test control so very support Active
Directory our policy

673
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:59,720
go out had a test account you try to
change the password that s account took

674
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,400
our password that didn't meet the
complex requirements if you're

675
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,819
successful control fail

676
00:36:03,819 --> 00:36:07,740
if it was not successful control was
intact and they're going to hope for our

677
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,069
law call this right

678
00:36:09,069 --> 00:36:12,480
is great insisting that we wrote in shit
was in ruins

679
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,990
whatever on but if it worked out well
home

680
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:19,950
I got a mild of lower for a second a
problem anyway so the cause behind

681
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:22,140
continues on what we did is on all the
time

682
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:26,779
we could find when the state or control
changed and we knew about it Inc

683
00:36:26,779 --> 00:36:31,630
pretty much near real time right and so
take this is our pilots a cloud provider

684
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:35,099
where you no longer manage the security
controls and you can't run a contest

685
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:37,529
every day and you can't run source code

686
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:40,990
are you tools on ever release you just
don't have this visibility

687
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,020
to shift a lot of your actions and your
time

688
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:48,549
to the audit function well as we know
our it is time consuming

689
00:36:48,549 --> 00:36:51,750
can be boring sorry auditors but it can
be on

690
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:55,740
and so we need to move to using the API
is an automated tool sets

691
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:59,720
too costly test the security these
platforms kasich's has to make sure that

692
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,220
our signs are preferences and everything
are in place

693
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,160
and you know basically just give us that
real-time knowledge

694
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,020
similar to what we would have if we only
application in the infrastructure

695
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:13,430
K so the Casa behind continuous auditing
or yeah

696
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:17,549
Kaka because the shit you know so I and
then we talking about the %uh

697
00:37:17,549 --> 00:37:18,170
communicate

698
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:21,440
intent not a plantation I can I put this
one on here is a big one

699
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,460
if you work with the vendors talk to the
vendors a say

700
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:27,509
hey here's the intent is what I'm
looking for

701
00:37:27,509 --> 00:37:31,640
Julie work so much much better the
companies and hey install some Cisco ASA

702
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,770
is for the hell of it

703
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:36,319
you know cuz many vendors will do
whatever you want and it doesn't really

704
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:38,089
actually give you what you need

705
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,569
you know I to secure enterprise which is
quite unfortunate

706
00:37:41,569 --> 00:37:45,660
so on so I hurts me so hip for

707
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,880
we talked about data residency so we
have some

708
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,730
country lies there on what are some the
other big concerns that people have with

709
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,200
our cloud services

710
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:01,440
and providers at

711
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,640
if they have a season security expert on
the team okay that's a great one

712
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:09,520
so arm

713
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,549
truck the counting is that without an
interview people

714
00:38:12,549 --> 00:38:15,700
a home okay

715
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,230
so that companies that will truly cell
into the enterprise

716
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,880
actually thought more about security and
would really

717
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,020
have better security people the people
there or has its own the press are not

718
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:30,290
target the enterprise secure consumer
based applications and services

719
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:33,480
they're the ones its government to watch
for but

720
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,819
disc falling 10 usually find who the
security people are any organization

721
00:38:37,819 --> 00:38:41,170
and then you'll be able to rate them out
and look across different organizations

722
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:41,799
and see how they

723
00:38:41,799 --> 00:38:45,230
who they know you know all that stuff
but the biggest thing I say is

724
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:48,290
is go back to communication have the
discussion with the guys

725
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:52,160
you know in five minutes if you think
their season of are but the big big

726
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,579
thing to look at is not how seasoned or

727
00:38:54,579 --> 00:38:57,880
knowledgeable security Siemens but how
influential they are

728
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,660
in the organization are you have the
smartest security people on the planet

729
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:05,150
but they can't get things done either
because their own inability orders

730
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,130
because the organization doesn't want to

731
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:10,220
then it doesn't matter it's all for
naught are worse than the other big

732
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:13,210
problems or concerns you guys have

733
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:20,190
you were

734
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:25,190
gone something action here SDLC okay so
is

735
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:29,609
what he says if they fall in SLC right
so are the democratic code out there

736
00:39:29,609 --> 00:39:34,180
on the SS Marco you know is a care you
know what they're doing arm

737
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:37,269
yeah I'm not going to say most a

738
00:39:37,269 --> 00:39:41,400
mostar cloud providers toll most of us a
lesser

739
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,900
let the really really big ones like
Salesforce so sales were stuck on proper

740
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:49,170
right if very structure program all they
have to write at JP Morgan on their list

741
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:52,470
and she turned down from there

742
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:56,150
clout is like the wild wild west the
selects offer developers who were

743
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:59,809
are like white over to ship code awesome

744
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:03,650
I was gonna for protein production
reporters have made a caveat is working

745
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:06,640
again it goes back to host if it will be
shipped about people for developers on

746
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,579
order don't

747
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:10,809
on but now it's just the cloud services
are

748
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:14,269
so like a blue box we we have to set the
code we have on device

749
00:40:14,269 --> 00:40:17,299
our security code but we have our
security I for I

750
00:40:17,299 --> 00:40:20,930
two different kinds developers my guys
are on platform like

751
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:23,960
it supports for we just no doubt over
who

752
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,220
no we can't say we can't do that that's
a really good one to watch for

753
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:31,599
because the security controls I around
who was putting code in production

754
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,000
how fast do nothing if it's been audited
is a big one in the

755
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,009
in the CAF providers because you don't
have the luxury of being behind the

756
00:40:39,009 --> 00:40:40,440
corporate firewall and

757
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,369
lose practices are okay sometimes and
all that it's out there is public

758
00:40:44,369 --> 00:40:47,920
you in your you know best friends in ire
on North Korea Syria

759
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,529
whoever's attack yesterday arm can all
attacking play with it all day long

760
00:40:51,529 --> 00:40:55,019
I so want more our way in the back

761
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:59,900
I guess we both you with some first
support

762
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:06,150
and what can they see yeah I can see
everything

763
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:09,740
no contest arm so this is an interesting
one to me so

764
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:13,440
I just had this is from my team ranks
weeks at best buy for we do see a lot of

765
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,410
data for our customers

766
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:19,259
and you know one of my guys is arm
misbehave

767
00:41:19,259 --> 00:41:22,400
his fucking hit me I am and he's like
bathroom

768
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,890
hello hi to see if the user man we can't
see their data

769
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:28,340
we are protecting me

770
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:31,430
how was mister protected if we can't see
it I don't know me

771
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:34,430
we have figured out how Mike to who

772
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:37,250
and the Knights in that conversation cuz
that's like my Big Lebowski not done

773
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,220
right that's all I got

774
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:42,470
so anyway %uh in the cloud providers
it's very interesting right

775
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:45,640
so if you go back to enterprise you
think about it who can see your data

776
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,000
inside in a price on your host your own
application right

777
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,470
your network admin your sysadmin your
day be sad man who ever write these

778
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,460
arsenals the essay

779
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:56,050
the same applies to the our cloud
providers

780
00:41:56,050 --> 00:42:00,109
they have people who can see your data
right unless you're doing corruption on

781
00:42:00,109 --> 00:42:01,100
your side

782
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,310
and then stuff in the car today to them
they don't the keys on a they can see

783
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:04,820
your data

784
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:08,330
now they may have policies never look at
your data and let me tell you they do

785
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:12,670
those policies many probably do follow
that but you run the inherent risk out

786
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:14,250
somebody can see your data

787
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:17,270
and this is whether their ethical about
it honest about it

788
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:20,359
anfal so how to best practices in
Spanish safety guidelines

789
00:42:20,359 --> 00:42:24,540
oscalus corroborate our disclosure they
don't look at it but they can also your

790
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:24,890
data

791
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:28,700
what's the same respect you had when
your hose inside the enterprise

792
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:32,490
it's shifted outside if you're in a
prize right so after to back the risk

793
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:33,580
and actually slightly different

794
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:38,440
based on their controls but it's the
same problem essentially okay

795
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,859
there's another on the back right
availability

796
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:45,650
tell billy's not security question who
cares if its up

797
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:52,650
what is down a secure nobody can hack it
be honest does my fair I like when I

798
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:55,980
when like a plan for a good hour ago
ship our jobs number today I'm going to

799
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:56,650
come out

800
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:59,820
wants you I'll knows availability

801
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:03,540
I so I I think I saw talk about it so
fell below the cloud services

802
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,800
on most closer visit you look at don't
have as a lace

803
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,830
on purpose when you go out a look at it
does say

804
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:14,350
we achieve four we strive for

805
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:18,100
these are awesome intense but are not
guarantees to be very very careful that

806
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,530
most your cloud services other

807
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:23,480
know how solid as always unless they are
highly focused on the enterprise

808
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,090
or you're a big ass customer in the
giving us away the rest of them

809
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:30,170
the key piece of the sounds fancy but
then when you like calculate the actual

810
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:32,960
number of 9th they just gave you your
allies is like

811
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,390
and a month a year they can actually be
down like a shit like

812
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:40,950
math always wins so talk to move off the
market in on that

813
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:44,580
I but our many the services are getting
better on availability

814
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,369
aspects in the cloud where they can be
read on it we can actually you know

815
00:43:47,369 --> 00:43:50,300
architect properly because we'll have
the restraints a physical hardware in

816
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:50,800
space

817
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,740
I but like I said most of it is intent

818
00:43:54,740 --> 00:44:01,740
okay are one more

819
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:22,250
rights so are so questions reliability
you know if the car

820
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:25,460
Firefox 7 possible stops the f-bomb this
early in the mornings like me

821
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:29,780
on his car if the lockout provider folks
out you know where the liability right

822
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:33,319
if it's a regulatory thank efforts I
want their customers and whatever it is

823
00:44:33,319 --> 00:44:36,700
wears a liability on yet this is an
interesting one

824
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,790
so I know vaclav I was just talking to
our intercompany

825
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:44,040
our last week on the hook la provider
and this they want to do business with

826
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:48,280
huge like they were like all and we love
you guys gonna do it

827
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,440
this is exactly what stop the contract
unfortunately on

828
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,020
the cloud provider would not agree to
the liability terms that the

829
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:58,730
interest company wanted and they weren't
even putting claims data or

830
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:02,280
you know in like that this was further
internal operations you know whatever

831
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,710
stuff right I

832
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:07,339
in the cover would not accept liability
they were too afraid of the liability

833
00:45:07,339 --> 00:45:08,180
hamanaka me

834
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:11,420
this is a big one this has been a
problem for a long time with posted now

835
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:12,450
source providers

836
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:16,450
arm you see a little bit with my
consultants but not as my life kinda got

837
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:17,849
over that got standard terms on

838
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:20,920
a club fires are still scared to say yes

839
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:24,720
gonna take this liability I'm gonna you
know go to these limits whatever

840
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,470
some will do it but many of my word
about it and with good reason I will

841
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:31,380
defend them a bit on this one so many
star fighters

842
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:34,710
they don't know what data you're really
gonna shove in there you say

843
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:39,160
00 I want to use it for my internal
request tracking right and there's some

844
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:43,550
do show some customer data client data
patient data whatever their

845
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:47,050
Dennis compromise and now the customer
has a

846
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:50,460
in a regulatory phone line and they want
a cloud provider to pay for it and deal

847
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:50,910
with it

848
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:54,859
when in reality like hey the terms of
engagement with slightly different they

849
00:45:54,859 --> 00:45:57,440
didn't know about that they didn't know
that was going to be used for

850
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,690
so large providers had very heavily so
we total sales wasn't happening ago

851
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:04,839
so disclaimer low sales force the fam

852
00:46:04,839 --> 00:46:09,460
right but they have at it right
Salesforce is not want to deal with help

853
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:12,550
the regulations the liability is too
much for

854
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:17,099
they pushed back everywhere they can't
when I was at a Roku

855
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:20,250
we would not sell to somebody else
health care so we came to us and said

856
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:23,369
it would have to go later I want money
they

857
00:46:23,369 --> 00:46:28,300
I mean i libri pay me because I'm a
greedy capitalists right and a pain me

858
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:31,569
be on a call be like sorry I want a
business like that is

859
00:46:31,569 --> 00:46:34,730
kill part my heart right there every
time I say that right I

860
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:37,890
but the in today we did not want to help
their cause I don't want a liability

861
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:39,800
because it's too big a liability

862
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,690
for me cuz I don't know what they were
going to have their risk group we risk

863
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:43,210
but whatever

864
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:46,170
so this is a really really good one yes
answered a few big liability

865
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:46,930
requirements

866
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:50,000
make sure you're on top kept so

867
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,050
we're going to start to finish up link
it to some Q&A I

868
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:56,940
but you know this is kinda want to know
I would work with providers as a

869
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:00,119
kind of an overview some other stuff
that we talked about their I

870
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:03,280
you know everything from the transfer
risk management to

871
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,619
a you know how to say that all the
private different and working with the

872
00:47:06,619 --> 00:47:07,089
virus

873
00:47:07,089 --> 00:47:11,050
picking the providers around that up
that work with the risk levels you need

874
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:14,000
which tied it perfectly here to this
liability question that we just had

875
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,280
right so have the open dialogue really
work with them understand their stack of

876
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,540
things to find those witnesses want to
attacking to go after

877
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,500
and is going to make your life much much
easier but understand eight dollars a

878
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,030
month

879
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:28,190
you like in the vesicular in the world
it just did

880
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:31,920
economically doesn't make sense right
not gonna happen so if you want like

881
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,140
I was gonna say government great
security but we or kinda know the

882
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:37,230
government scorecard security so

883
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:40,250
yeah I don't know where SAE you with a
little security

884
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:44,910
my organization has hope on you know it
was a month public market you there

885
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:47,970
but ideal scenario that you're looking
for cloud providers

886
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:51,099
these are couple or points are kinda
some the ideal things

887
00:47:51,099 --> 00:47:54,940
day when you talk to cloud providers you
talked about you say hey do you have

888
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:55,569
these things

889
00:47:55,569 --> 00:47:58,589
kind of helping others in these are some
progressive Concepts

890
00:47:58,589 --> 00:48:01,710
in security asked that in the cloud is
very

891
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:05,050
easy to put in place so Francis the
first one disposable systems

892
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:09,079
right so what my platform that we run
are and a Roku in

893
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:12,170
I think a the box as well are

894
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:17,030
we treat systems parva version release
so when I was at Roku we never had an

895
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:19,460
operating system like a server is a
server to assess

896
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:23,450
in production longer 32 days 32 days was
the oldest

897
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:27,599
that any instance was ever production
mean it can ever be vulnerable to

898
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:27,930
anything

899
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:31,569
or in 32 days because everything every
time we boudin instance it was auto

900
00:48:31,569 --> 00:48:32,130
patch

901
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:36,020
everything tom our pastor right and so
we treat is systems as they were

902
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:38,930
disposable their part of the release of
we were in a row code

903
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:41,970
wrote for instance is I didn't hand path
we roll

904
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:45,750
appease the code we're all for instance
this is a great causing a cloud

905
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:48,410
providers can do this or talk to them
about that if they're doing it

906
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:51,900
it's a big win because patching bowman's
been all this stuff

907
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:56,210
becomes less meaningful arm is still me
for what much less me it was our primary

908
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:58,270
control it's a secondary control at this
point right

909
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:02,660
traffic management been automated again
because control systems have API's

910
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:06,049
everything fertilize this is really
really easy to do and this is where you

911
00:49:06,049 --> 00:49:07,609
want to copy writers to be

912
00:49:07,609 --> 00:49:11,849
I and then I security events as per
operational monitoring

913
00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:15,280
this is something that I season
enterprises doing but interesting enough

914
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,480
consumer cloud providers move to this

915
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:22,319
before anybody else and I'm not sure why
i cant one thing I saw a class specific

916
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:22,740
thing

917
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:27,069
I just happen to see this trend is that
they're treating the security alerts

918
00:49:27,069 --> 00:49:30,569
and they're missing patches pacification
zone list as per their

919
00:49:30,569 --> 00:49:34,490
operational monitoring as announce
coming up in in the dashboard from the

920
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:37,119
idea of guys on our core whatever

921
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:40,849
and now if a patch is messy like soon is
that if I Z comes out hoop it's right

922
00:49:40,849 --> 00:49:43,819
there they're all the incense and
they're good 20 minutes right

923
00:49:43,819 --> 00:49:46,900
so it a Roku we store all our entire
fleet

924
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:52,560
in the flea fluctuated based on load by
an average profit 21 to 2200 servers

925
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:56,829
in an emergency we can rule the entire
fleet and some forty five minutes

926
00:49:56,829 --> 00:50:00,190
I did twice in one week there was no
purcell verbally came out

927
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:04,010
the vendor pass it two days later busy
airports that has actually was not

928
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:05,319
complete here's another one

929
00:50:05,319 --> 00:50:09,630
we roll the entire fleet twice in one
week no doubt on the customer's

930
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:13,740
are and no faults in the environment by
and we were able to do this because

931
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:18,329
we had pacification and operational
monitoring so it came up we saw you up

932
00:50:18,329 --> 00:50:22,230
that script was gonna handle that we had
can automated configuration management

933
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:24,299
so when is this came up won't it was
already bill

934
00:50:24,299 --> 00:50:28,730
air got built or need to be I and
because we treat every as disposable

935
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:31,970
there was no persist or done anything
everything was easy ways

936
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:35,040
for the switch everything was gone and
we're up and running

937
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,089
so these are things that are progressive
in the claus pace

938
00:50:38,089 --> 00:50:41,430
when you start talking your vendors
these are things you think about also if

939
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:43,890
you to assess if your pen to serve our
ability

940
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:47,930
are due for release as these are things
you think about think about how all the

941
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:48,980
systems are gonna be

942
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:52,810
how the configuration man has done and
realizing a lot like operators removing

943
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:54,140
its systems like this

944
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:57,420
so a be on top at the boulder testing
and and

945
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:01,299
make sure doesn't the new stuff first
lie all stuff gets probably won't really

946
00:51:01,299 --> 00:51:02,690
be there

947
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:06,750
alright so that's our about all my
ramblings that I have for this morning

948
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:07,210
at

949
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:10,869
I like 9:30 or something in the morning
on well

950
00:51:10,869 --> 00:51:13,980
I guess was like 6:30 my time when I
started this hostile

951
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:17,079
thanks to our schedule me first project
our harm

952
00:51:17,079 --> 00:51:21,480
so I any questions and we go any with
drugs and you guys wanna go doesn't

953
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,780
matter much to me

954
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:25,829
by any questions around assessing the
risk of Clough

955
00:51:25,829 --> 00:51:30,180
specific are providers how she revolvers
are whatever our care

956
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:37,180
I could

957
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:41,940
I guess the question is whether arm
providers allow you to click Mark so

958
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:43,580
what's the user is on the platform

959
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:47,220
doing their thing a blue nightie company
secrets mix it with their porn whatever

960
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:48,250
it is that they do

961
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:52,220
you're completely blind all this right
yes I love you this much about porn

962
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:55,320
year the ones doing it okay so right

963
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,770
um as requested his arrest question
right its

964
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:02,440
how much risk you wanna taken and how
willing are you to be polite to that

965
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,160
situation

966
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,420
I what you can do in many cases is

967
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:10,220
arm if it is the if it's aka sasser
describes the web a service

968
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:14,810
I you can log the I traffic coming off
your network to their network

969
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:18,060
and then inspect that traffic and try to
make you know

970
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:21,570
on guesses based on that now so complete
you don't get what's outside if you're

971
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:23,570
in price but give you some visibility
less

972
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:27,370
at least on other thing you can do is a
lot of these providers have

973
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:31,770
API's such you can are due to predation
expert and spectator this area crawled

974
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:34,140
it is there that I think and so

975
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:37,520
on automating be able to go out there is
back with the date is look at the

976
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,190
actions

977
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:42,360
and doing state change detection so look
at going in for instance is an okay

978
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,690
here's the admin settings and I expect
to see

979
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:48,090
or in the PI check the settings are they
still intact Yes No

980
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:52,090
okay who was last login: it's not great
this is not complete this is all custom

981
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:55,860
but this is one thing some organizations
to come over the real answer is

982
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:59,170
talk to the provider and just put on
them and if you have

983
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:02,490
if you know other companies usually
local groups like give local groups are

984
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:05,240
businesses that get together talk
security thing you guys are always the

985
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,000
same vendors

986
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,570
leverage that lean on a lot these bigger
organizations start to move to this

987
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:14,250
it's just me look at their featureless
in the priorities is down a little bit

988
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:15,510
because behind the other

989
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:19,480
10 things the business users one who was
pain but I could say that are

990
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:22,490
leaning on with your group helps a lot
as hell Salesforce's

991
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:26,630
I do log importation actually our times
is about 15

992
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:30,450
I CIS those in the Bay Area kinda got
together and leaned on

993
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:33,550
patrick who's the chief just over
Salesforce naturally ok

994
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:37,830
rap is like 15 like be companies and/or
base has a yes to prioritize

995
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:44,830
so work with them there's a question
here yes

996
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:49,290
Microsoft sucks fine not like

997
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:53,200
are yes oh wow what our customers
accuses of 365

998
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:57,400
I we have test accounts on a platform of
integrations that we do

999
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:01,440
um it's no worse than a better than any
other

1000
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,780
services out there on from the assassins
that I dunno and

1001
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:08,070
are the ones I've seen for my customers
I action no

1002
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:11,470
a couple guys to run security on that
side over there

1003
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:14,599
on the great thing is that its Microsoft
a very visible

1004
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:17,750
in so they have to deal with that
visibility in the market

1005
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:20,810
a big security breach affects their
stock price

1006
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:24,369
so on they're much more responsive and
proactive then

1007
00:54:24,369 --> 00:54:28,190
a lotta secure your love the service
providers in that same space

1008
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:31,190
I you know the some others that are very
security minded but

1009
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:34,609
I they're one of the better ones in that
space because I who they are mostly

1010
00:54:34,609 --> 00:54:41,609
yeah

1011
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:48,740
you know that's a great question
somebody really address arm so

1012
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:51,910
a as to its response the cloud
coordination with the

1013
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:55,410
customers on you know when I some
happened about a clout

1014
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:59,010
on SLE poor most was really really poor
right now

1015
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:02,220
on and its kinda how the spaces grown-up
on

1016
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:05,140
that they become about sunlight we
manage it we take care of it that's

1017
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:07,170
their big business proposition cell

1018
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:10,470
so that kinda carries over his response
the security as well

1019
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:14,590
on so it's very important we're starting
to see someone is provided below it more

1020
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:15,110
progressive

1021
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:18,480
little more open because they're getting
burned and flogged when they're not

1022
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,110
are but for most part more so the best
thing to do is when you negotiate

1023
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,400
contracts with providers

1024
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,590
have a contract are have a stipulation
in there

1025
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:30,520
the basis as a turn or if I with an ex
upon a time have any security fence

1026
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:33,770
this is what your sweet old and here's
the regular checkpoints

1027
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:37,030
et cetera if you bring contractually
their legal teams of all

1028
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:44,030
the picture

1029
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:49,070
yeah and that's because back to the
immaturity and the others know as a lace

1030
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:50,340
is our best effort right

1031
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:53,860
are so you're bigger ones you guys are
selling to the enterprise so your box

1032
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:54,840
you work day

1033
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:59,170
here DocuSign your sales forces you can
ask the negotiators terms not permit

1034
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:01,590
without problem your smaller guys
dollars a month

1035
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:05,230
there public not really looking so it's
okay I X O

1036
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:08,770
our question you but I get caught

1037
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:12,320
I'll be around for most the day so if
you want to chat about the sq providers

1038
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,010
or whatever

1039
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:18,650
I give me a shout and we'll talk thanks
here
