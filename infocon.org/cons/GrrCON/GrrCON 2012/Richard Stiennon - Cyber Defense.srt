I thought is sending to me cuz there's
some cool new fire assay

16
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:59,750
nothing cool about it other than the
fact that after that my computer so did

17
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,410
this Boeing

18
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,030
some behavior so course around as we all
do

19
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,670
all the different and let me know where
you got some check it out to him

20
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:12,290
nothing fines anything except by
firewalls tell me that I'm be coming

21
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:14,610
back to China and Russia constantly

22
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,060
and I gave the AV vendors about three
months

23
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,360
the fix that and kept in sawing their
updates

24
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,560
never fixed it so I get sick that switch
to

25
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,600
you know way to the scene switch to
Ubuntu a happy camper

26
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,990
in telling wife got america many get Mac
and the

27
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,140
I have a Mac and I feel so mark

28
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,220
they have American before I never gave
up

29
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,110
PCs because a the live the life love the
rest of us

30
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,360
him in the world a in live with that so

31
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,920
but my talk today is sexy I'm not
completely covering severed

32
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,360
a attacks which is the top pick up a
book I'm

33
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,360
attempting to complete and gets made it
to the publisher

34
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,479
it's so difficult to write a book on
something it's moving so quickly

35
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,890
the face if they let the manuscripts it
for a month I gotta start over to have

36
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:07,320
them

37
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,759
its now a month away from being
submitted but a lot of the stuff over

38
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,330
them

39
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,879
discovering just this past summer's
included in the stock

40
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,020
and you know just to clear a few things

41
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,700
a to me anyways as the industry analyst
so I

42
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,760
cover you know the fifteen hundred
vendors in the security space

43
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,300
to me that is there's a single driver
and that's the threats and explains so

44
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,209
much about the security industry

45
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:36,670
you know every single time is an
acquisition in the space

46
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:40,269
the Journal is reporting on it says a
another sign that the industry is

47
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:41,140
consolidating

48
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,580
because only a semantic but somebody
wells may be caused by his people

49
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,900
McAfee eyes by those people and what is
changing and the exhibition site is

50
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,129
different companies are getting into
security so yet tell him

51
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:56,760
and Intel buying into security Boeing
and

52
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,989
but to defense contractors starting to
buy into it but the industry will

53
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:01,879
consolidate

54
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:06,959
in the can consolidate because the
driver is change in the changes the

55
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:07,530
threats

56
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,709
so unlike here perc Ramer any other
industry eventually it matures

57
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:16,510
eventually was three or four big players
with the leader dominant it's usually

58
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,909
IBM or Oracle

59
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:22,260
et cetera that's not going to happen the
security space so you have to watch the

60
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,290
startups and you have to watch what's
happening out there to understand

61
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,970
those threats area

62
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,720
I've been using this slide so I can to
keep it in there to memorialize that

63
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,920
since 2002

64
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,620
when I was at Gartner would we realize
the offers a discount

65
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,849
all the random attacks concern of I'm in
that I talk about targeted

66
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:46,030
text that's really exciting stories are
and i'd have this hierarchy

67
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,799
love threats exploratory hacking is just
kinda thing that

68
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,370
we've enable all over users an all-over
businesses

69
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,450
to do because we give 'em network
browser and the billiard

70
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:01,209
Explorer megan is one around and look at
servers a grab documents

71
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:05,060
everybody does exploratory half-yearly 7
Parliament

72
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,230
occurs and of course way back when the

73
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,680
the New York Times web page was defaced
back in the day

74
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,030
so the Facebook became the next big
thing to worry about

75
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,549
now you protect your webserver which was

76
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,620
at the time simply a matter of getting
off internet

77
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,940
Riis from Microsoft and of course

78
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,810
activism is still with us and still
makes the news and

79
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:34,040
you you know just giving or more serious
even if you account for the attacks on

80
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,060
bankamerica

81
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,460
JP Morgan Chase a BB

82
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:43,229
New York Stock Exchange last week and
certainly PNC Bank this week

83
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:46,370
visa hecht with the tax and some worry
about the

84
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,410
certainly cause a lot of pain and agony
for the people that are

85
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:55,370
undergoing also tax I used to stop here
back in 2002 2003

86
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,970
unites a cybercrime you know it hasn't
happened actually

87
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,660
struck you know use strikeout across
that I'll

88
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,940
obviously cybercrime as part of our
history now

89
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,169
in one the biggest drivers for the
security industry

90
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:13,250
and have certainly we got information
warfare or cyber warfare

91
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,530
or state-sponsored attacks that was pure

92
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,639
a who's the nation's on the part love

93
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,530
guys running around saying the sky is
falling because it didn't exist

94
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,080
and of course a change change
dramatically

95
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,759
in 2000 a win georgia was attacked

96
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:35,360
a they weren't necessarily the russian
military attacking the state of SoCal

97
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:35,860
such a

98
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:41,110
im the government of Georgia but they
certainly were in conjunction with tanks

99
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,560
rolling across the border which was
always my definition

100
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,360
up several warmest you know it's a what
was the requiring you have have to

101
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,150
network countries

102
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,080
bordering each other in you have to have
sever tax in conjunction with tanks

103
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,539
rolling across the border

104
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:58,810
and it will be a long time think of what
I'm saying this in 2002 it'll be a long

105
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:02,699
time for Canada sense things cross the
border into the US

106
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:06,100
because those were you know pretty much
only two bordering network countries

107
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,330
course it's changed a we do have
ordering that work network countries

108
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:16,150
and obviously we have state involvement
in cyberattacks

109
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,680
in one of those impacts well for the
most part today they have them

110
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,699
a intelligence-gathering totals
gathering is so

111
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:28,569
gone through a lot love cycles over the
years certainly during the Cold War

112
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:32,120
we have a lot of the region's the in the
soviet union

113
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,110
and vice versa and all over the world as
a really really big business

114
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,600
and post the dissolution of the Soviet
Union

115
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,810
CIA's budget was cut back does really
dangerous to deploy people

116
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:47,300
in a laugh harder when a you've got a

117
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,860
train people in the Middle Eastern
languages in order to

118
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:55,000
embed them somewhere so we step back
from it everybody stepped back from work

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
and why bother train people up in
languages and risking their

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,490
their lives and their families deploying
them to be embedded when you discover

121
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,509
network and

122
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:09,340
steal stuff it's so easy so cheap might
as well just do it

123
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,740
infiltration comes a a couple different
ways but that

124
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,500
just for stealing data but just having a
presence in having a foothold

125
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,660
in the Airbus or the targets environment

126
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,849
though that actually takes fiscal step
2: because ur

127
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:27,300
is are cases have infiltrated agents who
are there to assist

128
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,560
in cyber espionage so they're no longer
opening a file cabinet say that they can

129
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,780
take pictures with Michael Camrose

130
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:38,130
they are there to get access privileges
and put some drives

131
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:41,880
im into the network and download
information

132
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,280
disruption to services sabotage them

133
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,139
yes if you're filling out your bingo
cards yeah I'm gonna mention Stuxnet

134
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:52,180
and yes and maybe even say APT

135
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,539
but sabotages is one love

136
00:07:55,539 --> 00:07:59,470
the concerns were really kinda waiting
for you know we know it's possible we've

137
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,530
seen the Devils

138
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:04,340
and obviously we've seen stocks that
don't know how can be done

139
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,849
in them and the bigger global scene is
if the Internet is becoming as important

140
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:10,009
as well

141
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:13,030
we videos then it's also the

142
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:17,110
to our instrument love social change and
certainly the

143
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:22,090
you know the for oiled a rights after
the elections in Iran

144
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:25,789
the riots in London you know expose
fueled by

145
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:29,220
blackberry meet up notices and of course
the Arab Spring

146
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,519
all have in conjunction with this
connection to instantaneous

147
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,880
communication it was hard for states

148
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,490
to filter or stop so there's a
potentials we think ahead

149
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:44,209
above CyberPower being part of changing
the balance of power

150
00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:48,300
a and especially through economic
warfare which ties are we back

151
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,190
to intelligence-gathering in
intellectual property theft

152
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,820
when I talk about targeted attacks a
true remind

153
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,850
a you know my audience is special and
talk to large industries

154
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,990
that they might not be the target
they're just the channel

155
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:09,709
so they're doing a disservice to their
trusted partners customers

156
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:13,790
if they're not doing the as good a job
as as possible

157
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:17,269
to prevent these targeted attacks gotta

158
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:21,420
banking client now Australia they're
very very concerned that they could be

159
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,580
the Channel four attackers to other

160
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,240
earth resource companies all huge mining
companies in Australia

161
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,760
who might target just information about
their money flow

162
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,899
or might just one user trust
relationship they have with the bank to

163
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:35,810
infiltrate

164
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,010
their organizations and a great example

165
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,440
from just two years ago when the nasdaq
director's desk

166
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,140
was infected with you know basically
drive-by malware was put on the landing

167
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,820
page for the director's desk well uses
the director's desk

168
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,420
you know a press was reporting to
Nasdaq's been attacked snow

169
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,970
the the boards of directors the actual
members are those boards to use

170
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:03,050
director's desk for storing documents
you know it's kinda over secure Dropbox

171
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,240
prime numbers secure in itself but

172
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,140
there you have it I when you visited
that you're getting infected with a

173
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:09,700
drive-by

174
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:14,140
download that was doing usual cyber
criminal stuff those pious over criminal

175
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,510
attack to get the credentials the
banking credentials

176
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:21,660
very wealthy people wealthy and powerful
maybe is going a little further cuz

177
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,850
those guys with the little but about the
M&A activity

178
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,920
and could give some very clever
cybercriminals ideas

179
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,910
poppin um schemes

180
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:35,899
where inside I first read a book and
several were started that's

181
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:39,660
a August 8th 2008 after the attacks I'm

182
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,070
and South Georgia and soulful session in
Georgia

183
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:46,880
a because now i cant say hey tanks
rolled cross-border

184
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,680
cyberattacks thereof several wars here I
read a book about

185
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,459
so as I was doing that I was at a
conference in the Dublin that Kozak some

186
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:55,950
you might have been there some

187
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:59,149
you never really cosic really really
great experience

188
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:02,630
three-day residential conference where
you live

189
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,700
together and you together and talk
together and

190
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,709
very counterfeit come true

191
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,730
virtual and confrontational audiences

192
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:15,160
so if you start seeing some we disagree
with me and I'll shut you down so yes

193
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,320
the road be prepared

194
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,310
not inviting people do that here by the
way

195
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,940
aide suggested to the group he you know
I'm reading a book about cyber warfare 2

196
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,820
anybody suggest we work cyber weapon
would look like presided

197
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,390
I couldn't think of any other than you
know the the set school

198
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,720
a or BGP route announcements that

199
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,310
turn the country of that school a but
what about actual

200
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:43,000
weapon right so nobody said anything
about public meeting but dinner that

201
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,769
maybe go from Switzerland merges
meanings as I got one for you

202
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:51,130
suffer updates its ok totally trusted
channel

203
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,209
from a vendor to their customers for

204
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:57,360
giving in to their networks and changing
software on their desktops

205
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,649
you know you you know if you head
whitelisting you can allow an update

206
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:02,399
from Adobe your Microsoft

207
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,649
sure the best organizations test updates

208
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:09,389
and they do so in a test burn make sure
done breaking applications

209
00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:13,190
but nobody has called in elsa something
updated not sending you

210
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:17,200
the source code you have to do it on the
binaries and nobody's forcing it you

211
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,360
wouldn't know

212
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,480
if the updated install the new
vulnerability on purpose

213
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,480
and how in the world would you attack an
update service

214
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,300
and from Microsoft Mac for you of course
you're in a virus vendors any updates

215
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,540
every day

216
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,850
a in sure enough

217
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,970
restoring to see that the first inkling

218
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:41,730
we got was when kamalo hacker a
infiltrated

219
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,970
a certificate authority in Europe and
then started issuing

220
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:49,190
you know sign certificates for all these
different vendors

221
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,420
and in web sites a

222
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,790
critical demo in at the time he claims

223
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:59,160
that he was doing it kinda in support
over who's a

224
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,450
somebody who supported the regime in
Iran and then later and we see that he

225
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,079
attacks

226
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,690
claims credit for taking DigiNotar and
getting their signing certificate in

227
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:13,350
signing over 250 certificates for
Microsoft and Google and most major

228
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,240
vendors and web sites

229
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,420
and those certificates then used interim

230
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,980
to be a man in the middle basically
attack against Iranian citizens were

231
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,570
using Gmail

232
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:27,579
pneumo that iran is actually shutting
off access to Google

233
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:30,829
if pics of access to Google to this week

234
00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:34,329
swells gmail and they're getting ready
to basically

235
00:13:34,329 --> 00:13:39,060
create an iron curtain around arian have
our own internet internally so good look

236
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,480
with their RAM will be by marks they say

237
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,670
in all this because are under such
attack claim but obviously the

238
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,570
controlling

239
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,100
there and users so here we have a

240
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,459
a gay says he sympathizes with a ram

241
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:57,470
basically handing over the keys to the
kingdom with a stolen signing

242
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,690
certificates from DigiNotar

243
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,399
imposing the pace been that he had
completely reverse engineered

244
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:06,500
the Microsoft Update Service he said he
could hack

245
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,750
we can see him do that but that's okay
because

246
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,889
the NSA has done that in a safe figured
out how

247
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:18,639
Microsoft Updates work and the
incorporated inflame

248
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,649
a a a false the Mikes of certificate for

249
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:26,029
update so is this went to their targets
in the Middle East

250
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:30,430
and say years update please accept that
the update head now we're in it was

251
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:34,670
signed with the digital certificate
those me through an md5 hash collision

252
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:38,610
which well those now easy to do its it
was directly

253
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:42,510
demonstrated how you do it but the costs
are so high that people were doing it

254
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:45,820
two hundred thousand dollars on Amazon
ec2 compute time

255
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,860
to do an average md5 collusion attack

256
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:55,860
well somebody with the resources to do
that did that

257
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:03,620
is Adobe announced yesterday that
somebody was infiltrating mm

258
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,500
indeed the code signing on their
products perfect there you go

259
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:13,910
predictions come true real time but
let's take us back to Athens in 2004

260
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,519
so you remember the summer olympics and
it was popped up in the news

261
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,870
courses pretty big news to me so I paid
particular attention

262
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:25,149
a as Vodafone Greece's a

263
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:29,519
Ericsson switch was basically hacked in
a very very clever way

264
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,209
over a period of several months several
apps offer updates were installed

265
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:39,040
in there and slowing just segments %uh
new code until the final update

266
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,060
was installed in its only purpose was to
turn a lawful intercept

267
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,579
in give some outsiders access to their
lawful intercept

268
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:50,339
in redirect phone calls over self over
the cell phone network to

269
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:53,420
whoever wanted to listen a we don't know
who it was

270
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,709
investigation was cut very short only
ring gauge

271
00:15:56,709 --> 00:16:01,519
a last january I'm so maybe eventually
get news out what happened the reason

272
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,120
actually hit the news was that the
engineer

273
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,180
who was responsible for the Sharks and
switch was found home

274
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,410
in his apartment so dead from

275
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:14,630
who knows what may be just remorse for
doing that

276
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:19,240
it also turns out that there are some
switch softwares all developed in

277
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,600
Athens so these have this confluence of
where the experts there

278
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,740
a the head insider evidently and of
course

279
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,759
you know where whether sporting there's
betting there's going to be

280
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:34,949
organized crime as certainly has all the
hallmarks over

281
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:40,540
but a great example love house offer
updates can be used

282
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,389
so I'm I don't know if anybody else is
we just talked about Stuxnet

283
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:49,339
but just a couple points so you remember
it sucks that probably USB born

284
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:52,459
a we definitely knows targeting the

285
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:55,670
Center nuclear the uranium centrifuges

286
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:59,720
in times a targeted semen software

287
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,030
used for zero-day vulnerability so that
alone is expensive rate those are

288
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:08,850
those are valuable things if you got em
very expensive to discover them yourself

289
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:13,860
use a vulnerability is tough find the
workstations or running step 7

290
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:18,039
once they found them favorite install a
deal rootkit

291
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:21,260
they would just sit there and pass
everything through the regular the OL

292
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:25,100
tell it's of particular format
particular block data in Midwood

293
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:25,839
modifier

294
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,950
texan change the speed at which the
centrifuges were going

295
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,830
one interesting thing about sucks that
was its size everybody's marveling

296
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,910
big this piece its offer was so good
back to that

297
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:41,000
actually a minute a bit less like to
keep that in mind stocks I was very very

298
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,110
large

299
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:45,200
sucks that was very successful actually
succeeded

300
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,620
in its goal is slowing down Iran's
ability to

301
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,970
to refined uranium into

302
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:57,000
maybe weapons-grade uranium

303
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,460
we r a hundred in 30 days and counting

304
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:05,510
since one of the most important events I
think big game-changing in for me

305
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:10,020
demarcation point in the history love
sober if we want to call it that

306
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:17,020
actually have some

307
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:33,510
some Afghan ago saves newspapers is
perfect in the bottom a file cabinet got

308
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:38,570
only other newspaper ever save them it
was from when apollo thirteen was

309
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:41,660
stranded in space who wrote cool article

310
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:46,030
but they have save this one the New York
Times of june 1st

311
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:52,220
2012 when Paul saying you're basically
reveals that the Obama administration

312
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,420
was the guys behind Stuxnet inflame

313
00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:00,480
so in probably according to spur
Kaspersky Labs and reports from

314
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,070
The Washington Post probably du coup and
girls as well

315
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:09,920
all over certain a super secret program
is totally revealed by

316
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,540
Geyserville eroded you gotta love course
whenever you doing with intelligence

317
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,600
matters go a step back and say okay

318
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,920
is a true to the US really right in or
do they just Paul Wall

319
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,140
over you know this award-winning
journalist in the New York Times

320
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,380
take it at face value he

321
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:31,140
provide enough corroborating evidence
stories from white house insiders who

322
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:31,740
say the

323
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:35,240
Situation Room conference table which
well no cuz we watch watch

324
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,940
West Wing was littered with parts from
destroyed centrifuges

325
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,690
from Idaho National Wales where they've
done the tests the its

326
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:47,220
is so secret that spread the tests over
multiple research lab so the guys in a

327
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,280
way I don't know exactly what's going on

328
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,980
I'm sure the suspected after we heard
about Stuxnet

329
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,040
the repercussions from not only

330
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,770
demonstrating Stuxnet in the first place
a you can use

331
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:04,420
these attacks to do physical damage but
then we come back

332
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:09,340
in claim credit for as the US government
has in their usual search which is

333
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:13,520
where you know the week the information
the FBI is investigating a week but

334
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,150
notice that

335
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:18,350
been subpoenaed anybody in there has
been no action on it because it came

336
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,100
from

337
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,180
executive office so what's the point in
thumbing your nose

338
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,680
at a ram like that which they obviously
have my mind im

339
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,430
mind you im already all my books I've
never said oh my god so we're getting is

340
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,150
coming into the world is coming

341
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:38,480
a but I've now feel convinced that it
would be really really logical

342
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,930
and certainly within the realm love the
definitions above

343
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:46,280
the laws of war for Iran to retaliate

344
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,690
again some attributes source with you
know

345
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:53,550
measured response which is the
terminology the use right so

346
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,930
taking out a building with an airplane
would not be a measured response

347
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:01,520
but certainly attack you control system
in the western United States would be

348
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,450
measured response

349
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:09,860
so why should the enterprise care
because I was the a

350
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,870
was for from the government nervous or
critical infrastructure most of us

351
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:17,790
are involved in these types of things
but if Google

352
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:20,860
the pentagon so Google Aurora pentagon

353
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:25,060
attacks cancer that owner email servers
for undetermined amount of time at least

354
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,990
six months in 2007

355
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,370
the attacks against Rio Tinto mining

356
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:33,710
large mining organization in Australia
that basically

357
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:37,670
own them the tech skin so neither owns
them

358
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,770
the attack skins are saying arce is
another great example

359
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,810
love them that being the target so

360
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:48,830
you know it was tryna according to
general Keith Alexander tryin attacked

361
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,580
arce

362
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,640
China stole the security seeds they
didn't

363
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,980
just want the security seeds they were
after lackey

364
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,440
in the attempted to use those within two
weeks to get a lackey

365
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,480
so if they can be breached

366
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,070
how can the enterprise first defend
themselves but most to them that I talk

367
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,070
to raising wall

368
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:11,230
we're not Google we're not the pentagon
we're not real Tinto

369
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,460
you know whereof a medical facility in
Grand Rapids

370
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,790
why should we care so there are some
reasons that you should care

371
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,860
the retaliation risk so if Iran

372
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,020
attacks or any other organization takes
it into their mind

373
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:27,550
the decides to use Stuxnet like attacks
against

374
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:30,890
our critical infrastructure control
systems a

375
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:34,340
there will be an impact on your business
that not one that %um

376
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:38,360
do anything about the first place but
you maybe wanna look at your power

377
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,890
backup systems and

378
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:43,500
get yourself a nice big diesel generator
for power supply

379
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,020
in an individually you might wanna worry
about water

380
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:51,070
arm add no shocked to discover

381
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,600
especially people inside washington DC
are hoarding cash

382
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,200
physical cash in their houses because
they're all kinda thinkin some could

383
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,060
happen

384
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:03,350
there's the rest from clairol damage

385
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:08,780
in not the traditional collateral damage
or even clairol damage that the US

386
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,210
face during these attacks and Georgia in
2008

387
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:15,560
so you I heard the story there was a
hosting provider

388
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,750
I'm in Atlanta Georgia it gets so
confusing

389
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:22,860
state versus country but she happened to
be in the capital

390
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,880
love Georgia the country when the
attacks worker ring

391
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,990
and you they basically dedust attacks
and people taking out the

392
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:34,810
the pipes into Georgia coming from
Turkey

393
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:38,270
she said he got a great idea just reset
your DNS

394
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:42,690
2.2 us that our hosting provider in
Atlanta Georgia

395
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,990
the state well they did that and they
got sixty thousand

396
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:50,370
page requests a second to a

397
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:54,320
to that website in their hosting
environment and took out all over

398
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,470
several thousand customers ability to
serve up web pages

399
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:01,090
so was an example federal damage well

400
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:05,240
but what I'm worried about is for
instance a case that

401
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,320
it seems to be fairly probable as our as
a Israel

402
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,760
is you know clashing their spears and
and

403
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,400
kinda getting the world ready for a
pre-emptive attack against Iran's

404
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,920
nuclear capability

405
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,360
the document was leaked to the israeli
cabinet that

406
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,160
states very clearly in the first
paragraph that any such attack would be

407
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,200
preceded

408
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,560
by what your use the word massive
cyberattack against Iran's

409
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,760
infrastructure

410
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:35,340
and if so it will be targeting their
communications and their power

411
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,550
in their logical in the water facilities

412
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:43,110
if in order to do a massive attack you
gotta have a lot to release points and

413
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:45,010
you gotta give it up quickly

414
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:49,050
and you might not have enough time to do
the testing to make sure that it stays

415
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,160
in Iran

416
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,280
no words there will be clatter of all
from there

417
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:58,050
sober for the disc call as Pine Avenue
bingo cards but you know that %um

418
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:01,740
and if if so we could have

419
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:05,040
concerns for ourselves when that happens

420
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,580
in a corset the option by several
criminals and yes we are seeing

421
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,840
Stuxnet code reuse for attacks

422
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,080
for cybercriminals so is the R three
areas a concern

423
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,150
if you're the enterprise

424
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:21,370
so in my travels especially the summer

425
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:25,690
a I've actually I but talking about
reorganizing for cyber defense now

426
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,930
for year and a half and I'm action
coding

427
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:32,190
organizations that were way ahead of me
have already done this

428
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,660
they're looking at me like a where were
you you know we've been doing this for

429
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,710
years

430
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:38,860
are only because they've been and the
pointy end of the stick they've seen

431
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,910
these attacks

432
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:43,450
in their traditional IT operations that
we're handling

433
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,940
you know patching and bone ability
testing and pen testing and

434
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,320
in the into virus and hints

435
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,850
you know monitoring IDAs logs mad enough
networking

436
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:56,970
have to do something else

437
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:02,330
in 1995 the term caso was coined by
Citigroup says the very first chief

438
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,950
information security officer

439
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:08,010
was Steve Katz and of course US
government has

440
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:12,100
assigned a server commander minutes in
the news today that

441
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,180
a 10 the the top Intel guy

442
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:18,770
in the US Cyber Command as saying we
need a lot more resources we're gonna

443
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:19,450
expand

444
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:23,060
US Air Command those already pretty
pretty doing big

445
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:27,050
it's getting bigger

446
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:31,390
I'm a big proponent are assigning
responsibility and that's exactly what

447
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,600
Citigroup did

448
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,210
I remember a meeting with the time time

449
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:39,690
Thomas the CEO of something together
time

450
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:44,190
his first day on the job went home and
also got a call that they just had this

451
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,700
massive attack

452
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:49,860
in their systems are down in the viruses
are running all over the place and so

453
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,510
who's in charge of security there wasn't
anybody it's me or they can charge of

454
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,690
security in 2002

455
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:58,770
no that was on a weekend by Monday
morning there was

456
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:02,169
a CISO its semantic

457
00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:05,580
you have to assign responsibility this
is going to be the person whose job

458
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,290
depends

459
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:09,970
preventing targeted attacks and I call
that

460
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:13,240
the sober commanders caller the director
of your sock

461
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,570
or a you just take the whole team that

462
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:20,160
curtain currently is labeled the you
know compute computer emergency response

463
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,360
team

464
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,960
in full them into this operation but
they've got some a new responsibilities

465
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,860
so circuit commander oversees the one
throat to choke you guys gonna lose his

466
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,650
job

467
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,900
if a major breach occurs that he should
have prevented

468
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:38,510
but he's also gonna sure that the right
tools and budgets are in place

469
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:43,310
importantly he's gonna report up to the
organization a regular basis about the

470
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:46,690
the situational awareness exactly where
they stand

471
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:49,980
and communicate outward to law
enforcement

472
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,030
when needed is that's everybody I've
talked to is going through this breach

473
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:56,790
is one of the parts that they've never
practice or Never Say officials

474
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,230
relationships

475
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:01,780
who'd you call when something like this
is going on

476
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,120
I think the analysts are private newest
part

477
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,440
I'm so every IT organization has
security guys that are

478
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,970
you know going to conferences like this
quite often there on time and on their

479
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,220
own dime

480
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:18,370
and the reading a lot of stuff but you
notes that managed and it's not really

481
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:20,590
the primary responsibility

482
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:23,700
about two years ago I sir to scratch my
head as

483
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:28,140
because I monitors love in a loss to the
job posting boards just to see

484
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,580
you know what companies are doing and
who they're looking for for posting jobs

485
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,270
there by growing

486
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:37,020
oh and I started to see reverse
engineers requirements

487
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:41,669
at major banks and I'm gone all why
we're paying

488
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:46,040
wanna tire these you're highly
specialized technology said very very

489
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,030
big price takes to do reverse
engineering when

490
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:52,350
you know Symantec McAfee in the Webroot
so the world have hired all those guys

491
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,020
already

492
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:57,460
are you employed why would anybody go to
a bank and why would the bank me there

493
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:02,050
well turns out they're being targeted
nobody else has ever seen this coat

494
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:06,540
semantic isn't gonna take coats missions
from anybody we've already gotten

495
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,740
your fifty thousand samples a day they
don't need any more than that concert

496
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,600
about yours cuz that the wild

497
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,130
second attack anybody else is no benefit
to them to

498
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:19,450
read a signature for your co so sorry
analysts are doing that

499
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:22,900
full-time there also creating the
methodologies

500
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:27,580
for detecting these attacks since im
they are actually the

501
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:32,050
headed described at one defense
contractor I went to

502
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:35,450
their their puzzle solvers their really
really smart people

503
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:39,130
they would love to solve puzzles are not
necessarily you know the best

504
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:42,450
reverse engineers in the world the ir
those as well

505
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:45,919
but they have to these guys are figure
out what's going on in the affair with

506
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,120
the target is

507
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,810
as well as class 5a the methodologies
use the comp key indicators

508
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:55,330
so we can build them into something
called campaigns

509
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:58,570
this the best example i've seen how to
get

510
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:03,310
upper management in the board to get
really engage in security

511
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:07,440
be present to upper management the
campaigns that they've

512
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,830
that they've seen that are attacking
them a campaign is defined by these

513
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:14,480
common indicators that could be of
course the source IP address

514
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,570
a the typeof now where that's being used
on the actual source go to the malware

515
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:19,980
that's being used

516
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,350
the source email addresses the demeans
the

517
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:28,080
targets you know if the individual key
employees in the organization are being

518
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,050
targeted

519
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:32,990
all that bundles up into hey this is
campaign you know sticky fingers that is

520
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:33,940
there to

521
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:38,250
name to it so so we have a name and then
they rolled it up and how late it upper

522
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,169
management to look at you know we've got
six campaigns

523
00:30:41,169 --> 00:30:44,540
and we've kill them stop them along the
way

524
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,770
and while we you know reno a few
resources or

525
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:51,550
be more resources because look how far
this campaign go maybe get our way to

526
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,900
the Active Directory Server

527
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:56,630
or they're actually install them the
email server before we discover them

528
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:00,080
and shut them down

529
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,220
so email us we use tools like County
refused

530
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:07,030
if you've ever seen County Route Sales
notebook is just wave leaking

531
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,250
information it's it's kinda love

532
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:12,679
you know Braintree kinda love display

533
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:15,790
and its use is very very successful
company account

534
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:19,610
kenna underground after a while sec
expose them as being part of a

535
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:23,429
the HB Gary pack that they did on the
pill tears

536
00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:27,000
doing extremely well you know several
hundred employees already based in Palo

537
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,010
Alto

538
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:31,810
in the school tool that they have allows
you to wink stuff they sell to

539
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,800
intelligence organizations were tracking

540
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,340
thread actors and ago said sect the

541
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:41,850
the monk institute in Toronto where the
first to demonstrate how you use it for

542
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:45,240
cyber investigation when they're
investigating the attacks

543
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,380
the successful infiltration the Dalai
Lama's office these County retired all

544
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,690
the others so used to seeing keep track
roles IP addresses and ports and

545
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:58,220
actors up so you see these tools being
used a lot

546
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:02,010
and then get the operations guys list
like think the the actual tools are

547
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:03,260
gonna be used to

548
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:07,090
defend your organization they're gonna
be discovering

549
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:11,130
these internal infections a from these
targeted attacks and they're going to be

550
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,510
monitoring insider

551
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:15,550
behavior as insiders you know looks like
it's

552
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:19,450
employees acting but it's obviously just
somebody with her credentials in their

553
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,230
computer

554
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:23,860
interacting arm they might use tools

555
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:27,260
like this one from secular to alert them
to

556
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:31,740
beating what's going on between internal
machines in command and control servers

557
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:35,419
so secular it's an Israeli company
that's clued into this

558
00:32:35,419 --> 00:32:39,020
this opportunity and another one is
unveil its

559
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,590
so ambience based other love Atlanta

560
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:46,370
very the lawyer will maybe a million in
half and financing

561
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:49,510
I'm in six or seven guys working on it
but in their

562
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:52,690
a investigations what they do basically
is a tear apart

563
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:56,790
to get same boxes and honey but I mean
it's immigrate thirty thousand samples

564
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,740
above

565
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:02,050
mail where every day running a sandbox
see where the Thames connect to

566
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:05,050
was IP addresses are a few dresses of
interest

567
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:08,409
and they put them in in the their
database

568
00:33:08,409 --> 00:33:12,120
in them the use either DNS singling

569
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,350
a I suspect though mobile admit that
they actually hack into the command

570
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,260
control servers and install their own

571
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:20,520
malware agents on those in a monitor

572
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,970
all the IP addresses their singing back
to home base

573
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:27,240
and now they gotta love all IP addresses
that affected by

574
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,260
Miller in religious you know to a few
pivots on the table weakling ninety

575
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,280
percent of

576
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:37,060
a fortune 1000 are infected with these
botnets

577
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:40,080
let you know bandits are not necessarily

578
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,909
the China Russia hacking in but they're
certainly sever criminals acting and

579
00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:47,980
though youths these great displays by
country

580
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:52,550
they did this live display for me the me
so over to show you that that Gove

581
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:56,770
domain in all the infections are now
that they either 3800

582
00:33:56,770 --> 00:34:00,120
infected machines with these parts a

583
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,480
around the United States including one
where notion which much

584
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,010
Mussman way week but manson

585
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:10,179
you know could be really hard to sell
this product 0 embarrassing

586
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:14,359
the CISO shown that he's got affections
and even know about

587
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:17,720
but a really good way to so the
defensive tool round

588
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,730
so it to you by but now I'm soil
affection sources

589
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:25,159
in moving and really am to location and

590
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:27,899
it's hard to see here but they're
actually showing you affection dates the

591
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:31,609
first time in six signal back to the
community control server

592
00:34:31,609 --> 00:34:36,140
in the last time that they got a signal
from its really really good intelligence

593
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:39,200
what's inside the network in companies
that

594
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:44,620
provide the tapes love tools to block
their access to take a feed

595
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:48,919
love known better IP addresses in a
block access to the

596
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:53,210
met with us is Levi industry leader
acquired by arce

597
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:57,900
after pareces breach mind you damballa
something like that though the focus a

598
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,480
lot

599
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,630
DNS entries so whereas

600
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:05,630
sentry be at work flight recorder that's

601
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:08,859
recording all information but is your
able to

602
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:13,150
drill down into it look for those IP
addresses guidance those that

603
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:16,750
p.m. point and Trend Micro systems

604
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:20,740
is rolling out those really cool sell
products there are basically your own

605
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,609
sandbox

606
00:35:21,609 --> 00:35:25,470
so you never same box in the wire summer
to a fire I

607
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:29,180
returning for the code as it comes in or
you have a say about server

608
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:32,400
%um you basically but the plumbing in
place

609
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,380
to connect everything to its all your
email servers San suspicious samples to

610
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,030
it

611
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:41,339
figure out what it is that you tell you
those those destination IP addresses

612
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:45,280
as matter fact in finally get the

613
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,560
red team so this is different from your
text penetration team you're all source

614
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,710
to your PO he sees the world

615
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:56,000
a or the guys who use internally these
guys are looking at

616
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,640
the the projects in the products that
you are rolling out

617
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,069
in there looking your business processes
maybe something I call business process

618
00:36:03,069 --> 00:36:03,580
hacking

619
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:06,650
something that usually only an insider
be aware of

620
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:09,800
kinda stuff when I was at PwC that we do
you know we

621
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,950
we go inside in after three or four days

622
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:17,390
you know either we discover the inside
IT administrators just told us about

623
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:20,069
some love on abilities and their systems

624
00:36:20,069 --> 00:36:23,220
because they're so frustrated nobody
does anything about me know that

625
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,310
when PwC says do something about it
though do it

626
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:30,359
but that's when we discover other
business works in how you can

627
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:34,530
subjugate their business to make money
or disturb the business

628
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:37,640
and this what the real their real
internal red team should do

629
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,319
i've seen a bank do this against the
Swifts payment network

630
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:45,310
we quickly discovered that it's with
terminals are you for wire transfers in

631
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:49,990
everywhere in the world except you know
except miss you biskupic Michigan

632
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:53,910
because I can nap transfer money over
swift for some reason

633
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:58,050
may be a good thing because this with
terminals a client-side authentication

634
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:01,420
so you have to do is send the correct
packets to

635
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:04,650
in makes the IBM MQ Series

636
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:08,000
server that says to authenticate it then
you are authenticated

637
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,430
these guys minutes to transfer million
dollars into their own

638
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:17,790
accounts in one day love attack

639
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:20,720
and then if you have been exposed to
this so highly recommend you download

640
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,720
Lockheed Martin's white paper

641
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:27,319
and the Sabre kill chain I'm loving this
I know its buzz words

642
00:37:27,319 --> 00:37:32,339
but I'm loving this is a methodology to
help you switched from

643
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:35,700
the thing I liked criticize a lot which
is risk-based management

644
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,839
not a big proponent love you are finding
all your assets

645
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,839
class thing all the assets as you know
critical that critical

646
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:47,920
why do we even have this here you know
it's like what IT guys gonna say he my

647
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,650
assets are critical so

648
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:53,600
fire mean you're the asset doesn't
happen risk management is

649
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,440
almost impossible to accomplish threat
base management

650
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,250
is possible because you're fighting an
adversary missus though

651
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:04,760
like you martin is looking at it so we
will take the

652
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,080
what we think it was a traditional in
there to be an attack you know is called

653
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:08,600
footprint

654
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,839
else's first they call reconnaissance
and the reconnaissance is getting very

655
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:16,720
very sophisticated as we saw in the
Google rural attacks with candice is

656
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,770
included

657
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:21,560
figuring out key employees a prize have
access credentials to

658
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:26,030
the stuff that they wanted which was you
know taxes people's gmail accounts

659
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:29,710
I just stumbled across the source code
install Google source code

660
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:34,270
as a benefit but the reconnaissance
included finding a friend's ovals

661
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:38,410
people on Facebook mm friending them and
eventually infecting the friends of

662
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:41,859
friends with malware that would post
links to Facebook which

663
00:38:41,859 --> 00:38:44,990
years ago click on a link get in the
door that way

664
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:48,800
but other kinda senses hey you know
we've identified the ski individual

665
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,870
we've got something profile

666
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,500
were following him on Twitter if he's
attending Dr Khan

667
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:59,300
in Grand Rapids so let's send 'em you
know some document abouts

668
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:03,180
the event in of course we're going to

669
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:07,930
weaponize that document that we send a
message next stage the weaponization

670
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:11,410
and weaponization is that's decided
we're going to target what

671
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:14,730
email the main you can use if you gonna
do it from inside

672
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:18,670
in but you know using Metasploit
whatever tool kit to bundle

673
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:21,760
the exploit with so Mac used Acura

674
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,740
the delivery is sending it by email USB
token

675
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:30,020
doing some real link to a page the final
the exportation

676
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:35,150
opens up the machine drops the Rolex
remote access Trojan

677
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:39,190
a in them starts communicating with the
command control server

678
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:43,700
to install the rest the components and
finally the actions on objective so the

679
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,180
actual

680
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:48,120
exfiltration above the information they
want or changing

681
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:53,010
credentials in the Active Directory
Server stealing all the credentials

682
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:56,550
for encryption that are just there %um
cleartext

683
00:39:56,550 --> 00:40:00,470
in the Active Directory Server in you
that good stuff actions I'm objectives

684
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:05,650
e2 those steps in the attack methodology
they call the cervical chain is an

685
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:06,589
opportunity

686
00:40:06,589 --> 00:40:11,500
to deploy 10 the sixties which military
guy so it's tough to read on to tech

687
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,550
tonight disrupt a great to see

688
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:17,380
or destroy NAVSEA detection is

689
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:21,180
why the tools you have to help you
detect each step of the way

690
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:24,830
most but most people don't actually
monitor their web logs to see when

691
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:25,859
they're being

692
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:29,230
a ski and or reconnoiter a or

693
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:32,480
there's some specific since no
suspicious behavior

694
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,730
you know before de dos attack:
somebody's gotta fear 0

695
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:38,810
which one your webpages causes the most
stress

696
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:42,010
and the back and deal with the sequels
around the back end

697
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:45,470
so we're gonna go through all your pages
not following the same logical order

698
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:48,790
clicking you know down the tree finding
information

699
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:52,150
but they're gonna go hey wow that
generates a map that

700
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:56,030
makes a call with the reserve and
creates you know special Shopping Cart

701
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:56,980
page

702
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:00,859
there look for those pages identify
those to load into lower core whatever

703
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:02,380
attack to lay

704
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:06,880
so you might get some forewarning know
my do PNC Bank got forewarning by

705
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,950
reading pace p.m.

706
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:13,200
in the news articles about it but what's
your web stuff can be valuable

707
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,390
millions and I the text you know you
maybe if they're

708
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:20,280
dumb enough not to use proxies you
actually know the IP address the gun

709
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,680
attack from

710
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,940
a who knows Korean policy else in the
routers switches

711
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,150
a all these tools can be deployed to
stop

712
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:33,690
each step of the way in this is exactly
how they create their campaigns

713
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:37,140
in reporting and how they've stopped
campaigns

714
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:40,510
so it's a saber kill chain that's as

715
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:44,930
fires I've got in my investigations love

716
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:47,960
what people are doing in order to
reorganize the counter

717
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,700
targeted attacks you'll know that's ever
talked chain

718
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:55,150
is the PT's very these are exactly our

719
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:58,750
say's attack like you attacked we all
see those I suppose

720
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:02,620
same format which course means that
they'll sue me another format

721
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:07,750
remember I said you know the notable
thing about Stuxnet was how big it was

722
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:10,859
well there wasn't picked the normal

723
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:14,359
command control communication with
Stuxnet evidently there was

724
00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:18,420
the command control server for flame and
evidently they do get feedback from

725
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,380
Stuxnet

726
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:23,520
on its progress we all know how it did
as go be fairly sophisticated they could

727
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,160
have had an embedded agent

728
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,589
but Stuxnet was so big because it had to
run autonomously

729
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:32,609
and that was the definition for me over
to cyber weapon

730
00:42:32,609 --> 00:42:35,730
is once it's installed it does what he
has to do

731
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:39,250
and so it's gonna be expensive to
develop you don't get this opportunity

732
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,230
to take it a step at a time

733
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:44,760
get infected machine you know cast your
net widely

734
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,240
your caps two guys work with that you
got it

735
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,450
design something you're just like a
remote satellite going to mars it's

736
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:53,450
gotta work with

737
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:57,330
oats hands-on control

738
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:01,240
the attackers will continuously upgrade
their methodologies

739
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:05,160
the server coltrane's a published paper
why not step around it somehow

740
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:09,150
the defenders must continue to upgrade
as well

741
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:12,690
think we have time for couple questions
if anybody

742
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:17,750
month so he soap tomorrow it's not my
fault

743
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:24,109
and Mike contact details if you are you
all doing

744
00:43:24,109 --> 00:43:31,109
Rio bingo masai musta missed something
it

745
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:35,450
I know it's the last you then I mean
it's in your chair

746
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:42,450
not good

747
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:02,590
your so the question was you're
pondering why

748
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:08,190
Bank of America's them PNC's still
giving successfully attacked after

749
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:12,360
knows expertise is represented in the
room in any to these organizations

750
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:16,940
unfortunately you know we're still at
that stage where the blinders on

751
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:20,280
and everybody years experience

752
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:24,290
you know hey me to be able to do this
the media are more

753
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:29,070
people or more technology something am
being told now you know we just gave you

754
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:30,680
all this money for your

755
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,980
DLP solution you know we don't believe
you anymore

756
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:37,000
because we have been attacked and we're
still fighting

757
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,060
you know my frustration is you know well
these remote blogger

758
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:45,030
I will tell them what's going to happen
to them if they just read it and reacted

759
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:45,450
but

760
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:49,190
course through in there lotsa people
like me doing the exact same thing in

761
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:49,790
its own

762
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:53,410
I'm just used to it owners I got full
time employment others keep

763
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:57,010
they've stopped on people the patch I
learned my lesson

764
00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:00,420
long time ago that's like that's not
possible so shut up about it

765
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:04,180
a but you know you can do the

766
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:07,850
you the dust is 10 sets one thing you
know those wanna talk that

767
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:11,320
to perplexing vendor segments

768
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,780
dedust defense guys so you know Arbor

769
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:17,940
yeah Prolexic I'm a ser service I damn

770
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:21,660
correr o I'm in plain sight as well in

771
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:26,050
there like a everyone is a potential
target so everyone should be a customer

772
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:26,730
in there that

773
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:30,710
you know very very little revenue
relative to arrest the industry

774
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:34,590
the others vulnerability management this
is like lavishly

775
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:38,140
everybody should be doing well the road
manager everybody should know two day

776
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:41,310
with their own abilities are no than
help you get 60 days

777
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:44,860
all but we should be doing it in the

778
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:48,470
the inventors are told me the ninety
percent of the calls to make the guys

779
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:50,350
have never heard a vulnerability
management

780
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:54,300
so it's it's just it's like the attack
surface area

781
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:58,270
the number organizations are so large
they are always be

782
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:03,040
vulnerable target and if it's not Bank
of America today will be some bank we

783
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:03,680
have him

784
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:10,680
heard of

785
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:30,030
goal question is what about federated
information sources so

786
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:33,910
a for banks work together government
work with banks

787
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:37,010
so that there's progress a

788
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:40,339
inside the financial services

789
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:43,750
arm what's called later its

790
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:47,280
the information-sharing associations
that government set up

791
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,030
for so far 16 a the critical information

792
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:55,849
infrastructure guys they are tempting
share information unfortunately

793
00:46:55,849 --> 00:46:59,569
everyplace the government sits there
classifying all the information so the

794
00:46:59,569 --> 00:47:01,560
sources over tax are classified

795
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,780
so at this point it's all one way
sharing with government

796
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:09,010
the Financial Services Group is by far
the best they're sharing real

797
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:09,790
information

798
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:15,609
but one defense contractor and two works
within the defense industrial base rate

799
00:47:15,609 --> 00:47:19,099
in the defense industrial base has our
own informations sharing

800
00:47:19,099 --> 00:47:22,569
group longs 30 of them Mischer

801
00:47:22,569 --> 00:47:27,170
source of attacking these critical
indicators all the time the 1i talk to

802
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:28,670
show the pie chart

803
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:32,569
without numbers on my cousin they've
others pretty critical that sure that

804
00:47:32,569 --> 00:47:36,740
but it looks like about eighty percent
of the tax that they felt that they had

805
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:37,530
stopped

806
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:40,560
came from internal information only and

807
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:45,030
20 percent from external information so
the Texas so targeted

808
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:48,740
that sharing is a is a mess we working
overtime the Nets

809
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,970
you know only in those bunch
organizations that are attempting to

810
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:56,170
one a make that sharing standardized
like CV

811
00:47:56,170 --> 00:48:00,210
years for vulnerabilities and in
hopefully be able to get some for XML

812
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:00,900
feed

813
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:04,109
to everybody else a the

814
00:48:04,109 --> 00:48:08,050
I believe the price is going to come
from a vendor's so I just the kind of

815
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:11,770
thinking Trend Micro cuz I was just sat
there today and also that

816
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:15,119
and their they do that amongst their
customers

817
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:18,579
just like you do with I'm the only way
the do you roll

818
00:48:18,579 --> 00:48:21,589
content filtering today is that web
crawling

819
00:48:21,589 --> 00:48:25,859
right trying to find every website world
in class for it you just wait until on

820
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:28,450
your customers if you have a big install
base

821
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:31,450
so of course trend has you know $20
million

822
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:35,119
in points or something like that
Fortinet has a million

823
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:38,359
gateway devices deployed those are are
reporting

824
00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:42,770
every time I see a new URL reported back
for now since they got home it is well

825
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:43,819
since then human

826
00:48:43,819 --> 00:48:47,260
analysts in China determining what that
is

827
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:50,619
and then feeling it back in it's going
to be the vendors

828
00:48:50,619 --> 00:48:53,890
that solve this problem because they're
gonna so you tools they have all the

829
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:54,750
indicators from

830
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:58,690
all over all customers and trends got
tools to do that now we got six hundred

831
00:48:58,690 --> 00:48:59,829
role customers

832
00:48:59,829 --> 00:49:03,740
eighty percent of them have agreed to
let the information out you know the

833
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,589
government guys doing we will say no

834
00:49:05,589 --> 00:49:09,599
because that information is classified
is just knowing who the attackers are

835
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:10,339
could be

836
00:49:10,339 --> 00:49:13,579
some information the attackers use them
so there's

837
00:49:13,579 --> 00:49:17,380
there is hope poet don't believe it's
going to come from the government

838
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:18,210
organizing

839
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:22,020
voluntary systems as the cybersecurity
act 2 2012 supposed to do

840
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:25,329
and the executive order soon released
will

841
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:32,329
Lincoln work yes sir

842
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:03,720
great question what's the advance the US
for leaking

843
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,800
the fact that they're responsible for
stocks that a

844
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:11,420
as a for some reason I just step back
going couple weeks I said what could be

845
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:13,420
the reasons for that I came up with
three

846
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:17,660
Arena Pass Marcus Ranum cuz I know he'll
tell me something bullshit if it's

847
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:18,140
bullshit

848
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:21,380
me so they're all bullshit a but the
three were

849
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:25,280
for smaller one that's been voiced in
the press you know it's just the

850
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,250
politics move to improve

851
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:33,250
the president's the the perceptual
president as a great

852
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:36,540
leader rate a maybe

853
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:39,790
another 1i thought is OK you couldn't

854
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:43,220
make that claim before true right
because

855
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:47,000
the real guys we go have in the
intelligence community the spy world

856
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:47,710
would know

857
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:50,880
you're lying so you really wouldn't
wanna do that

858
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,660
in less Israel were behind it in the US
was taking the heat

859
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:59,360
for Israel so it's another just throwing
it out there

860
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,470
no idea and thirdly there's

861
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:05,990
now this is the tin foil hat conspiracy
theory

862
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:09,670
version no the there is a movement

863
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:13,440
for a regulating a critical
infrastructure

864
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:18,180
so they resist evident desire to impose
a whole bunch of cyber regulations

865
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:22,490
and oil and gas electrical grid all the
rest well we all know

866
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:26,780
rama manuel said a you've never let a
good crisis go to waste

867
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:31,190
so we actually meet us over to your in
order for the government to react

868
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:35,700
we need a 911 for in order for the
Patriot Act three payaso

869
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:38,910
after the attack against critical
infrastructure

870
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:42,130
a then the real the instantly get you
know

871
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:45,780
everybody in congress voting for some
source over-regulation we

872
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:48,800
really onerous course totally useless
and

873
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,900
map effective but I'll have what they
want which is another regulatory regime

874
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,630
because while money lobbying

875
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:57,840
rest so how did how to induce that

876
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:01,380
from your nose adaran you natalie did
you really

877
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:04,420
hurt them and really embarrass them in
the spy world

878
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:08,040
now you've just taken it to the
international stage in core Sastry

879
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:11,690
you know gets access to the papers you
know through proxy servers so they know

880
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:12,470
it too so you

881
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:15,490
really really bear some way for some to
do something about it

882
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:19,340
in that something will be fiscal pact my
three theories

883
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:24,290
I don't know thank you

884
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:26,100
right receiver I'll be appearing
