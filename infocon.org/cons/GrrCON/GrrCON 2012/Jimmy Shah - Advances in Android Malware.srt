1
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,250
everybody

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,889
have I'm we talk about a real event

3
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:15,870
mobile now and when our basically thinks
attackers are doing now and improve upon

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,970
just sending an SMS

5
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:23,980
to get some numbers of urs right now we
see now is basically a mix between

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,570
regular Mauer and and what we call
potentially unwanted

7
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,599
program is your spyware adware your hack
tools

8
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:36,100
things you may or may not want on given

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:41,790
for roughly about fifty so it's not just
me or is not just one but two things out

10
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:42,100
there

11
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,129
there's a change now we're seeing
amongst

12
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:49,180
what doctors are doing actual becomes

13
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,960
BSF over me

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,049
good percentage seeing a lot more more
attacks like up doctor or botnet attacks

15
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:02,530
think send out yeah use information

16
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,470
to an attacker like your IMEI your your
MZ your

17
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,619
any precede identities and identifiers

18
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:15,860
help healthy a doctor buyer for jelly on
used to be attack your phone to work now

19
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:16,610
they're seeing

20
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:21,220
they're more designed to basically given
given in Tucker we do

21
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,689
count how many fix the house so if
you're running a botnet you say okay

22
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:28,630
I got 100000 fixed or get a new
infections I can tell by the number of

23
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,189
individual identified

24
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:34,340
it's more we're seeing now big numbers
in actually people discover okay

25
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,719
we're gonna send a quick message or a
quick cup SMS message

26
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:42,930
a cost you like baca message to be more

27
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,090
okay so so seniornet %ah Curtis from
like start something

28
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:49,800
bypass anti-virus software running our
sovereign

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,410
get onto a phone or get undetectable
whatever takes

30
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:57,380
welcome situation those p.m. this would
be like if you had your own

31
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,760
yeronus miss any Kuznetsova bunch of SMS
messages

32
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,260
you gonna come very quickly so their
ways to avoid okay or maybe running on

33
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,720
bond using okay let me put it together
and

34
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,170
100000 host if you don't use special
techniques me options

35
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,400
other techniques like your cool well
you're

36
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,360
coworkers or Europe

37
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:28,360
up

38
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,180
ok

39
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,910
boo okay arm

40
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,140
saw a couple if we sing a look at this
now I'll

41
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,140
say you got your own Barnett and and
someone takes over your partner

42
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,410
your bad shape so you are you sticking
like encryption or something

43
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,920
some advanced technique in the to avoid
someone else thing over and over

44
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,840
or invading your network of infected
devices

45
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,280
okay so now you come up with or maybe
even better

46
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,360
me you don't like like up my John over
Higdon and not treated to George or

47
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,450
Charlie Miller Odom

48
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:01,560
where they put out an application at
that download code from

49
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,910
from their their server or in the case
of a talker me tucker server

50
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,400
but no one's gonna run your code gets
number interesting so would have

51
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,910
different ways you can do that to get

52
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,110
bypass detection and to bypass been
boring

53
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:18,640
let's take a look at this the Citrix
first step once again

54
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,440
like the ER the bonnet situation where
you've got a hundred thousand host

55
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,220
infected and you've got a large network
above

56
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,790
victims here and zombies were gonna call
them arm

57
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,970
the questions how do you make sure
someone come over take over your girl

58
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:35,209
you're not worried too much or be
detected by antivirus or security

59
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:36,359
software not because

60
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:39,579
you're making money why would you worry
about that you're worried more about 21

61
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:43,739
take taking over your cast on your
network itself so what do you do you can

62
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:44,970
keep your network traffic

63
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,950
rather than it being gripping like say a
each individual copy of your mirror

64
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,870
so be these a simple things like this
the very simple technique they're

65
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,489
advancing

66
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:57,370
simple techniques are like hiding your
%ah what message you're sending a

67
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,660
one-off for

68
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,049
having a configuration files
configuration file like mean minimal

69
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:03,730
encryption

70
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:07,180
like substance I for something simple
from just avoid the

71
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,669
someone else easy taking over and over
again and taking over

72
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:15,700
I guess just basically it are a more
complex techniques use like a

73
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:22,550
a better algorithm IKEA SRTS 01 Mar our
droid dream I believe you start yes

74
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,500
and it was BC designed just to keep the
euro's was using and into crypt traffic

75
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,450
it was going over that work

76
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,610
really worried about it I knew detective
talk to want to kill you submit your

77
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:32,110
site for

78
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,130
it's a very secure in our room and
you've got not picky

79
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,719
stored in the in your file good to go
every text

80
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:42,870
yes we can love these are not the most
advanced techniques of their

81
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:48,380
I okay minor thing I was getting my
slight earlier a reader recording calls

82
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,890
basically a there's no way out there
that's able to record because this was

83
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,550
done initially by academic

84
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,000
approve contact with the said okay
achieved record audio and and do that

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,050
it took about six months after the
academic concepts for

86
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,320
back to Sac use email with a while doing
that and they've done things that have

87
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:04,979
gone after

88
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:09,270
United voices Ponton don't know that not
the most exciting parts

89
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:13,090
we've seen than we've seen a couple
different very you will def

90
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,070
technique but it's basically all about
recording audio not that impressive

91
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,590
nothing

92
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,590
parts that you got to be like this where

93
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:24,050
our updates this is so two different
ways you can do this one is by actually

94
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:28,260
arm having real updates or any other one
is pretend to be an update

95
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:32,729
and bring to be on a PC is basically
over cover later but fraud in now

96
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:36,659
as a technique an attack occurred it's
basically pretend to be a legitimate

97
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:37,840
update from the sea

98
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,050
Angry Birds or for a an actual and
offering system and you're gonna

99
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,190
get on there the main thing is if you
pretend to be a system update

100
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:50,460
when the user sees or two system update
and it's an old recordings of packages

101
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,180
some other

102
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,260
a high-level commission your they're
probably gonna prove it the system

103
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:59,200
update some YouTube a social engineering
there and help to get on device

104
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,050
and sexy something we see more often
than not

105
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,800
in attackers it's a little prick very
simple trick

106
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,370
but still enough people fall for it so
it it comes out in

107
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,010
it's quite successful the other option
was up

108
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:18,900
our affiliates of this is no one
actually has a way so up in itself from

109
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,870
an attacker server

110
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,950
so vividly to contact you could command
a call 770 fall down on some

111
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,960
new code YouTube on your fortunately
when you taking or something or install

112
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,750
someone else's of

113
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,029
we open up an example to coming up a
little later

114
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:35,719
take a look at that okay I'm

115
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:39,750
rights are generally are real now
operates 10 official don't you see

116
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,419
what's going on

117
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:44,680
and there's a basically a need taking to
the taken from legitimate suffer

118
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,759
your anniversary of itself your your

119
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,770
windows up itself like some word up
itself

120
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:54,349
why should my lower right they're
learning okay

121
00:06:54,349 --> 00:06:57,380
up another cock have been in an attack
which is a

122
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,780
ruling experts putting export to the
same want to use you want to chat or

123
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,240
phone

124
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,370
cease ok I want more access to my phone
I wanna be able to do stuff with it

125
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:08,520
apps can use for their exports and of
course from our office at the exact same

126
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,020
thing

127
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,270
they're saying okay why should I write
my own explain why she goes to all the

128
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:12,889
effort if

129
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:16,970
picking out new techniques 1 the ruling
community is already doing it for us

130
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,940
which is nice for the lazy attackers

131
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,020
because they're just taking what if you
have but bad for them also because the I

132
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,310
I'm not sure they realize this but since
these are public routing exploits

133
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,690
also factors including anti-virus
offered knots and we can use it

134
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:37,099
i in the case is something major ones
we've got like

135
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:40,629
Mauer text using mean no exploits

136
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:45,650
this repackaging them and adding what is
this 18 exploit variance 26 fence

137
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,759
these are very it's where they've just
changed worse if you were drawn include

138
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,620
the original ruling explain

139
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,259
up not that difficult but something
they're doing more and more

140
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:57,819
of it cuz fairly it pays more too just

141
00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:02,360
use existing code another lesson learned
from the gym it's %uh for development

142
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,680
bad for them if you want to avoid
detection

143
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,860
something sexy more functional arm fraud
basically

144
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,970
for on on on on mom our this is
basically

145
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,000
different from what he called in
infected code I believe

146
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,310
yes right skipping the difference where
were the application to spur tents or

147
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:21,590
the

148
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:26,349
our pretends to be the gym application
socit against the Heat are tuning out

149
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:30,060
okay to nap this guitar tuning not
exactly just pretend it has enough go to

150
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,560
pretend to be there

151
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,979
got two examples here I one is one click
Forward

152
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:38,560
pretends to be am risk in adult
entertainment out

153
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,930
and really good just weeks money after
the

154
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,880
of the victim and a bf a token which
pretends to be like

155
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,860
for those two factor authentication
application so like if you've got Ghulam

156
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,910
authenticator on your phone at to pick
up the kitchen

157
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:57,550
a installed on your Google account you
up to how far up the

158
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,800
Google's authenticator app in enter the
code it into Google every time you log

159
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,699
in

160
00:09:01,699 --> 00:09:05,500
so in this case they talk about in to be
one of those same kinda

161
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,959
it open applications for a bank

162
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,620
fraction number banks and really wasn't
one of those up

163
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,640
generate I generating you like what you
were expecting

164
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,819
RC talking or something just repeat
every minute or so will give you six

165
00:09:20,819 --> 00:09:21,990
digit code

166
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,760
if you a random code to enter your
password and all doses for the pass it

167
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,430
on to the

168
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,439
attacker so it's very tricky very sneaky

169
00:09:29,439 --> 00:09:32,880
but it really doesn't do what it's
supposed to be it's it's this from

170
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,930
pretends to be some

171
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:40,170
actual example think talking pretty much
it was cuz much love to you I think two

172
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,290
to three different banks

173
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:45,960
had called just like okay your password
and give you a fake

174
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,950
really nice concept simple actually got
a few people I think it affected

175
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,330
few good number people me technique

176
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:56,400
and good enough just good enough for now
to people

177
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,680
but not good enough to be an actual work

178
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,980
and I think we've seen so far since with
the routing exploited with the

179
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,560
encryption

180
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,320
melrose we aren't about the work thereby
making the money they can make the money

181
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,470
they're gonna do any extra work are now
on to one click fraud

182
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:16,220
just the adult up the kitchen our fickle
publication it's a ballistic

183
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,540
adult entertainment site answer to put
out a message every five minutes that

184
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,560
telling the user okay

185
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,220
it was the money cuz you look at them
reported something on

186
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,010
those lines sec

187
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,180
basically what it did was to take
information from you take your %ah

188
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,220
Google account number in a few other
identifiers to be able to track YouTube

189
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,160
infections

190
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,329
conviction and tracking user and finding
a way to get you to basically

191
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:44,360
pay them would be to be openable the
fake website and have you

192
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,630
cue give you a message saying OK pay for
further acts for peace with the police

193
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:52,360
new technique you ask cool fall for it
now because we do anything it doesn't

194
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,380
get you

195
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:57,959
if you were to cling to give you who
fall for that quite a few people

196
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:02,350
we actually saw deductions are probably
detective

197
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:07,089
but above its number right to one in
eleven people actually over this

198
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:10,870
and they picked up about twenty five
thousand dollars in actual profit some

199
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,920
people paying for this

200
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:18,220
basically this extortion the bag is a
extort you for doing so

201
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,470
himself the capital but your money

202
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:25,310
and did anyone can yes because it forces
legal

203
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,250
and it's something that people to crack
Maurice not special think that I can

204
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:29,870
money

205
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:33,300
that's a lotta money it's looks much
more impressive again

206
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,050
when you want but still it's quite a bit
of money up so

207
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,640
six people got picked up got a recipe
was coming to see the seen actual ending

208
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,149
result

209
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:45,350
our prosecution Road in 10 this if you
love was the actual

210
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:49,870
also or so what we learned so far from
our authors are lazy

211
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:53,459
there are like to make money and yes
they will get caught up

212
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:57,170
so really quite a few things here about
Rick's

213
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,620
am another technique that their
government to know what is on

214
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:06,250
and release got from the PC side is a
server-side polymorphism fancy words say

215
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,510
basically the change-up

216
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,730
every time you go to a given URL for
them our

217
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,120
you get a different copy of the love
them our your own personalized copy

218
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,750
outburst in a minute but it's designed
to like the change a few strings

219
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,540
changeable size on it in the case if
this this this one here

220
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:26,899
arm got about 300 kilobytes about 50
tickle fights but

221
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:30,380
basically the internals are to be like
chemical you take apart

222
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:36,850
me

223
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:40,869
if you actually a pack these a Android
applications you find other basic OTE

224
00:12:40,869 --> 00:12:45,489
virtually identical doing things have
changed or increase in see the

225
00:12:45,489 --> 00:12:48,509
the manifest file for all feelings just
enough to its

226
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:52,989
change in a min application internally
when installed and size-wise

227
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:57,059
lacus what you think very simple thing
to do when you talk to cite cost wise

228
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:01,889
all think they have to do is basically
script change due to certain files and

229
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:02,869
repack the files

230
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:07,149
and giving you don't know that can be
done in a few seconds script you

231
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:08,809
wouldn't even know if you click the link
can you get your

232
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:11,959
begin about a minute not a min I'm sorry
few seconds

233
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:15,600
really so every time you come in every
day every hour you wish

234
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,489
so we collect a few these everybody
detection to say okay

235
00:13:19,489 --> 00:13:22,749
strict also change I pick up all the
rest

236
00:13:22,749 --> 00:13:26,769
also while it's very nice initially from
a talker and it's real easy for them to

237
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:27,389
change was

238
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,970
it was much the big bucks and

239
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:34,339
but it is a nice cup initially
especially if people just hashing miles

240
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:38,160
away gonna catch sec actual file changes
a lot in

241
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,619
on treating code the file you pick it up
things like going on

242
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:45,529
PC side for years so so far we've
learned that

243
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:49,029
now authors like to make money or
they're very lazy

244
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:52,360
and didn't make crimes mechanistic so

245
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,610
sometimes can also stuff when they're
greedy something some more complicated

246
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:00,910
we'll see a little bit more example if
you were a little bit better than but so

247
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,569
far we've seen

248
00:14:01,569 --> 00:14:06,139
people who are not that good at it yet
but these are good techniques they're

249
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:07,009
nice techniques a

250
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:11,439
that did work in certain circles at and
when done properly

251
00:14:11,439 --> 00:14:15,610
and so one major example though that
he's

252
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:20,019
and we think it's all which I think
we're a few we're actually more than 25

253
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:20,829
at the moment

254
00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:24,329
very his appearance that are very
similar but they have changed enough to

255
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:27,970
make it to the protection more so than
the hundreds and thousands of other

256
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:32,410
I'll server-side very to have these are
one lucky

257
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:36,259
much diff actually my Nike with an
architect for most

258
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:42,069
but shitty job stepping over here is
this your be compiled and

259
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:45,600
manifest file their every single one
you're you're applications

260
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,449
me tell you what application is an
permission like

261
00:14:49,449 --> 00:14:54,079
exchange really are pre-fixed me

262
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,819
a few other things minor changes

263
00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:03,020
scriptable simple now

264
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,970
something more fun though more
interesting technique is up

265
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:09,850
injecting coating to air the gym
application this is very simple to the

266
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,530
front of occasion we have an obligation

267
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:16,640
or Napa to think that he said of the
fraud words that could be fake

268
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,750
maybe something takes the viewer
application

269
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,150
and a real obligation and basically

270
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:28,950
injected so much is going to like like a
standard pc virus infects

271
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,970
other executable files other programs

272
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:35,270
this case it's not action an actual

273
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:38,630
found picking virus is actually been
sold to lissy

274
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:43,070
when you're thirty different companies
much like to agree was initially in this

275
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,600
case we're talking about something
called

276
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,720
initially and would not cover and we
called Android staffer

277
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,490
up we find another birdie did almost
exactly the same thing in this case

278
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,990
we're talking about iranian food after
pretends to be a

279
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,790
it's unreal iranian food application to
your interest in getting restless for

280
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:02,070
a number of issues it would give them to
you it really would and the background

281
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,280
06 something up

282
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,770
it's got coded for basically a

283
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:09,770
going after pretty much every every year

284
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:14,550
photo on every chip take on on your SD
card it's dancing tired tired as the car

285
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,580
for every single photo

286
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:20,030
and camp stamps a copy over the
ayatollah Committee on to everyone you

287
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,990
pick your got family photos you got your

288
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:26,410
your friend to tell me I may be a family
picture for on this site on the corner

289
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:29,900
may be walking on the beach a picture
you know your your your your significant

290
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,850
other

291
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,900
walking on the beach and Brunei it all
is going to their

292
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,350
fastening concept really hilarious when
if

293
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:41,420
long-missing has when you're your only
copy of your personal photos

294
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,800
kinda funny in this case

295
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,030
the code injection is BC just a small
portion according to into a legitimate

296
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:51,260
up haitian a logical because the real
thing

297
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,070
and was gonna build this thing is

298
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:58,130
unlike go on a PC server a varsity
learns the

299
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:01,130
expected something market a particular
application

300
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,760
program I'm infected with 10 I put a
mark in there I

301
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,350
effective so I won't begin is a little
buggy doesn't even talk further

302
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:13,240
so I mean once again now Reuters

303
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,060
like big money like to do funny things
do a lot of things in there analisi

304
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:22,459
seem to fit a pattern on it I don't know
maybe me the point is that it doesn't

305
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:25,240
have to check it infecting every single
filer everything a photo

306
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,860
over and over again eventually push the
size of the file

307
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:33,130
so it's cool so I can say a few hundred
k2 maybe a megabyte or so

308
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:37,010
three large to accept this peace fills
up your tires to cart and also

309
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:44,010
damage your photos because the only
thing solid is the picture title

310
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:02,080
okay in a in the case if up any case if
the this is called you get this will fix

311
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,700
your diet or discard their

312
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,140
up to the code basically takes it got
every image

313
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,720
and staff this photo onto the corner

314
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,080
everyone your phone I your pictures so
now scored for that it has absolute no

315
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,120
court what's over to check it infected

316
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,540
and the scene actual sample that looks
like lets that start with my picture is

317
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,640
a picture person Obama

318
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,560
use a personal love the picture is Obama
one infected first-generation

319
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,460
me look at another site all alone look
at him as

320
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,530
a little too few generations later diet
or something fresh

321
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:39,310
Obama to cuba picket a balanced and
complete picture and let's take a look

322
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,510
if you were to shut up

323
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:44,620
I tore still looking good totally fading
away with its like you if you've seen

324
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,200
the

325
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,530
back to the future to learn more
resources a period when is the principal

326
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,370
get together you know

327
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:52,420
it's a bit like that maybe that's due to
all the reference

328
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,900
okay point is the the ayatollah gets
bigger and bigger

329
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:00,790
I ordered stronger apparently in this
case and your photo start to fade away

330
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,920
but the size you pictured it bigger this
is a side effect

331
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,710
it this is something sinister version B

332
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:13,240
about that an app for that Mauer this is
a a Japanese pop group

333
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,610
I think it's Ekpe forty-eight or
something along those lines

334
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:21,560
they have about morton et this one like
American Idol or something like that

335
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:26,020
but it's likely the couple sixty members
for did you see what they used to be

336
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:30,300
decisive in their membership basically
have a traveling band over you have

337
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,500
about 45 min travel around the country
and then

338
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,070
sync music casey ever use a compass a
vote on your favorite bands

339
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,910
so there was a after allows you to piece
we follow the elections where where

340
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,910
found could vote on who they want to be
in there would you want the current

341
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:44,560
touring band

342
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:49,280
and he had this happen and they actually

343
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,760
this a picture is the report places the
ayatollah I get stuck in all your

344
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,280
pictures

345
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,670
the trick was to african to be that that
after the team honor

346
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:00,400
who's won the elections I love this
particular band but instead he would

347
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,850
have to just post this picture here

348
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:05,180
now this picture is not totally
unrelated this is the picture from a and

349
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,870
another a KB 40 contest

350
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:12,000
I year before where you could see are
not a contest but unlike another after

351
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,010
let you see how

352
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:17,880
you as a fan I V KB 48 are you a picture
view and a picture of one of the members

353
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,410
we could be 48 over what would you baby

354
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:23,430
what your baby even be you if you mix it
together

355
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:27,080
this also with a sumo wrestler and love
the members salsa

356
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,520
cover somewhat creepy looking baby

357
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,620
put on every order purchased all through
all your pics on the disc ever

358
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,010
on a disk ever all around you despair I
was

359
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:41,660
if it's funny did good the dubsection
opponents in part because

360
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,760
literally the code was I completely I
dunno if you compare this to the

361
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,630
previous going to complete the identical
don't think

362
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:49,960
change if the picture nothing else so
once again

363
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,920
please email or authors they're not
trying very hard

364
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:59,040
not so much the the one to really try to
make money in an hour and in an hour in

365
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,470
general

366
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:03,350
are the ones who are running but naps
and attempting to make money or resell

367
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:03,960
traffic

368
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,910
just the same way to on a PC where you
infect hundred thousand computers and

369
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,330
you re Selby services

370
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:12,370
of those infected devices are infected
computers to

371
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:15,830
other criminals that's really the only
way you make money to Assam

372
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:19,030
otherwise you get in trouble or you make
no money or you get caught

373
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:24,070
I am this is actually something the more
advance was referring to

374
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:28,780
Android back strip got a this is
basically a arm

375
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:33,440
a fig version was injected coated in a
number of new real applications

376
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,460
this first-ever is an Angry Birds
version our

377
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:40,270
thank you for space and so stock really
angry Birds Space it's just thank you

378
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,090
burt space

379
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:44,780
well actually it anchorage-based plus
malicious code and a nice the weather

380
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,500
was cold

381
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,820
more the interesting thing about him
which is code is that it downloads the

382
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,570
additional

383
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:52,610
a taco yet to judicial tackled isn't

384
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:56,600
and record in need a better code it
excuse me

385
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,930
arm its area but basically embedded
JavaScript

386
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:04,460
in this case I uses a coat from a.m.

387
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,950
escape de mi which is a javascript to

388
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:13,120
j2me converter so basically you write
your call you're skipping JavaScript and

389
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,510
it gets loaded by this time escaped a
mean loader

390
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:20,750
and front in the context the application
so you can be sitting in bed

391
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:25,170
orkut all your tax and whatnot in
javascript into running I'm Eminem

392
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:29,660
actual job which is Lord easy if you
only ever learn how to program the web

393
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,580
okay

394
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:35,420
%uh so basically it loaded did this this
obligation want to run it in Seoul South

395
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:40,070
sincere your IMEI ames the budget in
identify SeaTac casino what

396
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:43,920
with the view dude even infected to
contract they're basically the botnet

397
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,970
so the effect maybe a hundred thousand
different

398
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:52,080
people maybe a million people depend on
how well they get along

399
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,429
and then the since susan corruption here
for their their code for the

400
00:22:55,429 --> 00:22:58,410
for the Jalisco gets down on him it's
like okay that's great that that

401
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:02,350
protects it over the network so if
someone's a

402
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:06,270
using I guess Wireshark or something to
monitor the network and see what's what

403
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,650
copies on over

404
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:10,860
or will be so there's there's a fun
intercept no don't always succeed

405
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,070
cryptographic they don't have the key I
miss evers

406
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:17,090
Tampa love the comp are a copy of an
hour

407
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:20,150
time meaning unaffected but but client
has a key

408
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:23,179
so but we analyze we have the copy is

409
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:26,370
have the an hour and we can take a look
and we know what's going on

410
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:31,300
autographic attackers lobbed or the
attackers competitors in this case the

411
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,560
Department gun owners competitors doc so
there

412
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,780
they're kept out are in this case some

413
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,929
the actually called it in very
intelligent doesn't do all the work

414
00:23:40,929 --> 00:23:44,140
all it does is provide infrastructure to
run the year down on the court

415
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,720
so when a dollar to call it downloads
command control code from the server for

416
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,660
me tucker server

417
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:52,420
bring to back down onto the phone and
and implement a few command

418
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:56,780
it's not very much after at the moment
by Curley table to our

419
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:00,410
done dial Rawtenstall in o'dougherty BK
or down on a became

420
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:03,910
meaning down another application from
the

421
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:08,620
for from the attacker server in place on
the on on the on your device on your SD

422
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,600
card

423
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,679
arm and also it's able to run now run

424
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,270
basically send you to other website it
down on install software so basically

425
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:22,260
click fraud and install fraud just a
nice technique is it a good way to make

426
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,810
money because okay

427
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:28,240
installs to generate money paper it's
all paper install

428
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,420
generate money for poor people and
attackers were awesome

429
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:35,060
to do on a PC all time where they will
install I call maybe that that icon

430
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:35,870
program are

431
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:39,480
some other comp program on your PC cost
them nothing

432
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,990
because you nothing but gets them a I E

433
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:46,000
commission from the person doing the
paper installs it

434
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,290
paper instock I

435
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:52,830
in this case are we looking out
something like this it'll pop up a a

436
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,550
WebView of basically

437
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:58,260
one obligation want to be installing a a
second opinion that's all we on on your

438
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,210
device

439
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:02,840
for new technique what you have is on SD
card little bit more advance the other

440
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,380
one

441
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:07,200
it's basically a South install suffered
you don't miss the one on there

442
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,310
once again potentially unwanted programs
not really Mallorca

443
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:15,040
really things that you don't want your
device and it sorry on this can you want

444
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,520
to give it a bit

445
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,670
but that's another story appointees this
is software that

446
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:22,480
actually stays on the radar doesn't do
any damage your system doesn't cause

447
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,730
other problems

448
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:27,590
encryption property can be taken over
easily and is able to be opinion on the

449
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,120
fly

450
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,260
Best Buy downing a script from the
attacker Munich

451
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:35,240
right now we're just as to two things
basically 11 was installing beer initial

452
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,600
adware

453
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,710
and second was a basically clicking on
links

454
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:42,929
and installing now software through
thanks okay

455
00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:46,970
so with how we do another one what are
possible future improvements

456
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:50,850
things up would be good for in Packer me
I make the money but good for them like

457
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:53,800
say some destructive like wiping you
from one phone

458
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,830
destructive not doesn't make any money

459
00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:00,060
maybe not a good idea but they can do
that I

460
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,660
another thing is we selling the armoury
insulation or reselling

461
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,870
other insulation so you start with one
program to install

462
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:10,210
even console for more program for
somebody else they can resell I say they

463
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:13,140
have abominable hundred thousand users

464
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:17,310
I because a number but they could be a
million depends how how long

465
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:20,950
good your initial installous huh

466
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:26,280
in this case all you do is OK arm I have
a hundred thousand more fun at the

467
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,169
available my we call so far but not
available for you

468
00:26:30,169 --> 00:26:34,030
out charge us 80 20 cents for each
install

469
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:37,400
so you give me the package also now to
mind the Nine Network

470
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,570
and August on all these devices and you
get the credit from your

471
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:43,720
I'll pay per install provider

472
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,190
or your commissions on your over
something that software

473
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:51,480
so it works out that every every person
in the chain

474
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,790
so there's a people selling this offer
if you wanted to make a commission a

475
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:57,130
sovereign the person who has the partner

476
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:00,320
you got a buncha people making money on
this entire transaction and

477
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,600
interestingly enough

478
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,669
not getting caught because it did
they're not actually doing damage and i

479
00:27:04,669 --> 00:27:06,940
actually stealing money from banks or
not

480
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:10,280
sorts lot harder to track them because
it's the I guess

481
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,780
low-hanging fruit or or something along
those lines where it's not as bad as it

482
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,850
could be

483
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,960
but he it could be always get works
always get worse but

484
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,820
we haven't seen up to date and we have
seen a trend actually were people saying

485
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,610
OK and attackers saying

486
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:26,900
it's better to make the money than to
get in trouble so they'll they'll tell

487
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,980
hit Lee it's a a mill uses for a buck
apiece

488
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:33,570
and a $2 million bucks the morning up
now to hit another in a couple years

489
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:36,960
to a different technique it if they're
more hidden run then a

490
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,409
a stay and wait runs and you know that
fake

491
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:44,240
fic no one could find one where you get
arrested

492
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,570
so bill boner the secular couple more
things some

493
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:53,250
academic and professional research are
something like this this is a

494
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:57,090
not as complicated but it's just trying
to get there are there was a version of

495
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:59,350
something call sound calmer which was
able to

496
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:03,340
we'd like a I've mentioned earlier
actually

497
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,010
problem across a musical touch lager
exhibition at the bottom

498
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:11,110
on this basis of it reads like you know
whenever you have like an Android phone

499
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:14,310
and you have the soft keyboard or any
any device like that

500
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:17,690
up every time if you hold the phone in
your hand unit at the

501
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:20,870
the keyboard your fingers at some point
um

502
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:24,860
I mean the center's built into the phone
like a motion sensor or not

503
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:28,700
the move a bit the move enough ending of
a pattern that you can detect

504
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,690
any given user typing in say did 129

505
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:35,780
something easy like that for any concept
it's like

506
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,000
it makes sense then and the vacuum
research on this and it works

507
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,840
%uh in the first instance touch longer
you use it was basically two pieces over

508
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,280
Andrew Andrew Tupper

509
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,770
wonder was creating Silverwood learned a
particular patterns

510
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:51,669
well movement caused by Ed one
individual typing in numbers

511
00:28:51,669 --> 00:28:55,390
and a second one that use at benedita to
basically figure out when

512
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:59,020
issues with type in the password or
other or their Pasco to ever take some

513
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,460
of their phone

514
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:04,140
man I was a nice concept but his body
has yet to pieces

515
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,570
this new new variation top blogger put
everything in one place

516
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:11,060
and adds a little fun 10 on their word
tonight you're playing a little icon

517
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,500
matching game that happen to have the
icon

518
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,030
all in the rain to the 02 were mind
sorry

519
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:20,850
1290 029 and the other like the

520
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:24,320
asterisk a man and a pound key you know
old is absolutely right

521
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,690
the same location you'll see might miss
it for new concept but good stead you're

522
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:28,919
playing a game

523
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:32,020
so to engaging in a gated Nadu and
basically

524
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,580
train this offer on how you press the
buttons on on your keypad

525
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:39,429
so when you lock your phone to Tucker
gets access to all your your information

526
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:43,380
the concept Tony academic at the moment
I mean yes is that an improvement on

527
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,350
other academics offer

528
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:50,380
and about 6.2 Miller we haven't yet seen
that in the wild in our

529
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,960
not sure why I probably because there's
not a lot of money in taking over any

530
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,700
given month

531
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,050
active in Android phone a mess you can't
sell

532
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:01,560
ad clicks or go further like Orsino

533
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:05,190
seen before were people try to take over
or bottle it'll take over the

534
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:12,190
wild second your question

535
00:30:20,629 --> 00:30:24,480
okay to question was how many users who
their do anything their past go to a lot

536
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,049
their phone

537
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:28,830
C 240 dippin how many of those are the
same as says the

538
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:33,139
as their bank carey campaign that's a
good question I don't actually know

539
00:30:33,139 --> 00:30:36,769
but it's the like the case and we'll
pass it another prosecution different

540
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:37,309
accounts

541
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:41,720
there's a lot of repetition and like my
friend here is an actual a pen tester so

542
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,340
I mean you

543
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,350
this is actual a Cup group

544
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:52,350
okay if you have enough information to
use it to be able it's all this you can

545
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,789
do what exactly

546
00:30:55,789 --> 00:31:02,789
you've got a lot more to go if you're
going okay and you possibly have a tip n

547
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,409
yes I can agree with that

548
00:31:04,409 --> 00:31:08,450
yes that's very likely this is a true
true to look at %uh sir does every day

549
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:12,039
well yes it's true yes if you use your

550
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:15,690
as a comment in your puppies and more
the one place and possibly on your phone

551
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:19,590
so this once again argues for use in the
slower

552
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:23,929
but we still haven't seen that it this
might be tied into what the Fed we're

553
00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:24,559
seeing where

554
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,899
attackers are enjoying just doing silly
things and

555
00:31:28,899 --> 00:31:33,320
making quick mark a quick buck and not
really trying hard on their own it's not

556
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:33,889
like they're

557
00:31:33,889 --> 00:31:37,940
the year the attackers are putting their
own Rd into are developing exporter

558
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,679
developing new techniques like like this
the suffer like this

559
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:44,700
that we trippin something like that
don't know quite how that whose are you

560
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,460
doing this work

561
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:48,749
academics to other researchers up its

562
00:31:48,749 --> 00:31:52,279
people like girl ok this section over
you what that does

563
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:56,549
maybe a little bit a better idea about
the touching and pushing the buttons

564
00:31:56,549 --> 00:32:00,149
but it was the same got a bill and 23 if
you use your pin

565
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:03,340
you pass in one place you move very
likely will use it somewhere else

566
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:07,049
let's look at two other interesting
researchers search on over height and

567
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:08,590
controllable I mentioned earlier

568
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:12,830
%uh so these two guys are really good at
going after mobile phones

569
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:16,869
baby to some interesting things a are
John put together a nap

570
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:22,039
rough a few years ago and at not summer
call you now said called eclipse truck

571
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:25,169
this is basically a piece of glass of
reputed to be a

572
00:32:25,169 --> 00:32:28,429
and opportunity bien

573
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:32,369
what we call it a preview out for the
latest the at all everything was Eclipse

574
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:33,710
it on its way could strap

575
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:37,149
so was that a preview of the show you
like what's going on in new movie this

576
00:32:37,149 --> 00:32:37,490
is a

577
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:41,309
once again playing on the on the fact
that it's a very popular movie the love

578
00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:42,470
you want what is up

579
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:46,639
the public a download it what do they
actually do it was just the

580
00:32:46,639 --> 00:32:49,990
fee cap that did just enough to show you
that know your

581
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:53,250
we're looking across my thingy clips
preview up

582
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:56,519
but meanwhile I was downloading on
native code from mom

583
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:59,919
over a server so kind of like what we
saw with the

584
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,960
with backpack script where does go from
you talk a server

585
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,250
it was the beloved on our exports in
code from mom a jock server

586
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:11,129
out charlie didn't trying to do
something very similar a few years later

587
00:33:11,129 --> 00:33:13,159
on nothing on the iPhone actually

588
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:16,250
it was a stock market after zabell
download code from mom

589
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:21,000
from his server new techniques so do
these are two guys who it really good at

590
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,570
doing

591
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:24,899
interesting things on mobile phones and
you went really really is the guy was

592
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:25,600
known for

593
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,759
the first Google Android the exploit and
I think the first a public

594
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:35,299
iPhone exploit so do you guys know what
they're doing they actually looked at

595
00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:39,529
Google's culture up technology about urs
a thing that

596
00:33:39,529 --> 00:33:44,990
group provided to basically provide some
kind of our I guess I'll vetting for for

597
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,529
Android app so you know

598
00:33:46,529 --> 00:33:50,169
we see only sealed people talk a lot
about all Android so open your you get

599
00:33:50,169 --> 00:33:52,769
whatever you want to turn into the app
market and it could be

600
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:56,929
Mauer could be anything be lot about
stuff other wears protection

601
00:33:56,929 --> 00:34:01,059
in this case I'll are Google's

602
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:04,640
culture technique was or boxers

603
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,980
what to proper term for this it he took
the name really if you're in a night

604
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,520
club there's a guy at the door saying

605
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,120
you can come in you can come in but PC
with this offer is it tells you that you

606
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,550
can or cannot be an application in the
App Store

607
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:20,470
in or the Google Play market call now I
think I

608
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:23,730
the problem you certainly some security
response I'll

609
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:27,550
side over security searchers in if you
were in security general

610
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:31,340
is that it's its security through
obscurity its sick mexico que no one

611
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,889
knows anything about this amazing

612
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:37,179
also we have protect you from all the up
from all the applications

613
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:41,669
up figure nothing about it so they can
break into the capital asset

614
00:34:41,669 --> 00:34:45,919
at this is good right not really
especially when you have two guys like

615
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:46,370
up

616
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:49,780
Charlie and John you know a lot of stuff

617
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,889
they basically fixes last problem here

618
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:57,670
they produced a basically a an out that
there was a sieve into the market

619
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:01,950
and it was able to basin provided me

620
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:05,820
connect back shell into the into the
have Google's network

621
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:10,080
so what they found was one Google runs
he's outs

622
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:15,530
and your app on their internal network
to it has access to the AT&T Internet

623
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,560
that's how the republican-backed himself

624
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,190
a 3 they found out they had a few things
interesting things like the

625
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:26,780
I'll i think is a picture a lady Gaga
owner arm is a good like one cock like

626
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:30,460
american its Alexa they'd follow the
email address a vehicle account on other

627
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,510
for another in a device for ammeter
phone

628
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:35,130
and if they're able to cover whole
budget thing something from the

629
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,260
background and you're also able to
detect

630
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:41,340
fax to me because they have been running
one a live person was testing it has

631
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,080
maps

632
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:46,560
is a whose life people to stay up so
well and they notice if

633
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,550
these guys are connecting back and
touching me your files and looking

634
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:54,020
around and it's like good concept maybe
should not do that why are there but but

635
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:58,760
the point is its it the Google started
like a really really good good start

636
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:03,280
very good start compare to not have
executed any kind sewed it is

637
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:03,940
inappropriate

638
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:07,830
it's getting there it's not quite there
yet the it could help if they did a

639
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:08,830
little bit more um

640
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:12,680
a communication between a researchers
like Charlie and Ron

641
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,080
and to provide basically import

642
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,980
on how to secure a situation like that
like okay you got a bunch on our other

643
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,510
it's not sufficient to run not just a
one or two scanners a one-hop

644
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:26,780
or it's not enough to just how people
run them arm

645
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:31,270
to do run run after manually because
there what what what what the what these

646
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:34,960
desuka came up with was basically saying
if you run when you're out for about

647
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,130
five minutes do nothing

648
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:39,290
I we freed we do publish action until
after five minutes

649
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:42,390
you're pretty much bypass the entire
barter process

650
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:47,000
initially obviously Google improves upon
are all the techniques

651
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,750
like when they're there are recovered
got cracked they've approved up on that

652
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,330
as well so I mean they've got people
develop a good work

653
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:58,200
and are doing well but this is the year
initial concept and its

654
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,900
interesting been thinking is that this
is what's being done by researchers

655
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:06,390
professional researcher an academic
researchers and an not actually

656
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,090
criminals

657
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:10,500
that's the really to the point of all
this is that the criminals are really

658
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,650
doing anything at all

659
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:16,060
malicious there there just to make money
and it's it's a good time for them now

660
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:20,359
it's a bit like with the doing the I
guess it's like having

661
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:24,330
a a Windows PC before we had all the
protection before we had all the

662
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:28,390
fancy Mauer before we roll for a defect
defect is affecting our

663
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:32,270
it's like getting in on the ground for
for them they don't have a try hard yet

664
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:35,900
because we don't have enough security
infrastructure in place

665
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:40,090
to have enough for Sikri sorry to have
things in the back and on the network

666
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:44,960
we don't have all these in place yet but
they're the time is coming and I'm

667
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,460
eventually what happened is that the
bankers get better

668
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:53,320
much like the back skip the got a much
like a few other but not controllers and

669
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:53,800
whatnot

670
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,370
they're getting better they're going to
get better and we have to basically go

671
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:58,440
after them and

672
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:04,290
basically provide more security think
that's the last thing I want there to be

673
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:05,190
any questions on that

674
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:12,190

would reagan started this

682
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:58,960
is the whole areas Matt Johnson with
PowerShell be a cool blue kid

683
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:05,960
really the whole area

684
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:16,170
though I Co

685
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:19,569
II this my talk power show beer cool
blue kid

686
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:25,509
are get started yourself to suffer gonna
go through a managerial intro myself you

687
00:57:25,509 --> 00:57:27,109
really have to actually listen to that

688
00:57:27,109 --> 00:57:31,809
are some basics a powershell go over
some files and file system stuff

689
00:57:31,809 --> 00:57:35,759
well as user access a little bit systems
management and some rap

690
00:57:35,759 --> 00:57:42,160
I I'm a system analyst for a nonprofit
organization

691
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:47,029
and Southeast Michigan I'm also the
founder the PowerShell

692
00:57:47,029 --> 00:57:51,339
Michigan power shows users group which
is cannot do anything right now so that

693
00:57:51,339 --> 00:57:56,680
it's hopefully gonna change later this
year I am a moderator on the hey

694
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:00,459
scripting guy forms if you're not
familiar with the hey scripting guy AR

695
00:58:00,459 --> 00:58:04,599
website at Microsoft it is the area to
help people learn PowerShell

696
00:58:04,599 --> 00:58:09,869
give arm actually things you can use in
your job so here's a variable

697
00:58:09,869 --> 00:58:13,150

cool their performs

698
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:18,140
and I am a moderator on their well as a
judge Microsoft s cooking games every

699
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:19,749
year to help you in PowerShell

700
00:58:19,749 --> 00:58:23,039
are either from basic or advanced are

701
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:26,819
judging is fun but its that's a lot of
scripts so

702
00:58:26,819 --> 00:58:30,219
I you should try it out of your use
PowerShell in PowerShell

703
00:58:30,219 --> 00:58:33,369
arm you throat remember my sack

704
00:58:33,369 --> 00:58:36,380
arm whether they like it or not

705
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:42,479
but I met ever given to any future
sports fam

706
00:58:42,479 --> 00:58:45,609
so if my phone goes off in the middle
here's it's probably the White Sox

707
00:58:45,609 --> 00:58:46,269
losing

708
00:58:46,269 --> 00:58:51,589
and I'm yeah and a

709
00:58:51,589 --> 00:58:55,049
I'm a father cue a future hacker I he
does

710
00:58:55,049 --> 00:58:58,279
crazy things that I am thinking to
Europe to do yet annie has been to a

711
00:58:58,279 --> 00:59:01,529
wonderful wife who have him this weekend
that I feel bad for her

712
00:59:01,529 --> 00:59:05,219
I'm not an expert I

713
00:59:05,219 --> 00:59:09,789
like to pretend I am but I'm really not
I'm really my sex power show expert

714
00:59:09,789 --> 00:59:13,039
and yeah they they've probably suffer
through that

715
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:16,289
there's a ton a sysadmin stuff in here
blue side

716
00:59:16,289 --> 00:59:19,640
are that's what I am normally do I don't
do read

717
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:23,440
side so we'll but a lot of the sadness
stuff does tend to

718
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:27,849
technically translate over the blue side
my employer

719
00:59:27,849 --> 00:59:32,190
doesn't feel this way are either does
Microsoft I feel like every site has to

720
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:34,219
have that line in there so that's why
that's their

721
00:59:34,219 --> 00:59:37,279
and as you find out I think I'm funny

722
00:59:37,279 --> 00:59:40,309
and I talk too fast so get over it if
you don't like it there's the doors

723
00:59:40,309 --> 00:59:44,249
so act what's going on you anyway right

724
00:59:44,249 --> 00:59:47,809
hopefully you all have seen this if you
use Windows seven

725
00:59:47,809 --> 00:59:51,170
an OPP to the other version for Windows
as well but

726
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:55,499
you need should use this looks like a
DOS window but it's a lot cooler them

727
00:59:55,499 --> 00:59:56,199
and also

728
00:59:56,199 --> 01:00:00,190
you haven't heard willpower shows is a
task

729
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:03,209
automation framework I automate
basically

730
01:00:03,209 --> 01:00:07,670
everything op from tweet now these guys
down here in my sack to

731
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:12,549
are were sent to my wife the grocery
list it's insolvent every Microsoft

732
01:00:12,549 --> 01:00:13,709
operating system

733
01:00:13,709 --> 01:00:17,509
it is getting better are so much better
you

734
01:00:17,509 --> 01:00:21,440
once you start you some partially meant
when does there isn't no literally

735
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,259
you're gonna wonder why they haven't
done much in years

736
01:00:23,259 --> 01:00:26,819
I heard someone comment today saying
that PowerShell makes

737
01:00:26,819 --> 01:00:31,579
when does actually usable my heart
arrive at SCANA Corp

738
01:00:31,579 --> 01:00:36,190
have and the current version is 30 I
have some 30 stuff for in the very end

739
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:38,299
here but I've still new and I didn't
wanna

740
01:00:38,299 --> 01:00:43,160
give you guys have stops up there's
times a support

741
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:46,180
I support everything on here except the
compelling one

742
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:50,749
on here the compelling topics I'm gonna
do a talk proud later this year or next

743
01:00:50,749 --> 01:00:53,009
year are with walking garlic

744
01:00:53,009 --> 01:00:57,900
Dawson give up stuff but is there is a
deep integration with all these products

745
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:03,219
you can be I i don't remember the last
time I opened actually agree we to

746
01:01:03,219 --> 01:01:04,589
manage have those products

747
01:01:04,589 --> 01:01:09,039
Skakel alright we're gonna go over some
little basic

748
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:13,479
I language stuff if you've are no a
partial as you can

749
01:01:13,479 --> 01:01:17,829
check your phone for an actual bet a
commander is like a command but

750
01:01:17,829 --> 01:01:22,549
it so a lot cooler it is our vets Mike's
Subs actual

751
01:01:22,549 --> 01:01:26,369
dust permission but it is a command the
you can make your own

752
01:01:26,369 --> 01:01:30,709
which will get through a couple minutes
that's when you read about power show

753
01:01:30,709 --> 01:01:32,279
you can hear the commandments

754
01:01:32,279 --> 01:01:36,349
it is are there some examples appear
like get help write-host register for an

755
01:01:36,349 --> 01:01:36,929
object

756
01:01:36,929 --> 01:01:40,569
its it's a very simple thing to pick up
Mr you

757
01:01:40,569 --> 01:01:43,829
type in get dashcam and it'll give you a
whole bunch commands in it

758
01:01:43,829 --> 01:01:46,839
actually you look at it and see what you
wanna

759
01:01:46,839 --> 01:01:51,400
you know you can find out what you wanna
do there's a naming convention when you

760
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,369
get scripts

761
01:01:52,369 --> 01:01:55,679
or download stuff off the internet
there's power show it should follow the

762
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:56,749
verb noun

763
01:01:56,749 --> 01:02:00,949
format if it doesn't and you might wanna
point them to the Bourbon

764
01:02:00,949 --> 01:02:04,039
the here's how to write PowerShell code

765
01:02:04,039 --> 01:02:07,609
stuff but it's a you'll see our

766
01:02:07,609 --> 01:02:10,589
you see a lot of people don't use it but
there is a naming convention and you

767
01:02:10,589 --> 01:02:11,469
stick by their

768
01:02:11,469 --> 01:02:14,699
98 verbs that Microsoft uses like show
get

769
01:02:14,699 --> 01:02:17,789
register stop terminate

770
01:02:17,789 --> 01:02:21,880
never use term paper that's cool I then
there's aliases for those people who

771
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,670
don't want to type out get

772
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:27,549
dash mailbox they're able you have GMB

773
01:02:27,549 --> 01:02:30,849
on their side get child I missed
actually dir

774
01:02:30,849 --> 01:02:35,449
much the powers over in order but you
can type dir and it'll do the same thing

775
01:02:35,449 --> 01:02:40,359
or alas for you on UNIX guys

776
01:02:40,359 --> 01:02:43,719
you should not use this is just a sign
up don't use aliases in your scripts

777
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:47,160
because if you share in sum up label
what the heck is that makes for easier

778
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:47,880
to read a few

779
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:51,519
type the full command name saw and you
wanna see all the aliases

780
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:55,150
get dash alias you can make your own to
so if you don't like

781
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:59,119
to type you can make your own in the
daily if your whole thing if you want

782
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:04,539
and get help is your friend I make sure
that you

783
01:03:04,539 --> 01:03:09,719
thanks Chris I use get help I use it all
the time if I'm not typing get help once

784
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:10,309
a day

785
01:03:10,309 --> 01:03:15,219
I'm not I'm not tryin

786

yes they do I camp completion is in the

787
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:22,130
consul and the built-in editor to give
you a pop editor to

788
01:03:22,130 --> 01:03:26,890
which is really cool it will now version
3 will cab company in the editor

789
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:30,410

791
01:03:35,789 --> 01:03:39,170
awesome of like some help

792
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:42,609
there I for the UNIX guys don't worry

793
01:03:42,609 --> 01:03:47,259
do you can type things you know man Kat
cpls

794
01:03:47,259 --> 01:03:52,869
there's a there's multiple aliases for a
lotta commands

795
01:03:52,869 --> 01:03:57,799
I it's kinda I think it's kinda weird
but whatever make people happy

796
01:03:57,799 --> 01:04:01,429
now we're gonna talk about our in
Scripture are outta the box

797
01:04:01,429 --> 01:04:05,170
you download a script for my website
might get home side whatever you won't

798
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:06,479
be able to run it

799
01:04:06,479 --> 01:04:10,079
you have to change execution passing
when this first came out you really are

800
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,119
managed to secure the future to stop
Iran

801
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:15,449
are run scripts and and people like

802
01:04:15,449 --> 01:04:18,529
relic pop up for our Matt

803
01:04:18,529 --> 01:04:22,140
who writes the power spoil module

804
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:25,640
show that we are really when you run
PowerShell body XE you can say

805
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:30,499
bypass the worst execution policy
execution policy is just basically stops

806
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:31,339
you from

807
01:04:31,339 --> 01:04:34,369
doing something stupid like outta the
box

808
01:04:34,369 --> 01:04:37,670
you buy it but are its

809
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:41,769
yeah it's there you can set its just a
minor based on user

810
01:04:41,769 --> 01:04:45,479
I'm a fan I'm just setting up by User
into the globally doing that

811
01:04:45,479 --> 01:04:49,309
are there's a switch and a command that
you can run but that on the Internet

812
01:04:49,309 --> 01:04:52,339
iraq to cover that and it is not a
security measure

813
01:04:52,339 --> 01:04:57,579
if just to stop dumb people from being
down

814
01:04:57,579 --> 01:05:01,009
this is what I love about PowerShell is
you can make tools

815
01:05:01,009 --> 01:05:04,519
how many times have you like and I wish
I had something I could do to do that

816
01:05:04,519 --> 01:05:08,199
you now I have axe I need to repeat that
a million packs

817
01:05:08,199 --> 01:05:12,199
I it's what I do a lot of the time I
make my scripts reusable

818
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:18,329
sharable share my blog a sharing with my
sect members I share my love attack

819
01:05:18,329 --> 01:05:23,199
part as 12 awesome things about this
then there's a huge community

820
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:27,739
miss high behind making tools and
sharing tools there's passcode there is

821
01:05:27,739 --> 01:05:31,410
Mikes of sight for getting scripts are
stunned to different places

822
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:35,029
so this literally is it's like

823
01:05:35,029 --> 01:05:38,029
now bash scripting or batch scripting
buddy its

824
01:05:38,029 --> 01:05:42,259
there's a lot more formal stuck behind a

825
01:05:42,259 --> 01:05:46,259
this is part of that modules modules are
a bunch scripts

826
01:05:46,259 --> 01:05:51,279
or compile the are coda there some other
stuff that you can put that put together

827
01:05:51,279 --> 01:05:52,839
to make and share those tools

828
01:05:52,839 --> 01:05:56,130
one other examples I have later as I
have a module to help

829
01:05:56,130 --> 01:06:00,869
at it host files and it's just three
functions are pieced together that I can

830
01:06:00,869 --> 01:06:07,150
important to my session and go on washer
guys at all about

831
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:10,390
is good for repackaging scripture
sharing group

832
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:15,179
PSC axe which I'll wolf mentioned in his
dotnet talk earlier is a great

833
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:16,489
collection of scripts in it

834
01:06:16,489 --> 01:06:20,249
always updated office 365

835
01:06:20,249 --> 01:06:25,219
you can manage the entire are online web
version of Microsoft's offer

836
01:06:25,219 --> 01:06:31,890
really an NTFS security is another call
on that will get into here in a minute

837
01:06:31,890 --> 01:06:34,869
how many times have you run a command
and wish that you knew what happened

838
01:06:34,869 --> 01:06:38,259
what the output what's Powershot has
he's too wonderful commands filter

839
01:06:38,259 --> 01:06:42,309
call start and stop transcript they will
record your

840
01:06:42,309 --> 01:06:46,179
command and the output for everything
you do so say

841
01:06:46,179 --> 01:06:49,210
at home your change in Ubuntu users

842
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:52,979
over to a group you can logged their
whole thing so you have actually a

843
01:06:52,979 --> 01:06:56,339
backup watcher debts even go back and
say yeah actually move that on this day

844
01:06:56,339 --> 01:06:57,650
at this time

845
01:06:57,650 --> 01:07:01,539
so it's to really cool

846
01:07:01,539 --> 01:07:07,049
with couple s minutes notes ira how many
people are familiar with programming and

847
01:07:07,049 --> 01:07:11,059
gotta gotta gotta everything's an object
which means that you can take it

848
01:07:11,059 --> 01:07:15,969
pipette for use in the pipeline and keep
are manipulating stop until the app

849
01:07:15,969 --> 01:07:20,219
usually when you build a powerful
statement the end thing is always

850
01:07:20,219 --> 01:07:24,659
your formatting so I'm gonna take users
I'm going to modify them and then I'm

851
01:07:24,659 --> 01:07:28,719
gonna print them out to a text file that
I did all this work

852
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:31,929
pipeline like in UNIX 1x at all

853
01:07:31,929 --> 01:07:35,519
you cannot pipe one command to another
two get

854
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:40,559
the variable things all variables are
prefix by dollar time

855
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:44,429
new name anything you want except there
some special variables

856
01:07:44,429 --> 01:07:48,259
our car how many there are but for
there's the does honors for a dollar

857
01:07:48,259 --> 01:07:49,479
sign which is the current

858
01:07:49,479 --> 01:07:54,390
thing in the pipeline or true and false

859
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:59,539
and anything in the stock works in
version 2 are about

860
01:07:59,539 --> 01:08:03,539
so let's start off I of russians I don't
know why you guys but I hate file

861
01:08:03,539 --> 01:08:04,549
permissions it's like

862
01:08:04,549 --> 01:08:08,420
literally is a pain in my ass I don't
like

863
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:11,659
you can the angry yeah okay

864
01:08:11,659 --> 01:08:15,269
and X calzone Kelce we all

865
01:08:15,269 --> 01:08:18,639
I'm in my least I know a lot of people
not to use some but their

866
01:08:18,639 --> 01:08:22,449
really not user-friendly there really a

867
01:08:22,449 --> 01:08:26,049
so built in the PowerShell there's get
inside a sea of

868
01:08:26,049 --> 01:08:29,790
these things are painful to use at best

869
01:08:29,790 --> 01:08:33,139
I'll show you an example or that in a
second

870
01:08:33,139 --> 01:08:36,469
by a you really if you're using this you
are

871
01:08:36,469 --> 01:08:41,279
0 I you know you might want to drink and
watch

872
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:45,210
MacBook are

873
01:08:45,210 --> 01:08:49,179
so here's a demo OVR actually how

874
01:08:49,179 --> 01:08:54,349
bad and the permission ng and windows
are

875
01:08:54,349 --> 01:09:01,099
for PowerShell for this is here we're
gonna create a director or quick

876
01:09:01,099 --> 01:09:05,170
now work in our league this on talk

877
01:09:05,170 --> 01:09:08,750
we're gonna this is the command to get
are

878
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:13,440
but ACLS for their folder and format
less gonna pretend to a thing that we

879
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:16,309
can easily read

880
01:09:16,309 --> 01:09:19,750
you see here there's a whole bunch stuff
administrators

881
01:09:19,750 --> 01:09:24,250
MT system an authenticator you're
basically this is the default

882
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:28,059
are ski access

883
01:09:28,059 --> 01:09:31,150
so here I'm in a store the

884
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:34,719
ACLs into a variable so that I can act
funny

885
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:39,609
here is this right here we're gonna say
that

886
01:09:39,609 --> 01:09:42,179
we're gonna set access for a
protectionist something you have to do

887
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:43,619
America

888
01:09:43,619 --> 01:09:47,179
I not I'm never ever change that so

889
01:09:47,179 --> 01:09:50,859
here's what the next thing we're gonna
do is we're gonna set a

890
01:09:50,859 --> 01:09:54,449
rule that this is an access control
world that gives domain admin for

891
01:09:54,449 --> 01:09:55,489
control

892
01:09:55,489 --> 01:09:58,800
over that directory that is

893
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:05,199
how long that is painful type a command
prompt just literally painful

894
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:08,659
here's another and then this story here
this command will add it

895
01:10:08,659 --> 01:10:12,130
to this variable so that we can make
sure that

896
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:15,929
bag deployed renewed go through and do
this

897
01:10:15,929 --> 01:10:19,090
again for domain users

898
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:22,170
and they're going to get the Modify
permission

899
01:10:22,170 --> 01:10:27,790
