1
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,830
yes

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,770
sorry

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:13,300
no so obviously we saw that X was
implemented by one

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,210
but because there is a more s sex
instruction what will happen is the best

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,400
the MS measly

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,759
all be favored 111 111 okay

7
00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:25,830
so that doesn't solve that based on the
example between

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,920
this thing 128

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,019
with more Essex what will happen is in
our example it was implemented by 1 seed

10
00:00:34,019 --> 00:00:34,410
is

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,580
ffffff and then 81

12
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,300
okay

13
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,300
so the would be 128 V would be ffffff

14
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,930
81 and that is approximately way to 4
gigabytes

15
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:56,190
so just imagine what would happen if a
for gigabyte values putting away a

16
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,620
a member of the destination source to my
4 gigabytes that is actually

17
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,900
the total a memory that that would be
too big to

18
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,340
to get a big sellers system would
address so

19
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,210
if the destination is not that big the
destination both but is not that big

20
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:16,490
it will lead to a buffalo okay and in
the bed was in what will happen is

21
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,810
this thing would be just 0.00% 0 0.00%

22
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:24,240
81 that is one thing so what is
happening is in the unpatched version

23
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,759
a man copy got me a call is made we're
just trying to go before you go by

24
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:29,500
myself and you

25
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,520
and in the bachelors in we know that it
has been reduced to just one big inning

26
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:33,869
by

27
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:39,280
day so the at this point we have tried
to analyze what the change was enough

28
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:39,960
what did

29
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,960
what was the chain made by Microsoft in
this bed so how do we explain this thing

30
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,829
thing

31
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:56,010
depends

32
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:00,280
night

33
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,730
that's true

34
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:05,550
but what we know what we want we are not
trying to write an exploit for this this

35
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,580
a proof-of-concept some what we know is

36
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:12,950
somehow if I put this magic number 128
some that in this and the pediatric ward

37
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,290
there is a high chance that I will be
able to exploit the limited

38
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,470
rate so I'm usually not the

39
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:25,130
name I'm not an expert with and if we
get a card but this is

40
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:29,720
sort assemble in the pediatric ward
looks like it's really simple to add and

41
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,120
if we get a good Guardian Windows DNS
server

42
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,360
this is what the simple and if we get a
good looks like you just go with the

43
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,850
name

44
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:41,360
a fully qualified domain no meaning and
you see that I these

45
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,420
fears away a on Oprah Francis leg string

46
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:49,010
regular expression replacement to me to
do explain this one then maybe you don't

47
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,250
have to be an expert with any pediatric
are

48
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:56,080
all you need to know is I have to put
this magic number 128 some that in one

49
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,130
of the speeds

50
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:01,630
so that the one that he would be
explained

51
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,569
so what they do is I start they're
putting 128 2012 indeed well you know

52
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:06,310
your your

53
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,510
and i'd regular blend in this look up
but they could never love

54
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,940
Nemo the when the baby was no one
expected ideally

55
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,280
that there should have been a honeymoon
are before to overflow

56
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,670
and it leaves the service should have
guessed but that never happened so can

57
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,849
anyone tell me a better solution what
good I could have done

58
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:27,870
explain this one that it may be we know
that there's something related to 128

59
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,459
number

60
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:35,459
and surely that would be a powerful

61
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:43,140
knows said don't sound it's not that
difficult so what they did this

62
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,319
I I saw there was this that up to the
east

63
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,180
string values the flexed ringside
whistling and regular expressions thing

64
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,980
so what they did is I just rather than
putting the value number 128 what they

65
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,620
did is I

66
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,239
just put a random 128 get a cousin and
then I don't did and this nigga

67
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,070
and then the service kress

68
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:09,010
because as simple as that any questions

69
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,230
so how this one nobody could be exploded
in the real world scenario

70
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,410
so what would happen if suppose

71
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,270
there's an a what an attacker could do
is

72
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,840
ago said the malicious domain names lol
with the

73
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,700
with the crafted me in this regard and
if we get a car

74
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,969
and a good sis send an email to one of
bill guys in your

75
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,970
at invisible he was adopted the company
makes for easy what he could do is they

76
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,600
would send an email to a guy in this
company

77
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,550
saying people you open this link this
guy would try to resolve that thing

78
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,540
the domain name for this and it would
break the fed's that record and was it

79
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,070
Fed does this accord the DNS solely your

80
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,590
effects have been those being a so when
it tries to bars this eckhardt

81
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,650
at this point the well if you do would
be exploited

82
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,030
and the DNS overturning on this system
Woodcrest

83
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,920
a simple as that

84
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,960
somewhat the important thing what you
want to know where u is

85
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,810
that only the DNS solo service they're
designing on the

86
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:12,300
machine would press not be in bed
operating system because it's not the

87
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,460
gonna lower than that ability it's just
have a little maybe

88
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,220
in the application more application
there

89
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,280
their DNS server application not be
gonna burn would be

90
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,320
so let's like to do something more
harmful where we would try to bring or

91
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:26,650
the

92
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,960
being on the end sa1 let's try to
exploit the when the pain goes gonna

93
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,020
any questions on MC dental 58

94
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,430
now so this brings us to another example

95
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:43,560
next example of MS 11 or 77 MSN 0727 was
released

96
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,670
last year in October 2011 and what they
did is

97
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:52,910
it fix for 100 is in Windows gonna again
if you look at the advisory

98
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:56,300
vendors don't give out a lot of big is
it just says that

99
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,290
a ms leno's on this and fixes anymore go
to

100
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:04,210
exit a and elevation of privilege when
that ability because

101
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,780
of in Senate as imports that is if they
don't give you a lot of new ideas what

102
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,970
bet on the bill was not sanitizer things
like that

103
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:14,820
so for this stock would be concentrating
on CV 2011 1985

104
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,730
and it was an elevation of privilege
when that if need be and

105
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:22,690
this is what the desserts from but were
def look-alikes

106
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:26,900
sick those you did that on many function
that looks suspicious to it

107
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,980
somebody else even a suspicious plus
plus

108
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,170
someone like this teens again and even
then the lake in the previous example

109
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,460
that we saw

110
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,370
only four functions were teens but if
you look at this thing

111
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:43,570
in this bed them many functions that
were teens any guesses why

112
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:50,570
the number of changes are so much

113
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,699
sorry

114
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:56,500
yeah

115
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,470
that's correct so we saw in the puppy vs
one Microsoft only fix to win the peace

116
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:05,100
but in this bed Microsoft Fix for when
the deputies

117
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,350
so obviously because they've fixed a lot
of things that are high chances that

118
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,040
they need to modify luck do lots of
Gordon this

119
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:17,000
and hasn't left in December so what I do
know they started looking at e2 one

120
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,300
function one by one

121
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,350
and then I saw that there were three
functions that

122
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,820
all stocked with and the use that FN and
the use that FN

123
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:29,790
the function starting with Andy's that
FN and all the court in this that will

124
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,500
make the dysfunctions all the scene

125
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,210
so basically whatever team was made to
one function was basically got be based

126
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,030
in all these functions

127
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:42,990
so far on and this is what we are I did
as I took one of the functioning

128
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:48,020
NP use that FN I in a box spring can
everyone see this

129
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,610
there okay so

130
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,960
whatever defenses is that for this
function:

131
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,440
there was a poor drafting a cover up in
section was added earlier

132
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,250
and there was this would block of code
that was that was aided by this new

133
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,240
version of the fight

134
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,479
so let's try to analyze it so what we
see is you stock combating

135
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,659
each instruction one by one and there
was this one for additional instruction

136
00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:15,430
that was a big

137
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,530
gone bad EC X ffff

138
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:22,699
FFF if this movement of efforts and a
call

139
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:29,699
and another block of cold weather so
let's see what is going on

140
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:33,770
we know that combat dcx ever fifth was
added

141
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:38,990
if you see the instructional your mooie
CX

142
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,539
ABB less on goes you know this is
basically the what there was a false

143
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,150
document foster this function

144
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:48,930
was moved to the CX e6 is then compared
with this one went off efforts this is

145
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,160
nothing but -1

146
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,240
whose those compliments -1 and

147
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,220
if it does not if it is ever effect is
-1

148
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,920
the whole it goes into this block and
calls a function with

149
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,540
said users said record

150
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,839
so let's see what's going on

151
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,389
ECS is compared with my if they CX is my
-1

152
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:16,399
a function call is made said lost data
and function

153
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,589
said said lasted a bit court

154
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:24,339
50 578 as and then victim so what is
basically going on in your eyes

155
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:27,680
and the and bachelors in there was no
comparison leg

156
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,730
compare the fullest argument with -1 or
anything

157
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:35,069
whatever argument this pasta that
function it happily accepted that

158
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:35,720
argument

159
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,050
and it continued processing but in the
bed was in what is happening is

160
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,920
the bed was in is explicitly taking the
first argument of the function

161
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,600
it is comparing it with -1 if it is
found to be -1 it does not happy

162
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,500
xx an ETA and ETB is although the
function okay

163
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,230
so I didn't go live but offer research a

164
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,500
ruling on what is this a and that is
what this 57.8%

165
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,949
ages and it is a systematic or for
invalid use a hand I'll

166
00:10:03,949 --> 00:10:08,370
invalid window handle so let's try to
see what's going on

167
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:12,129
in the bed was in whatever is the
argument

168
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:16,089
it doesn't get it just accepts it
processes there and goes out

169
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:20,230
but in the other in the bed wasn't what
it is trying to do is it is taking the

170
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,250
first argument

171
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:25,180
comparing it with -1 if this bond to be
-1 it does not have peace

172
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,639
xx an ETA and bizarre so how do we
explain this one

173
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:35,639
everything

174
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,590
so let me go again

175
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,420
in the end vez was in

176
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,920
whatever is the first argument accept
the argument

177
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,780
processes there and it is happy whatever
is the Aug in the bed was and what did

178
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,840
this thing to do is

179
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,170
it begs the first argument but the spot
for this function:

180
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,900
compares it with -1 if it is found to be
-1

181
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,960
does not happy and have sex and had a
and B is out so if you were to expect

182
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,870
this one that would be how would you

183
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,600
sorry

184
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,009
yeah that's correct so we know that
whatever is the

185
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:22,560
so the bed was is looking for this
argument is not happy when it does -1 if

186
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,329
you like to expect this when they're
ready

187
00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:29,470
just said this argument to be -1 and see
what happens so how do we explain this

188
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,279
argument has to be -1

189
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,040
and there was a little hand when I did a
google search about it

190
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,870
excess it xx and Adam before it bizarre

191
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:44,350
eg this a the endeavor to sectors

192
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:49,300
invalid user in relevant to handle so
this gives me a bit of an idea that

193
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,079
possible I have who said this argument
to be -1 and

194
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:56,230
this explicitly telling you that I'm not
happy because

195
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:02,170
it is an invalid window and so what you
do is be know that this gives you a

196
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,870
little hand that before us argument

197
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:08,040
is off by bindle handle so

198
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,189
this is a proof of concept but I miss
Lana sands and

199
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:14,249
just two lengths of court landed on it
your windows

200
00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:19,650
a.m. machine and it will be abuse going
on that

201
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:26,650
so yeah and the questions

202
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,139
sorry

203
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:35,840
yeah

204
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,000
I have a good blog about this I think I
have a link to that goal

205
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,010
so because what happens is if you see

206
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:47,910
this hour function and data and to use
that ended boxing

207
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,990
this is a good move them to new cannot
does give it a coordinating

208
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,450
so you need to know how to reach that
function how to take that from

209
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:57,810
so decks I have a blog about their

210
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,090
just google it and it is a pretty much
everything what you need to know

211
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,799
about this thing

212
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:06,650
any other questions

213
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,940
okay so what we have seen under this
point the point like which I want to

214
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,760
highlight is

215
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,570
that this technique is really very
simple and what

216
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:18,640
benefits investors could do is they
could use this technique to develop that

217
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,190
own customers place and they are just
not limited to the exploits that data

218
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,610
available from next like backs

219
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:26,840
they could create their own
proof-of-concept invested and engage

220
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,480
them again

221
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,260
and use them in that engagements sort

222
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,610
done so did this technique is not this
only useful for

223
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:39,130
I penetration testers but there are
these bunch of guys who are already

224
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,440
using this technique

225
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,590
and can anyone guess while woo

226
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:50,019
are already using this technique

227
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:54,560
so yeah my daughter's my daughters they
are the ones who are using this

228
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,449
technique a lot

229
00:13:55,449 --> 00:13:59,410
it is very helpful for them so that they
know what the Fed these but is that

230
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,290
really is what they would do is the
Woodside

231
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:04,870
doing buying the new defaming and I'll
try to come up with ex-wife's

232
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:09,779
so that they could use it so a very good
example of this is Ms Leno

233
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:12,930
9 a.m. est residue 04 it was the lease

234
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:16,500
in January 2000 and what did it is it
fixed to

235
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,839
when their abilities in Windows when
handling the

236
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,900
all maybe five me defies

237
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:27,110
even know what the media file is a these
are like really small music by is

238
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:32,560
so far the stock has been concentrating
on C 2012 003

239
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,700
and it's a remote code execution
vulnerability

240
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,700
then boxing the modified so the nature
of this when they begin which makes it

241
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,340
more

242
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,940
nuclear do for them on that all it does
is first of all it's a remote code

243
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,240
execution vulnerability

244
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,010
and secondly a whenever

245
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:53,960
if if I send you a link which has a MIDI
file your browser will try to parse it

246
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,190
that in there

247
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:59,430
so basically if they're not bad as in if
I send you a link to an exploit and you

248
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,020
click on it

249
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,890
basically you are owned by that thing

250
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:06,480
so let's do a buying any dipping

251
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,470
again you see that they would if they
resist to fix this one and maybe

252
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:15,250
Microsoft did not deny just changed one
function to fix this when the media

253
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,640
all the functions look identical in
there was only one function that was

254
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,220
teens

255
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,420
let's try to analyze what the function
change was

256
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,670
for the function name as me D out play
next volume

257
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:30,040
we don't get on the functioning and

258
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,280
if a stock tumbling each in section one
by one you see that there was

259
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,400
this one and business section that was a
and you

260
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,610
and the media comma seven if age so
let's try to analyze what this

261
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:45,970
and be a comma 7f ages so what is
happening away you know is

262
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,120
so that is this one

263
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,070
BD was that was moved to be in and it is
combat handed

264
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:56,410
and then logical and was then against us

265
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:59,629
7f eight so what is happening alia is

266
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:02,790
vendela that isn't what and logical end
does is

267
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:06,709
if the value in BN is less than seven if

268
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:09,959
age it is it it is kept to that value

269
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:13,749
but fatah if the value of BL is more
than seven if it

270
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:19,850
it is you use to 07 if age so what's
happening only it is in and bed was in

271
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:23,079
there was no standardization whatsoever

272
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:27,860
anything you boss to a it was happily
accepting it but in the bed was in

273
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,220
what is happening is Microsoft is
explicitly taking one video but

274
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,579
and it is not happy then effect if the
vid

275
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:39,189
if that the the value of that variable
respond to be greater than seven if it's

276
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:41,879
it is used to seven if age

277
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:45,060
so this is the only thing that was made
by the function

278
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:49,080
so what was the change had just taken
for a video but it is

279
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,230
if we it does not want this value to be
greater than seven if it

280
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:59,230
so how do you expect this one

281
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,500
this rate

282
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,339
so

283
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,360
me know that that is this one really bad
with the bad just trying to take

284
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,830
and it does not and it is setting a
limit to it so if you want to explain

285
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:15,710
this when they really

286
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:20,750
just possibility that is bigger than the
slimming make does all this for

287
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:27,180
on this red a heart goes out this value
which it was trying to check is the Nord

288
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,240
number but I'm leader

289
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,320
for to me to fight now I don't have an
exploit

290
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,760
funded I do have an expert but I can
assure you because

291
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,040
its unmodified so if the NDA's

292
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,810
uninterested to send me an email and it
and be happy to send you a

293
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:47,910
a proof-of-concept expect for this

294
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,970
so guess what

295
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,370
so this page was the isn't the end of
January 2007

296
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:56,910
any guesses when was the flushed model
that found in the white trying to

297
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:01,460
exploit this when the meeting

298
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,470
thing

299
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:08,260
couldn't sorry denser in for my betta

300
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,890
autos it is not just they don't want to
crash %uh system

301
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,950
they want to get to the level good
execution obviously

302
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:18,500
if got a good with their different
things you could have a proof of concept

303
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,090
of all this in just one day

304
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:23,540
like to get reliable court execution it
would take you a lot of them

305
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:27,780
it would take you some time to develop a
sophisticated expect still do it

306
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,960
it like to do it any guesses all

307
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,020
long would be big okay so the Fostex my
dad was found in the white

308
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,660
trying to expect this one then maybe was
fun on 26th of January 2000

309
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:44,320
so just a minute next 16 days after the
bet was the least that is already on my

310
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:44,870
mind

311
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,890
life Frank expect this one on the day

312
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:51,120
even this is a privately reported
vulnerabilities soul be

313
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,890
before the end of January than one way
there was no exploit our

314
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:58,800
would just as soon as the fed's israelis
within 16 days

315
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,940
there was a moderate all that was trying
to exploit the system

316
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,860
BR system so back to bed just some files

317
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,410
so what we have seen under this point is

318
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:14,140
this technique is useful for are
penetration testers

319
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:17,830
my daughters are already trying to
explain use this technique

320
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:21,690
but what about security sensors ok
indeed breakthrough

321
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:25,770
how can they come up with new when the
bees if you guys are trying to do when

322
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,840
they begin the search how could you come
up with new when there it is just based

323
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,250
on

324
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:35,800
security badges so dun sa be hot but
this bed is I'm not always done right

325
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,230
these badges: I suppose to fix when the
abilities but

326
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:44,130
the often into his new when the body's
immune system a very good example of

327
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:49,830
love this this PHP 5.3 playing nine I it
was released in January 2012

328
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:56,490
and a it fixed a

329
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:01,020
the ps3 520 19 it was the least to fix
our hair school is in denial of service

330
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,440
when we did does anyone

331
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:09,440
and you have any idea what they are has
clinton also responded ideas

332
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:10,730
okay

333
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,350
so

334
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:15,980
has collision denial of service when
nobody it is it was a very

335
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:20,560
popular one little bitty and the like it
affected many

336
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,720
are

337
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,880
it affected many web servers love

338
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:31,040
even Microsoft had a bad for this and
miss if my cuz I fixed it with MC 11:01

339
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,490
100 on also there was a

340
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:37,590
the badge for don't get fixated

341
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:41,370
like so what basically a hassle is in
denial of service when the body is

342
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,799
what you do is you have a Feb so

343
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:50,160
and you just bombarded with lots and
lots of Postmedia but watson also post

344
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,510
here

345
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,610
so venue set do a post the

346
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:57,710
egress what happens at these labels are
stored on the web server in a form of

347
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:58,520
untested

348
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,850
for the idea is to send you lots and
lots of I'll post videos

349
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:07,770
hoping that these videos will cause a
hash collisions on the vessel

350
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:12,260
and factor being on the web so it was a
very popular when we get affected all

351
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,110
the that sellers

352
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:17,950
so how did BSB 5131 n fix this one every
day is

353
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:21,280
then

354
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:28,220
that

355
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:35,220
Chris of Chris

356
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:38,270
you
