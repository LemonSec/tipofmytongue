1
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,379
for first let mine

2
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:15,900
so my name is christopher allison
currently under principal mala scientist

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,769
in r saying that witness

4
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,710
i'm also the author of a

5
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,119
mountain peaks and martin it's it's
currently out right now it's available

6
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:25,369
in amazon

7
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:31,449
search for my kids college fund so by
once again

8
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:34,520
and that bass adventures before i joined
our say

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,420
i was with them by the forty years from
two thousand ninety two thousand twelve

10
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,420
at security thousand six two thousand
nine

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,630
trend micro nineteen ninety two thousand
six so i was fortunate enough to after

12
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:46,710
college

13
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:53,710
i went directly to trend micro so my
first job was to be pressing matter

14
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,680
and uh... you can file in that regard at
helps usually don't with stuff they're

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,240
usually just announcement

16
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,700
so but still

17
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,180
some things might be interested

18
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,670
so it's the end of the talk you select i
would put the long agenda

19
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:08,740
but uh...

20
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,980
i think it's much much easier just to
put the dating the top

21
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,820
and that is to understand the trek
ecosystem

22
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,530
so what is a political system

23
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,370
uh... the way i do find it it's an
interdependence you're different

24
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,010
technologies

25
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,930
and the people behind him

26
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,349
so it's similar to a real ecosystem

27
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:29,490
yes and non living component and also
giving component

28
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,240
man

29
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,530
abiotic and none of the out the
components

30
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,770
so it's almost similar to that one

31
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,979
but the most interesting things really
see

32
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:40,409
is the technical elements

33
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:43,010
so what are these these are the
deployment technology

34
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:47,159
uh... by the way i'll try to speak fast
because i have to be demonstrations

35
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,770
i'll try to fit it into a into our
country

36
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,110
to the diplomatic argue that's the one
that the police the maori can be and

37
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:58,210
email before it was a floppy disk you
can be a usb drive

38
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,560
it could be a compromise tragic any
technology that will deploy maverick

39
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,680
assistant

40
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,320
and the mother installer uh... no matter
where right now

41
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,830
that different components and one of the
component is the mother installer the

42
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,889
mother install itself

43
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:15,519
is a separate technology

44
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:20,739
so some of you guys when you get an
infected the korea and email with edna

45
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:24,449
it diminishes attachment usually back up
action it is not the milder but the

46
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:27,159
deployment technology that installs them
out there

47
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,499
in the system

48
00:02:29,499 --> 00:02:33,369
and get them out of a certain domains
some analysts are serving the mains this

49
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:36,569
are websites for our network resources

50
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:39,989
that contains the mantra itself or
updates of the maori

51
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:43,509
so i'll make their uh...

52
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:45,769
demonstrate that

53
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:50,789
and a common command and control so
uh... the easier it is for the time cmc

54
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:55,139
our command and control it's a resource
it's not just the website of the main

55
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:57,490
but commanding control piece a resource

56
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,149
that when you change it

57
00:02:59,149 --> 00:03:03,029
it would be influenced demolished
behavior

58
00:03:03,029 --> 00:03:07,079
and the drops in drop zone is read this
golden information

59
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:10,529
is being dropped in the local hard drive
and email

60
00:03:10,529 --> 00:03:12,919
or the main

61
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,850
and of course the amount of components

62
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:19,189
decide uh... things that infect their
host

63
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:21,789
so that's a lot of them in action

64
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:25,349
first it starts with the deployment
technology can be and email uninfected

65
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:26,580
usb

66
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,499
are for or a floppy drive

67
00:03:29,499 --> 00:03:34,589
from from their usually contains the
mouth installer

68
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:38,249
and a crunch amount installer uh... we
have the proper

69
00:03:38,249 --> 00:03:40,489
and the downloaded the dropper

70
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:44,039
it's uh... usually it's bigger in size
because the mother component is already

71
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,959
included in that file

72
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,549
while a download there

73
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:51,449
it's very small and the fire and amount
of files are not bitter but instead he

74
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:52,639
checks

75
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,269
and now they're serving the main

76
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:57,439
for them out of clouds and that
downloads it'd infected host

77
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,479
so it's that time

78
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:01,079
thick installing flash

79
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:05,259
yahoo downloading let's say sixty four k
b afula

80
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:09,629
a file but then many executed it would
go to uh... get adobe dot com and

81
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:14,449
unequal download all of the uh... adobe
files

82
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:19,400
so usually before installation it would
first check but it isn't updated malware

83
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,839
in the mouth for serving the main if
there is non

84
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,270
then uh... it would

85
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:28,539
not do anything unless if it's an
dropper if it's a dropper

86
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:30,800
you could just install it it pass

87
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,460
uh... what it's been carrying

88
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,889
and one secret installed the mouth of
components the matter components

89
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:42,520
acctually uh... different executables

90
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,330
or it could be different files

91
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,360
led them outta libc before ring
everything use combined into one file

92
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,240
so if you get infected

93
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,900
he does he want filed but nowadays it's
a whole different story

94
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,620
everything is eh...

95
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,380
is being broken down into different
components in this different components

96
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,439
of different functions

97
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:04,419
but that the disappears for the
attackers that they put you see the

98
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:05,989
update one component

99
00:05:05,989 --> 00:05:10,479
without disrupting the whole infection

100
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,520
so we had the configuration file usually
the configuration file contains the

101
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,800
directive

102
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,599
or the network the solar system albany

103
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:21,370
and it also contains delete this
commander

104
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,909
from the sea and sea

105
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:24,360
we also have get back component

106
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,169
that that component can be a keylogger
can be a keylogger

107
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:31,780
it could be a trojan it depends on the
uh... directive of the attacker if he

108
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:35,110
just wants to steal information that
that component

109
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:39,499
could have uh... does uh... features bag
one image in q lobbying

110
00:05:39,499 --> 00:05:41,100
ran scraper

111
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,169
desktop image capture

112
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:45,649
and other information stealing

113
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:47,360
capabilities

114
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,840
there's also that he generation
component racially coldest before krups

115
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,280
if you're familiar with the harry potter

116
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,520
so uh...

117
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,449
the regeneration component usually it's
headed

118
00:05:57,449 --> 00:05:59,020
so what does

119
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,170
it depends on how how long

120
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:06,090
it's configured it could check every
hour everyday every book up

121
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,360
they did the mallory still do it if it's
not date with the story

122
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,509
that's why we call the regeneration
component

123
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:16,009
and uh... of course the more popular
with the component it's a component but

124
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,479
make sure the mouth race not seen

125
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,409
in the system

126
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:24,360
and the one it's becoming popular fee
for the past

127
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,580
five seven news is that what agent

128
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,319
dot blot agent itself is the one that
added

129
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,820
necro capabilities

130
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,880
the malware that they've been seen
before

131
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,900
it's the one responsible

132
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,919
four are communicating to the mouth or
serving the main the check

133
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,849
whether they're updates

134
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:44,249
on the mouth a if there are two dates

135
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:46,749
let's say that actor wants to uh...

136
00:06:46,749 --> 00:06:49,069
sending u and you command

137
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:51,980
the buck agent checks for that and any
updates

138
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,060
the like components one of the component
e to show the updates as the

139
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,610
configuration file

140
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,300
another thing uh...

141
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,680
it does is that it sends status reports
to the command and control

142
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,249
usually when you get infected the first
thing the mother will do is collect all

143
00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:12,819
of the system information you have and
then send it out and say

144
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:14,899
and disinfected this machine

145
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:18,379
located in michigan big mac i_d_ days

146
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:22,060
in media stuff kind of programs
installed this uh...

147
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,449
version the browser installed

148
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:29,469
and of course this year so it's a sense
commands back to be a through the

149
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:32,360
malware

150
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,289
and usually the mallory so information
stealer

151
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:38,349
it would need to have drop zones

152
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:39,710
usually three kinds

153
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,059
we have here

154
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:42,529
local harddisk

155
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:45,300
the other email and yet the drop is on
the main

156
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,509
uh... the local harddisk before

157
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,789
spyware

158
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:52,099
it's drop zones the local hard drive

159
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:55,740
the main advantage of this is that uh...
it's very easy to get

160
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,639
that stolen information

161
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:59,999
but of course you have to have axis

162
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,360
did the physical machine

163
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,209
suits you could get that that
information

164
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:05,339
but of course it's

165
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:09,419
this is good if you are a aspiring as
files or your kids

166
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:11,669
but if you want to meet me

167
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:14,030
spot on the other people

168
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,990
this is not a good day to do it because
then you would have to have a backer

169
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,300
component

170
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,750
debating to that machine and get all the
bills information

171
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,039
and what if you've been fected one
million people

172
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,339
it's like uh... baking in one million
pounds of their machine just to get

173
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:29,550
information

174
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,660
that's like that actress came up with
that you know

175
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,910
so uh...

176
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:37,590
they would debt all of these bits and
pieces of information send it out of

177
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,070
that packer and then you just go that's
it

178
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,910
but of course email it's not really

179
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,300
organize when it comes information

180
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,040
so what usually happens is that uh...
that darker

181
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,340
gets ten thousand email today and he
doesn't know what to do it and it's not

182
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,620
organized

183
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,240
so they came up with a a the main drop
zone

184
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,350
to become a drop zone it's similar
policy antibody and they have a they

185
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,950
would have a control panel

186
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:04,950
all of the information is collected in a
centralized server they could just bars

187
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:09,660
whatever information they need

188
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,550
so what are the

189
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,410
commonly use matter technologies uh...
we have to be i like it so mallard

190
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:19,820
before uh... when i first seemed in
usually cordoning assembly

191
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,050
but nowadays most of the malware are
created to toolkits which i will live

192
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,930
show you later in my dick demonstration

193
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,320
so the most popular disease

194
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,050
spy art

195
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:36,580
and of course armor wrinkles armored
bulls make sure that what you create

196
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,820
that cannot be detected by a v

197
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:45,150
so the more popular is this all six
silly sleeping picks them out of there

198
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,630
axia

199
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:50,859
make sure it's uh... it's different
informed of the functionality beast

200
00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:52,510
remains the same

201
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,450
so that's why when you are

202
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:58,150
when you get an infection use entity
levy

203
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,840
uh... let's hear favorite

204
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,020
eighty company unity existed but could
not be in the next day

205
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,970
still the same thing is happening and in
the sand the same thing again to a t_v_

206
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,640
and she had do providing the dissolution
in the next couple of hours but in the

207
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,370
next eight happens again

208
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:20,890
uh... why is that happening out so they
clean my uh... demonstration also

209
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,810
another popular arming police the file
joyner

210
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:28,390
so mallard before they infect files so
defect files depth and themselves to

211
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,249
that file

212
00:10:29,249 --> 00:10:32,849
safe it's a gaming file and you see
every every time somebody suspect game

213
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:34,330
to get infected

214
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:37,999
but now with a smile a don't have the
infection that can be used to have

215
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:39,480
because uh...

216
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,760
probably the mouth of a writer's are
becoming they see

217
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,360
so what you can do see could have a file
joyner respect the infection routine

218
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,720
unical

219
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,120
so if you do if you create the trojan

220
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,340
yet a very popular execute the bull

221
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,820
joined them together

222
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,180
shared them and uh... file-sharing side
saying here

223
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,510
or just send them out the friends

224
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,160
and you have malware

225
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,300
that's backed

226
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,440
in a very popular execute the blended
and danny could be easy for them to

227
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,580
uh...

228
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,950
executed

229
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,080
and of course all of them out of the
samples

230
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:18,410
solo did this pools mme wrinkles old
mala samples even colds can become

231
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,320
undetectable again

232
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:27,240
so uh... i collect uh... recycling mala
aguila bs impatient

233
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,230
it was in that book on rain i showed you
know

234
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:33,200
how old code stan goldman was being
recycled

235
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,310
i call it uh... green malware

236
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,110
made from one hundred percent recycled
ma'am

237
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,380
it still works

238
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,820
because most of the technologies there

239
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,170
at their main concern is uh... just a
deploy and nobody could exit and then

240
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:50,490
you can still do its job

241
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,420
as i just mentioned the old man records

242
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,770
now what are the comedy abuse
technologies

243
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,310
so uh...

244
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,930
but don't forget technical components of
malware

245
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,340
if it's purely bad it's too easy to take
down

246
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,359
because new

247
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:07,060
nothing will get their affected by it

248
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,590
so that's a uh...

249
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,330
i have a server

250
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,650
and uh... indentation company

251
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,129
batiste doing bad stuff

252
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:16,010
if they discovered that surveyor

253
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:18,670
they could just take it down and uh...

254
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,970
that affect me significantly

255
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:24,850
but what if i use if i abuse common
thick non-state email

256
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,809
email he could send

257
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:29,060
email attachment to strata fee

258
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,560
uh... we're going to come

259
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,380
msn account or whatever

260
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,820
send about bacon

261
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,320
bacon identified that you know he used

262
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,340
but they cannot believe the breakdown
google

263
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,180
aura

264
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,150
or hotmail

265
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,910
and other things the web hosting

266
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,250
god most webhosting spree

267
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,240
so what you can do is you just need a
new email address

268
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,810
and that's it you could create a free
web hosting account

269
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,770
even if it gives you plenty fight to
make a plea space

270
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,570
that twenty five make is already enough

271
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,430
the host

272
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,320
multiple malware

273
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:10,140
the decisive let's say for five hundred
chibi

274
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,790
and on my list and also this is

275
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,250
the bad guys

276
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:19,330
also have what they call a quality
assurance they make sure what they

277
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,250
create

278
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,410
it's not but that could be v

279
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,200
so there lots of services out there we
have the uh...

280
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,540
no buyers thanks and also we had their
school

281
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,240
but not they don't use buyers total
because once descend about the vice

282
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,530
total for checking

283
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:37,510
that gets distributed to eighty
companies which defeats their purpose

284
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:41,200
but need nobody spends this afternoon an
option that lets us do not distribute

285
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,710
your sample

286
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:46,630
but of course we're not sure whether
they're really not distributing it

287
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:52,470
so sometimes they have their own
implementation with dissapear pool

288
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,020
forgot to bring it

289
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,610
where you get the sock election of
different atvs

290
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,180
all of them are uh...

291
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,230
are cracked

292
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,750
and they use that

293
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,110
and sometimes when they can read their
creation

294
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,950
that saved a target being company

295
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:10,040
uh... you seeing anti virus b

296
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,350
you'd be subject to a it's depicted by
active i_c_i_ devised a anti virus deep

297
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:18,500
it's not detected by activites be then
for them that's okay

298
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,600
buddy they just need a small window of
time to plant whatever they need there

299
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:29,120
so that they can have access and they
can do anything

300
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,400
also social networks

301
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,119
soaked with their that there can be used
as a c and c

302
00:14:34,119 --> 00:14:37,790
which i could uh... and we ought to be a
mistake maker

303
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,180
and of course face book

304
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,850
if you have friends that they have on
their walled at cesa just one and i

305
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,570
tried to detect obviously

306
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,600
chances are they in fact it and then
when you click on that link it'll post

307
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,170
on your wall and it will post messages
in defensible

308
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:56,170
that that the two pieces that that the
their stars when it comes to

309
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:59,660
disinfection vector distrust because see
what they call

310
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,530
my friend post this in

311
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,010
his or her wall

312
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:09,110
so probably take taking the time
glickman

313
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,380
and uh... one thing i've seen i've seen
this in a couple of malaise at the

314
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,000
website visitor accountingservices

315
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,190
so most malware or bought next they
would have a control panel ready and

316
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,630
they could then you make

317
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:24,850
how many hosts are infected and from
each country's

318
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:28,410
but some of them don't have that luxury
suv these displease serviced on nine

319
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:29,980
counts online com

320
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,620
athlete gives you a piece of quote that
you could at their website

321
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,250
so that whatever visitor website

322
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,480
uh... the location of the visit there
would be recorded

323
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,050
and all of that uh... groovy is
presented to you

324
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,590
but online com

325
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:48,850
so what one-mile walk one mala right
they did is that he created the uh...

326
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,990
a website which is benign

327
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,240
there's nothing there but because the
online

328
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,200
comp code to whoever visits that website

329
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,390
information of the visit there will be
recorded

330
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,620
and what you did

331
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,210
he smiled where when it's active in the
system

332
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:07,430
it would happily uh... activate a
process of internet explorer

333
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,779
the basic that website

334
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:12,590
it's just the process not the window
seat don't see anything

335
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:16,509
so every time get visits that website it
collects the information

336
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:17,960
of your machine

337
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,990
so what he does is that he just open
seas online

338
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,730
found account

339
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,740
and then you would see their

340
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,410
uh... ten thousand from the u_s_

341
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,079
one thousand from china

342
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:30,650
three hundred from russia and

343
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,280
from wherever countries

344
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,640
those host come from

345
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,540
so he has a control panel

346
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,629
pretty clear that we see how many hosts

347
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,700
are infected and from the two countries

348
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,600
and he did it even

349
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:48,600
do anything he didn't even in destiny
technical effort company

350
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:49,889
the human elements

351
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:53,829
supported and a technology w months that
they're profiting and uh... providing

352
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:55,810
all of this technology

353
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,850
we have to sponsor

354
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,170
the technology providers

355
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,890
the cyber crime boss

356
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,940
the money mules

357
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,150
and uh...

358
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:09,809
those for willing to break down

359
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:13,570
but said the sponsor the sponsor it can
be a government

360
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,590
commercial organization

361
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:18,940
non-commercial organization activist
groups usually this is the individual

362
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,410
need the money

363
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,750
is the individual

364
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,250
that would say okay i need to do this

365
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,170
but i want to be uh...

366
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:33,730
discreet about it citebase somebody else
to do it

367
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:37,170
and then the technology providers the
one i showed before those technology

368
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:40,740
providers could be divided into
different groups

369
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,930
the smartest of them all at the mouth
characteristics of the original maverick

370
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,190
creators

371
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:49,570
before in the nineties you could apne
doctor these people in our cec channel

372
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:53,130
saying i'll give you get some of the
money can you break me just now

373
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,980
but of course they got smart because
some of them get arrested abbott and a

374
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,470
couple conference

375
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:01,590
radar last against uh... underwriting

376
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,640
said they came up with gets

377
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,820
so uh...

378
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,140
now they come unto christ their skills

379
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,790
by selling gets

380
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,190
so you don't get to interact with them

381
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,320
the just provide the key

382
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,930
the website and say okay just pay me
this amount of money

383
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,570
through western union i'll give you
access to the kit or if you have already

384
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,450
been dot indicate

385
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,600
i'll give you a pc did uh...

386
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,890
activate

387
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:29,570
all of the functionality setback

388
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:33,910
and then the deployment providers the
deployment providers they're the ones

389
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,100
latin provide

390
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,169
the things

391
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:37,970
to deploy the malware

392
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:41,560
so some of these are also executables
that's one thing you notice when you get

393
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,260
infected being exicted to file

394
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,320
suddenly disappears

395
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,760
in your system but then you get infected

396
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,730
the reasoning behind that is that that
it doesn't want to leave any case

397
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:57,860
because that piece of software can be
sold over and over and over again

398
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,050
it can be played different kinds of
malware

399
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:05,140
so what did whoever owns that technology
also wants

400
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:09,330
system allen stalder to be undetected
because if it gets defected

401
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,340
nobody knew

402
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:16,990
bidyut deployment technology from him
anymore

403
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,990
and of course the bottler master

404
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:22,940
so i'll be aqui often hear that there
aren't bought mcmaster

405
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,570
bought me a control their balking at

406
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:26,840
operate

407
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,050
so uh...

408
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:32,320
it could be an individual or it can be a
group of people

409
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,180
so you should be a partner operator is
someone was actively operating are

410
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,240
controlling the barton

411
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,440
he could probably just have a slice of
the button at the spa be someone who

412
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,559
dissented uh...

413
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,070
that's a one thousand infected machines

414
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:51,200
so that by skoda bought neck operator
the guy who really owns

415
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,270
the whole bought net

416
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:57,700
is called the bar master

417
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,130
and incidents provided is sarah once you
provide

418
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,460
the students even it comes to their
network

419
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,020
uh... resources

420
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,299
so uh...

421
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:12,340
some of them the more popular ones are
about the cause of bullet-proof hosting

422
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,159
worrying

423
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:16,789
anybody can do anything in that
particular hosting company

424
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:20,870
ice not the hosting company gets paid
they don't really care what you put in

425
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:25,060
in their hosting services credits
malicious or not they really don't care

426
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,450
and most of the cell

427
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,950
bulletproof companies or domain hosting
company's

428
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,020
undertake it outside the u_s_

429
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,780
there's one happily that was uh...

430
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,560
redman ice in advance and they said
there was one

431
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,620
he was a russian student

432
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,640
what that pay a bulletproof hosting
company

433
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:49,929
but then the f_b_i_ directing him and he
got arrested

434
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:52,149
what about the uh... the widest mansion

435
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:55,279
sometimes and getting ahead of myself

436
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:59,169
and of course the crime boss the crime
what is the one that i missed the show

437
00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:02,340
usually most of the seller people

438
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,760
that technology providers

439
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,370
most of them they don't know each other

440
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:10,270
only the crime boss know who to contact

441
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,480
so some of these they operate

442
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,100
sometimes through email through chat

443
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,790
so their level of collaboration he's
really really good

444
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,680
they don't even know each other

445
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,820
so the crime boss

446
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,240
speak up puts them all together

447
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,780
said the sponsor

448
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:30,299
could get what he needs so the sponsor
athlete base the crime boss whichever

449
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:34,159
show later how the monies room

450
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,000
and of course there's also job for us

451
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,010
they cut the money meals decide
unsuspecting

452
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:44,570
that uh... i think they have a
legitimate work from home job but in

453
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,539
fact there

454
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:46,920
working

455
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:52,730
for uh... cybercrime uh...

456
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:55,050
the maverick on them

457
00:21:55,050 --> 00:22:00,149
so usually uh... when it comes to uh...
the flow of money

458
00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:02,500
it started a stolen information

459
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,470
so this told information we sell
artistes are sold to the public

460
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:10,360
or sometimes sold to a special at the
last bascially buyer

461
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,750
with jess will have some need of that
information

462
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,290
in the mouth on the meeting for the
stolen information useful you work but

463
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:20,230
the buyers willing to pay

464
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,600
so uh... let credit card numbers

465
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,570
it's very easy to get credit card
numbers nowadays that before

466
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:30,880
then you seek vetoed underground you
could uh... cdom selling one credit card

467
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,170
number for ten dollars not biggest
seller consents five cents ten cents

468
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:37,130
they even gave you free sample

469
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,680
first and numbers every evening wear

470
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,600
by the rest for dis amount of money

471
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,419
and the sponsor he placed the cyber
crime boss mississauga crumbles

472
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:52,670
it's like um... leverage if you're
familiar vida bedecked cbs

473
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,279
subcommittee happens there

474
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:58,110
cyber crime boss similar to that one

475
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,799
and then the cyber crime boss

476
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:02,750
spreads the money around to different
technology providers

477
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,240
of course he gets a profit

478
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,170
and sometimes the technology providers
depending on the arrangement

479
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:12,920
sometimes they worked exclusively we
decide to crime boss

480
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,210
or sometimes they go under independent
ventures

481
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,570
they could sell their kid's uh...

482
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:21,150
to uh... to anyone last the money

483
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,220
or they could

484
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:26,370
probably won't be died inside the crime
bosses

485
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,810
so how is uh...

486
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:30,830
stolen and they come unto christ

487
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:33,159
so we have stolen data

488
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:34,730
it's advertised

489
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,500
usually uh... it's sts

490
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,390
impact their forums

491
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,679
or in place bid

492
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:43,120
and then somebody buys it

493
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,230
and the payment is processed by

494
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,650
common people

495
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,440
uh... these are the money meals

496
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,270
so if you get that email saying uh... if
you have a bank account

497
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:54,279
and uh... he can work

498
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:57,980
to always have been a process payment
you get that defied person

499
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:01,669
tans aside at some i mean you scheme

500
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:03,790
and any dispute lies that their

501
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:07,070
since day using your bank account accept
payment

502
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,800
and any lead off in their bank account
diesel resting in miami beach nobody can

503
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,070
now based

504
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:17,390
probably just get supplies and f_b_i_
come knocking on your door because your

505
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:22,390
bank account is being used for fraud

506
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:27,010
and there was a payments are collected
it's sent to get back

507
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:30,720
now household in uh... advertising still
in beta is quite easy if you have google

508
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,250
you could just uh... search this dumps
made a site uh... column base been dot

509
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,080
com

510
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,580
then you could see this

511
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:44,320
so one u_s_ visa master four dollars
comics discovery four dollars

512
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,810
and the seller haven't you know all-star
u_n_ yelled at the home that that is

513
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:51,030
basically numbered why a m

514
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:55,000
so if you want to contact in the best
number did he do it

515
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,240
and even says there we are both

516
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,840
here to make my case i respect most
likely respected let's get back together

517
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,649
in god we trust

518
00:25:04,649 --> 00:25:09,330
at least at affects sam

519
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:12,909
now how do we recruit how do they
recruit finance managers usually you get

520
00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:14,780
opposing like this

521
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:18,880
sometimes not through email but through
legitimate websites

522
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:25,880
they would even up uh... sometimes
bostick in monster our hot jobs

523
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:33,090
but chances are if you see something
like this it's a manual

524
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,550
so that's it for the presentation again
you can follow me to face book linkedin

525
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,620
anup tops

526
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:47,620
now let's go to define stuff began

527
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,030
we depend on my internet

528
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,929
tous

529
00:25:54,929 --> 00:26:00,240
this year

530
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,340
so as i mentioned before dictates

531
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,770
some of us would would uh... that the
statement from our uh... baby vendors

532
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:11,980
that that we've received fifty five
thousand unique samples today

533
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:16,640
or for the past year there were twenty
million unique samples

534
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,010
but basically the way did you find
unique he still has his

535
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:24,220
and that's a good to me it's not that's
not a good day to define uniqueness

536
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,560
nicolas what bitmap what that patents do
right now is that

537
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,720
date apne papa make the creation of
malware

538
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,650
that's why some of them out to sea

539
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:36,320
sold and they really don't spend dining
and cooking etc

540
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,059
because uh... was he defected

541
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:42,809
they were just sending you one

542
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,210
but for me

543
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:48,270
this system it this is an automated
system dictates malware

544
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:53,970
i have to call this the malware factory

545
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:56,130
you have the building here

546
00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:00,120
incorrectly dot we have zero mala sample

547
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,180
fordice do this

548
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:10,180
and then it without great mala sample
for me

549
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,890
speaking to be a the resolution

550
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:20,890
messed it up this exit

551
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:10,770
so that when i was so

552
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:15,110
for these are not using a workspace
macro

553
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,580
once you move something

554
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,710
the automation

555
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:24,710
gets messed up so we have to do it again

556
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:52,910
tonight's counting for five

557
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:56,470
so what the malware right there with do
or the one who once served to have an

558
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,120
army of malware

559
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,630
you could just have one of the and
running

560
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,300
what the latest polls

561
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,210
go for a cigarette break

562
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,659
you'd probably get

563
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:09,309
let uh... thousands of malware

564
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:12,890
and then he could at that speech one of
them in separate emails and deployed

565
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:13,730
them

566
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,540
so that's why

567
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:18,320
when you get uninfected email

568
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,000
the sample that you have there in terms
of hash you wouldn't see it in any other

569
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,390
emails

570
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:28,320
so when you just identified my letter to
hash s it's already

571
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,070
a failure

572
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:34,350
and then you look at this when you look
at the forum and structure of this and

573
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:37,690
also the code it's totally different

574
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:43,860
traditional signature base won't work
anymore

575
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,860
damien

576
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:51,860
you could start this demo

577
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,320
so that's a we were able to produce

578
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:11,510
it's a one thousand sample today

579
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,519
those one thousand samples

580
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:18,340
ten p multiplied exponentially by using
an armor too

581
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:22,720
because get one from that sample crying
again and are moving to which produces

582
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,629
one thousand samples

583
00:30:24,629 --> 00:30:28,039
and in the second sample mannequin and
i'm going to which we'd also produced

584
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:29,840
another one thousand samples

585
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,510
which is totally different from each
other

586
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:36,620
and you have an army of malware that
have the same capabilities

587
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,240
but when it comes to detecting them

588
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:46,240
would be needed to be a challenge

589
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:58,280
hoops

590
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:28,110
so that i said i'm going to show is
uh... how we use com one

591
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,549
technologies

592
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:32,600
asa cmc

593
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,710
so uh... before i do that and you
connected to internet

594
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:43,710
so we could see and i and you know

595
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,039
right while we're waiting for the
internet to connect uh...

596
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:07,820
if it's actually a twitter account that

597
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,840
is used as a c and c

598
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,190
so when you look at

599
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,350
all that meets here

600
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,900
they looked normal right

601
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,020
uh... tissue around in the mail add

602
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,169
meets

603
00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:22,940
but that lady streets

604
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,100
piracy in c commands

605
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,880
that would uh...

606
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:33,880
influence the malware get sunny
intervals

607
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,510
so let's say you know you've already
created

608
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:49,610
no one million samples and you want to s

609
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,330
brenda moran

610
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:57,620
so aside from using it in the mail he
decided to embedded in a p_b_s_ fine

611
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,810
and sometimes he would go if you keep
good uh... get an and effected be

612
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:07,570
defined in an email it's an innocent
looking p defiant but wednesday executed

613
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:11,340
apne executes

614
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,559
something in their system

615
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:17,510
uh... this one's neutered visits and you
could not where it doesn't do anything

616
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,220
uh...

617
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,340
so we want to pick anybody

618
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:23,080
buttons endings and it's not really
beating itself

619
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,269
but in the real world deportee bill
itself it will be running in the

620
00:33:26,269 --> 00:33:28,440
background even

621
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,200
defeat darndest uh... if you are

622
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,110
this file

623
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,920
or close it

624
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,420
it's still there

625
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,210
so what it does is uh...

626
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:45,010
it could be used to looks fine update
print cmc

627
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,340
so to help us understand

628
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:50,779
they seem to command

629
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:54,780
that means is key words

630
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,430
for the said the keywords

631
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:02,150
said the time it ceased d ski words
third balance concert being olin g

632
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,179
innocent happy

633
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:05,450
it would do this

634
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:08,759
twitter activate the loving feature

635
00:34:08,759 --> 00:34:11,549
balance backbone von their ability

636
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:15,349
the main advantage of packing up the
ball nobility if used as an infection

637
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:19,179
vector is that it wants exclusive access
to your system

638
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:22,409
if you have a system that multiple mala
infection

639
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:25,779
running in their system it would slow
down your system and it will cost if the

640
00:34:25,779 --> 00:34:26,639
suspect

641
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,499
this that there's something going on in
your system

642
00:34:29,499 --> 00:34:33,929
the good thing about having come out
there that practice vulnerabilities

643
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:37,369
is that once a diverse engineer it you
could happen you know

644
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:39,379
how to patch that vulnerability

645
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:42,149
and then you can share it leader
software vendor

646
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:45,349
and then hope and pray that they do
something about it and that make for two

647
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:48,929
months

648
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:50,889
so that's a uh...

649
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:52,649
let's activate the fuel are being

650
00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:59,649
capability of the map

651
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:13,010
hopefully internet is fast enough

652
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:20,010
so

653
00:35:38,209 --> 00:35:40,809
so this uh... selfless design

654
00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:43,279
throughout the display a message

655
00:35:43,279 --> 00:35:45,689
instead of doing

656
00:35:45,689 --> 00:35:49,519
so this fall uh... checks this twitter
account

657
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:51,329
every five seconds

658
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:54,509
so at the time he doesn't see anything
discussed therein units in the confined

659
00:35:54,509 --> 00:36:01,509
making for an update

660
00:36:12,449 --> 00:36:14,089
alright stare

661
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:17,359
shinde

662
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:18,579
i loved it

663
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:25,579
let's keep the matter

664
00:36:27,699 --> 00:36:32,699
so i'm using sprint four g so they
should be fast

665
00:36:32,699 --> 00:36:39,699
protecting a distant you know

666
00:36:48,229 --> 00:36:55,229
that's the sixty tickets again

667
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,769
feed and noticed a

668
00:36:57,769 --> 00:37:00,359
delighting

669
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:07,359
happy day

670
00:37:07,389 --> 00:37:14,389
so let's say we want to set the malware
server

671
00:37:47,689 --> 00:37:50,729
so the main idea of this is that uh...
anything

672
00:37:50,729 --> 00:37:51,740
can be

673
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,939
a c and c

674
00:37:52,939 --> 00:37:57,369
usko hospice data and update that can be
translated them malware it can be a

675
00:37:57,369 --> 00:38:02,039
ciency

676
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:06,239
one unit sample of this is that when we
see span emails and the timing is

677
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:08,299
perfect

678
00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:09,629
for example

679
00:38:09,629 --> 00:38:12,799
when people are waiting for the iphone
fight abilities

680
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:16,639
if an amount there right there i could
just uh... monitor

681
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:18,979
apple uh... apple's web-site

682
00:38:18,979 --> 00:38:22,369
deceived as an announcement that i phone
five usa may be available

683
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:26,839
and if it this available and would
immediately activate mum my mouth where

684
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:29,229
sense pamper everyone dancing

685
00:38:29,229 --> 00:38:31,949
okay just one and i four and five

686
00:38:31,949 --> 00:38:33,339
or uh...

687
00:38:33,339 --> 00:38:36,909
you won the raffle could be first in
line with high phone five click on this

688
00:38:36,909 --> 00:38:38,989
link

689
00:38:38,989 --> 00:38:41,619
so now it's at that door

690
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:45,629
the mother's favorite is tedious and
advantage of this is that with their as

691
00:38:45,629 --> 00:38:48,109
a shortening service

692
00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:51,299
so when it comes to the main black
listing

693
00:38:51,299 --> 00:38:54,059
this is a good way to obfuscate

694
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:56,229
so uh...

695
00:38:56,229 --> 00:38:57,179
have a good

696
00:38:57,179 --> 00:39:01,889
topic on this on now u r l obfuscation
in my book the one i uh... uh... showed

697
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:06,299
you guys grenier de tocqueville even buy
for my kids

698
00:39:06,299 --> 00:39:10,389
so i have a copy but this one that you
are an office cation

699
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:14,259
some of them big issues every day calls
that the see on the internet that they

700
00:39:14,259 --> 00:39:15,679
offered for free

701
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:17,469
that we take for granted

702
00:39:17,469 --> 00:39:21,819
but when it comes to that backers that's
approved test or a pressure test for

703
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:26,429
them

704
00:39:26,429 --> 00:39:29,209
let's say you're malware s defected

705
00:39:29,209 --> 00:39:31,899
and it's a it's becoming mancini

706
00:39:31,899 --> 00:39:32,869
because uh...

707
00:39:32,869 --> 00:39:36,359
uh... researchers are picking it up the
media's picking it up

708
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:40,739
and this is at the end of the company's
deciding how do an audit in my system

709
00:39:40,739 --> 00:39:44,049
so if i'm the mother right there but i
can do is i could just be activate days

710
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:47,879
so it would be moved all traces of the
priming

711
00:39:47,879 --> 00:39:51,719
of what they want chopped down the
server dividend audit live

712
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:55,099
so what they do that they won't find
anything anymore

713
00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:57,529
and then i could just uh... i met

714
00:39:57,529 --> 00:40:00,609
to wake up again that's saying a couple
of days from now

715
00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:04,759
orono specified date next april

716
00:40:04,759 --> 00:40:05,849
or

717
00:40:05,849 --> 00:40:07,410
he could get the or

718
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:09,899
some big in the future

719
00:40:09,899 --> 00:40:12,109
so for this one

720
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:19,109
the key word is happy

721
00:40:32,759 --> 00:40:39,759
i think that's the working for that

722
00:41:01,149 --> 00:41:04,219
this is that my second ah...

723
00:41:04,219 --> 00:41:06,479
twitter account

724
00:41:06,479 --> 00:41:12,259
because it seems that uh...

725
00:41:12,259 --> 00:41:15,499
sometimes i think they have a

726
00:41:15,499 --> 00:41:19,149
we have a way of knowing that their
second user account has been used so

727
00:41:19,149 --> 00:41:26,149
many times

728
00:41:29,979 --> 00:41:36,979
so let's see if it would still actively

729
00:41:42,289 --> 00:41:44,639
it won't work

730
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:48,249
that's when the put their do the keyword
happy

731
00:41:48,249 --> 00:41:51,440
it within itself and even if you're on a
manually

732
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,049
or somebody else wants the best it in
their sandbox

733
00:41:55,049 --> 00:41:58,509
their automated sandbox it won't do
anything

734
00:41:58,509 --> 00:42:00,669
so if you did on automation

735
00:42:00,669 --> 00:42:03,609
and you have amount written like this
and you have no idea what that mattress

736
00:42:03,609 --> 00:42:04,879
capable of

737
00:42:04,879 --> 00:42:07,899
you'll get an output if nothing

738
00:42:07,899 --> 00:42:12,219
and then uh... if you had automated
systems that make sense about output

739
00:42:12,219 --> 00:42:14,509
it would make sense of nothing

740
00:42:14,509 --> 00:42:17,919
so decide the challenges that they're
facing a

741
00:42:17,919 --> 00:42:22,179
some of the researchers

742
00:42:22,179 --> 00:42:23,589
and uh...

743
00:42:23,589 --> 00:42:27,919
that's it for my presentations if you
guys have a and questions at the we

744
00:42:27,919 --> 00:42:29,200
still have

745
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,399
ten minutes or so for questions

746
00:42:32,399 --> 00:42:39,399
and apply connected

747
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:48,769
uh... this one it's very difficult to
detect

748
00:42:48,769 --> 00:42:49,759
because uh...

749
00:42:49,759 --> 00:42:53,209
even the network protocols it's similar
to a twitter

750
00:42:53,209 --> 00:42:55,119
protocol

751
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:59,079
if the kansas and the uh... network
resource

752
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:00,509
that's legitimate

753
00:43:00,509 --> 00:43:03,579
that's the challenge when it comes to
detecting the east

754
00:43:03,579 --> 00:43:06,029
and even if they did that get

755
00:43:06,029 --> 00:43:10,309
defeated ok it's you know we don't have
to source the one that cmc

756
00:43:10,309 --> 00:43:12,690
nothing's preventing them out there
right there's

757
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:15,529
that we generate on the fly

758
00:43:15,529 --> 00:43:17,160
put their names

759
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,199
that uh...

760
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:21,139
already has in his possession

761
00:43:21,139 --> 00:43:25,399
so if you guys are familiar with the
g_a_o_'s the main generation algorithm

762
00:43:25,399 --> 00:43:26,540
make conficker

763
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:29,310
it generates a fifty thousand domain
names

764
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:31,309
a day conficker c

765
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:33,809
you could also do that here it could
generate

766
00:43:33,809 --> 00:43:36,349
fifty thousand random

767
00:43:36,349 --> 00:43:38,649
or it's not clear and the best answer

768
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:41,049
disintegration behind it

769
00:43:41,049 --> 00:43:42,839
we could generate that

770
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:45,409
and then a stand-alone boo

771
00:43:45,409 --> 00:43:46,749
of that

772
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:50,920
could be in the procession of de facto
so given the ok except me by this date

773
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,979
by this time this is the one being beach
outdo by dea

774
00:43:54,979 --> 00:44:00,089
by my creations divest i decided to
teach out the down twenty-fifth day

775
00:44:00,089 --> 00:44:02,799
uh... name that it would generate

776
00:44:02,799 --> 00:44:07,589
so if i need to communicate with
indicted you step twenty-fifth eh...

777
00:44:07,589 --> 00:44:11,129
and many times the defection yet when it
comes to network depiction it would be

778
00:44:11,129 --> 00:44:11,949
hard

779
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:14,499
but of course they're served in the
rules for this

780
00:44:14,499 --> 00:44:16,929
but for example nobody's in the office

781
00:44:16,929 --> 00:44:20,989
and you see a a massive uh... get their
communication

782
00:44:20,989 --> 00:44:24,989
so that's already a telltale sign the
key here is that uh...

783
00:44:24,989 --> 00:44:27,039
you understand that threat

784
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:30,319
so if you understand that that was the
capability of the malware what it does

785
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:31,979
in the network

786
00:44:31,979 --> 00:44:38,489
that now you can always come up with a
solution for this one

787
00:44:38,489 --> 00:44:42,409
any more questions

788
00:44:42,409 --> 00:44:45,049
and by the late at night and

789
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:48,519
arce macnaughton s

790
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,969
so you could see her project works

791
00:44:50,969 --> 00:44:56,259
and then on the questions uh... thank
you for uh... listening the micro and

792
00:44:56,259 --> 00:44:58,369
hopefully i gave you something

793
00:44:58,369 --> 00:45:00,710
that you've been uh... date did you when
you go back there
