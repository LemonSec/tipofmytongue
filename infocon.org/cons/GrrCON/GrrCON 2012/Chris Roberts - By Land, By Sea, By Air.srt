1
00:00:01,339 --> 00:00:04,710
the original talk was called as you can
see by land by sea and by air

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,360
but let's on looking for me I seventy
two as it does on Monday or Tuesday

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,429
having offers than a

4
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:13,880
Monday night myself Jesse and a couple
the other guys

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,480
a huge rock thank you

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,480
they close not when are they gonna keep
the line open I can see through but it's

7
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:32,950
been iraq thank you very very much

8
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,400
so was sitting there Monday evening

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,670
and we're talking about lasers because
we have a couple lasers in the office

10
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,920
and wanted bigger laces

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,550
big a laser equals big power so in
Denver

12
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,580
there's a the Geological Society whoever
it is

13
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,530
has got a nuclear reactor its data

14
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,720
has got a nuclear reactor in the middle
it in the middle somewhere in the middle

15
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,240
a denver

16
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,490
as a Newbie where she found nowhere was
for the promises bloody things like

17
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:01,790
forty or fifty years I'll

18
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,590
so I it's probably won't he's probably
run out by now so alike we need power

19
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,900
how do we get power

20
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,080
so and a little better this talk is
about how we get power

21
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,479
but we started talking about you know
getting power out love

22
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:20,250
reactors and we figure the most other
reactors a couple good react as we

23
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,900
figure out reactors empowerment summit
look to me like

24
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,369
you being the evil genius somewhat known
and I'm being me

25
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:31,500
like know what your building is the evil
lair how high

26
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,740
no no no maybe yes so all love you
hopefully Kallis recognize it one or

27
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,130
more be evil less

28
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:44,070
so despite the fact this talk is by land
by sea by air what I'm actually going to

29
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:44,920
be talking about

30
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,950
is how to build your own evil lair

31
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:52,740
because quite honestly I think I've kind
of gone rogue to some degree

32
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,050
we will put a shopping list together for
you evil everest you gonna go through

33
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,610
every cup for 2011 as well

34
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,820
how we gonna do it which makes relevant
to a business side of things we don't

35
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,290
talk about

36
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,900
no sense we're gonna talk about digital
for printing

37
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,630
ohs it have you guys know what I wasn't
is most some non

38
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,989
okay open source intelligence gathering
okay

39
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:21,400
humint human intelligence gathering you
can also do social engineering for the

40
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,080
same thing

41
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,870
but the ohs inside the world is
literally finding

42
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:30,310
out what data is already out there

43
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,260
this is not you having to hack into an
airplane over that actually helps or

44
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:34,980
some other stuff

45
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,540
but it is actually going and going I
want to hack into an airplane

46
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,329
how the bloody hell am I going to do
this

47
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,939
what tools do I need what is the
architecture one on the system's

48
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:50,659
how do we do this and so we'll work our
way through this you'll have to probably

49
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:54,000
issues me some the slides a kind about
us even zombie messing around with acres

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,099
originally this was a fairly dry talk

51
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:00,040
and then I rearrange the whole bloody
thing to actually deal with even less

52
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,599
we will talk about boats and missiles
and power

53
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:09,560
missiles a fun um boats were fun we had
fun with boats in no way

54
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,719
and then some to do some things to think
about and then for me actually some

55
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,739
stuff that we're working on a little bit
more polite next year or whenever

56
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:21,260
if I don't get invited back again so
anyway as an evil genius

57
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,810
this is the shopping list we need wheels
ok iraqi ready for me one is loss and

58
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,510
I've got to

59
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:30,139
you I absolutely adore thank you very
much thank you

60
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:33,950
and have this too so as an evil genius

61
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:38,459
I need wheels obviously once I've
trampled on by millions on each other

62
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:42,079
roll over the top any long distance
transportation planes

63
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:45,669
will see the Bucks typically as
everybody knows the evil lair

64
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:49,099
is on a disused bloody under a disused
volcano in the middle of an island

65
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:49,680
somewhere

66
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,989
how this man you get to it we obviously

67
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:55,709
you know we need two missiles were
crying out loud we need lotsa missiles

68
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:57,409
have you guys have seen Despicable Me

69
00:03:57,409 --> 00:04:01,120
good continually

70
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,629
moving sorting missiles again this is
the reason we need power you need the

71
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:07,439
power to build a bloody missiles in raw
materials would know that one for this

72
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,939
one when he the location we need the
millions we haven't fought so this one

73
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:13,189
yet I can't quite figure that

74
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:16,359
have a call in millions or do anything
else with this one so in a house in

75
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:17,199
talks to millions

76
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,090
now again the second realization

77
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:26,199
this is going to cost us mag absolutes
making huge amount of money unless we

78
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,099
can find a different way of doing this

79
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:33,169
you also so we discovered cannot walk
into a military base in Goa hello the

80
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:36,099
pac-3 over there couldn't possibly just
borrow it for a little while

81
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:39,830
they don't like that we actually did
call up

82
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,669
we call that the pentagon asking if we
go by

83
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:47,539
by it was great went through to the
procurement department at the Pentagon

84
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:49,550
said we'd like to buy patroness of place

85
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:53,250
we have an AMEX it has a good land the
clearance on it they wouldn't let us buy

86
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,060
one

87
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,650
I've got the telephone number in case
anybody tries to do it find a

88
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,909
intelligence-gathering oh said open
source intelligence

89
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:09,510
and digital footprint and as a says the
bottom remember this

90
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:13,639
this is relatively important the whole
way through this talk in the funds of

91
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:14,279
what we have

92
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:20,800
so what is it it is a trailer to
traverse the left by the targets

93
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,419
interactions with the Internet

94
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:27,729
you as your organizations organizations
you're targeting or you represent have

95
00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:29,990
it. people you might be achievable
yourselves

96
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,090
how often do you go to an open for

97
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,650
how often you go to the Cisco for the
lists

98
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,479
forums and Oracle the story of a Cisco
wherever it might be

99
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,170
and go hi I have a problem

100
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:47,940
I need help with my problem and somebody
else helpful on the form goes high

101
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,940
will help you his post the config and
people do

102
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,160
the database that we maintain so how has
a

103
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,670
on the database that we maintain has
about four or five hundred thousand

104
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,590
Cisco config zit

105
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,270
most without the bloody password encrypt
it

106
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,490
I have to go to break into the damn
company

107
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:12,440
when they post the information out there
themselves that doesn't include all the

108
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,190
other stuff and some other or going to
it

109
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,140
and again a red reference we're gonna
skip by the slight

110
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,350
have simple stuff

111
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,480
this is stuff had a quick show of hands
if you guys don't have a reviewer

112
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:30,120
out in the security the pen testing side
of things hopefully

113
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,260
this all makes sense to you guys if it
doesn't stop

114
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,350
adding this to the Arsenal and it isn't
just about the social side of it

115
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,709
it's everywhere

116
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:43,439
from an organizational standpoint even a
simple open quotes act my company or my

117
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:45,419
company the target dot com

118
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:48,979
clothes quotes sequel error codes Cisco

119
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:52,999
whatever you might wanna put into helps
understand

120
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:57,969
what data has already leaked out about
you will need to buy this

121
00:06:57,969 --> 00:07:02,519
you also need to pick your target

122
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:07,459
correctly the left hand side top left
inside is Jesse I was actually gonna try

123
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:09,139
and get him out here this year

124
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:13,209
because quite honestly I'm blaming him
for a lot of this he's an extremely good

125
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:16,489
friend of mine he is also probably one
of the best engineers I know the Nikon

126
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:17,019
you know what

127
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:21,569
I didn't go through the slide show and
tell it not to move on sign after run

128
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:22,389
back ever again

129
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:26,799
anyway i'm happy for stuff simple stuff
easy stuff

130
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:30,509
but the stuff that is hackable make sure
this one doesn't actually move up

131
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:33,939
the stuff that we know we can take at
take a

132
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:37,189
tractor or a combine harvester basically
fifty

133
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:41,909
half a million two million lines of code
right hand side modern aviation systems

134
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:43,969
527 million lines of code

135
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:48,049
gonna shoot the computer I love my Mac
but it's going to have a freaking bullet

136
00:07:48,049 --> 00:07:51,179
hole in a minute stay

137
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:54,649
milwaukee's modern aviation

138
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:59,469
527 ish million lines of code not
include the and famous as the look at

139
00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:00,259
the vehicles

140
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:05,479
a hundred million ish lines of code that
is a huge

141
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:08,979
Amanda data and how much it's got there
isn't it

142
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:14,169
these are my targets these the targets
were looking at

143
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:17,799
there's also a distinct possibility
we're looking at these things as well

144
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:22,959
we're looking at the missiles because we
wanna miss out because we got by one we

145
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,229
can take one away so we're gonna figure
had a right to use one of them thanks

146
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:29,309
we going to end at it's fun

147
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:32,409
but again putting it into perspective

148
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:35,569
that one single the cost Mercedes

149
00:08:35,569 --> 00:08:39,360
has more bloody code in at the near 1525
an F 35

150
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,669
you wanna start looking at Target some
things to break

151
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:45,800
those are fun wants to play with plus
they're readily accessible

152
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:51,160
other than cost billions of dollars if
you crash what suck

153
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,670
shopping list I'm we're gonna run

154
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,709
literally run through this one because I
did this last year and I don't really

155
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:00,559
wanna repeated too much into the lot
about stuff

156
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:02,900
character to go for it

157
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,949
are you guys are we recording this again
this year yeah

158
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:10,850
okay call if not I can get a copy this
but give me cargo hold the mind hit me

159
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,529
up on Twitter

160
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:15,649
something along those lines or get a
copy them and if necessary

161
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:18,800
cars so we're gonna go through with no
doubt that we did this last year

162
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,870
we started looking at basically the CAN
bus system

163
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:26,279
the AUTOSAR system the most network
architecture how to the vehicle's work

164
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,720
how the architect is work

165
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,079
how can we as individuals interact with
those architect just you leave it on

166
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:33,569
this one because this is the one we
actually need

167
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:38,490
so what do we use to interface with the
top left on site Bluetooth

168
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,980
it's a simple insists USB t-1000 I think
for crying out loud

169
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,990
or go get yourself a bit too shoot after

170
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,350
stay no walkies

171
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:57,350
I might actually stop this in a second
civilized has he not let me do this

172
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:01,120
so the tools we use on your tooth on
those well go get yourself over to get

173
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,360
yourself a bluetooth driver

174
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,270
again your target for the stuff that
we're looking at the vehicles I have

175
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,829
Bluetooth enabled

176
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:11,149
on the stuff that we're doing on this
one

177
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:15,820
in particular we have the one example we
have on this one as we saw to messing

178
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,199
around with a couple the new these are
all commercial tools

179
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:21,480
you don't actually have to go out and
crack tools

180
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,120
you can use basically the injections
older in that

181
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,269
your to ingenuity tools in that the can
RS 232 to those in the camps all

182
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:30,790
suffered

183
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:35,959
this is all commercially available stuff
and this is where I can you say guys I'm

184
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:37,610
actually gonna try and adjust this

185
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,240
see if we can actually get it so it
doesn't keep skipping ahead because

186
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,829
otherwise I might have to she'd

187
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:46,280
transition

188
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,419
the fifties vastly

189
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:51,280
slides

190
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:56,850
all right keep fingers crossed

191
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,510
alright

192
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:03,870
so what on your show you as well as as
well as talking about the Oceanside

193
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,930
digital footprints a

194
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,290
in this particular case what we ended up
doing

195
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:13,820
with using the USB tool and we'll talk
you're on the next one so obviously you

196
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,680
have to find your target you have to go
fishing for your target

197
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,010
this case we do this weekend we redid
some work this weekend

198
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:25,480
I'm simple architecture really you need
to suffer spectrograph analyzer

199
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,700
is obviously as your target comes into
range

200
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,730
you need to understand is it running
looted nice little bump in the middle

201
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,430
tells you the vehicle in question

202
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:39,140
is running looted you now have a window
of opportunity to make friends with said

203
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,540
car if it's not yours

204
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:44,820
obviously from a legal standpoint we
only a we would recommend you practice

205
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,880
on your own vehicle

206
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,170
what you choose to do in your own time
is entirely up to you

207
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:53,330
I I think two years ago I made a
statement about the fact that the

208
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:56,930
presidential cavalcade would make an
amazingly good target but I think they

209
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,040
fix the problems now

210
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,150
Romney's bus

211
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:08,150
was still running Bluetooth as of two
weeks ago by the way going to get yelled

212
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,140
at

213
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,850
center-right get to target

214
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:17,610
you will run into the first thing on the
vehicle's you run into the high

215
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:20,620
we need a four digit PIN code fuzz it

216
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,850
break it or write your own code or even
go online there's a bunch of places

217
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,840
where you can basically get Bluetooth
puzzle for cup for

218
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,970
passcode fathers you basie brute forcing
a four digit PIN code

219
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:36,030
no different than the fairly easy way to
brute force the four digit PIN code on

220
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:39,680
ATM card if this is a vacuum it up
pretty instantaneously now

221
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,730
right to self a quick program it's
fairly easy to do

222
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,420
in doing so you now have associated with
aforementioned vehicle

223
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,750
now that you've associated with the
vehicle will you now have to do is

224
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,000
figure out how to get from the
entertainment system to the main campus

225
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,399
network there are a few ways of doing
this again

226
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:02,130
I will go back to the ocean world and I
will go back to you guys and encouraging

227
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,740
you guys to start looking at the Cannes
bus architecture

228
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,490
but once you can't do that you can get
use of the count to 3-2 software

229
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:13,459
or use of another nice piece of which
will actually look at the pet ID soon

230
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,670
now you can watch the page ID architect
you but you gotta put the vehicle in

231
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,680
maintenance mode

232
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,720
which in the Volvo in particular will go
in maintenance mode mother still

233
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,899
thing still driving this particular
Volvo we did over the weekend it wasn't

234
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:26,100
on a vase I have to admit

235
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,990
um and we actually have we got the
engine speed engine for position engine

236
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:31,740
fuel right

237
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,570
so we help to the person with the Volvo
south of of the cylinders

238
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:42,570
helps fuel economy so this wasn't always
like

239
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:47,149
this was this baby receive gotshall's
myself

240
00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:50,550
rendered a bunch of other guys walking
on the high street in oslo

241
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:54,360
and we recognize that each one a blasted
taxis was a mercedes

242
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,089
and I'm walking down there and those is
like giggling and I'm like what he shows

243
00:13:58,089 --> 00:13:59,420
me the Bluetooth interface

244
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:03,899
so needless to say I rise to the
occasion we fired the Bluetooth system

245
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:07,829
we realize that is also fishing I have
the Mac code on this thing

246
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:11,240
I have decided that now as you know
exactly how to attack the vehicle

247
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,970
I fire a backtrack to give me some other
Bluetooth cause I need to get into the

248
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:16,640
system

249
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,690
at that point in time I have my
Bluetooth antenna I convert Blu

250
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:21,540
throughout the

251
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,459
the 02 ingenuity tall is an RS 232 tool

252
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:28,709
RS 232 you your body into a Bluetooth
side of things

253
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:31,730
it then start to talk to Mercedes we put
them all in neutral

254
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:35,870
within about two minutes per Mercedes to
do this

255
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,949
it was quite fun to do now in case you
need

256
00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:44,510
mercedes can bust paid ID's here they
offer no my spreadsheet if you had to

257
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:44,940
google

258
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:49,940
you can find them the nice thing about
this one is about halfway down here

259
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,770
had alleged was a half way down here she
gives you the n-type it I D

260
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:58,069
to put the vehicle into neutral see you
inject that in

261
00:14:58,069 --> 00:15:03,819
and all the summer season just huge
drives like what the pic to have to

262
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,940
happening simple

263
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:11,540
do some oh sit do some digital for
printing

264
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:15,579
this is actually polled of us in public
stuff that's out there its easy to do

265
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:16,180
guys

266
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:20,089
so needless to say is the bad guys we
figured out the cars

267
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:25,380
i really wanna know if that's running
Bluetooth buses

268
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:30,230
again this is from last year although we
updated it cuz we went at all slow I'm a

269
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,170
friend with the oslo transit system
probably never get invited back there

270
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:39,770
again those rights you photographs we
took before we got on the bus and stop

271
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:40,520
us from running

272
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,620
we got off the bus cuz we could get it
running again

273
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,050
yeah it's not gather

274
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:51,420
again open source intelligence

275
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:56,089
there is actually a website in Canada
that tells you exactly what

276
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:59,990
the transit fleet is running what the
flight number is who the manufacture

277
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,390
what the engine is what the transmission
is

278
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:06,430
you can find this information that you
can then go out there and go

279
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:10,060
I need software for this engine I need
to interface with this engine

280
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:14,660
I need to understand how to talk to this
engine and then when you understand how

281
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,839
to talk with the engine

282
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,670
you can sit at a coffee shop in this
case in denver you can sit at a coffee

283
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,779
shop in Denver

284
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:24,819
you can fire up your wireless access
point from the wireless access point

285
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:25,260
that you

286
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,870
borrowed possibly an SSID key from the
main transit system

287
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:33,300
you can associate with the bus as it
spends five min is waiting there

288
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,980
you can make friends with the system you
can actually fire up the

289
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,670
who suffered abuse for this one Cummings
the comings insight software

290
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:44,690
unless you have the coming since I saw
for you can now adjust the RPM's

291
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,040
you can adjust the speed limit this if
the bus isn't turning up on time

292
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:53,329
you can i mess with the speed limit on
the bus perfect public transit

293
00:16:53,329 --> 00:17:00,329
so we have the bus is sorted as well

294
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,490
planes I talk about planes last year I
think I did not

295
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,600
guess what they still haven't fixed many
other problems

296
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,040
if I had a really nice conversation with
somebody in here earlier only walked up

297
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,990
to me and said hey

298
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,900
there's problems with the Tomcat the
apache on the plains and I just started

299
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,520
giggling

300
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,860
so we did this last year but again it
comes down to research

301
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:26,630
it comes down to knowing the Boeing
doesn't build airplanes Boeing gets a

302
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:30,720
hundred other companies around cuz we're
all gonna build an airplane like Lego

303
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,770
each one of those 100 companies goes
away and publishes on the website will

304
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,980
who will in their play

305
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:42,400
those become your targets no different

306
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,640
then if you are working against your
client

307
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,660
your client is engaged you to attack
them you walking to the front door go

308
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,700
hello I'm here

309
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,960
you can do that and it actually works
but you can also go through the side of

310
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,450
and the side or being the vendors no
different than this

311
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:03,680
so with the airplane will go to the
example again you find out who makes the

312
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,860
airplane systems

313
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,150
you target the system you want in this
case the Intel bus architecture for that

314
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:13,050
you have to actually find out what the
APIs for the API architecture

315
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:17,809
you got to the third party company and
you can download the VX works in violent

316
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:21,190
that allows you to communicate with the
Intel bus architecture

317
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:25,480
you on your own system have made
yourself a self-contained VX environment

318
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,340
that could communicate with the Intel
bus system you had to do somebody

319
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,500
research for it

320
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,070
and you had to figure out exactly how it
works but when you've done it

321
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,870
what you now have is the ability to
create yourself a crate

322
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:41,059
and in this case it was a trade for a
787 that we made

323
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:44,740
the bases shut the engines of using the
fader chip architecture

324
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:48,910
35,000 fate lots hugs and kisses

325
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:54,140
11 laps needless to say they have fixed
some of these issues

326
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:58,420
but having sitting on an airplane going
up to no way and actually sitting on a

327
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:02,790
737 going down to San Antonio on Tuesday

328
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:06,030
I we made friends with the firewall

329
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:09,640
we overrode the firewall or make friends
with the second final

330
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,250
ones from the second fire we run into an
Apache Tomcat sitting on

331
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,910
1433 it's not patched

332
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:21,950
have fun with it carefully

333
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:25,410
have K simple

334
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:28,420
stuff takes a little bit work

335
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:33,020
it takes you coming a little prepared it
means you going onto an airplane with

336
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:33,750
the Machinists

337
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,840
no capable of having some fun with their
environments and you guys flying the

338
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,670
planes that have the go-go while it's
running on the I

339
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:45,250
challenge you next time you're on the
airplane the has gogo while us

340
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,640
see how far through the firewall you can
get see if you can get to the ground

341
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,030
based communication that they use

342
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:55,470
see if you can get to the Intel about
socket to please don't take the airplane

343
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,860
at the sky

344
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,539
for those of you who are in the airline
industry listening to this

345
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:05,469
fix it please

346
00:20:05,469 --> 00:20:09,989
visa problems that we've highlighted
lost 0-2 this is stuff we brought up for

347
00:20:09,989 --> 00:20:13,190
wanna same as the cause the vehicle
stuff we brought up for several years

348
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:17,579
now I know that the cycle they have to
fixing stuff is extended but it would be

349
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:19,570
nice to actually know this that's being
done

350
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:23,719
because the same things you can do with
airplane you can do with drones as well

351
00:20:23,719 --> 00:20:28,329
and the same guys who do the work with
the airplanes

352
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:33,179
the l7 guys the lucky guys the Boeing
guys xxxxX after all leaking

353
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:38,950
tons of data about the drugs and the
ATSB did you guys go to Def Con this

354
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,899
year then if you guys catch renders

355
00:20:40,899 --> 00:20:43,829
talk or the University it sexist or
whether she took over the drones and

356
00:20:43,829 --> 00:20:44,579
have fun with them

357
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:49,570
this is a follow on from that were
sitting in a civil enough from the ATSB

358
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,149
architect a nice couple months

359
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:55,959
all again 30 said the ability to now
control the system

360
00:20:55,959 --> 00:21:01,169
sup we have planes we have drugs so sick
with a shopping list

361
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:04,809
well we go back to it we need to
actually start looking at the floating

362
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:05,239
things

363
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:09,589
leadership so this was all slow again
earlier this year

364
00:21:09,589 --> 00:21:14,959
and I'm sitting on the case I'd I've got
a while Santana running and I'm just

365
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:16,509
making friends with whoever's around

366
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:20,609
and I notice that the couple a wireless
access points keep on coming in and

367
00:21:20,609 --> 00:21:22,969
disappearing off on a fairly cyclical
basis

368
00:21:22,969 --> 00:21:26,250
amor realizes the bloody ships

369
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,030
I they go free wifi for people but they
don't

370
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:34,240
their wireless access points are
actually for their internal systems

371
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,050
so

372
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:41,720
if you can actually get one on the damn
things to stay still for more than five

373
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,370
minutes

374
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:47,040
and I see stay within wireless range you
can very quickly very simply and very

375
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,730
easily

376
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,680
with the use a backtrack in a few other
things gain access to the wireless

377
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,400
network

378
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,330
cracked the key that is running its
weapons doesn't take very long the

379
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,510
crackdown web K

380
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:00,330
and I'm on the networks all I do is run
a quick scan across the network

381
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:04,460
we find the engine management software
it's running

382
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:10,800
RTP on 3389 thinks about two minutes to
crack the administration password

383
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:15,650
it's a derivative the company that's
running the ship's

384
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:19,790
since I was sitting on the engine
management system which point where she

385
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,570
stopped the engines

386
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:25,580
again you know we're trying to be
politically friendly so

387
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:29,030
we doing this at this point in time
we've actually got a host from

388
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:32,310
I had gone out there and he's asking us
what we're doing like

389
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:35,800
see the ship New Year is like you cannot
do that

390
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,850
which is that you shouldn't do that we'd
is that

391
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:45,160
start up again working on a again guys

392
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:50,120
this is set this is we're not talking
about doing a huge battery coding

393
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,910
you having to know how to use the tools
and backtrack or or any of the other

394
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:55,360
stuff

395
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,440
this is pretty simple stuff guys and
it's kinda fun suffer this point I'm

396
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,870
we have our ship did you see that they
auction this thing off earlier this year

397
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:09,150
it's really sad we put a bid in for the
auction because we wanted to keep it in

398
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,570
one piece but they wouldn't let us

399
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:13,820
I have no idea why

400
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:19,600
sup so far we have a whilst we have a
bus as we have a place we have about us

401
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,670
we need to move on to the other stuff
but

402
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:27,940
I think before we do stiletto said

403
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,720
black something about us so

404
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,630
we're gonna take a pause we'll take a
look at us in for a second really the

405
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,760
old stuff that we woulda and is all but
it still bloody valid and it's still

406
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,190
being done a lot and it's a perfect way
into an organization Human

407
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:46,470
human intelligence gathering as well as
social engineering again those of you

408
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:50,990
who are in the red team or a pen Sestito
helping organizations to understand this

409
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:54,550
this is something that needs to be
looked at but again the sink inside a

410
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:58,180
bit and the Oceanside ovett there is a
huge

411
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:02,530
amount have information that is out
there that we tend to ignore

412
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:06,100
organizations put a lot of dates out
that part because they have to

413
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:10,550
but partly because they don't realize
it's being put at their own internal

414
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:15,100
guys put it out their own internal
systems put it out and these things

415
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:20,680
don't bloody hatchet your firewall your
ID Suri PSU host intrusion

416
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:25,100
isn't going to catch the fact that your
Cisco guys just being socially

417
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:25,710
engineered

418
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:28,740
in the put in a bloody config out an
open Cisco for

419
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:32,780
although the as/400 guys putting stuff
on the list sup

420
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,580
these are tools that you can use as part
of a pen test

421
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:42,050
so stoplight use in the because I'm part
English

422
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:47,890
I like to have a go at the French the
channel tunnel was both the channel was

423
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:50,260
built for a reason and some silly saw
that she put her

424
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:53,520
bloody me so

425
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,200
good example difference between reactive
and proactive

426
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,360
reactive you guys know the National
linus

427
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,520
absolutely awesome piece of engineering

428
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,470
gorgeous amazing more concrete used in
that but I can't think of

429
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:11,720
and appointed in one bloody direction
Germany

430
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,010
now the germans being the sneaky chapter
they were back then

431
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:18,140
when but we're not gonna go through that
so they went rounded

432
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:22,200
and over the damn thing thereby
rendering it pretty useless

433
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,250
that's the firewall love the
organization that you are pen testing

434
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,779
you have other option C use them

435
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:33,419
start looking

436
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:37,769
even it yourself what data is that what
public data what private data who's

437
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:39,399
calling it who's looking at it

438
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:42,570
help your clients understand that data

439
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:46,360
that the footprint may have other reason
this

440
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,610
I Papa Samantha guys I was gonna do this
and I apologize condom in advance

441
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:54,590
but about a year year and a half ago to
some and his credit they put their hand

442
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,919
up and said hey we lost data

443
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,340
the problem is that data had been out in
the wild for an extended period of time

444
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,190
we actually had a client that we worked
with pretty heavily in which to work

445
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,549
with him on a monthly basis who

446
00:26:05,549 --> 00:26:09,649
use as a service we found it was being
published news actually being both sold

447
00:26:09,649 --> 00:26:10,590
a bloody traded

448
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:14,840
so we told our client are kind to look
at it took a risk analysis over and shut

449
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,450
down a bunt to the semantic systems

450
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:21,080
thereby saving than the headache about
20 the exploits

451
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,800
help the organization's you work for or
that you are attacking

452
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,490
understand what their risks of

453
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:34,140
unbelievable to about for a second the
engine you guys could do the simple

454
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:34,500
stuff

455
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,010
you can go out to Google you can do the
open court at my company or common all

456
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:38,640
the other stuff

457
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,390
you can build yourself your own
environments weekend views lucy in

458
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:47,040
we use not to use solar and various
other things we do a lot of calling a

459
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,820
lot of indexing it's all out there guys
this is

460
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,440
for the simple stuff and you can start
messing around with the rest it's on

461
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,160
there as well

462
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,160
the challenge you have to do

463
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,870
as you are making sense if the Internet
is to figure out the difference between

464
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:01,810
basically

465
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:06,249
I'm hacked off with IBM and I'm hacking
into idea

466
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:11,710
contextualize the searches you have
understand how the search queries in the

467
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:14,210
circle architecture in the search
engines work

468
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:18,360
the second or third bullet points to the
stuff that went missing around with

469
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,490
trying to figure out what the smack
hacked is

470
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:25,539
in you know Russian buses Iranian and
Iraqi is gonna be interesting

471
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:29,200
and the various options but again this
is tough it out like this

472
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,499
sup back to fun stuff missiles

473
00:27:32,499 --> 00:27:36,320
again obviously

474
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,240
have you guys seen the dictator you know
already standing at the front going

475
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,980
we're making it for peace with you sis

476
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:47,340
obviously missiles for peaceful use of I
was

477
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:51,649
an evil genius I have to have my
missiles of Seaford de terrent I'll this

478
00:27:51,649 --> 00:27:53,789
you will never use them in an offensive
spells at all

479
00:27:53,789 --> 00:27:57,419
but I have to have a now as an
individual

480
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:02,799
inside the continental United States
unfortunately we can just go out there

481
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:03,549
and

482
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:07,730
ask for missile so we have to do
research

483
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:10,590
we have to actually start to look at
these things go well

484
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:13,760
I want to have a look at it so I'm gonna
figure out what's going on with missiles

485
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,610
in this case where she decided to split
it into two ways Missy the missile for

486
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,380
band full

487
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:23,600
ground-based communications and attacks
but just like

488
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,890
I love the stuff in phnom was a Star
Wars

489
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:30,400
James Bond you know to get up into the
space on a regular basis

490
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,470
we decided we needed a couple a space
missiles as well

491
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:36,740
so if you notice on here we actually
have the ground support equipment the

492
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,700
launch vehicle

493
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:41,659
the spacecraft bus in the payload I'm we
actually have all the code behind the

494
00:28:41,659 --> 00:28:42,530
scenes with this thing

495
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:45,809
and yeah there's some fun stuff missile
launching as well

496
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:49,110
this was good

497
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:56,110
this was BNC to BNC three of three XY
got us into this really nice

498
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:00,769
so will talk about these for a minute
again we lacked a missile's

499
00:29:00,769 --> 00:29:05,090
wily coyote he can find a pack me

500
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:09,630
you get a box it's delivered it has a
missile in it we can do the same

501
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:14,019
we actually have to approach it a little
differently first we have to have to

502
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:15,399
figure out what we want

503
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:19,990
so our acquisition in this case we went
after the patroness of

504
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:24,059
we started looking at where they were
how to get them

505
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:27,090
what the architect who was and who made
the damn things

506
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:32,029
in doing so we did some research and how
much will this is but the as an IP

507
00:29:32,029 --> 00:29:32,679
address

508
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:36,789
user name and a password and the host
night for a database

509
00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:40,370
the nice thing about this database is it
was made public it gave us the entire

510
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:42,350
shopping list for a patriot missile

511
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:46,399
we're she called up the pentagon again

512
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,429
and then we gave them the entire
shopping list and secondly by the

513
00:29:49,429 --> 00:29:50,700
individual components

514
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,519
which point men in black suits them up
at the office and started asking also

515
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:55,639
the questions

516
00:29:55,639 --> 00:29:59,870
I oberlin wonderful

517
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:02,990
yourself her

518
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:06,929
so we started to look at this thing it's
like okay

519
00:30:06,929 --> 00:30:10,539
how can we without actually going and
buying one of these things

520
00:30:10,539 --> 00:30:13,610
how can we take control of one

521
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:17,040
again you can't walk in kick the door
down to push the button where you want

522
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,350
it

523
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:22,600
but what you can start to do a start to
look at how these things have guidance

524
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,840
control systems

525
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,140
start influence potentially the guidance
control architecture

526
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,530
to that point we started look at all the
vendors

527
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:35,419
all the vendors in the systems they have
all the vendors and the programming the

528
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:36,580
pie from the RX

529
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:41,070
all these other things that they use the
company's

530
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:45,130
that made the individual components we
know the feel we know all this

531
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,830
information we knew exactly how to
control the motors on these things

532
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:52,760
but what we haven't figured out and
two-wheelers on the patent office

533
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,330
was exactly have the guidance control
system what

534
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:59,340
so thank you very much Patent Office

535
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:04,590
annexed really really good source of
information should you ever need it

536
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:08,100
I highly recommend using it for buses

537
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,290
calls trains airplanes

538
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:15,830
missile nuclear submarine

539
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:19,380
it's great so this point I

540
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:23,299
I know exactly what I want the guidance
control process i now the nice thing

541
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:25,419
about having the parts list I know
exactly now

542
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:28,470
who makes the guidance control processor
again

543
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:32,780
public information so now that I know
who makes the guns control processor

544
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:36,669
what I had to do we have to figure out
exactly how to either influence it or

545
00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:40,660
rewrite the stupid thing and this point
we have to give thanks to Walter

546
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:44,000
want to work for the company that made
these things

547
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,660
Walter was offers a very nice thing she
designed the acronym

548
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:52,480
goes with the pac-3 missile he also
program the programmable modules

549
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,520
and he did the whole thing in CORDIC
which I she hated

550
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,780
because I had to learn court program

551
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:04,040
but we also thanks to him figure out
exactly what the field programmable

552
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:04,990
arrays were

553
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:08,120
how the switch sandwiches were can have
the actual architecture worked

554
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,640
this is all out there if you are trying
find that it's quite fun

555
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,110
so now we have the ability to influence
in architected rebuild it reprogram it

556
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,070
the whole bloody lot

557
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:20,150
but we didn't know it's Heather actually
you know get it to interact

558
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:25,010
so thankfully some bright spark in a
third-party for third-party

559
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:29,630
posted the entire DOT standards online
for exactly how to make these things

560
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:30,500
communicate

561
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:34,830
including all the switch matrix system
the architect to the capabilities

562
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,040
accepted such a scenario we pretty much
so on

563
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:41,500
every single thing there is about the
capabilities around these damn missiles

564
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:46,680
as demonstrated here we have the whole
thing so what we need to do is go make

565
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,590
friends with the company

566
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:53,390
with it they have an FTP site and FTP
site is wide open unfortunately I had

567
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,340
sum up the actual designs for the

568
00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:00,040
guidance control tips: so in good
spirits as citizens we downloaded the

569
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,700
damn things

570
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:07,220
we rewrote the guidance control
architecture for the guidance issued by

571
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,900
the way there's more than one of these
damn chips on these bloody things is

572
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,010
about a hundred oh damn

573
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:15,010
thanks it took a lot to rewriting but
eventually

574
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:18,580
when we gave it back to the people and
said test this it didn't matter what

575
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,900
coordinates they put in

576
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:23,980
they went straight to the corners we'd
already hard coded into the program

577
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:30,980
score one for the bad guys so in doing
so we also made friends with some other

578
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:32,710
countries

579
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:36,230
pager missile systems and other
installations over the missiles

580
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:39,660
which we then gave to other people said
hey look they got missiles to him as

581
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,290
their data

582
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:45,200
and then we forget it with a pager
missiles were and then we figure out how

583
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,470
to deploy patriot missiles that we
needed by the way we figured out how

584
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:52,040
fathers damn things flying to make them
go to the target we need we need to keep

585
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:56,960
most them inside the US which is a bit
of a problem so we have missiles

586
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,210
and there are various things you can
actually do with the needless to say

587
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:06,560
by the way I will give a fax out all of
those people inside corporations

588
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:11,780
to download free antivirus especially
ones who run around with classified

589
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,620
computers

590
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:16,610
and still download free anti-virus we
love you

591
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:21,260
and your data thanks brain box so

592
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:28,260
how we don't I must have absolutely no
clue we good on time only sweet alright

593
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,450
said I was done messing on this is where

594
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:34,640
this is where on I had to take a few the
slides out

595
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:40,550
but we can talk about some stuff so this
is where we decided we needed power

596
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:45,490
and we couldn't use the nuclear-powered
that was coming out of Denver

597
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:49,000
because well it was kinda all

598
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,760
we needed new power and we obviously
need a lot of power in our

599
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,310
evil genius laugh because we really miss
cells were gonna computers and storage

600
00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:00,230
arrays and trains will receive more
missiles because obviously we need lots

601
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,670
of defensive situations

602
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:05,310
so literally sitting at some I hope one
evening

603
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:10,210
we figured out that this a new nuclear
power stuff is being designed the

604
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:13,330
problem is as they take the damn things
and they put him in submarines

605
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:16,380
but this self-contained units

606
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:20,750
and they go for 33 yes it's like a never
read the paper ready battery two runs

607
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,090
for 33 years in runs in a megawatt range

608
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:27,010
the problem is they put them in
submarines you've got to get the damn

609
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:28,540
things out of a submarine

610
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:33,290
Big Ten opener all you have to borrow
the submarine

611
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:38,840
so

612
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,350
we decided to take on what's known as
the ass nine-g_ you some research on

613
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,600
this is sitting in the Virginia cost
reactor

614
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,330
the POW's the submarines is quite a few
that they're not quite fun

615
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:51,550
um steady output

616
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:56,250
steady research and I can present the
whole lot about how the catcher on

617
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:59,580
something we can talk a little bit about
it but I can't put everything out on

618
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,110
this

619
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:04,520
the list to say cuz I got yelled at what
we can tell you

620
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:10,140
is the research you need to do top
left-hand side is the possible location

621
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,030
that maybe some others actually comes
out of

622
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:16,450
now I would highly recommend when you're
looking at this organization you look at

623
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,560
the subsidiaries

624
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,870
and also the owning her ownership
company

625
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:24,800
again do your research to your hosted
research

626
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,940
start looking at the organization's what
emails that putting out by the way when

627
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,780
you're looking at the third party
companies look at your emails

628
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:36,240
there is a distinct possibility might
still find the FTP site

629
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,720
the FTP site still has a home in today
to including FTP user ID's and passwords

630
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,020
we love them for this cuz you gave us
access to other areas that we needed

631
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,740
the other areas that we are allowed to
actually get to

632
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,980
although we actually managed to get it
was just nice the one that s nice the

633
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:52,620
website

634
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:56,320
that tells you exactly where the reactor
is what it's doing how it is

635
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,070
and some other controlling interfaces
because what I eventually figured out

636
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:04,220
what you can just take a nuclear reactor
put it down there and hook up a set a

637
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,110
jumper cables

638
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:08,960
Jesse tell me I can't do that I have to
get a lot more sophisticated

639
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,370
so what we ended up doing was looking at
the reactor

640
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:16,410
and then started looking at the software
components around

641
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:19,670
again I need my power 90 good clean
power for the day to rate for the

642
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,100
missile production systems

643
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,500
and again I have to find out through

644
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,180
digital footprints a through open source
gathering

645
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:32,710
exactly how to control the reactor you
can actually go out to Google

646
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:36,180
and do some others you don't even have
to have the engine if you go out to the

647
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,840
Tor network in the only network

648
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,210
you can even find a whole lot more about
it

649
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:44,480
so now I have my reactor

650
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,650
it in a submarine which is a pain in the
ass I have

651
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:52,360
the architecture for the system I have
the software for the system and I know

652
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,470
how this thing works

653
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:56,890
we actually found one the sitting on
land that they test

654
00:37:56,890 --> 00:38:01,920
that's a long way from the ocean which
is kinda ironic cuz

655
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,780
right where one of the most geologically
unsafe areas is in this country slightly

656
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,160
to the left a bit on a map

657
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,520
his one of the biggest nuclear testing
areas

658
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:16,910
are you guys figure out whether this but
right in the middle %uh that

659
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:21,050
they have a reactor that they test on
these damn things needless to say if you

660
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,050
really clever

661
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:26,820
you can actually get remote shell on the
calling plan system for it

662
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:32,890
they've got a demo of it less the cotton
socks sup

663
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:38,430
we still have the millions to solve and
I haven't quite figured this one out yet

664
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:42,460
I don't know how to actually solve the
problem with the minions

665
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:48,060
I've got an idea there was a conference
to happen last year with RFID tagging

666
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:51,080
they tagged everybody in the new exactly
where everybody went some

667
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:55,030
okay we could do that you can do social
engineering hi we have some projects

668
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:57,120
will you come in bill these missiles
they're really

669
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,130
good things there's also something you
can make a corporation and

670
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:04,450
give it a normal corporate world there's
this information is are in the most of

671
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:05,500
us would probably enjoy

672
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,710
working in an evil lair over there be
this damn power struggle everybody week

673
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,310
because he's one of us want to be the
boss

674
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:16,470
you take it in turns

675
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:18,869
but simply

676
00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:23,999
all joking aside we are literally
looking at internal data leakage

677
00:39:23,999 --> 00:39:29,079
the problem is the LP's not gonna find
that your ID s here IPS me if I will

678
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:30,359
also sell a win or a

679
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:33,659
are you guys doing it have you control
and heavy manager

680
00:39:33,659 --> 00:39:36,609
and this is what we're trying to do with
trying to highlight some of the

681
00:39:36,609 --> 00:39:37,329
challenges

682
00:39:37,329 --> 00:39:41,219
probably having a lot of fun along the
way what we're doing at what we're

683
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:43,779
trying to help organizations understand
the hey guys

684
00:39:43,779 --> 00:39:47,400
you are leaking crap loads a day to you
are looking enough data but I can take

685
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:52,559
over bloody patroness of a crying out
loud your business partners and those

686
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:54,189
that do business with you

687
00:39:54,189 --> 00:39:58,269
are leaking data the vendors the
organizations that you love and trust

688
00:39:58,269 --> 00:39:59,880
and money over for people

689
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:04,569
and services a leaking data about you
this some slides it in put up that we

690
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:05,390
worked with the

691
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:10,119
one of our clients hosts a bunch today
to Davis house Ubuntu the system that a

692
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:10,919
data center

693
00:40:10,919 --> 00:40:15,909
so we Social Engine at the datacenter
when they handed over

694
00:40:15,909 --> 00:40:19,669
config systems database schemas the
whole bloody lot

695
00:40:19,669 --> 00:40:25,359
but that's fine and for a whole bunch of
other clients easy done from the pen

696
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:29,269
testing standpoint this stuff the
goldmine blue team in an internal

697
00:40:29,269 --> 00:40:31,289
organization standpoint US

698
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:36,880
have to be more aware more cognizant
this is going on office either

699
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,659
deliberately

700
00:40:37,659 --> 00:40:41,249
removal of data is the controlling a
data how do you imagine how do you

701
00:40:41,249 --> 00:40:43,970
control the day to you

702
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:47,950
her so the shopping list oversee the
whales we sorted

703
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:51,180
the buses we saw that the planes were so
that the boats with now sorted the

704
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:51,790
missiles

705
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:56,130
I think we'll agree we probably so did
the missiles we St tested

706
00:40:56,130 --> 00:41:00,390
on in a controlled environment exactly
the code that we put on the guidance

707
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,330
control chips

708
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:05,190
and it worked so the missile when where
we wanted it to

709
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:10,280
not where the program deters I think we
got myself sorted the power

710
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:15,950
we counted all sorted as well I had to
cut that was shown for that I apologize

711
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:19,070
let's just say we have the capability to
get to the submarine

712
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:23,560
we have the capability to take control
nuclear system on the submarine

713
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,330
and we have the ability to take some the
power of the summary

714
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:30,520
when the damn things in dot the problem
is

715
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,660
I live in Colorado it was pointed out to
me

716
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:38,680
that is a landlocked state I'm not used
to that I come from the United Kingdom

717
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,940
which has water all the bloody way
around it

718
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,950
we park our submarines in the lake up in
Scotland

719
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:47,570
we need them up in Scotland cuz if the
bugs blow up in theory it shouldn't

720
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,030
affect the United Kingdom too much

721
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:52,580
will this be we have we gotta be Scott's
going here as you left

722
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:56,100
though this we we harry radioactive
Scottish people very very angry again

723
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,480
over here

724
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,110
a car park assaulting submarine in
Colorado neither can I take the nuclear

725
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,950
part after the submarine because

726
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:07,370
I didn't realize this until after was a
thing weighs about two and a half

727
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:08,540
thousand tonnes

728
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:13,500
moving that with the tractor would be a
bit of a challenge

729
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,480
now but fun thing about that one is if
you do your research on nuclear reactors

730
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,520
is actually company

731
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:22,260
in Colorado which in their own words is
making a reactor

732
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,430
about besides a POF help I'm like

733
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:30,250
sweet and again if I wanted the data
from that how

734
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:33,730
easy is it for me with out breaking into
them

735
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:37,710
to take their information to gain access
to it how much

736
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:40,910
data has that particular client leaked

737
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:44,400
have their intellectual property in the
case of these guys

738
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:50,820
quite a lot unfortunately we didn't talk
about location I actually forgot to put

739
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,780
the slides in for this one but it's
totally cool

740
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:57,260
if you go online and Google Google
missile sites for sale

741
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:02,200
this a holding call once so we already
have the missile okay this actually won

742
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,480
in Denver this really cool

743
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,910
there's an old radio frequency when this
guy like 45,000 square foot on the

744
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:08,700
ground completely sorted out

745
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:14,270
no messin or anything else like that so
we have the evil lair sorted out again

746
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:17,440
promise Colorado lawn looks like Congo
bloody submarine and a

747
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,950
we'll figure out we're working on this
one we gotta figure this one out

748
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:25,940
oversee the millions we haven't sold the
millions I cannot put a job at up on

749
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,800
Craigslist or up on one so saying

750
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,440
wanted a ship because I'd be fun I

751
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:37,540
I take that back if you see an advert on
Monster and a couple weeks time

752
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:41,330
wanted millions crying out loud on
response

753
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:48,330
the other two things on this one the
superhero defenseless obviously as

754
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,510
several evil genius knows

755
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:54,880
as assaulting superhero all the way
around the corner somewhere out there

756
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,110
and I've got things like nixon heroes
gotta

757
00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:00,810
got a list that there are over 100
things I would do if I wasn't evil

758
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:01,560
genius

759
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:05,220
are posted before if I give these out
before give these a lot you put the link

760
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,320
on the it's freaking hilarious

761
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,370
I will not give my minions like black

762
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:14,150
out screens the hero will not be allowed
to live

763
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:18,410
for 24 hours while I taunted his ass
will be shot or tasted on site

764
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:22,470
you know all the normal things you'd
expect

765
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:27,760
oh said the one other thing that we need
as we are crawling and taking the web

766
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,210
we've realized this when we have

767
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:33,100
the engine that we have has about half a
billion

768
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,910
or so

769
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:38,380
web sites and URL's in IRC channels that
it watches

770
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:42,390
so if at any point in time you decide to
start talking about nuclear fission or

771
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:43,249
fusion of stuff

772
00:44:43,249 --> 00:44:46,450
for god sakes please do on an IRC
channels encrypt it that way not

773
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:47,140
watching

774
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:50,900
please we have a

775
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:54,339
bad up of a billion records in the
system: we have so where

776
00:44:54,339 --> 00:44:57,540
closing in on a petabyte with the data
at the moment

777
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:01,180
it's indexed in band we have some family
fun kinda fuzzy stuff goes well

778
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:05,500
suck I have what time is it doesn't help

779
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,990
times cool

780
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:12,820
alright so from a standpoint of
everything else

781
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:16,380
ASI don't I don't have the other one hit
the other legal stuff

782
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,790
actually has better language in there
says if you decide to go take over

783
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:20,410
missile

784
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:24,250
or a bus or train you doing so your own
risk have out and play nice

785
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:28,520
but that from a general point to view
the talk that sit on the tall guys

786
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:32,890
questions or thoughts or anything else
by this questions

787
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:39,890
mom we've talked about me yes

788
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,810
can access the can and I'm gonna repeat
the question because I'm off because

789
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:44,650
nobody else can hear a

790
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:47,840
so can I access the Canon a vehicle when
the vehicle is all

791
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:53,770
no I cannot the vehicle sorry the
vehicle has to have the ignition turned

792
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:54,770
on any street

793
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:59,550
how to the entertainment system I I am
aware

794
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:02,580
but I haven't had chance to play with it
yet

795
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:07,150
that there are a couple of technologies
deployed in vehicles that allow

796
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:10,420
house we save remote access

797
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:13,799
one of them has something to do with
celestial things

798
00:46:13,799 --> 00:46:19,579
I we haven't yet had a chance to play
with that but it's on the radar I just

799
00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:20,539
need time

800
00:46:20,539 --> 00:46:24,999
the resources and a spare vehicle that I
can take back hurts without them looking

801
00:46:24,999 --> 00:46:27,319
at me all confused again cuz I broach it
on it

802
00:46:27,319 --> 00:46:34,319
I should have said organization decide
to lend me 10 their vehicles that has

803
00:46:34,489 --> 00:46:35,619
this celestial

804
00:46:35,619 --> 00:46:38,819
thing on it well more than happily taken
to see if we can break it

805
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:42,670
yeah that's the only way the moment I
know that you can mess with that

806
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:49,670
your question that there was another 1i
saw another hand shoot up but there is

807
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,450
it I

808
00:46:55,450 --> 00:47:00,550
I'm here her as a fun I got into trouble
for playing with the space station

809
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:02,710
ship was that

810
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:08,349
7 a nine years how many years ago that
crap eight nine years ago we messed

811
00:47:08,349 --> 00:47:11,720
around with a space station we just had
the temperature on it was quite fun we

812
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,720
got yelled at by nasa

813
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:18,960
if they do leave open shit that's not
encrypt it that's a random silly fall

814
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,390
a so satellites

815
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:27,410
I E how by so many things to play
without that

816
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:30,549
this is having time so we have a couple
clients that

817
00:47:30,549 --> 00:47:33,420
have things up in the air

818
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:37,829
what we have found is the easiest way to
take those things over is actually to

819
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:39,759
take over the ground control systems

820
00:47:39,759 --> 00:47:43,079
and their mess with obviously the
communication architecture because the

821
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:45,229
communication architecture itself

822
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:48,869
for the most part and if in the you know
better in it for the most part is funny

823
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:49,539
will encrypt it

824
00:47:49,539 --> 00:47:53,229
always pretty well segregated all
separated off from anything else

825
00:47:53,229 --> 00:47:58,160
and if anybody argues with I have no
problem going make offer on that one for

826
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,430
the ones that we've dealt with

827
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:03,359
we found the easiest way and literally
diseases ways to physically

828
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:06,400
you to get into the location or
electronically get into a patient and

829
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,349
then take control

830
00:48:07,349 --> 00:48:09,560
ground systems

831
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,300
because they have the something ready
gobbling decision or the other stupid

832
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:12,670
shit

833
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:16,850
if I i have those in my evil laugh no
problem I got it cuz you can actually

834
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:19,150
still the password and have fun with the
controlling systems

835
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:22,640
but until I have the I miss you can use
that technology is cheaper and easier

836
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,830
but that's as much as we played with
those things I

837
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:29,310
yet those would be fun to play with even
more

838
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:33,510
that's a good one we might have to come
back next year and CMT supplies we can

839
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:34,680
actually take control of

840
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:40,390
his you support about it grow

841
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:44,960
I'm gonna get yelled at again um I i
think is anybody here mister I'm a

842
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,250
satellites

843
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:52,630
alright your homework for the next 12
months see you can but but the most

844
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:53,470
satellites

845
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:57,970
yes good question %uh but yeah I expect
that to be in next year's

846
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:04,970
if I get invited back at Chris's shoot
me again yeah

847
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:08,400
take

848
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,610
which hood all the I we tried

849
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:17,510
I reach right report I somebody put so

850
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:22,460
I do you guys catch at the curiosity
Rover's bans in Iran was like Oh

851
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:27,500
a rabid friggin crazed RV at the moment
the suggestion was to take that first

852
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,010
bit

853
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:31,630
we've actually started to investigate
that should we say

854
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:34,990
again if this goes this goes back to go
said

855
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:40,440
this goes back to Intel people we as
humans we like to stand and go hey I did

856
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,390
this Court shit

857
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:45,040
that's fine but stop giving so much
better away

858
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:49,970
we as humans and those organizations
like to say hey we did all this cool

859
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:50,580
stuff

860
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:54,100
I already said it Boeing gets all these
companies and all the companies go well

861
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,630
with building airplanes from Boeing

862
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:59,540
may become the targets no different than
our Curiosity rover

863
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:04,690
their organizations out there that have
publicly gone hey we are building shit

864
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:05,410
but this that

865
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:08,370
we have done this we have the
controlling interfaces we have the

866
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:09,580
architecture for this

867
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:13,290
the closest we've done is figure out
exactly how they're communicating how

868
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:15,290
the controlling it

869
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:18,670
and we might have one or two at the
password for some other software that we

870
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:20,140
know we're still in default mode

871
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:24,770
but the problem is is actually getting
into it without breaking more balls than

872
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:25,980
with used to breaking

873
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:31,510
no I think nasa would probably get
pissed at me for that one we start I'd

874
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:33,510
really want to give it a figure avail we
could

875
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:36,780
we were trying to do that with the
drawings so we have that we have

876
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:41,280
University Texas this cause some stuff I
think this before Def Con this year

877
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:45,380
where they took the drones and a Master
fly for a prerequisite pop and they were

878
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:47,160
messing around with GPS and stuff like
that

879
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:51,380
we've actually got ATSB now so that we
can as he messed render not to mess

880
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:53,880
around with this needed a whole bunches
of Def Con this year

881
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,240
but we've now got the ATSB welcome
started ghost signals

882
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:01,280
around the drones so we can actually
start to move the drones where they

883
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,290
don't want to go

884
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:07,119
but I haven't got it develop fully
enough but i wanna put it up on spinnin

885
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:10,390
present the damn thing at because what I
really wanna do is have 12 a figure a

886
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:10,740
fight

887
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:17,010
just for the sheer giggles a bit

888
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:22,410
questions yeah

889
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:29,410
cool

890
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:46,380
with the hobbyist developed on the
satellites out there yet

891
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:52,610
nice alright so it's a matter just its
it's no different and I'll pick up the

892
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,510
cost of a topic on some the other things

893
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:58,490
I mean there's that 108 at the if you
wanna start in research on same thing

894
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:59,370
with the ATSB

895
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:04,590
the military i think is the city's the
city's actually produced a white paper

896
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:06,700
on it was actually of popcorn with the
military

897
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:12,310
produced a white paper a couple years
ago stipulating exactly how many flaws

898
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:13,920
in security holes they were

899
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,380
in a BSB be published a damn thing I
think it's publicly that is what we can

900
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:22,060
week we found out about that way I'm

901
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:25,590
think it's publicly available try for
Minister Singh spam

902
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:29,300
but it so that it goes for like 10-15
different force in a BSB
