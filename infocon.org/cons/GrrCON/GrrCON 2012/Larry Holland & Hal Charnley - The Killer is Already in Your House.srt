1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:03,230
from ok we have Larry Holland

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:07,009
and hail Charnley we're gonna talk about

3
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:10,230
you have your fire all but the hacker
threat is already

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,750
in your office AK the killer is already
in your house

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:20,750
I'm so you guys take it over good
morning everybody

6
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,980
I figured that up remind sizes are
speaking like a preacher everybody's

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,660
attention

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,199
feel kinda like we're in church or
something but the

9
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,350
you have your firewall but the threat is
already in your office

10
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,809
I'm gonna stock you I'm going to follow
you around every corner

11
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,320
and I'm going to continue to gather
information about you

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,550
until I have what I want possess
unfamiliar

13
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,820
this sound like what somebody would do
if they want to get access to your

14
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:52,680
network

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,699
let me tell you something folks

16
00:00:55,699 --> 00:00:59,190
everyone of my customers

17
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,210
that I service and work within the
security industry

18
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:07,390
they get copies of things say SANS
Institute temple sec reading room

19
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:11,570
promoter based security who knows
affirmative a security is

20
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,760
got our firewall right

21
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,360
I'm sending their guarding the front
door

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,930
I'm watching I'm waiting and suddenly
somebody stabbed me in the back

23
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:30,590
i'm looking in the wrong direction does
that ever happen in the workplace

24
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:35,009
absolutely so you have your firewall

25
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,960
but the threat is already in your office
I'm on going to take a few minutes a day

26
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,159
and then I'm going to bring on how
Charlie from net clarity

27
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,939
is the president and CEO I want to
change the discussion

28
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:50,500
I want people to pay attention to what's
inside their network

29
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,840
our agenda

30
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,240
real simple you thought the firewall was
all you needed

31
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,790
that's the only part that i'm gonna
cover help his going to cover the

32
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,590
missing piece to the security puzzle

33
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:09,009
inside out security agent list internal

34
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:12,410
for security protection for the
mid-market

35
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:18,069
small mid-size business I have news for
you if you thought the fire was all that

36
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:19,170
you needed

37
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,750
you're dead wrong doctors office Dennis
office

38
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,440
lawyers small to mid-size businesses

39
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,010
prime targets because they have a bone
formation daughter

40
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:34,510
social security numbers telephone
numbers addresses

41
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:40,200
the statistics I could go on and tell
you every one of them they're all true

42
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,250
for and it all boils down to one thing

43
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:47,680
everybody is targeting the smaller
organizations why

44
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,800
because they thought a fire all is all
they needed right

45
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,459
they thought were hey I bought that
SonicWALL hey

46
00:02:55,459 --> 00:03:01,550
I have a checkpoint ASA Cisco ASA I have
everything I saw any

47
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,730
and the hacker is already in their house

48
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:08,450
they're stealing everything and they
don't even realize it

49
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:13,140
keyloggers back doors

50
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,349
tampering free texting everything's
there

51
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:19,450
it happens this your firewall stop for

52
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,959
no the hacker was already there

53
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,060
how to breaches occur

54
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:30,459
again statistics statistics statistics
the only one that I care about

55
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:37,260
on this entire list 69 and eighty-one
percent

56
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,599
as a super-majority they're happening

57
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:43,849
right there in the office behind the
firewall

58
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:48,830
when we look at

59
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:54,069
where the attacks are coming from it's
boiling down to one spot small to

60
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:55,510
midsize enterprise

61
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:59,540
they get their devices think that's all
they need and

62
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,549
lo and behold the information is being
continuously gathered

63
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:08,510
informations being sold whether to
government office a small government

64
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,010
office in agency

65
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,879
anything it's a small to mid-size and
titty they think that

66
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,630
the only need that firewall or

67
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:21,160
they jump on the bandwagon so all I need
is an identity engine

68
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,919
that upper now protect us how many have
you bring your own device into work

69
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:30,660
I maybe got jobs way to go

70
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,610
let me tell your when you bring your
device into the network you have to

71
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,030
really do anything much

72
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:39,250
to but get access you plug it in right

73
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,790
I I'm a beer hackers

74
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:46,050
art that guy he's got a job is a hacker

75
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,550
he's stealing your information if he
wants from his dad from a device that

76
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,889
you allow them to bring an

77
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:56,620
does that make sense for security
professionals to say I'm gonna sell your

78
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,870
firewall

79
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,449
makes sense for hacker to some firewall
right

80
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:06,009
so when it boils down to

81
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:09,570
the numbers we can all say

82
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:13,180
I feel secure if I have checkpoint
solutions I feel secure

83
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,430
have Cisco ASA I feel secure if

84
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,300
I have a device at the perimeter

85
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,370
until you're ready to changes the
discussion and say

86
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,500
we need a device that's watching
internally the network for the hacker

87
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,800
that's actually there

88
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,610
that's when you're actually going to be
doing the right thing in the security

89
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,630
industry

90
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,960
I want to take up a lot of time today I
just want this to set the stage

91
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,050
to say the firewall is enough

92
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:45,190
you're gonna get stabbed in the back
hoelter night

93
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,810
regular have never had to speak after a
preacher and

94
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:54,060
be done before lunch in my life so this
is a first so

95
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,620
we'll talk a little bit about about
internal security

96
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:02,400
and um where that fits into your overall
security solution architecture

97
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,660
it's a very very critical piece of the
puzzle we're not saying that it is

98
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,490
going to replace firewalls it's going to
replace your endpoint security

99
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,259
was gonna replace your ipsi DS systems
that you already have

100
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:17,780
we're saying is that those three types
of technologies

101
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:22,280
in combination is not adequate to deal
with the threats that exist in today's

102
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,800
in today's world and the way we approach
that

103
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,610
is from a asset management and access
control standpoint

104
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,930
looking at vulnerabilities for assets
including our friend here that's going

105
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:34,740
to bring is

106
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,360
device to work it on the network when
propagate malware from his personal

107
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,630
device to over corporate devices

108
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:46,449
I'll so we all know about the firewall
market the external

109
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:51,180
a intrusion defense market far also been
around for a long time

110
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,610
and the Faroe market back in the
eighties was really focused on

111
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,139
the larger organizations the Fortune
1000 companies

112
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:01,819
who a were smart enough to know that
they realized that they'd realize they

113
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:02,990
needed to do something

114
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:06,440
and second they had the budget to deal
with the cost of the

115
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,449
equipment in the cost to deploy that
equipment

116
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:14,270
overtime those very large modular
complex systems

117
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:19,270
became much more affordable a became
integrated into a single box solution

118
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:23,860
and then today you know you can go to
staples are Radio Shack or Best Buy in

119
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,910
by a consumer Great Firewall for $29 to
$39 dollars and

120
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,930
that's a fifteen billion dollar in your
marketplace today

121
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,139
point to the slide is that that external
security market

122
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:37,470
it started at the top of the largest
organizations

123
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,720
and then over time twenty years were
more

124
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,590
started to move down into the consumer
soho market

125
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:48,400
were saying that same trend starting to
occur

126
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,729
for the internal security market but
with about a fifteen year

127
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:56,210
delay will talk about that in a minute
so what's driving

128
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,789
some other issues and concerns around
and the needy

129
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:03,490
for internal security solutions first
and foremost is

130
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,580
BYOD um in our business

131
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,740
we have seen by the last six months the

132
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,639
interest level and kinda the reason that
people are approaching us

133
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:19,340
has shifted from I need more security or
unconcerned about compliance to

134
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:24,740
I need to deal with BYOD I need to deal
with that from a policy perspective

135
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:28,379
I need to deal with it from a technology
perspective I need to do it from

136
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,740
employee morale perspective

137
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,279
et cetera it's a cut very complicated
problem

138
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:37,399
to to deal with we need to deal with

139
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:40,760
personal devices we need to deal with
corporate devices

140
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,709
we need to deal with wired connectivity
in wireless connectivity

141
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:48,680
we need to deal with a variety of
different operating systems

142
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,200
so we talk about devices this could be a

143
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,220
barcode scanner could be a it could be a
a

144
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,690
an iPhone it could be an Android it
could be a galaxy tablet

145
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:03,019
they can be an Evite branded laptop et
cetera in

146
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:06,440
if I'm the president of the company I
don't own these devices

147
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,839
if I have some technology that's
agent-based they probably don't have an

148
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,240
agent for every device that's out there
matter fact the dough

149
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,269
in homework who might be to installing
an agent on on a device that I don't

150
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:18,260
even know

151
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,920
so a crease it creates a tremendous um
set of practical

152
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,440
policy and technical problems for every
organization today

153
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,250
if you look at some other statistics by
2016 more than half

154
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:36,290
enterprise email users are going to the
using a mobile device as the primary

155
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,190
device for getting their email

156
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,990
and if we look at some of the other
statistics on we're successful breaches

157
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,510
are occurring today were those preachers
originating

158
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,720
it shifted from being external threats

159
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,269
to now being internal threats and that's
what's really creating a market for

160
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:52,029
internal

161
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:56,860
security solutions but I haven't point
security I have

162
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,029
I have AVI have a a

163
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:04,459
malware detection on all my laptops and
all my desktop computers in the

164
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:05,500
organization

165
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,360
I should be safe I should be safe from
the zero-day malware but you're not safe

166
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,500
from the guy that's going to bring his
device into the office

167
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,940
you're not safe from you know malware
the can propagate through

168
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:21,089
devices that don't have anti-virus and
malware

169
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:24,390
endpoint solutions today I'm so

170
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,130
what are the things that's important
when you're looking at an internal

171
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,620
security solution

172
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,990
is to find a solution that can deal with

173
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:38,120
non-windows devices into the vast array
of wired and wireless devices that are

174
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,930
out there today

175
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,050
so what that's done is it's created
similar curve

176
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,430
similar concepts as we saw with the
external fire whirl

177
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,930
market just a minute ago but its cue the
whole

178
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:53,959
time frame by about 15 years and

179
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:57,220
in the mid 2000's in 2006 or thereabouts

180
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,250
was where the first you know can access
control

181
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,899
solutions came into the marketplace the
agent-based

182
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:07,260
they were complex they were very
difficult

183
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,060
deployed they did not solve or even

184
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,180
attempt to solve the BYOD dilemma

185
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,000
and I know if you heard some %uh the
comments in the in the presentation

186
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,510
prior to mine

187
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:23,140
about no patch levels et cetera the
orientation of the early

188
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,140
internal security solutions and access
control solutions wall around

189
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:30,350
insuring the latest patch level on

190
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:34,209
insuring the Navy had been run in there
were no no viruses and have been run in

191
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:36,990
the last 24 hours and came back clean

192
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:41,019
but just cuz you catch the latest local
doesn't mean that you're secure

193
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:44,220
right so what's happened is the sh

194
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,880
that the the attacks have shifted from
the outside to the inside

195
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,730
the other thing that's happened as the
attacks have shifted from the very large

196
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,930
organizations

197
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:56,310
who already made the investment in a in
a comprehensive security solution

198
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:59,490
and now it's focused on the middle
market in the small business and that's

199
00:11:59,490 --> 00:11:59,899
the

200
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:03,029
going to the opportunity that that that
the clarity is chasing

201
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:06,630
this is front-page a last summer um

202
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:09,790
on the wall street journal and it was
about

203
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:13,870
full-page article with a lot of pictures
and graphs talked about

204
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:17,060
how hackers are shifting their tax to
the small firms

205
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,339
why because it's easier why

206
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:24,040
because they think a firewall is all
they needed

207
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,639
it's not all you need you need a lot
more than that so the real security

208
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:29,010
problem

209
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,290
his CV is write a there's

210
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:37,940
there's a lot more CV lot more viruses
and strains a malware then there are

211
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,220
CV is so if we can take a approach

212
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,570
if you take an approach to look at
finding the root cause in going after

213
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,839
the root cause I love

214
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,149
viruses and malware and exploitations of
corporate networks

215
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:54,630
in go after the CV's into

216
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:58,519
interrogate the devices that are on your
network look for the CV

217
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:01,889
and make sure that the IT managers made
aware

218
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:06,160
of those export exposures and that he
can do something about them before they

219
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,290
were exploited

220
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:11,300
that we don't have to worry about are
endpoint anti-virus software

221
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,649
catching the virus after its already
infected that particular device

222
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:19,040
so we take and we believe that the right
approach

223
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,300
is to look at more the root cause rather
than trying to treat

224
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,899
treat the patient after he's already got
the disease let's talk about

225
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:30,730
a solution that can bring the

226
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:36,000
they can be brought to the market that
is affordable and that can deal with

227
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,079
this a burgeoning internal security
threat

228
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,490
on so we we make a a a family of

229
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,360
internal security appliances ranging
from the bottom

230
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:54,060
a very handheld device that can be
really mounted on a wall or

231
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,440
underneath a desk all the way up to
rack-mounted enterprise units they

232
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,010
really do three things:

233
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:02,720
the control who gets on your network
make sure that nobody gets on your

234
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,029
network that you don't want on your
network

235
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:08,820
number two is they harden your network
from the inside out by making sure that

236
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,720
all the trusted devices

237
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,570
that are on your network don't have sea
views that are above a predetermined

238
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,010
threshold

239
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:19,209
in in the event that they do have those
CDs that they we

240
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:23,300
provide some medication assistance and
then lastly we make sure that any device

241
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,560
it's going to get on the network is an
already infected

242
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,320
what else is important in looking at
internal security you know one another

243
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,190
big appliance that sitting in line right
inside the far wall were every bit a

244
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,459
network traffic needs to go through

245
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:41,130
becomes a bottleneck it becomes a single
point of failure in your network

246
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:45,040
see what to look for a solution that's
that's not a band that's not in line

247
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,190
secondly and critically important as you
need something that's agents

248
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:53,740
if you require if a solution requires
agents they're not agents for every IP

249
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,170
device that's mate

250
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:58,540
today there's no agents they can go on
year IP based

251
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:02,170
video surveillance camera that you have
in your lobby

252
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:05,320
and it can still have all abilities they
can still be exploited

253
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,889
and it can still be the entry point into
network for that act that's already

254
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:12,420
inside

255
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,880
so from kinda the the top down the way
that

256
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,889
these types of solutions work is

257
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:22,430
first things you need to know who's on
your network so gonna go out many

258
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:25,529
journalists we discover who's on your
network

259
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:28,769
like the box and I have been

260
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:32,269
put it in discover mode it is gonna go
identifying in five

261
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:36,199
all the devices on your network wired or
wireless

262
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:40,620
its gonna agent Leslie fingerprint them
its gonna identify the manufacture

263
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,940
the mac address the IP address the
operating system

264
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,959
the patch level that operating system
agent Leslie

265
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:52,170
from that list you're gonna build the
trust list you're gonna say

266
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:56,190
these are the 114 assets that I want on
my network

267
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:59,410
and I want them on certain parts %uh may
not work I want them on this be aware

268
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,440
that the UN

269
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,149
I don't want them to have access to all
of the PI that's contained in my

270
00:16:04,149 --> 00:16:06,389
organization

271
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:10,079
and then that policy needs to be
enforced such that if

272
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,420
larry is allowed to get on our
engineering the land

273
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:17,570
is a trusted employee and he now tries
to get on our sales we went

274
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:21,709
working a lot and we're going to block
it just as if a cybercriminal is trying

275
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:22,980
to get into our network

276
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,740
or a trust asset that has an infection
were

277
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,040
the CV that's above a certain
predetermined threshold tries to get on

278
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,040
a network

279
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,560
they will be blocked not be blocked
agent Leslie

280
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,170
which is very very important
particularly when you're talking about a

281
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,610
BYOD phenomenon

282
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:43,320
one of the things that's important this
is a lot of stuff going on inside the

283
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,149
network is to be able to get a

284
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:48,769
Chris and high-level snapshot

285
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:52,079
what's happening in that network one of
the things that that

286
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,220
the way we look at that internal
security is based on threats

287
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,970
vulnerabilities in assets

288
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:00,000
and we have this risk profile which
gives you a quick snapshot

289
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,829
in visibility into what's happening in
your network do you have on trust assets

290
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:04,939
that are being blocked

291
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:08,230
you have sea views that are above a
certain threshold you have assets that

292
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:11,049
are infected with malware

293
00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:13,760
your thing we find is a lot
organizations are distributed right they

294
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,490
have multiple sites

295
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,980
um but those remote offices they don't
have an IT staff

296
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,439
so the the need to have a

297
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:26,900
an enterprise solution with the command
center second visibly that can configure

298
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,640
and control and monitor

299
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,880
those remote sites becomes critically
important

300
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,480
so typical deployment for this type of a
solution is you have an enterprise

301
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,539
solution that sitting at your
headquarters where IT staffers

302
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:43,210
you have one or more remote boxes um up
to

303
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:47,030
250 remote the appliances can be
controlled by a single

304
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:51,179
enterprise appliance in each of those
remote appliances dealing with

305
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:54,220
the assets that are trusted in a loud
and that

306
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,039
local office and also insuring

307
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:01,910
a for the ability scans et cetera and
compliance reporting for those are

308
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:07,350
offices so what do you need an agent was
not for access control

309
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:11,760
up in addition to you know your wireless
infrastructure I just put in

310
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,110
place a row over mobile iron ore one of
the wireless infrastructures to handle

311
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:16,799
my

312
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,760
my BYOD a requirements

313
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,370
why do I need something more than that
well

314
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:28,620
we need to make sure that that device
it's connecting to the network

315
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,850
is connecting to the right part of the
network we need to make sure that that

316
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,100
device that's employee-owned

317
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,710
is an infected with malware we need to
make sure that that device that's

318
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,929
employee-owned

319
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:43,770
doesn't have any hi vulnerabilities we
want to make sure those things before

320
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:46,200
that device is connected to the network

321
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,270
in your wireless infrastructure isn't
going to do that wireless

322
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,200
infrastructures gonna provide you

323
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,780
some level love password protection and
encryption

324
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:59,120
but it's not going to do anything to
ensure that that particular device

325
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,610
gets in the right spot it is a secure
device when it accessing the network

326
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:08,160
there was a study done recently by by
Verizon about

327
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,460
a the breaches that occurred

328
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,530
originating inside the firewall what it
would have cost

329
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:19,640
for all organizations and large
organizations to to remedy that they put

330
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,890
in kinder

331
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:24,169
three different categories simple and
cheap intermediate and difficult and

332
00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:25,200
expensive in

333
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,559
what's interesting is is that the study
concluded that

334
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,900
the the investment that what was
required

335
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,480
to mitigate these threats that
originated inside the firewall

336
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,610
for the most part fell in the simple and
cheap category

337
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,230
and that's the the opportunity that that
that we and others are

338
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:47,070
going after in this marketplace

339
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:51,230
so with that I'll open up to for anyone
has any questions to

340
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:58,230
yes

341
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:04,370
it's it's not a 2.1 X which is the first
big difference

342
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:09,710
okay we use it or 2.1 cue so so we can
control access down to the veal and

343
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,250
level

344
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,899
and were integrated with most of the
major manufacturers that are to know

345
00:20:13,899 --> 00:20:14,850
when he switches

346
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:21,850
for the vast majority of the other nap
solutions are 80 2.1 X

347
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,250
agent-based number one um so

348
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,470
from an agent less a so first things
were

349
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:36,460
where where agents second thing is we're
not in line

350
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:41,679
third thing is that we can scale and
were optimized around that small to

351
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,909
medium business in that small to medium
enterprise

352
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:50,909
not authorized around trying to sell
into the fortune 1000

353
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:04,540
that

354
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:11,720
we do we we look at your place we're not
suggesting that we replace a

355
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,840
a McAfee mcafee endpoint zero-day
protection or semantic et cetera

356
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,890
they're looking at it from a heuristic a

357
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:23,150
point of view in a signature point of
view so though

358
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:26,680
one is about 90 those vendors out there
that make integrate

359
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,080
in point AV zero-day protection

360
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,750
none of them were 100 percent effective
but there's always that last window

361
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,370
where

362
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:38,740
the signature hasn't been created the
the device has and download the latest

363
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,320
the database et cetera

364
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,600
so what we're doing to augment that is
were looking for

365
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,430
a basic destination IP addresses

366
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:51,940
that would match a list of known Alcon
sites

367
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,960
so we're looking for any type a traffic
that's going back to unknown

368
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,420
malware call back URL we don't know what
kinda now we have we don't know where

369
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,390
you got it but there's no reason you
should be sending a single packet that

370
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,280
particular site

371
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:10,430
we do something we do some white packet
inspection so either

372
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:14,810
you to connect to the span cordova
switch look at AmeriCorps to look at it

373
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:15,380
that way

374
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,920
or use an untapped device of all the
ports in the back or appliance

375
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:25,920
Sr

376
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,060
yes if they're looking more at traffic
doing deep packet inspection

377
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,970
we're looking at as a primary level
we're looking at

378
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:44,210
assets so we're we're more concerned
about

379
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:49,080
mac Address is and devices as opposed to

380
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,980
looking at packets in controlling user
behavior and making sure that

381
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,630
you know the bat that could stoke
getting only the good packets getting

382
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:00,790
doing anything in that regard we don't
know if we're saying

383
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:04,490
the device is authorized you can get on
the sales Vonn

384
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:09,260
it's not infected what that device does
one sits on the lawn

385
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,070
we have no visibility thats kinda you
know another
