19
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,340
except I've been attending a month to
the talks and

20
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,219
I've really liked a lot of what i've
heard there's been some great technical

21
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:25,710
contact: this year

22
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,830
a.m.

23
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:31,210
but have already decided that I've won
because the one thing that is still

24
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,030
messing

25
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:36,350
from the discourse in the dialogue and
year just for granting and fuckin crazy

26
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,330
as a raving

27
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,680
which is that's what that that's this
home

28
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,729
as a level of accountability for
industry were still patting ourselves on

29
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,850
the back trying to solve the world's
problems

30
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,170
but spending like no time looking
internally

31
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:55,060
as to you why it is that maybe we're not
solving some of those problems as fast

32
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:55,659
as we could

33
00:01:55,659 --> 00:02:00,330
so a.m. so anyway

34
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:05,250
by gay and taken off the ground and the
reason that I'm taking off the crown is

35
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:05,690
cuz

36
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:09,519
I don't want to be the only person I
don't want to be the only voice

37
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:13,610
thats out here talkin shit about what's
wrong with

38
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:18,459

70
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,680
rate Chris I mean do. that's what search
do so multiple choice

71
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,919

75
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,930
which but

76
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,509
so so rid CC the gases see

77
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:56,199
the air I'll the answers all of the
above mother fuckers

78
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:59,449
the truth of the matter is I'm not half
bad

79
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:03,819
what I do for a living doesn't have shit
to do with the pilot plaques on my desk

80
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:08,960
I'm by I'm also not half bad at taking
multiple choice exams but I can't

81
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,529
remember the last time I was at work and
somebody said

82
00:05:11,529 --> 00:05:15,659
quick your honed do you a or do you be

83
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:21,589
or do you see right and I can't remember
the last time

84
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:25,419
as ash from the start but I had to fire
a Photoshop so

85
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:29,539
so there you go so

86
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:32,719
our day book what's what what the fuck
is my point

87
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:35,839
right whitewater so let's talk about
certification

88
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,969
as an industry body cuz because let's
admit it this industry

89
00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:44,419
I T in general completely culpable
InfoSec

90
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:48,839
maybe a little bit worse I mean I so the
DOD

91
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:52,620
doesn't require that you have your MCSE
to work on their servers like they'll

92
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:52,999
take

93
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:56,319
dude I'll take a they'll take a grime
leg right out a basic

94
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,979
and if he says yeah I like computers the
full image from the the store on nt4

95
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:04,249
this through the commitment from the
Windows Server they don't care that he

96
00:06:04,249 --> 00:06:06,640
doesn't have an MCSE

97
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,020
but if you want to go do Lake you know
cyber

98
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,870
security for the DOD you have to have a
sis be so

99
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,860
so what's the value right i mean if
we're ever so obsessed with these things

100
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,990
why what we what are we really getting
out a bit

101
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,129
so

102
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:25,439
their tool for your HR department right
the idea is that this makes it possible

103
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:28,569
for human resources to do hiring and
recruiting around the particular skill

104
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:31,729
sets that they need to this is hard
security is hard I'm not gonna lie to

105
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:32,119
you

106
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:35,669
without how I'm probably preaching to
the choir you now

107
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:39,669
right so if I wanna be a Windows guy how
much do I have to now

108
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:42,970
about be GrpN HSRP

109
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,330
exactly jack shit right and that's a
maybe I do know some stuff but I don't

110
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,000
have to

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,520
if I'm a UNIX guy how much do I have to
know

112
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,600
about you know registry hives

113
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,830
not a damn thing if I were to insecurity

114
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:03,290
have to know all that shit on I at least
all the shit to my employer as

115
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:08,700
so it's hard for HR so what about you

116
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,470
well you'd like that job the end of the
day you'd like to

117
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,510
move ahead you like to do some new stuff
you want your career

118
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:19,860
to progress so you don't get those certs
in hopes of getting better job

119
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,150
get a raise at your current job get a
new job go to Washington

120
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:29,200
centered ass watch logs

121
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,560
make six figures packed do you seriously
we do that Tammy T

122
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,380
okay and then after the certification
body a fight at this is america

123
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:40,970
let me go cash private enterprise 3
market right if we have

124
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:45,030
the certification program that everybody
wants then

125
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,780
everybody's gonna come to us and we'll
make money it's a quality product this

126
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,100
is a free market right we are

127
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,140
we are adding value it's it's it's all
good

128
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,850
I think we're gonna spend a little time
examining you to these and I

129
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:00,030
bad a bad all the people certifications
in the room they're really good a

130
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,800
multiple choice questions have already
figured out the answer

131
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,990
because there is only one right answer

132
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,080
so raise your hand if you're I TPG
certified

133
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,410
as a room full love you here you don't
even know it

134
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,980
in 2001 I S E to choose the certificate

135
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:23,340
the the certification body by NCIS is BS
SEP in

136
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,770
like four other search for you can
become like a

137
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:31,990
developer Eunos saw for security life
cycle all back up in Dr

138
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:35,440
nearly business continuity you do all
that stuff go get a search

139
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,430
that I see two years earlier company
called I TPG does it

140
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:45,070
I TPG generates the courseware for all
the exams so the camera body of

141
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,470
knowledge like the whole thing

142
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,470
everything that goes into the exams as
report together by this company

143
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,650
they do all the pre review courses race
for those people that show up with the

144
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,630
isc2 pains at the classes for any of you
who've done that

145
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:00,480
don't even work try to see to work for a
company called ATPG

146
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,940
and they're not really supposed to tell
you that although I mean let's be honest

147
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,650
I got this

148
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:08,410

Pradesh

150
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,900

151
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,650
is now we're so I don't think it's like
a big secret but

152
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:25,500
they do all other marketing to so right
for the market the stuff

153
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,970
the market HR departments the market it
into the industry they did a fantastic

154
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,710
job in marketing it to the federal
government

155
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,680
they run all the classes that people pay
for they put all

156
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,620
all the books that people pay for they
run all the tests that people pay for

157
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,710
so what but the fact is she do

158
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:48,170
do but what what do they do

159
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,060
alright this non-profit collects 23
million dollars in revenue

160
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:57,640
from I TPG each year believes this is
the last year I think it at one point it

161
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,390
was as low as $6 million dollars

162
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,860
for for running 0 a website and mailing
you pieces of paper

163
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:08,550
so hot I am in the wrong we are all in
the wrong business are we

164
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:15,110
so by the way

165
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:19,550
pay attention to the titles on my slide
so

166
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:24,030
the CISSP common body of knowledge
currently has 10 domains

167
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:29,820
to pass that exam you're supposed to be
proficient in all those domains

168
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,480
and each exam soon a 50 question six
hours one sitting

169
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,340
a I know there's like a there's like a
lite version is this where Lake you know

170
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:41,680
if 250 in six hours is too hard it's
like a hundred and three hours

171
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,040
really

172
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,980
I'm but anyway so that's what the test
consists serve and that's all it takes

173
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,120
to get certified is to go through the
process

174
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,340
and take the exam and then you and then
you get somebody laid out for you and

175
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,700
say that you know in some a copy of your
resume which they don't validate

176
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,590
and somebody puts a a number on the
thing and signs it like there that

177
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,970
person but they're not really

178
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,050
the other just checking the name and the
number validation

179
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:09,670
the so anyway so I'm I'm not saying

180
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:13,029
you could lie and kisses P

181
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:19,000
but you could art tho

182
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,810
I decided that that the O evidence-based

183
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:28,250
arguments are the most effective so
here's a graph

184
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:32,510
this graph is um a frequency very calm
and it looks like button on the screen

185
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,790
doesn't matter yeah

186
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,840
alright so I will walk you through this
because it was so bad

187
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,710
right so this piece of the pie a

188
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:46,270
right here is 50 questions in the 250
and they tell you this going in

189
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:50,800
are for a.m. yet for the next to love
tests

190
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,940
right so 50 on don't count only 200 mm
do they don't tell you which ones

191
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,520
a but if you've taken the exam in the
last four years you can clearly tell

192
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,250
because they're not even for this SB
anymore

193
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:05,430
they clearly on some other subject
matter so now they got 47 exams in

194
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,300
rotation

195
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,590
across the entire day event they refresh
a handful the questions every year but

196
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,770
they're spending almost no money
developing messer

197
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:16,170
and instead you're paying 600 bucks for
the privileged cuing the new product

198
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,150
that they're gonna sell you

199
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:20,760
next month so that's the green pie

200
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,210
the rest to this legal regulations
governance and risk management

201
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:29,140
right security architecture and design

202
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,660
make up the rest that the majority of
the questions on the tests that I

203
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,270
sampled

204
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:38,320
and those are you in the room that have
taken it going how are you

205
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,380
you sample past how many times did you
take fucking

206
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:47,760
easy just want my past and one but I
will show you my secret

207
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,180
so and then I broke it down and

208
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,770
and do you notice anything about the top
where the slivers get really really thin

209
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:58,620
right like so what appear in these three
ten little slivers rate

210
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,890
fi sack OPSEC crypto

211
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:07,400
and then over here BCP and network
security

212
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,450
so guess what you can pass without
knowing any of the technical domains for

213
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,560
she acted

214
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,380
you can I don't I don't know how one
question

215
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,240
in operational security or physical
security qualifies you as

216
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,630
is his profession how high is that
France posed to be

217
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:29,200
move six min triggered relation to an
expert white

218
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,750
I wish I was kidding

219
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:36,620
but those have you have done it know
it's true

220
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:40,230
sorry because you spend a lot of time
and money

221
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:43,580
but you know it's true so I'm

222
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,990
where they get itself I'm there some
web-sites

223
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:52,610
on this internet thing where you can
just download

224
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,310
reso so in addition to Lake you don't
even have to be technically proficient

225
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,640
in the thing that they can they're gonna
certified as being proficient and even

226
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,560
pass the exam

227
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,010
but this dudes so you're gonna take the
CISSP next week I take it

228
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,070
get a good picture so

229
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:11,560
well good luck II I

230
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,210
so so there's the other safe for you to
download the questions

231
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:18,910
right and I and and answers and

232
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:22,490
and practice on real questions on the
test now admittedly

233
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:26,960
the one thing that that that I TPG has
going for this SB is that there are 47

234
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,720
versions the exam at two under 50
questions apiece

235
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,480
so I can't quite do the math all in my
head but that something like ten

236
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,370
thousand questions you'd have to
memorize

237
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,870
and at that point like you you don't
really need it she

238
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:44,530
if you can memorize 10,000 questions you
ought to be able to pretty much kick ass

239
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,660
at every

240
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,760
multiple choice test you take over the
course your career

241
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,140
so but actually the best part the reason
I included this is an act as I wanted to

242
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,240
like bragging I second tired at the
CISSP questioned

243
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,680
who cares I i mean this is me on Google
and you can do it too

244
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,210
but the best part the best part is so
the bottom and these are the raw folks

245
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:07,110
sure on this part say registered for
like some you some account anonymously

246
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:10,240
and they put all the stuff on there any
comment on in like most it's like

247
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,490
yeah I totally like download this study
for like two weeks impasse then lakes

248
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:18,550
sweet it really works right oh and by
the way you're supposed to pay a 149

249
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,480
bucks for these

250
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,530
but I figure if Lake you're in this
industry the fact that entail 149 bucks

251
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:26,600
to download from your site could you say
such as your problem not mine

252
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,860
so

253
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,020
am but the best part is this the fuckin
to comment on this

254
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:38,120
fresh so I i did. if you can't see it
this guy just click

255
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,690
so this guy who is totally okay

256
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:46,600
with cheating to get the certification
cuz he's registered for citing is paying

257
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,120
for these things to download them

258
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,360
and pad his resume without actually
learning any this stuff

259
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,630
is backing on the CISSP is worthless

260
00:15:55,630 --> 00:16:00,700
I'm gonna span 750 bucks to get a CISSP
in a week

261
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,960
and and by the way it's still fucking
sucks don't do it

262
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,130
but I mean is 0

263
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:12,600
first ask yourself in a CISSP is worth
it league only cost you 150 bucks should

264
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,890
he do you think it is

265
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,090
so sorry I couldn't not put that up
there

266
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:21,460
that the lake morally bankrupt awake
resume pirate

267
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:25,590
downloading the stuff right not the guy
who's trying to elevate this

268
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:28,560
the right not to another guy who's
trying to be at the happy oh that the

269
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,420
high-minded guy in the industry saying
like

270
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:34,250
CISSP isn't enough it is a really sorry
finally the technical you wouldn't want

271
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,290
to put a person in front of like
anything

272
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:40,120
you know important the old maybe it's a
good for

273
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,120
you know general knowledge base but you
know you're alright let whatever their

274
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,130
arguments that is that's not this guy

275
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,160
this cash this guys like disguised

276
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:56,160
you this case apart I mean you know
pirate and whatever you are but but he

277
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,460
took time out from his day

278
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,090
in which he clearly doesn't give a fuck
to look back on the CIA as as be on this

279
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:02,980
site where like

280
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,500
you're just downloading it to cheat some
awesome

281
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,180
so awesome

282
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:15,490
okay so I am so there's there's been
this thing going on lately

283
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:19,570
around the CISSP and I be loath to not
talk about it

284
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:24,360
just because the the reality of the
situation is that there are people that

285
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,640
are still invested right there people
who have not divorce themselves from the

286
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,800
SIS be exam yet

287
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,389
okay and and smart people people that
like are good at what they do

288
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:38,010
so there's a there's the the the four
horsemen to the cyst pakalert II added

289
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,850
this is popular because I more clever
but they came up with the four horsemen

290
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:41,240
shit

291
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,990
so do anyway these are these are for
guys that are you know this is like the

292
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:51,140
Def Con crowd rates early Dave Lewis
from liquid matrix Chris nickerson from

293
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:51,780
layers

294
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,290
I'm Scott turbine who some grumpy
podcaster

295
00:17:55,290 --> 00:18:00,110
and boris who's a sir or market these
guys on a podcast by the way

296
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:04,620
but the so they all came up with the
idea that they were going to run for

297
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,840
the isc2 border directors to try and you
know

298
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,020
shake it up make a little change try and
steer the organization in the right

299
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,170
direction

300
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,570
well we're not very far along this
process

301
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:21,320
but truman didn't make it because they
had a whole bunch of their

302
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,100
tf2 get like enough sponsors head-to-toe
review petition to get

303
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,030
in the running for the border directors
name get enough it so they got enough

304
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,950
signatures but then a bunch of a more
like to run out as they were phony

305
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,230
because like you know hey i'd

306
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:37,490
I trolled Twitter for a buncha people to
sign my petition

307
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:41,840
like no shipping on all CIS espy's but

308
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,430
so so been a little bit about the two
guys that didn't make it in

309
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,510
because I know I'm talking to a roomful
of people who who

310
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,970
some %uh view a good number love you
have this yr or are thinking about the

311
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,160
server might have some other I see to
search

312
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,940
whatever the case may be so Dave Lewis
from likud major Exxon I'm gonna fuck

313
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,140
with day/date a badass

314
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:02,230
if you if you don't check out the good
natured start like these like the one

315
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:02,650
guy

316
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:06,360
i think is and he's Canadian to a I am

317
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,340
cases is kinda tryna pushing things in a
positive direction and then there's

318
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,340
chris Nickerson who is my fucking hero

319
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:16,990
so this is this isn't like my total Lake
rabbit hole sidebar thing like

320
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,750
so the if you don't know who Chris
nickerson as

321
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:24,860
Chris niggaz n and a and a guy named
Ryan other guy named Luke

322

bigger team anybody fuckin clap for
Tiger Team that's right

325
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:41,090
so they start on this show called Tiger
team that was it if you haven't seen it

326
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,740
you gotta go find this shit on you to be

327
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,760
fuckin awesome it is this reality show
about Penn testers

328
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,100
they do like mixed vector

329
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,410
a physical pain tax rates are like like
they'll hack your

330
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,720
the hack your learn cistern the hack
your phone says the the social your

331
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,390
people and then a break in your shit

332
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:05,010
and like you knows all intended to be
this league really awesome expose

333
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:09,350
but so there's two episodes and in the
pilot episode they break into this high

334
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:13,140
and Beverly Hills car dealership and
they drop necklace chaise docks and they

335
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,410
get a any shooting the show gets fucking
cancelled

336
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:20,429
but this is how much of a badass Chris
nickerson fucking is and why is my

337
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:21,270
fucking hero

338
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:26,140
so like to show totally gets cancelled
eastward flaky a it did they they all

339
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,420
change our jobs they'll go different
ways now

340
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:33,350
and and try again and and they make a
sitcom

341
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:38,140
about this that you might have heard ov
called breaking in

342
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:42,470
Chris nickerson got my complete bikes
christian slater in a sitcom how awesome

343
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,020
is this guy seriously

344
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:50,030
like I got my employer sued for duck for
dropping docks on cable TV and they make

345
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,190
a show about me starring Christian
Slater

346
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:55,290
box the so awesome so

347
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:58,570

crush interest nickerson

348
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:02,260
any and somebody's gonna email the like
a link to this video to a mic for months

349
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:02,670
from now

350
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:06,970
should be who the fuck is this creepy
guy I'll

351
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:10,920
and I'm just I'm just a fan at the art
man that's all it is

352
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:16,890
solace alright so that can all I have to
say about CISSP other than just to say

353
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:17,270
that

354
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:20,500
if if you give a shit if you wanna see
change

355
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,350
we might have a moment I'm not highly
optimistic because

356
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,860
that's not my job as a whole lot funnier
to get up here and back

357
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,990
shit that's gone wrong and celebrate
stuff that goes right

358
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,590
was it easy so but at the same time

359
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:39,470
you know if if you're if you're going to
vote for board of directors or even if

360
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,980
you were going to maybe especially if
you were going to

361
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:45,559
and you think maybe you'd like to see if
we can do something

362
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:49,190
about making the icy to search not total
garbage

363
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:53,100
like the next sir I'm about to talk
about oh yeah

364
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,000
a give you one guess anyway I'm

365
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,880
but the the year so maybe

366
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:07,880
maybe consider voting for these guys I
and the border directorship

367
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,409
writer who is a

368
00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:14,159
who had the gas for life was up next hmm

369
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,440
fish you guys are experts but yet as
course it's

370
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:23,100
courses the CE H+ the Certified Ethical
Hacker or as I like to call it how to

371
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:27,190
get rich by rewriting the and Matt man
page in question form its diseases like

372
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:31,200
it some

373
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,260
that some guy that I got fired from
jeopardy

374
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,809
from the writings that was just let you
know what I'm going to do I'm gonna go

375
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:38,139
take the technical docs

376
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:42,440
and reword them in the form of a
question ants

377
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,570
you britt exactly what is dash

378
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:50,750
H

379
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:55,240
what is Google dot com okay so so and
the ec-council

380
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,940
I if you if you don't follow attrition
in the air at a project

381
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:03,750
I'm they've got caught selling material
with play dress content like their books

382
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,310
on like how to be a Certified Ethical
Hacker

383
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:11,280
I'm at let me say that again their book
on how to be a certified

384
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,560
for call hacker contain plagiarize
content that they ripped off the

385
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,060
internet

386
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,450
so I'm

387
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,450
what their yes sounds legit

388
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:27,260
shoot up so you i jus there so bad
they've got their own charlton page on

389
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,900
attrition dark and if you go well

390
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,810
okay so what the fuck does that mean
that they are petition that are down the

391
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,730
child into page

392
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:37,980
right dude along with the shady fucker
to give it up for my man Greg Evans from

393
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:44,020
work at the only man to ever be
threatened with having is CISSP revoked

394
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:47,190
lucky for him he was lying about it

395
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:50,870
so

396
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:55,140
he is in fact reasonably decent with
Photoshop

397
00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:00,860
okay so the statistical analysis wins
all arguments

398
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:06,150
I i went ahead and took a summer the
overrode not some of the questions that

399
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,210
from the ch

400
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,679
is just the one I'll balls so

401
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,890
you the one question set for the current
reading CH

402
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:19,890
and I and their work domain since I
kinda had to make my own

403
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:24,179
but I figured certified that means I
pass the test

404
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:27,640
ethical I know something about at 6

405
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,929
hacker I know something about hacking
and I filled out the question what I

406
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:34,460
quickly discovered as they relate to
other categories

407
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:40,039
right security networking and
definitions what does the Fed flag do it

408
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:40,750
easy P

409
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:44,649
we're legitimate technical question

410
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:48,299
you can google the answer to or open
security tools

411
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:54,309
how do I perform a Christmas can with an
app the answer to both those questions

412
00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:55,659
by the way is

413
00:24:55,659 --> 00:25:01,720
Google mother fucker and then there were
a handful the questions on affects

414
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,500
and exactly zero questions on hacking

415
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,789
and you go okay we'll wait wait bullet
bullet

416
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:12,299
I mean maybe you're just being a dick
might you duh

417
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:16,710
baby but maybe you're being a dick and
maybe they really are questions about

418
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:17,460
hacking

419
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,779
okay but so here's what I would expect
to see in a certification that was going

420
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:24,070
to pick demonstrate that you had some
ability to hack

421
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:27,990
because let's call hacking exploitation
especially if it's offense if security

422
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:30,890
which is that the cEAT supposed to be
right this is the

423
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:34,690
I'm a baby penthouse tercer so

424
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:37,419
you have not trying to be a dick but
really honestly if you're just getting

425
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:39,299
the CDH like not a pro

426
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:42,399
right anyway I'm so Jojo

427
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:47,360
this is the this would be the cert where
I would expect us to show

428
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,019
right like oh here's an array into a
char pointer with no bounds checking

429
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:57,029
I am which of these answers would
successfully exploit this we're just

430
00:25:57,029 --> 00:26:00,830
tell me what kinda vulnerability is in
this code

431
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:03,389
okay so I just gave it to you somebody
shouted out what what kinda

432
00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:04,909
vulnerability I just described

433
00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:08,489
fuck yeah overflow right

434
00:26:08,489 --> 00:26:14,009
valid easy wasn't it do that ninety nine
more times and you could be certified in

435
00:26:14,009 --> 00:26:15,230
something better

436
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:18,289
the Certified Ethical Hacker we could do
this right now

437
00:26:18,289 --> 00:26:24,389
right self right if I put

438
00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:29,399
you no question mark equals script alert
dot fuck you

439
00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:33,340
in an earl in a box pops on your screen
what's that called

440
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:38,500
that's right me

441
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,170
there you go okay see this isn't hard
this is easy but

442
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:45,400
but that's my point to rate is is that
that there was none

443
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,620
there's none of that it's like this is
this this is that

444
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:51,680
the army so these definitions right they
would ask you to

445
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,440
to define certain security terms and you
know but

446
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,150
I can't believe how much of that is
really about like password hashes

447
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:02,210
Mike I

448
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:03,890
again John

449
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:09,100
dash %eh okay so when this is this is a
course

450
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,440
grade the site where I downloaded the
same stuff from ec-council and just to

451
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,620
prove my earlier point

452
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,790
I'm red I passed on September 14 like
fuckin two weeks ago

453
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:22,810
who's got past with 86 rate me get this
guy oh there's like five questions that

454
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,020
are changed

455
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,080
and there's another guy hears three and
by the way here the questions and

456
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,900
answers

457
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,870
so like like a really honestly go
download this go pay to take the test

458
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:32,950
you will pass

459
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:37,210
mush pasa so so

460
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:41,520
let's check back in on the case for
certifications

461
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:47,370
so how do we do great HR hiring and
recruiting

462
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:51,740
our certs a good way to validate that
people actually have the skills that

463
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:56,830
they say they have

464
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,540
crickets

465
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:01,630
who yep so course for you

466
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:05,660
our course if you're in a jar and your
job is to read resumes and you're not a

467
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,840
technical person

468
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,550
and your job is to find somebody who is
technically qualified to do a job and

469
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,380
you're using search your fact

470
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:19,380
sorry used the word is going to do your
job and get paid I suspect but

471
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,920
at the end of the day you're you your
mission to leverage certifications to

472
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,080
get skilled technical people

473
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,400
daughter is clearly being undermined
actively

474
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,100
right there's a market for not learning
the shit to get the search

475
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,320
and oh by the way just because I passed
the exam even if I didn't she

476
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,240
this still doesn't mean have been tax
burden the K

477
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,679
so your professional advancement

478
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,730
you just dropped three grand to go spend
a week in Chicago

479
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:50,289
studying in cramming for your CISSP you
worked in the industry for four years

480
00:28:50,289 --> 00:28:53,470
you read all eight have shot harris's
books and if you ever meter you're gonna

481
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,289
choke her out

482
00:28:54,289 --> 00:29:01,289
you been buying practice exam so long
boatswain has breached your credit card

483
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,869
twice

484
00:29:02,869 --> 00:29:09,869
and you are frayed and frazzled and you
said through a fucking scantron test

485
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,080
like it was

486
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:15,600
1988 fares Bueller

487
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,590
just to then go awkwardly ask somebody
at an Issa meeting to sponsor you so she

488
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:23,780
could desertification and you finally
get it and you go to your boss and you

489
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,810
realize that some

490
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:29,910
dickhead spent 150 bucks to do the exact
same thing you've been doing six months

491
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:30,400
time

492
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,970
and your boss knows it now

493
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:37,150
to somebody send a link to my video will
be on for months

494
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:42,260
right like you so what does it do to you
what does it do to your bottom line

495
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:45,080
how do the people that are aware that
this game is going on tell the

496
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,980
difference between this and the person
who like grounded out really knows what

497
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,020
the hell they're doing in the person
that has cheated

498
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:54,230
they don't

499
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,450
so you've been ripped off

500
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:59,169
or use Oct cheater you

501
00:29:59,169 --> 00:30:02,470
so-and-so how to search benefit you

502
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:07,549
if you're and an ethical douchebag

503
00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:10,340
anybody disagree okay so

504
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:13,490
so who's our winner of course

505
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:17,620
of course right I see two is raking in
the dough they do. dear crimes fucking

506
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:22,380
call so gold butts are all these others
because it's an industry everybody wants

507
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:25,510
to get into you come at a college in
already got experience is really hurt

508
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,919
real above a bar get a certain its you
know

509
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,030
why because it's in the job posting days
to come

510
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:35,290
you know it Haulover so they're raking
in the money

511
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:38,860
and ultimately eventually you the stuff
is going to stop being

512
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:43,100
of high-value both to employers into the
people pursuing certifications

513
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,830
trying to get a career in this field

514
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:49,960
sucks really sucks so

515
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,070

oh okay wait I'm in our time you get
back to you in a minute

525
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:34,299
Saints so here's the thing I'm gonna
talk about fans in a second but if

526
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:35,549
you're trying to tell me that

527
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:40,730
a sans like a any the G Akshay at Silver
level is any better than any other stuff

528
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,480
I just going back and I call bullshit

529
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,520
I do it's bullshit now I'm not saying
that the material in the in the courses

530
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:46,940
in there

531
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:50,990
isn't good but do you think if I went to
another part of the site may be able to

532
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,809
find the stamps q's and a's

533
00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:57,610
I will I will give you I will give you a
hint the answer is fuck yeah I did

534
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:03,490
I mean could so

535
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:08,610
but I'm gonna skip around and go back to
your point but CNN's gold

536
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:12,659
break so this is instructor-led stuff
but then you have the right

537
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:16,460
a practical write a paper get a
peer-reviewed have somebody that has

538
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,270
some cried

539
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:21,700
look over what you had to do and say hey
this guy actually knows some what he's

540
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,630
talking about

541
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:25,480
one of the problems that they're still
having in golden it's not it's not

542
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,630
rampant but if I can could become that
they've gold becomes the sand gold

543
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:30,090
search

544
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:33,990
become like a thing is is the plagiarism
issue

545
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:37,590
right plagiarism is a is a is actually
for whatever reason a horrible problem I

546
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:40,200
know what it is right is because
security still trying to figure out how

547
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,250
the fuck you do this as a as a job

548
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:46,190
rate we're like if you're a Microsoft
engineer Microsoft listen to the book

549
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:50,789
right like I mean I'm gonna I'm not say
and that doesn't require talent and

550
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:54,380
skill and knowledge base and experience
to know that but at the end to the day

551
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:58,020
there's kinda once or so truth for how
to work with and products that are made

552
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:58,880
by a vendor

553
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,930
with security it's a it's a whole broad
field so

554
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:06,630
but getting some peer review ray getting
some be ok demonstrating that you can

555
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,170
actually

556
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:12,150
put together and collate some parts
around what it is that

557
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:16,770
that that you wanna the the you want to
put out there as positive

558
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:22,270
I am you security research well they
demonstrate something more then

559
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:26,830
I guess D enough times correctly by
Cisco CCIE

560
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:31,510
not only is this probably the hardest to
cheat at because you have to fly out for

561
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,910
the fuckin lab practical

562
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:36,990
this is the hardest sir to fake did you
know that they don't print a paper

563
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:40,710
search for the CCAA I know I try to try
to get one for the for the deck

564
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:45,080
and what they actually do is they
engrave a plaque it's like a glass like

565
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,480
laser etched plaque is a real bitch to
get one

566
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,760
to end it in it Anna and the guy at the
the trophy store couldn't get it to be

567
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,440
quick enough

568
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,800
for today should I mean every nobody can
get those they're totally affordable

569
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,250
so and then offense if security I am

570
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:03,540
you're there a I haven't seen anybody
tryin

571
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,800
and I mean I looked around and I
couldn't find anybody cheatin' on the

572
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,830
on a awee year they w/e I'm

573
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:12,870
I think the backtrack certs a little
cheesy

574
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:15,970
by you know it is what it is um but it
for

575
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,700
for those of you that don't know when
you actually go to take the AW

576
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,700
recertification

577
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:23,929
like you get actual binaries and you
have a 72 hour clock that there I'm

578
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:27,300
to do whatever you can to come up with
an exploit an acute right thing that you

579
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,429
can't research

580
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:32,360
so the only way to achieve is to get
somebody leaked opponent for you

581
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,409
I mean so I guess you could

582
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:39,240
you the really I mean if it is that that
point you're smart enough to her hackers

583
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,320
could get to see a españa become a
manager

584
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:48,320
ago and hey that will make you at least
top 50 percent as you knew where to find

585
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:52,000
a real hacker

586
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,340
so

587
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:59,170
okay so how do we change this at the end
of the day the employers a key

588
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:02,490
right i mean this is this is simple
trickle-down economics right

589
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:05,950
the employers are leveraging search to
find people hired to pay their

590
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:09,580
those people that would like to get that
money or that have that money and want

591
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,660
more of that money

592
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:14,780
are the ones paying to take the
certifications and then that money goes

593
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,180
in large volumes into the hands

594
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:21,270
the certifying bodies the companies that
do this stuff

595
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:24,610
so the end of the day employers have got
to get out

596
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:27,930
love the paper have it and actually
start asking people to demonstrate

597
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:28,750
skills

598
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:32,000
now I want to tell you a sad little
story

599
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,290
but its it's sad because it's a sad
commentary on the world

600
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:39,580
I did in fact get hired at that job

601
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:43,520
at Speedway back in college and Speedway

602
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,400
is the only company to have ever
required me

603
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,830
to test on skills I had to pass a bad
past

604
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:56,550
I had to pass I shit you not that maybe
put the smack on the right way like the

605
00:35:56,550 --> 00:36:00,910
the cheesy I think they're polos now
it's Peter and I don't go inside hit the

606
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,050
power brake but

607
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:06,510
the you but but back then you had to
wear a smock

608
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:09,740
and you had to put it on right and and
then they made me

609
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:14,110
I and then they may be count make change
that was the last time I spoke in

610
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:17,330
eighteen years old is the last time
somebody asked me to prove that I knew

611
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:21,090
how to do the job they were hiring me
for and in just taken off my resume

612
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:24,590
a guy is a nice guy and he's like not
totally socially retarded so

613
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:29,210
will bring him in they didn't know I'd
just land halfway decent social engineer

614
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:33,580
ever I I read the the are the deception
that I got a good

615
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:38,520
today

616
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,640
but by the way shout out to to kevin
Mitnick for agreed to be my opening act

617
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,570
today that was so

618
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:48,460
so nice for them to fly out for their
cell

619
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:52,020
alright so focus on skills test for them
in interviews

620
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,800
there is nothing I was sitting across
the table from somebody that you're

621
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,960
trying to hire making them do something
really hard on the spot this is security

622
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,540
after a

623
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:01,610
we was going to do clues to make
somebody do that would under pressure

624
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:02,650
thirteeners

625
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:06,220
fuck you have you ever had a bad day in
security like do you have any idea how

626
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,760
horrible it can be issued by

627
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,540
you should be good under pressure if you
crumble under pressure even if you know

628
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,910
the technical should get out

629
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:19,910
go teach I hear it. PD is hiring

630
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:27,300
alright so yes stop relying on certs

631
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,840
and at the very least here's the other
thing for all the times that I've ever

632
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,420
applied to a job in Lake

633
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:35,580
send them a copy like just a photocopy
love

634
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:38,730
love certifications that I have to
qualify for you for the job you know how

635
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,430
many times they verify their

636
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:45,090
exactly zero right I mean is so if you
back up like those

637
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:48,320
you know I don't know many people caught
it early totally would like but with all

638
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,740
the numbers on those certain stuff
fairly

639
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:54,180
midsummer me easy summer here a little
harder you can

640
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:58,450
you know asking about later but anyway
the

641
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:01,580
bill 0.08 is so that you can validate

642
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:06,440
the that's a real certification right
except for the fact that like you know

643
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,020
if you're lucky enough to have a pretty
common name you may just

644
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,930
you'll be able to go search the registry
for your own name in the pot on there

645
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:12,970
any Photoshop shit

646
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:15,880
but it doesn't matter cuz they will look
anyway they just won't work they don't

647
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,500
look

648
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,760
HR doesn't care they're not interested
in spending any time

649
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,950
doing anymore research they like poets
on their can I get a copy copy be

650
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:27,820
something that has the same Mike four
letters hun it is the

651
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:32,109
thing re probably never even seen one
before so

652
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:35,670
so it starts with the employer and
realistically I think for the IT

653
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:38,570
management and the roommate is not fair
to ask HR

654
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:42,099
to get on board with this I mean it you
know just say to them like I don't care

655
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:45,359
so much about certs are not spend so
much time on certain looking for certain

656
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,730
keywords or whatever

657
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:50,420
but admit hiring people is just gonna be
hard

658
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:54,210
and it's worth doing even though it's
gonna be hard rates were

659
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:58,349
it's worth it's worth taking the time to
get the right people on your team

660
00:38:58,349 --> 00:39:01,730
rather than ending up with you
government

661
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:06,089
there so

662
00:39:06,089 --> 00:39:08,900
for the rest have you in the room though
that are going to do any hiring illegal

663
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,950
voting this was always to 40 minutes
thanks a lot asshole

664
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:15,400
so but that

665
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,660
but no you you have something to do this
to ride

666
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:22,260
I don't hire people I don't wanna be
hired then lead by example

667
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:27,580
right step up be be an example %uh what
you want the industry to be like instead

668
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,140
of

669
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:31,390
because everybody's running around
getting the search even the people like

670
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:31,950
me

671
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:35,380
baguette I could totally get that like
I'm a fucking hypocrite

672
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:39,099
I own that I'm really good at it

673
00:39:39,099 --> 00:39:43,880
but those but the reality is it raises
were all just chasing cert

674
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,349
we're all just running around like
trying to put alphabet soup on our

675
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:48,000
resumes

676
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,760
because we think that's how people will
judge our skill and our ability to your

677
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,359
job

678
00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:56,130
then we as legitimate security
practitioners

679
00:39:56,130 --> 00:40:01,180
just for their the myth that that really
is what matters

680
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:04,560
right so the next time somebody sends me
a resume

681
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:11,560
with their name comma some certification
I like I am so tempted to use tear it up

682
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:23,380
at yet no thank you I email them back
and say no thank you

683
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:28,630
thanks but no thank you how next year
you to come up here do this you're

684
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,200
bigger dick than me that's awesome

685
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,830
so

686
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:38,670
um you you throw like a sis p

687
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:45,670

689
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:56,250
anyway so talk about your
accomplishments ray if you've been in

690
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:59,580
this industry for years long enough to
go get your CISSP

691
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,980
if that's the coolest thing you can put
on your resume 5 back

692
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:07,480
right do something interesting right
even if your job sucks cuz

693
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,900
cuz admittedly some part of everybody's
job sucks and some other people in this

694
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,900
room have jobs that

695
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:17,680

698
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,240
past two days

699
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,950
that guy's job is worse than yours to
point that out

700
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:35,500
I'm so even if you don't have anything
called put on your resume because you

somebody

703
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:45,080
who's like and and I can I can think I
have at least a half dozen people in

704

involved and it's gotten

708
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:00,520

908
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:27,960
recertification

909
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:32,190
like you get actual binaries and you
have a 72 hour clock that there I'm

910
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:35,560
to do whatever you can to come up with
an exploit in a contrived thing that you

911
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,670
can't research

912
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:40,620
so the only way to achieve is to get
somebody lied to pony up for you

913
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:43,670
I mean so I guess you could

914
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:47,500
you the really I mean if it is that that
point you're smart enough to her hackers

915
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,580
could get to see a españa become a
manager

916
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:56,580
bigger and hey that will make you at
least top 50 percent cuz you knew where

917
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:00,280
to find a real hacker

918
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:03,600
so

919
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:07,430
okay so how do we change this at the end
of the day the employers a key

920
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:10,750
right i mean this is this is simple
trickle-down economics right

921
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:14,220
the employers are leveraging search to
find people hired to pay their

922
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:17,850
those people that would like to get that
money or that have that money and want

923
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:18,920
more of that money

924
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:23,040
are the ones paying you to take the
certifications and then that money goes

925
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,450
in large volumes into the hands

926
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:29,530
the certifying bodies the companies that
do this stuff

927
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:34,310
so the end in today employers have got
to get out above the paper habit

928
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:38,920
and actually start asking people to
demonstrate skills now I want to tell

929
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,260
you a sad little story

930
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:45,740
but its it's sad because it's a sad
commentary on the world I did in fact

931
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:48,830
get hired at that job at Speedway

932
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:52,200
back in college and Speedway is the

933
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,660
only company to have ever required me

934
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:59,060
to test our skills I had to pass up back
past

935
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:04,810
I had to pass I shit you not that maybe
put the smack on the right way like the

936
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:09,110
the cheesy I think they're polos now
it's Peter and I don't go inside pip

937
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:10,310
operate but

938
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:14,770
the you but but back then you had to
wear a smock

939
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:18,000
and you had to put it on right and and
then they made me

940
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,370
I and then they may be count make change
that was the last time I spoke in

941
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:25,600
eighteen years old as the last time
somebody asked me to prove that I knew

942
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:29,360
how to do the job they were hiring me
for and in just taken off my resume

943
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:32,850
a guy he's a nice guy and he's like not
totally socially retarded so

944
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:36,820
will bring him in they didn't know I
understand halfway decent social

945
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:37,470
engineer

946
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:41,840
their I I read the the are the
dissection that I got a good

947
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:46,760
today

948
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:50,900
but by the way shout out to to kevin
Mitnick for agreed to be my opening act

949
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:51,830
today that was so

950
00:58:51,830 --> 00:58:56,720
so nice for them to fly out for their
cell

951
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:00,290
alright so focus on skills test for them
in interviews

952
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:03,170
there's nothing I was sitting across the
table from somebody that you're trying

953
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:06,390
to hire making them do something really
hard on the spot this is security after

954
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:06,790
a

955
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:09,870
we was going to do clues to make
somebody do that would under pressure

956
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:10,910
thirteeners

957
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:14,480
fuck you have you ever had a bad day in
security like do you have any idea how

958
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,020
horrible it can be issued by

959
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:19,800
you should be good under pressure if you
crumble under pressure even if you know

960
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,160
the technical should get out

961
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:28,160
go teach I hear it. PD is hiring

962
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:35,550
alright so yes stop relying on certs

963
00:59:35,550 --> 00:59:39,100
and at the very least here's the other
thing for all the times that I've ever

964
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:40,680
applied to a job in like

965
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:43,860
send them a copy like just a photocopy
love

966
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:46,990
love certifications that I have to
qualify for you for the job you know how

967
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:48,550
many times they verify their

968
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:53,350
exactly zero right I mean is so if you
back up like those

969
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:56,480
you know I don't know many people caught
it early totally would like for to have

970
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,760
all the numbers on those certain stuff
fairly

971
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:02,290
midsummer me easy summer here a little
harder you can

972
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:06,710
you know asking about later but anyway
the

973
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:09,830
bill 0.08 rate is so that you can
validate

974
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:14,700
the that's a real certification right
except for the fact that like you know

975
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:17,280
if you're lucky enough to have a pretty
common name you may just

976
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,190
you'll be able to go search the registry
for your own name in the pot on there

977
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:23,070
any Photoshop church but it doesn't
matter cuz they will look anyway they

978
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:23,810
just won't work

979
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:26,940
they don't look HR doesn't care they're
not interested

980
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:31,670
in spending any time doing anymore
research village poets on their

981
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:35,510
can I get a copy copy be something that
has the same make four letters honey

982
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:36,080
this the

983
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:39,160
thing re probably never even seen one
before so

984
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:43,240
so it starts with the employer and
realistically I think

985
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:46,830
for the IT management and the roommate
is not fair to ask HR

986
01:00:46,830 --> 01:00:50,369
to get on board with this I mean it you
know just say to them like I don't care

987
01:00:50,369 --> 01:00:51,500
so much about certs

988
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,990
not spend so much time on certain
looking for certain keywords or whatever

989
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:58,690
but admit hiring people is just gonna be
hard

990
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:02,609
and it's worth doing even though it's
gonna be hard right it's worth it's

991
01:01:02,609 --> 01:01:03,160
worth

992
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:06,609
it's worth taking the time to get the
right people on your team

993
01:01:06,609 --> 01:01:09,980
rather than ending up with you
government

994
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:14,330
there so

995
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:17,160
for the rest the view in the room though
that are going to do any hiring illegal

996
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:20,210
fighting this was always to 40 minutes
thanks a lot asshole

997
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:23,660
so but that

998
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:28,200
but no you you have something to do this
to write but I don't hire people i jus

999
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,170
wanna be hired

1000
01:01:29,170 --> 01:01:33,400
then lead by example right step up BB an
example %uh

1001
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:36,400
what you want the industry to be like
instead of

1002
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,650
because everybody's running around
getting the search even the people like

1003
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:40,210
me

1004
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:43,640
baguette I could totally get that like
I'm a fucking hypocrite

1005
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:47,369
I own that I'm really good at it

1006
01:01:47,369 --> 01:01:52,170
but those but the reality is it raises
were all just chasing cert

1007
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:55,609
we're all just running around like
trying to put alphabet soup on our

1008
01:01:55,609 --> 01:01:56,260
resumes

1009
01:01:56,260 --> 01:02:00,619
because we think that's how people judge
or skill and our ability to your job

1010
01:02:00,619 --> 01:02:04,400
then we as legitimate security
practitioners

1011
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:09,450
just for their the myth that that really
is what matters

1012
01:02:09,450 --> 01:02:12,820
right so the next time somebody send me
your resume

1013
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:19,820
with their name comma some certification
I like I am so tempted to use tear it up

1014
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,650
at yet no thank you right back email
them back and say no thank you

1015

1016
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:38,470

1017
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:42,110

anyway so talk about your
accomplishments ray if you've been in

1022
01:03:04,510 --> 01:03:07,840
this industry for years long enough to
go get your CISSP

1023
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:11,220
if that's the coolest thing you can put
on your resume 5 back

1024
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:15,740
right do something interesting may even
if your job sucks cuz

1025
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:20,160
cuz admittedly some part of everybody's
job sucks and some other people in this

1026
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,170
room have jobs that

1027
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:25,910
only suck right I'm day but you know
what

1028
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:29,560
I way so is the custodian from the last
place in here

1029
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:34,670
okay right so i've seen what you freaks
have done in the bathroom this year the

1030
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:35,500
past two days

1031
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:39,210
that guy's job is worse than yours to
point that out

1032
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:43,760
i'd so even if you don't have anything
called put on your resume because you

1033
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,260
did something cool at work do something
cool on the side

1034
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:49,270
but I would so much rather hear from
somebody

1035
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:53,340
who's like and and I can I can think I
have at least a half dozen people in

something really fuckin sweet on the

1038
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:00,920
side like an open source project or

1039
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:05,710
a your research paper rate that got
involved and it's gotten

1040
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:08,770
maybe something to do with what they do
at work maybe not by

1041
01:04:08,770 --> 01:04:12,580
