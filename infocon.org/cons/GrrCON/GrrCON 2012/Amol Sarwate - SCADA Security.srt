1
00:00:01,069 --> 00:00:04,779
thank you with

2
00:00:04,779 --> 00:00:08,679
alright so my name is on wall and

3
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:12,540
in the next hour or so we are going to
sort of brainstorm

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,700
on why sq security it's such /url

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,670
uphill battle a and director of a lovely
labs

6
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:24,439
at Kuala switches or ability and
compliance management company

7
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:27,449
so let's get started all

8
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:30,960
before this talk I was talking with some
folks outside

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,100
an incident leave the new about SCADA
systems and should be here in the dark

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:36,880
because

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,489
up this ad will we are gonna ended up so
my question to them was what is your

12
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:44,360
expectation from the talk

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,590
from from the bleacher Garcon as well as
my talk

14
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:52,809
so some of them their pen testers and
they said well we just don't want to see

15
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:56,920
just a bullet points we want to see some
actual meet some chords and back its new

16
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:02,570
some something like that while some of
them with more on the management

17
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:07,010
front and they said well that's all good
but we would also like to see

18
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:11,720
or getting or general overview of what's
happening in this key to wall

19
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,320
and how do I protect my critical
infrastructure so

20
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,780
I've sorta beard might talk to the
appease both type of audience

21
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,659
on there are a lot of slides so let's
get started

22
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:27,820
so the agenda for the next hour or so is
that

23
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,909
will go over some ski da basics

24
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:33,979
ski days vast and divorce and what

25
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:38,369
I refer to its key tell me not be
something that you would refer to what

26
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,549
scale so we will we will go quickly over
some love this key to be sick so that

27
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:43,229
all of those

28
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:46,540
are in the same page will look at

29
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:51,000
for its so where are these threats why
do these threats exist

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,090
and how can and attacker or attackers

31
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,030
iraq into your skin dollar critical
infrastructure system

32
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,409
will look at challenges so if we know
where

33
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:06,509
the threats or if we know why the
threats or if we know how an attacker

34
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:07,479
can attackers

35
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:11,200
why why but only protect against it what
what are the challenges

36
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,900
will go over some recommendations and
proposals

37
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,720
on securing on securing SCADA system and
last but not least we'll go

38
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,080
were or a free tool that I have
developed its close key to scan that

39
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,040
you could potentially Ron in your
environment to

40
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,260
getting i do. about your scale systems
so as you can see a lot of things took

41
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,540
over in just one hour

42
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,540
let's get started also echoed

43
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,830
at any time during the talk if you

44
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,410
if you have some experiences to share if
you agree or disagree or strongly

45
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,360
disagree with something just

46
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,459
the give me a shout out and will will

47
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:55,060
quickly discuss those topics alright

48
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,909
so it was over five years ago when

49
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:03,269
no one day my boss comes to my desk and

50
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:06,610
tells me that hey I'm all do we have

51
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:11,209
bootable the signatures for SCADA
systems not to give you a little bit of

52
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:13,120
an back in on what my team does

53
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,599
is weird 8 signatures to identify
vulnerabilities

54
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:20,950
possible threats miss conflagrations or
any way in which an attacker or

55
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:26,379
actor good hack into your system even
five years ago when there was no Stuxnet

56
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:27,640
or no do CEU

57
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,310
mmm I knew what's good %uh systems were
we were in no position to rate

58
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,549
vulnerability signatures to identify
winter booties on scale systems

59
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,700
so I told my boss that tables so

60
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,099
we don't have any signatures yet board
will start working on it

61
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:46,989
and I started talking with

62
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:51,819
a lot of people in the industry with
people with our customers who have some

63
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:55,819
SCADA systems and the more I talk more
phone over that

64
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,830
they are referred to in by

65
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:02,970
different people in different meet some
call them SCADA or supervisory control

66
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:03,349
and

67
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:06,569
the two acquisitions some call them the
sea is

68
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:11,930
I see years but for the one and there
are differences in these

69
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,819
are different acronyms but for the
purpose of this stock

70
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:19,500
i'll just refer to all upbeat systems
industrial control systems distributed

71
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,630
control systems

72
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,800
just add SCADA so I know there are
differences but

73
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,979
for this talk I'm just gonna refer to
them it's at SCADA

74
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:33,669
so what what really comes to your mind
when someone sees the storm skied up or

75
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:35,070
SCADA system or

76
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,580
and I need some art impart participation
here what do you think

77
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:44,660
of muscular system examples

78
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,600
industrial control that's a good one our
plan do

79
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,080
three-tier

80
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,850
we r that's that's that's that's right

81
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,550
sorry a gym I will that's that's that's
good that's

82
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:06,960
so that's part of the skill system so
these were some of the systems that came

83
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,960
in our minds when we look when we when
we thought about skill

84
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,740
electrical power lines so the

85
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,590
bout run been meals or gas distribution
pipelines

86
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,669
so all the systems on tall are usually
referred

87
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:26,160
at the skewed %uh systems and the

88
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,050
generally the rule of thumb is if you
sort of hug a skewed also similar if you

89
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,240
end up arguing

90
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,090
an entire mmm CD or steel or even a
country or continent

91
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:40,210
that's a good enough indication that
it's a SCADA system

92
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,830
the systems at the bottom the systems
are used

93
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:47,190
possibly in food manufacturing in

94
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:50,960
automobile manufacturing and so so on
and so forth they are generally referred

95
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,440
to as industrial control systems

96
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,690
they are pretty huge but they are not as
distributed

97
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,520
as the ones on the tall with a muscular
systems which are like really

98
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,380
distributed

99
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,720
so okay there are some differences but
we will will will call all of these

100
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,910
scared of order for a purpose

101
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,660
levels talking with or folks from the
industry

102
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,970
we notice that there have been a lot of
accidents in SCADA systems

103
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,080
and the links here I'm not sure if if
they are

104
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,250
visible clear lead back but the

105
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,270
or links from or or government from
Merck

106
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:31,330
to some of the liquid pipeline failures
power failures

107
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:35,110
and the really fine old war was the root
cause so was it

108
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:40,280
all was it operator feel your or was it
a mechanical failure

109
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,940
and these PDF them by the way at the end
of this presentation all

110
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,090
I'll give you my twitter handle were you
can get into the entire slate and what

111
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:48,740
not

112
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,319
so you don't have to rate these links so
the

113
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,080
outlying I'll they basically give why

114
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,080
there were some of these liquid pipeline
failures power failures exit row

115
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,319
to israel agreed they have been some
accidents so

116
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:08,530
an minuscule system there is always the
possibility that there is a loss of life

117
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:08,919
so

118
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:13,169
that's why maybe our customers want to
secure SCADA systems

119
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:17,569
we looked at some cases of Amanda
listens and example here

120
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:21,250
is will is a pretty famous example from
Portland

121
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,789
where some vandals the destroyed rubber
gaskets

122
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:29,460
on power transmission lines wide don't
know exactly how you would do that but

123
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,590
but they did that

124
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,710
it didn't really cause any power
disruption but the power company had

125
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:40,810
to do without power we had to extending
crew at the remote location

126
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:45,389
to fix it and did cause them a lot of
trouble and money

127
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:49,210
so I said okay that's why I'm some awful
or customers they're requesting

128
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:54,020
viewed signatures for identifying
vulnerabilities in SCADA systems

129
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,690
we look at some of the insider threats
like like a disgruntled employee

130
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:02,900
and the link you is a very famous one at
the most of you must have heard of it

131
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,280
this is from Australia where or an
employee was fired from

132
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,440
or water treatment plant and

133
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,190
and the IC's couple of people noting
that hurt so this is a very famous one

134
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:17,250
and what does employ dugan very next day
since he had

135
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,090
a good understanding of the system a
blueprint of the system in your borders

136
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,060
to marry will

137
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,600
from the parking lot of the company he
was able to you

138
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,520
opened some of the gates which allow

139
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,789
mmm sewage water really bad water into

140
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:36,010
reverse and into the park's

141
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:40,840
caused a big embarrassment to the
company and general it was in the news

142
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,730
all who were aboard Australia Australia
cause sort of an embarrassment for the

143
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:45,580
country as well

144
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,570
so as a look at this is getting free
pretty serious

145
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,710
but what we didn't realize at that time
was

146
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:56,190
what we see now or what has been termed

147
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:00,390
in by the industry is APT home in a few

148
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:06,640
I've heard of an APT a lot of it so
that's that's good a pity is a advanced

149
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,760
persistent threat

150
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,510
and usually do is I'll mmm

151
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,960
well the eg the link I have your

152
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,740
is not not for Stuxnet it's for du coup
in which was

153
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,740
sort of call as the son of Stuxnet

154
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,180
from everyone heard about Stuxnet and
Duqu who

155
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:29,960
alright so what in an appt usually what
the

156
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,880
would be referred to in an appt is that

157
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,540
attacked usually uses 0d which means
that even the vendor

158
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:43,120
or no one is really no one really knows
about it will not a booty

159
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,250
and also people behind their back or
cutting ordered back they're not really

160
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,660
interested in your credit card
information

161
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,630
or your social security number or those
things like that

162
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:57,130
there is usually a big organization who
wants to

163
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:01,680
dystrophy or critical infrastructure
your power lines or dams

164
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,040
mostly some sort of a big state or
nation

165
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,700
and the the link it is actually pretty
nicely in this link is from semantic

166
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,210
it's not from my company it's from
semantic and

167
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,980
they did a pretty good reverse
engineering on boo on Stuxnet as well as

168
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,790
du coup

169
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:22,160
and they concluded that the same people
who ruled Stuxnet

170
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,970
love also drew do as you know sucks and
it was the

171
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:30,560
wires or the warm that affected some on

172
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,620
some Siemens PLC's which which would

173
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,570
which would be used in a nuclear power
plant and du coup was

174
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:42,430
love a wire is that didn't really do any
harm but was

175
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:45,580
reading to collect information so it
didn't

176
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,820
send any calls to the PLC buddy just
collected information

177
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:53,680
so is our look at this a is getting
pretty serious and I guess that's why we

178
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,320
have to create did signatures

179
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,630
usually what happens is

180
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:02,640
when we get such a task of writing will
not believe the signatures for detecting

181
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,780
when their abilities

182
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:10,190
we get that move due to be or operating
system or alter or whatever firewall

183
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,720
that would be in or lab

184
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,930
we sorta bang on it till it breaks and
do fine with her abilities

185
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:21,750
create signatures for it many times
there are no notable beat so we don't

186
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:25,220
even have to do that we just get that in
Orlando we

187
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,270
try to exploit the known already known
in public movement abilities and

188
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,650
discreet a signature for it pretty
straightforward

189
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,100
but Azumi recall those pictures of

190
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,480
skew the system's it was impossible to
get

191
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,770
all these systems in our lab electrical
power plants and what not

192
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:47,440
so what we did was we studied systems
and sort of created

193
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,680
00 block diagram for our own engineers
to understand beat systems better

194
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,510
what you have here is on the left hand
side

195
00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:00,980
is the field so these or the compliments
that could be thousands of

196
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,940
four kilometers miles very all from your
right hand side

197
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,510
which is the control center so usually
the controls entries a place where

198
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:15,580
mmm people who are manned 24 by 7 they
are monitoring alerts along

199
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,910
and on the left hand side is the field
which

200
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:22,810
which could be on I the said on might
sorry

201
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:26,560
so let's take a lil detailed look at

202
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,190
more these different components or so
the

203
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,870
compliments on or the box which is on
the leftmost side

204
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:38,949
is that all for data acquisition so this

205
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:42,360
consists of sensors meters

206
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,900
field devices which acquire

207
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,209
but i'm a dreamer sleek late temperature
or pressure

208
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:53,199
and can work them most probably to an
analog signal

209
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:56,940
again not all skewed all systems would
be like that not all I see is systems

210
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,120
will be like that good

211
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,680
this is a general block diagram that
sort of all systems

212
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,959
more or less comply with and example
that I have here is a photo sensor a

213
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,380
pressure sensor and a temperature sensor

214
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,980
so pretty pretty pretty OK to known this
is just dudack position where parameters

215
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,930
like

216
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:19,030
temperature pressure flu or

217
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:22,540
what not get a quiet on this block has

218
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:26,050
a two-way communication with the next
block which use

219
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:33,050
data conversion this block consists all
for your PLC's your IED 0 RT you

220
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,709
to programmable logic controllers
intelligent electronic devices and what

221
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:38,329
not

222
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:42,790
and that's what we have here and the
pictures we have a PLC VIII

223
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:46,720
DNR to you and to give you like a sort
of a sense of

224
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,610
whole big girls small it is on the right
and sadism and

225
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:56,100
holding a PLC in his hand which use I
guess about among

226
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,339
to on No I don't know what that this
could be a man

227
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,199
turbine pool or something

228
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,209
before all we want to know is on the
left hand side the leftmost component

229
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:09,660
which we just saw was data acquisition

230
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,680
there is a two-way communication with
the next compliment which is due to

231
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,570
conversion

232
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:17,470
which can words these analog and
discreet measurements to

233
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:21,160
digital information and the

234
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,070
toward a compliment his communications
so this information is now

235
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:30,110
been communicated to the last block
using this communication channel

236
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:34,620
it could be your wired communication it
could be wireless communication

237
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,560
it could use radio and most probably it
uses

238
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,310
01 of the mean two dozen

239
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,880
or so skewed upward to close their
garden that people

240
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,230
now some say a some people say that
there are more

241
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:53,530
100 different skilled operator calls
that exists right now

242
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:58,630
a lot of open source close schools
proprietary and non-proprietary

243
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:02,500
my I have not been able to count 100 but
I can definitely guarantee that there

244
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,900
are at least two dozen

245
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,800
difference cued up because there are big
news

246
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,490
so good what we have till now leader
gets acquired

247
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:15,380
the targets can work there the packets
communicated

248
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:19,070
and at the end of the day reaches the
last

249
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,089
block which is presentation in control

250
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:27,130
so this is where there are human beings
man most probably 24 by 7

251
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:30,810
mmm into a control station where the
monitor

252
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:34,030
alarms where they reacted with alarms

253
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:39,110
and as you can see you can see you or an
engineer looking at some

254
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:43,350
switches and some displays the what
they're doing that basically is the

255
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:46,750
or monitoring alarms so let's say

256
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:51,310
if your left hand side has or pressure
sensor which senses

257
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:56,040
so water pressure and if the pressure
gets high or low

258
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,120
the targets acquired

259
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,240
translated and basically at the end of
the day beaches

260
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,660
this a presentation and control

261
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,380
layer with a or operator views this
alarm saying that

262
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,589
hey the pressure is getting low or the
pressure is getting high

263
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:17,839
and operator can also change the
pressure we can 200 K

264
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,160
the person needs to be this let me just
say control display

265
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,140
the selecting the not

266
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,620
also this is many times call as the San
gentleman said

267
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,209
HM I or human machine interface that's
just

268
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:36,020
just a fancy acronym for what I just
described

269
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,890
so these are before sort of building
blocks

270
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:45,080
of I'll be sick cause cue the system or
industrial control system

271
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,480
let's though let's take a look at where
the vulnerabilities or

272
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,950
and where dick an attacker actor could

273
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:58,580
packed them

274
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:02,910
so let's take an example of something
between the first and the second block

275
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:03,260
which

276
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:09,070
is or between your sensors and between
your PLC

277
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,589
not this type of an attack if an
attacker was though

278
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:17,839
going to attack this sort of component
was probably it requires physical access

279
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,550
because I mention the left hand side is
thousands of miles away

280
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:25,699
these are sensors this could be
somewhere on a power lying

281
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:29,600
somewhere in Arizona monitored on

282
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,860
maybe an electric pole or in middle or

283
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:37,550
whatever could be so if in a packet has
to attack that company usually it

284
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,590
requires

285
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,850
or physical axis and

286
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:46,669
feel cue meant generally does not
contain process knowledge

287
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:50,330
mean in for it contains information
leaks a valve sixty

288
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:53,630
in all the breaker can be your whatever
were

289
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:57,800
generally without process knowledge it
leads to new sins

290
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,980
disruption so something that we saw in

291
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,080
or earlier example where a couple of a
man does the gist

292
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,320
lemme vandalized or destroyed rubber
gaskets

293
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,500
from electrical power lines in this
company in

294
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:16,070
Portman are that would be a great
example of this type of an attack where

295
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:20,700
my back ordered something word without
process knowledge

296
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,770
gingerly causes just nuisance disruption
it's not a targeted attack

297
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,300
it's not been PPT

298
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:33,310
so is OK this is more in the physical
world where you literally have to go and

299
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,390
physically damaged stuff

300
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:39,620
let's look at some of the communication
trips so

301
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:44,500
corrects which or in in this book
compliment

302
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,720
so as I mentioned or on about two dozen

303
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,070
at least two dozen two dozen different
skewed operative holes

304
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:56,130
and if you manually those protocols word
an attacker could do

305
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:01,159
is if he could he or she could give the
wrong impression to the control center

306
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:04,780
of what is happening in the field so it
began

307
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,480
he or she can manually the output from

308
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,480
if you P so that the control center

309
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,320
looks a good to look at a different
picture than what the reality is

310
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,649
so basically change if you be output
which is important to the last

311
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:23,540
compliment the human-machine interface
compliment

312
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:27,159
and so we decided to look at a lot of
protocol

313
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:30,600
threats which or in these or

314
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,390
in its killer protocols first we decided
to look

315
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:38,050
at to a protocol call as mod bus

316
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:41,510
home in a few no more bus

317
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:45,320
and mmm was probably program for more
bus or a

318
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,460
some technical rate okay

319
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:54,850
good so I'll models is a protocol it's
just like any other protocol that we use

320
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:58,600
lady to DP your FTP or SMTP

321
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,210
are just that it's used in industrial
control systems

322
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:07,850
this is on it has a pretty simple
clients or were

323
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:11,640
more master sleeve organization

324
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,690
and it's pretty much the same bill

325
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,940
the client request something from the
server

326
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,260
the server give something back so it's
it's so you can

327
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:25,550
even compared at the theoretical level
to http I just because something

328
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:29,310
I get something back accept their a
little bit

329
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,640
it's a little bit different in the sons
the master is also

330
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,730
use usually the client and the sleeve is
thus or were

331
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:39,460
usually needs to be refloated in a
different way

332
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:44,429
so this is the reserves on with the
slides were all the pen test first so

333
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:47,500
mmm this morning they said they want to
see some real

334
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,260
real meat is okay

335
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,590
this is more the supreme it consists of

336
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:58,100
long application data unit and a program
rely on it

337
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,960
well what I'm going to do is I'm going
to just dive a little bit

338
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,679
into this protocol on how how it works
and

339
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,840
or lead this lead to stop

340
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,050
so mormons is actually a thirty to forty
you

341
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,909
protocol which was not never really
intended on never really designed to

342
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:18,080
work on TCP IP

343
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,380
the way it now works on TCP IP is just
that the PCP in the IP header

344
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:28,610
are just input in front of the entire
morbus however and the marbles back

345
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:32,120
so we have the IP packet you have the
TCP packet we have the

346
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,880
morbus Edun the more the speed you

347
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,130
so let's get rid of although TCP IP
address and all that and

348
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:44,320
let's just look at Marquis so all it
convinces the header

349
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,580
some function course and Edo

350
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:52,760
the headers have basically a transaction
ID which is basically

351
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:57,300
I'll that is over as a mention in the
field equipment to your aid

352
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:01,149
it so since the or

353
00:22:01,149 --> 00:22:04,919
or let's consider another example where
the Hemi

354
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:09,280
wants to know more the pressures for
example so the gym I would say that hey

355
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,700
this is transaction number one

356
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,139
tell me what the pressure is and the
response comes back saying that the the

357
00:22:15,139 --> 00:22:16,880
question that you are just

358
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,990
which was in transaction number one this
is the answer for it

359
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:24,240
when this is the pressure so it is just
transaction ID is nothing bird

360
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,919
oh you need question number and unique
answer number when

361
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:32,050
someone asks you a question is a look at
this as question number one the question

362
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,139
number two

363
00:22:33,139 --> 00:22:36,679
and that's what exactly a transaction ID
is

364
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:40,950
protocol lady it's fixed for more booze
length is the length of the packet

365
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:44,889
and you need it. it something
interesting which is basically when

366
00:22:44,889 --> 00:22:48,720
the HM I asked this question that hey
this is question number one

367
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,370
what is the pressure on unit number ten

368
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:55,630
and and you get a response back saying
that oh this is the

369
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:59,460
answer to your question were one and
this is the pressure on unit number ten

370
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,770
so there can be many units so and that's
basically the unit ID is you consider

371
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:06,820
this question number to know tell me
what's the temperature in unit number

372
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,770
100

373
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:11,169
and so on and so forth say only one good
good

374
00:23:11,169 --> 00:23:15,980
good you nor

375
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,320
the function cords are basically I'm not
going to go or the entire they will but

376
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,050
these are just what type of requests can
be sent

377
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:26,870
so I can see a this is a read request
tell me where the temperature is tell me

378
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,350
where the pressure is

379
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:32,130
tell me tell me tell me or it could be a
late requested could be multiple reads

380
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:38,159
could be multiple rates so just
basically instructions on what to do

381
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,760
and this is just a simple

382
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,460
oral implementation of the packet here
so this is the diagram

383
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:49,850
this is all the back it looks if you
just put that in core

384
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:53,169
this is out looks basically you poor you
the to buy

385
00:23:53,169 --> 00:23:57,149
transaction ID the protocol ideal and
unit ID

386
00:23:57,149 --> 00:24:01,460
love love love you Phillip all what is
Eric what is is

387
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,600
in the diagram into corporal packet

388
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,300
and then you send it or just talk it
what we see

389
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,540
on are if you sniff the spike it on

390
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:15,580
Wireshark a linear bit sniffers is
exactly what you said you saw

391
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:20,149
from in the red transaction ID that we
chose to be 256

392
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:25,409
we saw protocol that invites you to Linz
the Knicks unit number one

393
00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:28,540
and this is a request to read some
registers

394
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:32,690
and by the way from reason we didn't
have to modify

395
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:35,820
or write plugins for any of the packet
sniffers

396
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,840
so what usually happens is to if you
already booking

397
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,790
on new protocol or unknown protocol the
packet sniffers they cannot

398
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:46,880
mmm they cannot sniff the package
because they don't know aboard a

399
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,889
political

400
00:24:47,889 --> 00:24:51,659
but most of the packet sniffers actually
I would say all of the packet sniffers

401
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:53,690
Wireshark or any of them the

402
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:59,860
already have built-in I'll built-in
support for a marvelous and a lot of

403
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:03,240
cute a political so if you do this in
your environment you wouldn't have to do

404
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,780
anything special just

405
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:09,480
snow the traffic it will show you
clearly what's being said

406
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,490
so this is just an example requested
that we saw from those

407
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:17,700
so pro called and you get an example
response that okay fine

408
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,210
I got back the I asked question number
to have 26

409
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:24,419
I got an answer for my question 256

410
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:27,480
I asked for reading 5 registers

411
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:32,200
and I got done by its to bytes per
register so I ask some question

412
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,929
what's the status of these five
registers I got a response

413
00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:38,960
it could be connected to a pressure
sensor temperature isn't that what it

414
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,720
what I don't know

415
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,740
I just asked the Value Select and I got
some

416
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:46,609
leaves so doing pretty good to hear

417
00:25:46,609 --> 00:25:49,940
alright so what's wrong here did
something

418
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:56,940
terribly terribly wrong

419
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,460
okay that that that could be it sums or
something else

420
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,560
that's right

421
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:10,670
no authentication so usually any
security protocol or any security

422
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,510
communication

423
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:14,530
is measured on these three sort of all

424
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:18,670
holy grail of security integrity
availability and confidentiality

425
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:22,360
and by confidentiality I mean

426
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,640
all authentication and authorization

427
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,280
authentication is are you up indicated

428
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:33,850
are you do you have access to it when i
send a request me give me these five

429
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:34,800
registers

430
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,840
it just gave me this five value for this
fight is stirs it

431
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,140
the protocol orders over never asked me
that he who are you though

432
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,440
are you up indicated to do I could have
said

433
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,750
right to these five register switch
could have meant

434
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:53,430
open or change the pressure or change
the temperature

435
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:57,210
that is a rate basically when you write
to something changes but I'm occurs

436
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:01,900
and could have just done it there was no
authentication it never asked me who you

437
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,410
are

438
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:06,390
secondly new authorization so even if it
had often be

439
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,630
if there is not an indication that
cannot be authorization authorization is

440
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,780
basically okie

441
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:14,440
I agree that you are who you claim you
who you are

442
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,720
word are you authorized to do it audio
throws to do with Reid

443
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,310
as well as right or just we so there was
a new

444
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:24,580
confidentiality there was very less

445
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:27,590
integrity so and the man in the middle
like that could

446
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:31,680
easily be possible so we said okay
marbles

447
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,620
was a pretty old protocol as as as many
of you is your hands

448
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:39,740
you know the maybe thirty years or
protocol

449
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,910
let's and and it was not really designed
for

450
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:46,840
security in mind so we will say okay the

451
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,280
we created a signature saying that okay
if we find a marvelous meaning in your

452
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,110
environment

453
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:57,030
or you it's him I and you feel equipment
communicates using marbles

454
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:00,490
then we see that okay you have a
potential vulnerability

455
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:03,840
because the protocol itself doesn't
support all these things so you have to

456
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,310
secure your environment using some other

457
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:10,020
or securing fact other things

458
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,120
around the political and we'll look at
how how to do that

459
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,970
so we said let's take a look at or
little bit more

460
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:20,820
a little bit more than protocols so we
look at D mp3

461
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:24,890
how many if you have heard of the mp3

462
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:29,550
so a lot of people so the mp3 was

463
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:33,060
or div look from the ground soap almost

464
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,730
for the electrical grid system in
indiana

465
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:39,730
in in the United States are it

466
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:44,400
is a lot advance then more moves as in
in more because usually just see

467
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,820
mmm it's mostly based on polling because

468
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:51,230
the clients is ok to give me these
committees and it has to pull

469
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:55,110
a lot of times in the in between you
could have a

470
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:58,370
sort sort of a call back mechanism that
you can see that all let me know

471
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:02,000
only if the temperature changes or if
the pressure changes that were

472
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,220
and then you can get notified
automatically and it does a lot of

473
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,410
or other improvements on more bus

474
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:13,090
as wetzel a

475
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:17,270
before going to DnB three so I mentioned
about a free too

476
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,900
that

477
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,360
the that ever done it's a pretty simple
tool it's close cue dusk and

478
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,660
and more it's being used to is you can
use

479
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:28,660
it to brute force you or

480
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:33,510
marvelously ladies so if you run it with
the dash in but I'm a true can use it

481
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:36,880
tu brute force it I'll again give you
the link to it and then love this

482
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,280
presentation and that is a

483
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,270
read me online so it has more on how to
use it and what not

484
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:47,200
so this is what B&B three looks like

485
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,790
at so mmm online in a textbook or in in
the art see it has

486
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:56,660
a user its application layer a pseudo
transport layer

487
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:01,620
and the link layer and again we won't go
into a lot of details about B&B 3

488
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:05,650
Raleigh up in New is it has a similar
things it has

489
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:09,290
a request for dinner response for use in
some request saying

490
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:13,430
hey this is the request this is the
right to request in a good response

491
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:17,550
so mean again the won we won going to

492
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:20,810
this in too much of the details

493
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:24,410
and this is an example from the same

494
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:28,340
askew dusk into boldly mp3 you just
fill-in

495
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:33,120
though more basically created in between
packet and by the way this is actual

496
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,330
pork or so if you

497
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:38,490
just copy paste this an run it in Opel

498
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:42,260
you created your own and

499
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:45,970
this is that it was that we just send
and the response that we

500
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:49,950
issue over the request was basically or

501
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:53,550
link status because to find out what is
the status of the link

502
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:57,320
and we got those terrorism the link
which is a couple loves you more than

503
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:57,960
once

504
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,530
each of them meaning something some
links to this again

505
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:05,760
we come to the same question what does
the NPP provide

506
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,380
not this time should should should not
be any surprise it didn't provide

507
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:15,840
any confidentiality as in no you just
send a request

508
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,250
to change some parameter and it will do
it for you that what some integrity

509
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,840
because I saw some calc

510
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,880
your the but not not too much you can
easily be hacked

511
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,540
but

512
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:33,420
and an okay this is the ask you to scan
tool now running in the

513
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:37,190
the mp3 more but all is not lost the war

514
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:40,760
what happened was in 2007 the BNP 3

515
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:45,980
organization came up with this secure
version of B&B 3 which has kept all

516
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,620
Griffey

517
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:50,780
at the hashing and a lot of key
management and all the

518
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:54,340
sorta functions that you expect from a
modern protocol

519
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:59,120
so if you or have the mp3 in your
organization make sure that

520
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,280
its surrounding the secure version of
the mp3 which is

521
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:07,690
or the post 2007 version

522
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:13,890
so those were some of the communication
for its any any questions example my any

523
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,090
concerns or

524
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:18,960
anything that you have seen different to
what we have discussed so for

525
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,540
so we said okay so

526
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:29,160
there are a lot of threats in skewed
communication because most of these

527
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,390
protocols with ridin

528
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:35,880
a long time ago without security in mind
so let's look at some

529
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,300
let's see what threats or were what but
banks could

530
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,480
happen on the skill to master on the
edge in my

531
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,540
or this is the police will usually on

532
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:51,160
it's it's a secure facility with you
cannot you cannot just go in there is

533
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:55,020
there a lot of guards around thick walls
support not depending on what

534
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:59,890
are it in my it is if it's a nuclear
power plant in there will be a lot of

535
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,430
security if it's just a

536
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:05,260
the if it's just so let's say

537
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:08,310
factory on the water min plan that would
be less security

538
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:11,600
but what you have generally on in your
to my is

539
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,750
a lot of physical a strong physical
security

540
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:18,490
on biometric already know scans and what
not to get

541
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:21,790
inside this control room where do you
usually see

542
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:25,360
I think I showed you a picture here were
some monitors

543
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,450
and people are manned 24 by 7 to look at
alerts and respond to those alerts

544
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:34,910
the number one threat that we phoned to

545
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:38,010
this I'll is that the control system
network

546
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:41,210
is connected to the corporate network
and sometimes

547
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:45,360
even to the Internet now the old school
taught was that the control system that

548
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,290
work should be aired a gap from

549
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:51,310
any other network so if this is the
network which controls your damn

550
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:55,030
it should be at a gap it should not be
connected to the network

551
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:58,350
that you H horses system uses or to the

552
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:03,310
network that your receptionist use or to
check emails and whatnot

553
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:07,740
but the number one threat that we saw
was this control system that workers in

554
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,830
network Lincoln

555
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:12,909
connected to the corporate network or to
the Internet

556
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:17,210
can can can you think of a reason why
this could be happening or why such a

557
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:19,280
critical network is connected

558
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:26,280
to the internal corporate network or
even to the Internet

559
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,800
alerting notifications

560
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,129
a that was a the number one reason
actually what we saw was that to the

561
00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:37,230
control engineers

562
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:42,070
wouldn't have to leave their desk would
happen in one of these two instances is

563
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,240
that

564
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:47,350
we asked a wiser control network
connected to your corporate network or

565
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,350
why do you have internet access from
that

566
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:53,220
and the third world resort operators
manned 24 by 7

567
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:57,090
at three o'clock at night sometimes if
they have to check the email or

568
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:00,410
the even go online check their facebook
or something

569
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:04,730
well we don't want them to leave go to
the cuban do that so we just connected

570
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,690
that and I was like away

571
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:11,970
in some cases the control system network
is connected to the Internet and that is

572
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:14,890
what I think the other person here said

573
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:19,060
is there was a company which wanted to
give you real-time feedback to their

574
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:19,870
customers

575
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:24,600
about I i think it was about power
outages and so on and so forth

576
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:29,210
and all of you in this room know that
they're all many different secure ways

577
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,270
to do that

578
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:35,070
but the V that they implemented what's
to disconnect the control system network

579
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:37,690
to the Internet to the web server which
is

580
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:42,530
all with spews out okay the garbage is
here are you and what not

581
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:47,630
no a said that our Lord other secure
ways of doing that but the way they

582
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:50,070
decided to do it was to connect

583
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:53,790
the control system that were directly to
the Internet

584
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:57,400
so that's the number one trip number 23
it is

585
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,010
%uh there are there was no
authentication or for user

586
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:00,900
authentication

587
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,630
on these a different control system
machines so when you

588
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:08,690
goo inside this controls room the

589
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:12,400
okay you need do you have a guard who
the who is with you

590
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,630
you have some biometric to get in would
offer you get

591
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:19,410
in the H imply or the police will you go
and

592
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:24,650
doorknob to change the pressure or open
the liver or open some

593
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:28,240
damn door something like that that
doesn't have

594
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,360
hope for user authentication know that
was okay if the network was not

595
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,910
connected to the corporate network or
internet

596
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:39,590
what although viruses and worms that
could

597
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:43,820
jump from the corporate network or the
Internet they don't have to get in that

598
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,360
control room physically

599
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:49,800
they can jump just come from that
network onto the control system network

600
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:55,250
and do the same thing as a human that so
a poor user authentication

601
00:36:55,250 --> 00:37:00,720
or just any type of authentication would
also go a long way

602
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,970
there were no passwords for these these
control systems

603
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:09,870
and to mall before before I tell you why
would be a reason that there are always

604
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,830
new passwords to these

605
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:15,610
control systems which control really
important stuff

606
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:22,230
wired and passwords is because
historically the air gap there was no

607
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,590
need of a password

608
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:28,040
and on also some some folks to lose that

609
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,540
if there is for example a fire on the
factory floor or something like that

610
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:36,280
we don't want the operator to stride
login to change something and apps

611
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,300
bad password hopes try again bad
password because these are really

612
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:43,830
time-critical a type of responses and we
don't want

613
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:47,920
to waste time in typing or your password
in case of an emergency

614
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,490
now that sounds like a very logical and
reasonable explanation

615
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:55,650
what at 10 disc you know conferences
were

616
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:59,360
people only talk about skied up there
was 0

617
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,610
and there was a home there was a person
from the

618
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:05,880
US Navy and he said that he had

619
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:10,850
all I think 20-year-old mmm young boys
and girls typing

620
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:13,920
25 character long password

621
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,630
with changes every two weeks without a
single

622
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:20,910
at her Fort Lee so many years no

623
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:25,090
being in an organization like a military
or they were you can enforce these

624
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:28,490
things you can really do it in your
network or a No

625
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:32,890
private organization but I think we have
to sort of at least or

626
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:36,400
thinking about it because if they can do
it why can't we

627
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,570
because these are critical systems at
the end of the day

628
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:43,170
and we should it's time that we start
thinking about them

629
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:46,510
as critical systems

630
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:49,930
well another thing about that was def or
password so

631
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:53,140
you have a system from any vendor I'm
not going to

632
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:56,330
I'll mention any skill offenders in this
presentation but

633
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:59,940
just think about any vendor that you may
have or it comes

634
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:04,110
a lot of systems come with a default
password if these passwords are not

635
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:07,460
certain if I'm in fact that if I'm
reading now that like Stuxnet

636
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:10,540
what will it do first thing and CEO is
this

637
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:14,950
so system from XYZ vendor yes for the
second thing overdue

638
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:18,310
test if

639
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:21,860
it still has the before password because
the password is already in the manual

640
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,960
it's on the Internet

641
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,240
but this six why the system from XYZ
company comes with this before password

642
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:27,690
so

643
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:33,150
I'll just try that password so no basic
things like passwords and the for

644
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:35,080
passwords are still an issue

645
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:40,750
when it comes to SCADA systems there is
no password change policy either

646
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:43,980
well this is a pretty

647
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:48,080
pretty interesting subject as far as it
comes for skew the system which is

648
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,630
basically nope that Ching

649
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:53,880
I'll are all skewed %uh systems that we
saw none of them their passion like your

650
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,600
ID systems which room

651
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:01,920
windows and what not none of them were
patched any any guess on why that's

652
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,770
happening are all skewed on your sleazy
or something more

653
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:11,530
what's what's the reasoning behind it
they don't want to bring the system so

654
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:14,970
knows good engineers are not lazy its

655
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:18,590
I'll usually what happens is in the
nineties

656
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:22,640
a lot of skewed 0 mmm people who owns
cue the system

657
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:27,020
with a lot of property by prosecutor
system the asked their vendors that he

658
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:30,040
can you port your HM I

659
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,380
all your control systems with it there
is a human interaction

660
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:37,910
on the standard operating systems like
Windows or Linux or

661
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:43,110
solo this and the vendors just did that
reported their controls on Windows or

662
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,420
Linux and what not

663
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:48,180
and it was great for cost savings
because these are

664
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:51,340
normal desktop PCs which are cheap

665
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:57,190
but although threats and vulnerabilities
in wireless is an warms that affect

666
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:02,390
now your normal Windows clinics any of
your systems now

667
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:05,530
started affecting or will affect skewed
%uh systems

668
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:09,290
you and and and and solar patches

669
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:13,000
so if for example your system runs
Windows

670
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,620
Microsoft for movie loses the patch
every worked

671
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:19,820
one so

672
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:24,110
once a month right as Tuesday everyone
knows that work best to date

673
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:28,180
and that means you have to patch your
skill system every month

674
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:32,540
know what happens here is you have to
vendors here one is your operating

675
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:36,070
system in which could be Microsoft
Google indexer the world

676
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:39,810
no one is a risk you know software
vendor know if the skewness of the

677
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:43,820
lender doesn't give you enough guidance
that by up like that this budget see if

678
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,690
got love this patch is not safe blah
blah

679
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:50,890
as a skewed change in Europe person
managing that system what we like to

680
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:54,690
when Microsoft releases a Bachelor just
go and that's the system because I want

681
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:55,650
everything secure

682
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:59,680
no muscular vendors and tell me if the
bad tutsi for NORCS I don't want to

683
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,600
break anything I don't want

684
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,270
my a stupid bad me not stupid but my
patch

685
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:08,080
to break some or stops on

686
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:12,470
conveyor belt or something so I won't
apply the patch and that basically

687
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:17,190
needs to beat systems being on patched
and basically open to all the viruses

688
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,460
and worms and

689
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:22,620
all sort of malware which could have
been stopped if they were just patched

690
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,100
but there is actually no

691
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:27,450
good good good answers here and we'll
look

692
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:32,500
in a moment when we go to on how to
secure them on what what could be done

693
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:36,690
there are a lot of systems which have
not even the started

694
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:42,290
for years and love when we asked them
why is your system not

695
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:45,570
restarted in like five to eight years

696
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:50,180
the simple answer is we say we are not
confident it will come back up

697
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:53,730
and

698
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:56,910
its love we r I had the same reaction

699
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:00,140
were thankfully I didn't to expressed it

700
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:03,280
love that is the state were

701
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,810
a lot of skill does systems or which is
a lot of older operating system Windows

702
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:08,800
NT

703
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,680
Windows XP what not %uh which are not
patched

704
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:16,850
which are not even restarted because of
a lack of support from

705
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:21,410
sometimes Wenger's and sometimes because
the system is just so although you don't

706
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:22,410
want to shut it down

707
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:26,140
since now as I mentioned these

708
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:31,060
or stand I'll operating systems that are
off the shelf operating systems your

709
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:34,410
Windows Linux and I don't want to just
meet up on Windows I'm just mean

710
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:37,930
in the official operating system salah
is the

711
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:42,200
or there are a lot of unnecessary
services running so now you have to do a

712
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,040
lot of

713
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,990
security management on the system that
we would do on a normal lighting system

714
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:50,320
you have to make sure that this system
doesn't have for example means that

715
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:50,950
we're running

716
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:54,210
just because it came by before it like
that

717
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:58,810
and off-the-shelf software that that
that we we talked about this

718
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:02,950
already so just do some rate some of the
challenges

719
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:06,960
that we saw and the number one challenge
which

720
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,380
affix cue the system's is the long life
cycle of that system

721
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:15,350
let's say there is a will and ability in
your phone or in your laptop

722
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:20,100
yourself my phone I'll just get rid of
it I'll buy a new phone my laptop maybe

723
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:20,550
in

724
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:23,890
eight months or a year old buy a new
laptop it's cheap

725
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:29,460
what's cuter systems they are meant to
last for decades or multiple decades

726
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:33,150
its and this long life cycle askew the
system

727
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:37,210
i think is the number one challenge as
for that security is concerned

728
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:41,190
its extremely expensive and difficult to

729
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:44,970
upgrade even parts of the system it's
not like you can change the entire

730
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:47,490
school system or night but even parts of
the

731
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:51,040
systems are pretty expensive to or

732
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:57,310
a creep there is no as as as a min as we
mentioned earlier there is no testing or

733
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:59,470
guidance from the skewed %uh vendors

734
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:03,750
on vent to apply operating system
patches and the

735
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:07,350
it kind of goes up beyond operating
system as well as we'll

736
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:12,030
we'll see soon there are some SCADA
systems which are managed directly by

737
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:12,940
the vendors

738
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:16,500
so we would have to an instance where we
went for security

739
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:20,870
we were we are being reviewed for
security assessment of a system and we

740
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:21,420
said no

741
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:25,180
it's a stand-alone it's a bindle system
we have been thousands of assessments on

742
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:25,610
it

743
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:29,000
move could just give us the password
will

744
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,530
do though authenticated assessment and
they said no we don't know what the

745
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:34,640
password is because the vendor is
managing it

746
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,740
and then the vendor had to be involved
and what not so

747
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:41,140
that is one of the challenge as well for
auditing

748
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:45,940
systems there are no in the school
system there are a lot of

749
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:50,210
other things on that network there are
new to historians their apps or worsen

750
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:52,560
the read a story inside typically do you
know uses

751
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:57,140
which could be article my sequel and
they are also affected by the same thing

752
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:58,560
as an operating system

753
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:03,020
is affected by article.really dispatches
my sequel really dispatches what do you

754
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:03,470
do

755
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:07,580
be applied these badges: does your skin
over and really tell you if it's safe or

756
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:09,010
not go play this batch

757
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:12,020
and

758
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:15,700
in more than one kiss as we have seen
these internal differences between

759
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:18,950
the people trying to secure skill system

760
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:23,540
worse is people who own that's cute the
system or responsible to keep it up and

761
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:24,050
running

762
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:30,040
in many or a lot of instances what if
she needed someone was trying to secure

763
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,090
that system

764
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:35,050
somebody has a run applying port scan

765
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:38,320
or scan using some other tools on the
skew the network

766
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:42,620
what's called some of the ski the
somewhat discutir PLC's or things like

767
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:43,109
that

768
00:46:43,109 --> 00:46:47,310
to go down and then the skew the beams
is they look at you guys are never going

769
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:49,670
to scan or do any audits on my system

770
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:53,160
and that have happens more often so

771
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:57,530
are if you or in the team which tries to
secure did system

772
00:46:57,530 --> 00:47:01,740
please talk with your skewed goes for
San or try to get though

773
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:06,660
vindo where in it's okay if something
goes down because more

774
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:11,710
less menu scan this QR system something
for you go down

775
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:16,430
hmm it used to be a don't mentality that
skew days to obscure to be hacked but I

776
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:19,740
think the Stuxnet and Duqu and all these
viruses

777
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:23,200
has helped a lot can change in that
mentality

778
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:27,640
so some of the proposals that so I have
you is

779
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:31,920
do simple things simple things like
started use for a password policies

780
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,980
access control for access rules

781
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,000
some strategy for software upgrades and
patches

782
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,070
if possible I know it's very expensive
but try to have

783
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:44,770
a sort of a mini system of your big
skewed a system where you can apply

784
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:46,410
patches where you can

785
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:49,810
this does purchase and

786
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:53,250
having this best and warm and will go a
long way

787
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:56,620
you into it may cost you the

788
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:59,900
considerable amount of money but it will
go a long way

789
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:04,120
also be known from your skewed %uh
vendors in contract in writing that

790
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,410
the will give you guidance on patching
what to do

791
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:10,750
they will tell you this patch is
DeVilbiss those batches forced

792
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:15,510
and then tell you on if this budget safe
or not to apply

793
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:19,030
a lot of times those batch from always
vendor

794
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:22,010
you cannot apply that directly on your
skew the system because it's a little

795
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:23,690
bit of a custom white system

796
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:28,990
so what happens is that batch is almost
sort of the compiled by your speedometer

797
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:32,390
and then you get that he complained
about from them saying they're looking a

798
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:33,820
lot like this batch

799
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:38,290
because you cannot upload link but from
Microsoft Data pure skill system

800
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:41,780
so in that case have facilities written
down so that

801
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:44,820
the will give you busy convoy patches in

802
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:48,450
a reasonable amount of time

803
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:52,420
or demand from your skewed a hundred and
you were vendors newer protocols

804
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:56,460
because all protocols as be solved even
not really meant for security and if

805
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:58,040
you're using those you're just

806
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:03,650
wide open so demand newer protocols and
also when you get new protocols make

807
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:04,670
sure

808
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:08,609
that you are using them in more than one
instances we have seen their

809
00:49:08,609 --> 00:49:12,180
0 the on the check mark we have a check
mark single we are the things that we

810
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,350
have secured security in between

811
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:18,640
we have secured this we have secured
that when you do an assessment

812
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:22,620
still dollar per book also been used so
okay you board the new software but it

813
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,480
was never really configured to me

814
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,760
use of these new security features so
make sure

815
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,460
that's that's done and in general apply

816
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:34,630
as or askew the systems are Nov

817
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:37,640
looking more and more like your regular
IT systems

818
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:41,050
regular off-the-shelf operating systems
of the show

819
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:44,380
databases to supply experience from your

820
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:47,750
I T or network management and security
experience to

821
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:52,510
to skew to auditing and scanning will go
a long way

822
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:56,040
no for auditing there are a lot of tools
available

823
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,750
there is a fee to let I mention would be
very careful

824
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:03,150
because cued up ulysses so sensors

825
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:06,150
and what not the or on

826
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:09,760
they are very low power devices a lot of
them will just

827
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,700
crash or reboot you leave the gate the
ping packet so if they get something

828
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,040
that they don't understand

829
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:19,609
they will be make beeville crash so if
you use my two

830
00:50:19,609 --> 00:50:24,790
that is a big disclaimer here is it will
definitely good at something somewhere

831
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:28,530
it is written with a all the care that
it should not but

832
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:33,040
there will always be a PLC or the system
which just cannot even handle pingback:

833
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:33,950
its order

834
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:38,359
something like that so if you plan to
use you there my tool or any other

835
00:50:38,359 --> 00:50:39,430
auditing or scanning

836
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:42,839
to make sure that you do it in the VIN
do it effectively

837
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:46,680
everyone has at least ones in the
quarter window for cleaning the

838
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,350
machinery or what not so use that time
frame

839
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:52,690
to do your initial scan to the

840
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:56,870
so that if something catches locates at
least the system is not online

841
00:50:56,870 --> 00:51:00,780
boat auditing and scanning is I'll

842
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:06,080
can go a long way so those were some of
the proposals that I had

843
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:10,980
all this is a a little bit of a road map
of this cute as can to

844
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:15,530
which is basically currently in the
alpha version that supports marbles DnB

845
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,630
3

846
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:21,060
in the be diversion what I plan to do is
have some skewed a masterful and

847
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:21,960
abilities on

848
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:27,400
support for HDPE an SNMP but in the
final version in the 1.0 version really

849
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,520
get what I want is user-configurable
signatures

850
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:36,430
because the fact is that no company me
my company or no other company

851
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:39,690
is able will you will ever be able to
get their hands on

852
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:42,900
all people skewed %uh systems so if it's
a community-based

853
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:46,070
thing where you could upload your own
signatures to the to

854
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:49,780
that would be for investing in that's
that's the goal of the two

855
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:53,280
so with that that's still nah

856
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,810
that's the link to the source called the
thats my Twitter handle

857
00:51:57,810 --> 00:52:01,170
and so with those are like two

858
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:05,400
open up for any questions I think we may
have a claim only for like maybe one

859
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:12,400
or two questions good

860
00:52:29,619 --> 00:52:33,789
well yeah I mean you know there are some
custom operating systems available and

861
00:52:33,789 --> 00:52:37,299
as you mentioned lenders are coming with
custom operating systems

862
00:52:37,299 --> 00:52:40,999
it really would depend on the
implementation I mean you

863
00:52:40,999 --> 00:52:44,269
if implemented right you could really
implement a real

864
00:52:44,269 --> 00:52:47,660
tight skill system which is not affected
by all these

865
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:51,660
vulnerabilities but on the other hand
Microsoft's a lot as Linux these

866
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,140
operating systems have been

867
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:56,499
around for decades now and they have

868
00:52:56,499 --> 00:53:00,059
the have gone through this process and
fix all they're both and things like

869
00:53:00,059 --> 00:53:00,990
that so

870
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:06,640
on I would say it could go either way
the

871
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:12,309
yeah

872
00:53:12,309 --> 00:53:19,309
for

873
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:47,240
if

874
00:53:54,600 --> 00:54:01,600
ok

875
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,579
all right one last question

876
00:54:04,579 --> 00:54:07,609
no

877
00:54:07,609 --> 00:54:09,530
or thank you folks thank you
