I'm sure you guys enjoy that I know for
I drank all the beer

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,130
but I'm scott i'm suppose to do xoxo

14
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,410
I so I'm gonna talk to you about
false-positive abuse

15
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,330
a I was loud here so

16
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:12,350
how many have you guys are involved with
IDS is IPS

17
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,670
you up to all bullshit that we call an
industry

18
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,750
snake-oil all that crap

19
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,660
I am an IPS dude but I am NOT band

20
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,720
I'm not going to sell you some aunty

21
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,280
are zero-day not hit dude up

22
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,850
I'm here to talk about how these things
incurring

23
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,990
have some problems I sort this is me

24
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,700
a by me on twitter I do

25
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,030
I'm actually professional believe it or
not I'm so as the comics like

26
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:50,100
now my paycheck very much but I think
someone showed each day

27
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,780
is a full force it is in fact

28
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,850
so I mean RTs world okay a

29
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,530
you got people chewed out false
positives a

30
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:05,390
but generally something's going on is an
event

31
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:10,340
each banked causes and I'm option or
reaction something course the

32
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,780
false-positive whatever happened so how
do you view I guess guys

33
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,400
ones one again shows ones okay

34
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,090
how much do you have to do false
positives on a day-to-day basis

35
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,420
yes how much does your company

36
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,640
moves man-hours deal false positives

37
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,350
as always some stupid thing going on you
know always

38
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,290
but they always have mean

39
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,970
folks was it does have a meeting is
either some application doing stuff

40
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,130
wrong or someone is actually up to
something and it's easy for us as a

41
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,550
false positive to

42
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,200
see this is a are as our as a non-event

43
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,890
were sometimes false positives a or
indicators are some think

44
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,060
greater about I what I'm talking about
today

45
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,490
is the we can use false positives

46
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,310
to numerate that is IPS is but more to
the point we actually can use false

47
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,580
positives to enumerate

48
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,050
room sets you know it's hard to detect
detection system per se

49
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,790
but is easy to understand how its
process and frappes

50
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:17,480
I we've we've got some crazy stuff that
that

51
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,520
you know I'll talk a little bit about
I'm also going to talk about

52
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,330
open source project that we launched
last week and anyone that deals with

53
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:31,060
IPS ideas gonna love ship Beyonce so

54
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,400
I've been told them to talk you should
always tell a tale

55
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,790
shows tell stories are I have a story
for you I was at Berlin

56
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,700
and Berlin sites ranting as usual by

57
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,830
yes I really really like have to go the
whole

58
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,190
industry have go exploit that's happened
our

59
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,540
like you know snow Sourcefire exploit

60
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,930
everyone I'm government tell you I just
basically

61
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,240
wanted I I myself was

62
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,400
is a really stupid signature personal

63
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,740
okay everyone see this

64
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,870
how many view got dealings with this

65
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,000
it if you ever seen a small snow how
many of you

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,289
try and work out what's happening here
snow has a room

67
00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:22,169
that was attacked so often a lot you
send all the CDs

68
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:25,780
you know what that is apparently nice
looking for buffer overflow

69
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:30,630
so this is the first one that we should
be so start

70
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:34,220
take the piss out say know what be
really funny

71
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,639
1093 mail signature due to look tough
about snow

72
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:41,120
box will be really pissed off I

73
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,770
soul so friend of mine

74
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,150
a very cool dude Phil a not talked

75
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,699
from he I'm I said to him you should use

76
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:56,759
overseas growing your email signature
strange thing happened because why

77
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,080
expected to happen

78
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,550
was nothing some

79
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:05,960
dude gets some love someone life when
all what actually happened

80
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,379
is the No got dropped didn't go through

81
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:14,930
so we start to think was actually

82
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:20,789
what's actually happening here and the
reality of what was happening here

83
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:25,270
is that his host

84
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,659
EU was the company that that was doing
used

85
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:33,710
claim AV on the mailbox what was
happening walls

86
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:37,810
we'd inadvertently detected detection
system

87
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,319
that walls dropping emails

88
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,430
dropping emails have this in the ball

89
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,719
or in the wherever you want to put it so
start this

90
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:52,289
kinda thought right the this is very
interesting

91
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:55,960
because with one email we now have good
idea about their hosts the EU's

92
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,289
certainly that out with the facts you
know the use

93
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:02,749
this particular so we know the using
snort

94
00:06:02,749 --> 00:06:06,499
signatures we know what rules thats

95
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:10,039
there so we know that they're running

96
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:13,389
this that we know that you're probably
using old rules and we can start to

97
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:14,960
develop

98
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,279
attacks that we nor will buy personal

99
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:22,219
how many guys do you like ideas
innovation techniques

100
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:25,810
that shits funny I mean I live stop

101
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,870
and I'm

102
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,129
this this great a call to the positive
Asian technique abandoning

103
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:37,009
his lies about where you belong here so
there is a rule in snow

104
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:40,189
for and for export Co

105
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:43,759
whisper I meet you guys know was like
Maine Forest poppy

106
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,900
busy bring about he's the guy the

107
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,490
wrote I the ideas innovation techniques
that room

108
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:55,289
the key to the web's that web
applications comment very very cool dude

109
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:58,809
how to export in the white I have

110
00:06:58,809 --> 00:07:02,389
called whisper old export 2000 I would
pop

111
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:05,990
I 98 95 box a

112
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,020
like remark toss just point clicked

113
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,389
review and he reversed engineered from
this export

114
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:16,300
out while any I

115
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,419
what's so slight that what's up
basically ran for sloppy for shits and

116
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:21,349
giggles likes this

117
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:25,219
your C code says the code I've hardcoded
this message

118
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:28,870
in here a and it basically works on all
frightened

119
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:33,770
and I met by of session if you plan on
fragment said host field

120
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:38,680
ship departed 98 right and fines the
sound while

121
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,919
him but he does a it doesn't message
from be first

122
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,319
says yes yet if you see that message
absent be okay

123
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,050
if you don't special system is rebooting
and you're in trouble

124
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:54,349
I'm so what's all swiped it ok sorry
snorted

125
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:58,360
I walls her they didn't write a room

126
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,669
that look for a no fragment in the
server hosting over the map by a session

127
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:06,009
there a rule that look for static string

128
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:09,809
on and that price connection that said
be verse yep yep

129
00:08:09,809 --> 00:08:13,089
and that was the rule the bear in mind
that this exploit

130
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:16,569
was from the wild and what they've Road

131
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:20,249
was basically the basic pops PRC

132
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:24,449
a so why did shiceka goes to take the
original code

133
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:28,150
and change it but at straight through
the texan

134
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:32,409
this is like 2000 this is happening in
2012 under

135
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:36,150
a WTF

136
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,159
I mean what what is going on here this
is ridiculous

137
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:43,070
but we have the we have stores like this
throughout the whole

138
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,080
over detection systems per se a

139
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,480
like to say both dealing false positives
on a day-to-day basis

140
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,040
you have the same false positive that
you keep on seeing time time again

141
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,210
also if you really want P of an
administrator or snow administrator

142
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,500
apparently if you use an immersion
threats is your group that

143
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,150
I E four user-agent: is detected as
Mauer

144
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:08,910
I you can make your own mind up if
that's actually about whether or not

145
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:13,220
most of us would probably argue is and
yes if someone was using IE for my

146
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,240
network

147
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,329
I would love to know about I've are very
much not support stuff for sending me in

148
00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:20,600
a lot

149
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,160
is a is a misdiagnosis to say the least

150
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,070
so that's where we are I am

151
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:33,009
transgressions on so what we are able to
start working out

152
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:36,290
was that opposed to you

153
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:40,930
we were able to really attack that they
were using intrusion prevention system

154
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:45,209
we were able to detect was the
signatures that we use

155
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:49,889
so we know read that we could stop a
being a real pain in the OPs

156
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:53,339
because we could just put a load of
false positives in an email

157
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:56,389
and really annoy someone just keep on
sending the email

158
00:09:56,389 --> 00:10:02,470
time and time again but is it for us to
detect this defects

159
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,829
wouldn't really work force because we'd
need course moms to get the map

160
00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:10,790
who is it start thinking about

161
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:17,790
is before use a fake promises wrong URL

162
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:22,790
reason IPS involvement sticker a
question mark once they got the end you

163
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,130
are out

164
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,649
do I stop can detect do I stop getting
what connection

165
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:32,399
that that those does a good role and if
I remove

166
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,040
this do I still got it you know be so
you've got like yes looking after

167
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,750
website probable our internal network
whatever you choose

168
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,240
do I get a connection dark connection
bingo

169
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,269
with now spot something patient perhaps
Paul

170
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:49,880
I for this

171
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,810
the shits and giggles was a gotten a

172
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:57,120
I wrote this just nothing special in any
shape

173
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,350
shape or form what it is is a a

174
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,449
is raging the house number four known

175
00:11:03,449 --> 00:11:06,709
false-positive strings on

176
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:10,170
if anyone's that was snow in line you
see the end its master data

177
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,779
it will tell you if you alert or drop or
part

178
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:17,680
so we're able to now these just a truck
picked

179
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,160
the top my hat I'm

180
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,399
and you're able to go to website

181
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,490
use North American action and if they've
got snow in place

182
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:31,880
for shits and giggles as well just well
I'm think about it

183
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,790
do you know if you got Facebook with one
of these folks agent strings East use

184
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,269
folks

185
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:39,699
positive strings you get about 60 false
positives

186
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:43,149
every you are I request who have iced up

187
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:46,819
like all the A's everything all the
pictures

188
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:50,060
all the elder HTML CSS and script

189
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:54,040
anything I call all this stuff you much
and how much for pain in the ass that

190
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,519
must be

191
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:58,149
do the first after so yeah we were

192
00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:01,470
some people in a very poor I'm

193
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,829
be having this is available on my
website hit me up on me now

194
00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:08,769
I'll give you top you probably want to
look at these things a little bit more

195
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:12,800
that but what we're able to do now

196
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,970
is we're able to use

197
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:21,399
I'm I mean I'm able to detect post-war
normalization in small

198
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:24,509
I'm pro tip for you snow

199
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:28,279
in line doing protocol normalization

200
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:32,720
time to live last in flight less than
five it will rewrite that pocket make

201
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,029
8 every time so we can send out a pocket

202
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:39,170
the TT Aleve like four and if we see it
become

203
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:42,529
8 bingo snowing lights work you know

204
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:46,060
we know you that so we can start to do
something key stuff

205
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,440
snow is public big problem when it came
to you a

206
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,579
streets so how many have you know about
like a

207
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:57,209
maximum segment size and TCP a

208
00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:00,949
this enables you to specifically change
I

209
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:04,519
to to manage the site marksman segment
so you can say

210
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:08,360
is a bit like MT you but specifically
for TCP

211
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,480
basic a

212
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,560
and interest in you know

213
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,000
how I'm you could use innovation
technique that basically reset the am

214
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,600
assessed value

215
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,190
I made smaller with snow would only work
on the

216
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:30,060
Mt you value and wouldn't be able to to
reconstruct the

217
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:34,509
that that the second size it was it was
blind to that basic

218
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:39,290
almost like protocol on unit we see
those who love Asian techniques over the

219
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,170
years that

220
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:43,959
protocol and see if you can RFC you see
where just

221
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:47,259
isn't clear about what to do top

222
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:50,550
will be an idea survey center I can
guarantee you

223
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:55,699
now because the minute you lacked and
implement to make their own mind all

224
00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:59,589
it's going to be different from an other
implemented that made their own mind up

225
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:03,019
an example if this isn't easy P my
seventy

226
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:06,670
how Windows reconstructs a TCP stream

227
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,829
resembles the TCP stream is inherently
different

228
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:13,870
how when x1 do it someone mean by this
is stuff that all

229
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:18,389
I like how it handles overlapping
fragments

230
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:22,519
is massively different when it's is in
Windows

231
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:26,579
and using the sort of things we can be
with me call this an insurgent

232
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:31,149
we can make the IDS system see one thing

233
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:34,379
but we nor that it will reassemble in a
different way

234
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:38,199
II Alden insurgents option what if you
if your system's

235
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:41,430
let this go through units call you find
a I

236
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,839
one of the old insurgent attacks used to
be invalid checksum

237
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:48,800
so you can make a whole picture appear
tonight yes system

238
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,389
but the minute that an invalid checksum
hit I'm Internet router

239
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:55,860
those packets will be dropped the IDS
reassembly

240
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,120
I was the way that you were able to now
your your idea should not

241
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,259
before about thats all barrio was like
96

242
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:07,509
the first papers came out well so yeah i
mean that that best interest

243
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:10,920
but the problem with white folks
positives is is there the first time the

244
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,750
couple have

245
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:16,000
so a switch a few people here are the
wrong I need to do for spas issue every

246
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,310
race

247
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,730
amounts to a week that probable

248
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,540
see if I sent you thirty false positives
in now

249
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,779
without actually fucked up in your
thinking process

250
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:31,480
is the guy that's managing you like I do
25,000 false positives that day

251
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,069
what's 30 between france but for me

252
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:39,290
I can work out a few using a POSCO
normalization

253
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,879
I can work out how snow is reassembling
stuff for me

254
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,910
I what what would you have done up with
about 30 pick-up

255
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:50,949
files just be played out actually need
to do in the top

256
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:55,079
just replay 30 anyone is playing TCP
replay will tell you

257
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,209
the running a TCP replay

258
00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:01,300
you can run three or four hundred tops

259
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:05,170
and second of I I can literally

260
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:08,889
run three to four thousand tops again
snow in less than a second

261
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:11,959
just using TCP replay

262
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:15,970
there is a product that came out from a
panda are not talk about the benefits

263
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:19,360
I was there but respectful I have

264
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,600
they have a protocol debater storm soft

265
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,620
how many have you guys heard it first
this product

266
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,959
how many view it no review stance of
hope

267
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:35,579
a for is the worst way that you could
possibly be testing in IDS system

268
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,910
inherently it is not scientific

269
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,019
it's completely up tall

270
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:45,879
a and all the shit the old on talk about

271
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:49,290
so for years one of the three 18 months

272
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:53,290
its terms of talking about advanced
evasion techniques

273
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:56,980
I'm sure you've heard that term from
them they like to liked from our

274
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:01,470
and that's cool thereof reserve maybe a
hundred

275
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,550
on CDs and then didn't disclose

276
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:09,300
Anne information about we responsibly
disclosed

277
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,480
to you to other vendors so wise man once
the patient acting

278
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,209
it turns out advanced evasion techniques
is more than one invasion technique

279
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:21,410
missing not your I have

280
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:25,540
superstars there's an interesting paper
Carmen the fault I love it but it's cool

281
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,579
like the achilles heel

282
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:30,130
detection systems and have

283
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:33,240
they make an argument about if you use
more than one

284
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,790
I dissipation technique the chances of
you being detected

285
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:41,880
increased massively because if you think
about we need ships attacked

286
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,309
the fact that you're doing more things
so an example

287
00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:50,549
would be snow a will be taxed any
segment size

288
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:53,770
on 228 part on get on 28 it will

289
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,650
it would make the texan overall I'm sure
you've probably dealt with this before

290
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:03,510
without false positives you gonna see
the Lexmark string5 let go

291
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:08,150
one of the default settings innovator is
to make packets about

292
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:11,610
eight bytes all which will always of
snow

293
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:15,570
always selves the problem was something
like this is that

294
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,690
you you have a web control panel

295
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:21,700
you pressed buttons press the top some

296
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,980
it's not very scientific I mean you
basically got a web application

297
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,230
that's not really how wants to stop so
my advice

298
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:32,880
would be a using something that you
can't guarantee

299
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,279
recreates taxed and we are supposed to
be scientists 24 stock

300
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,980
i'm suppose to be able to turn around to
evander and say

301
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,390
this is what I liked it this is how I
did it

302
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:49,070
this is why I expected to see you can
really do about the baby

303
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:53,049
evader let you take captures my
suggestion would be if you're testing

304
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,049
our guest list

305
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:57,120
the you will take captured traffic and
replay

306
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,059
about because that can guarantee you

307
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:04,870
retraced tests you can't do that with
innovative

308
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:09,480
bar its cool its mines that we have a
product that tests

309
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,260
a 164 advanced evasion techniques me
ferron of

310
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,250
I mean much the evasion techniques with
am I so 867

311
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:21,150
a few not detect not shit you really of
something wrong with you

312
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:25,190
I'm although surprisingly as well
different story

313
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:28,279
I'm there was a point like take

314
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:32,250
a ISO 867

315
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,750
source for all snort with only detecting

316
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:41,600
the version that came out mass book
amass wears a particular network what

317
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,150
when it comes to the CrPC traffic and I
can tell you in about two frames

318
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:49,289
that's come out Matt's and it doesn't
work

319
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:53,070
the natural way of doing things doesn't
work in mass way

320
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,220
when these things we don't talk about
Christmas was the two champions will

321
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:56,809
love it

322
00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:00,419
a pop-up I but I was able to take

323
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:05,480
your regional I'm SO 867 and get that
straight through snort

324
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,799
with bernie shaw over didn't attacked

325
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,809
this four-year-old mature exploit

326
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:15,070
that we've seen time and time and time
again

327
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:19,750
and it was lazy signs the beautiful
thing is think

328
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,799
the report but that's not fair on their
website anymore I don't know why

329
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:27,820
I have which is a 10-page document about
of course and they work

330
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:32,669
zero-day protection accorded if anyone
that knows and I so 867 will know that's

331
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:33,929
babe lease them

332
00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:37,580
am I so 60 40 looks very very simple

333
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:40,620
I so when they run their

334
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:46,210
exploit from mass boy it picked up and I
so 867 invest diagnosed

335
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:49,360
about 10 they protection call me
old-fashioned

336
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,830
book if your job is detection

337
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:56,309
getting a misdiagnosis doesn't account
was a win

338
00:20:56,309 --> 00:21:01,730
you that's what you pay for that's you
function in life

339
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:04,919
so they wrote this post paper about how
awesome they are

340
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:08,200
a how they were that the rule the the

341
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,200
evasion technique that Maxwell uses
coming to you

342
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,590
you if you mess but thats

343
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:17,929
if you are please look at SMB need your
help

344
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:20,929
sits in a pot way

345
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:25,289
how many views admits 086 at on a Pentax
taught them or anything like that

346
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:29,770
on the view from right

347
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:32,960
I know he recently popped box with four
thousand

348
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,250
passes out ship IOC

349
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:40,260
how many if you've used ideas innovation
techniques from Massport

350
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,279
you guys ignore Monaco white default

351
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:47,450
Metasploit uses to I the estimation
techniques by

352
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,710
default you choose to try them on call
me old-fashioned again

353
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:55,100
but I'm going to use idea special
techniques you best be

354
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,500
I'm telling you die yes vision
techniques you know ten on

355
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,720
me and I hope this thing that basically

356
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,809
anyone that knows about like the CRTC or
MSRP see whatever they want call this

357
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:07,480
week

358
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,840
there is ATI corman the time transaction
and

359
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,240
my that is used to the initialization
SMB traffic

360
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,309
so hasty discovered the a wave

361
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:23,279
forcing an end points process code that
wasn't enough a normal way

362
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:27,289
you

363
00:22:27,289 --> 00:22:31,260
so it turned on by default

364
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:35,320
didn't tell anyone and ever since then

365
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,960
you've all been running now on your
boxes about realize

366
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,220
this network what this particular
network but that is only found in mass

367
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,090
boy

368
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:46,929
and the turn of innovative somehow I
don't know how about

369
00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:50,929
I but yet the the ideas if you have a go
at mack's point like show it show

370
00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:51,980
evasions

371
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:56,659
you see a list div II evasions news on
export

372
00:22:56,659 --> 00:22:59,919
they that but turned up this transaction
and quite

373
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,020
the proper way establish a connection
just doesn't happen a

374
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:07,370
back sport you can't make it work now if
you're my support aster

375
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:10,919
they're sitting there going I've tried
the

376
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:14,580
you would think by default on innovative
way be turned on

377
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:18,330
like the folk if that's what you
naturally that's what we've

378
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,779
and you you run it you get Shaw wouldn't
get root I tried

379
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:26,659
gay pop Pop's let's try this show
evasion stuff although

380
00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:30,649
let's try this transact way of doing
stuff exploit fails

381
00:23:30,649 --> 00:23:35,490
yea at the ideas innovation technique
doesn't work well actually no

382
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:38,610
the evaded technique works the
innovative technique doesn't

383
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:42,580
what source what's know what that was
ruled a particularly detective this

384
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,510
particular network

385
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:48,580
and is very very interesting thoughts
what we sing about I it's a lot of fun

386
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:52,929
so yeah I mean static strings were
nightmare

387
00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:57,440
book when we look to

388
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,450
how problems were inspection systems

389
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:04,159
in the Army what we see steeples like
this

390
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,289
if I stick this most these all if these

391
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:11,679
any IP traffic on any poor external to
internal network

392
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,950
will set off Miller in pot the master
data if you are using snow in line

393
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:20,059
dropped the connection any of these

394
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:23,909
I can stick effect from up you're gonna
get Noah

395
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:27,679
I could stick this into a bar even email
you're gonna get Miller

396
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,049
I could just be a tactic I just couldn't
sleep with these I'll

397
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:36,049
you know and how use post-its how I'm
being malicious you saw on planning an

398
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:37,250
attack

399
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:40,679
how do you tell the problem with false
positive reviews is

400
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,840
you see false-positive abuse it's a
legitimate talk

401
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,510
and that this too aspect that you need
to think about false positive reviews

402
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:51,130
a you don't rush right yes system
anymore

403
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:54,289
how many view actually trust you
detection system probably

404
00:24:54,289 --> 00:24:57,320
not bit chai beam

405
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,769
not solve your problem another false
positive but yet

406
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:03,899
this could be an indicator I'm ought to
stop

407
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:06,990
I know I'm now planning an attack I see

408
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:10,659
how your pasta Stan deal with things

409
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:15,610
just by striker I'm you know it's hard
for me to explain to it non

410
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:20,019
I guess dudes literally a stick by me
you are out

411
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:24,450
reaching the I'm getting a lot Lisa
static strings

412
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,510
apparently these detect before overflows

413
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:32,549
really I P bloody surprised

414
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:36,960
I was I was speaking at sect e a which
is a a conference in stock or

415
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,970
and is very fortunate enough to have a
the or SME such a top speed speed that

416
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:46,570
and he's talking about I messing with
big points

417
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:50,320
the and anyone that likes it big points
on that is this twenty

418
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,140
by field at the beginning and if you
don't mind putting some money

419
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:57,929
you can basically destroyed the chain
how this works for me

420
00:25:57,929 --> 00:26:01,049
basically there's an implementation
issue if you don't mind

421
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:05,940
burning a little bit a couch you can ok
everyone else's money

422
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,610
he was dismissed talk about false
positive review seems like can you get

423
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:09,960
me

424
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,809
a twenty by false-positive strength yeah

425
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:17,840
without proper I have so he's looking

426
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,330
put one of these false positives it's
pat Quinn's

427
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:25,149
I was fun factor to be every time a pic
which generates myself a lot on your

428
00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:26,140
network

429
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:32,980
all you're a tease gonna delete you
money beautiful

430
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,760
a nothing to do with me of course I'm
not responsible society

431
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,860
or liability for anyone else's research
but yeah

432
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:44,049
this is another example were snow its
past

433
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:47,590
there is no fit in fields or bites and
pick one

434
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:51,340
such obvious that make you find this 20
bucks I follow the rule

435
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:55,760
in small that basically start

436
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,950
script and that's the rule

437
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,360
any web traffic that's not a script
you've probably been pissed off at you

438
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,789
about your system

439
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:07,240
but basically your typical script are

440
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,950
last but that's the the rule fees like
see I don't go to the website I look at

441
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,929
the roost I've got my sister

442
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:17,010
is on a little bit lazy my sites as well

443
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,130
and he said to me really but that seems

444
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:23,559
seems not room your is the SSID

445
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:26,710
is the website link to it can have a
look

446
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:30,890
you go to the website that when
escapehtml

447
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:35,860
her from this war room you basic got of
the rule explains on the website

448
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,159
and as they are got script gas while

449
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:43,440
there and upskirt on the website a
recent interesting issue

450
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,860
because a sure banged up

451
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,720
how do you not understand stove secondly

452
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,860
Wow what vast best persistent

453
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:58,450
access s have I mean much and delivering
an XSS

454
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:03,580
by snow rooms how how beautiful is this
is a concept

455
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:07,700
I and probably easy to do defense
amongst the personal

456
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,809
apostles i hates the amount based in
nature as well

457
00:28:11,809 --> 00:28:14,889
we could really cold some misty but so

458
00:28:14,889 --> 00:28:19,789
the the the false positive stuff is
inherently

459
00:28:19,789 --> 00:28:23,740
interesting and not we can really get up
some missed you

460
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:28,389
I

461
00:28:28,389 --> 00:28:32,649
I want to say are you coming months if
three hundred

462
00:28:32,649 --> 00:28:36,720
false positives and the 25,000 day
you're dealing with

463
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,760
probably not I'll other on

464
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,990
gonna sought to understand what things
are going on I want trying to get across

465
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:43,769
is

466
00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:47,029
is that you need to spend you need to
make the business

467
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:50,120
argument do you manage is saying

468
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53,840
we need to focus on mom on looking
false-positive

469
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,370
a false positive is always a triple
sister in the fucked up

470
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:00,960
something is tricking I'm if we don't
understand why not event has been

471
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,830
happening

472
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:04,970
someone else might know something about
was that we didn't want to know

473
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:09,220
and if you don't watch Top I mean be
issued false positive use as well as

474
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:13,960
about the tide untested the validity of
the system is in question because you

475
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,850
don't trust the system anymore

476
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:20,080
I much in the legal argument when you
turn on CB Prince we've got market

477
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,370
yeah but you have 25,000 false positives
that day please tell me again

478
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:27,679
how you up sure but this was the guy
that did it

479
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,409
please call so if you know what you
folks positive someone else might

480
00:29:32,409 --> 00:29:37,130
very well I'm really with internist is
almost like to be optionally

481
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:41,179
the we are in we have control

482
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:44,480
a situation that makes something

483
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,950
you know someone said to me or I'd love
to be able to reverse

484
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:51,169
and Ginny signatures in Maui and in IPS

485
00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:54,130
I'm you'd have to have a debugger up to
the memory would have to do this and

486
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,340
have to do that

487
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:58,700
actually not we are in control

488
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:02,899
what comes in so we could start to
reverse engineer signatures

489
00:30:02,899 --> 00:30:06,130
very easily because we know what
triggers it

490
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:11,309
we know how I am I so 867 this detective
so we can work out which part upstream

491
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,220
setting alarm off

492
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:17,799
you know we don't have to hook you up to
people to we know we are in control

493
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:21,120
a so we always have you not being
controlled be

494
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,090
see not scientific process we know what
goes in

495
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:29,090
and we see something go out we can start
making educated guesses

496
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:32,850
the problem with this its is that how'd
you get rid

497
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:36,860
the pain nice false positives you know
what you don't

498
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:40,710
I'm not gonna give you up its story
about how we should do XY in Sac

499
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:44,519
because there is no way to eradicate
false-positive use

500
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:47,600
you know II here about an only detection
systems

501
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,350
yep cool the problem in only detection
systems is

502
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,580
what's normal versus abnormal so

503
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:59,070
you drop you are not only detection
system

504
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:03,220
onto a network that's probably fires
back towards and all that stuff

505
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,990
you know I will do it will look on the
back door isn't working anymore

506
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:10,590
because it's different that's the
abnormal behavior

507
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:15,130
anomaly detection systems only work if
it's on a clean network for it starts

508
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:18,750
if you're compromised how do you know
it's not there

509
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:22,269
at the rate at which you just don't
false positive views at the end of the

510
00:31:22,269 --> 00:31:23,830
day

511
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:28,059
you always have false positive reviews
there's no way around it

512
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:32,909
if you write sloppy signatures which
let's be honest with you

513
00:31:32,909 --> 00:31:36,350
we write sloppy software of course we
write sloppy

514
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:41,250
signatures I mean it's about getting out
ready to ship

515
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:44,980
we've got detection yeah you've got by
protection

516
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:48,120
the source like guys who love them to
bits my pic on them because they are

517
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,460
open source or nature nothing but
respect them in the act

518
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:56,330
I know it sounds like be on them hard in
my opinion it's not to use

519
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:59,909
you write your prop commercial Banda
needs to be due back

520
00:31:59,909 --> 00:32:03,559
the snow guys these are basically people
in their own time

521
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:07,009
of course the commercial system should
be back but it doesn't

522
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:11,120
doesn't always work with us Fort I

523
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,259
sure carter's on possible by the way I
was looking for

524
00:32:15,259 --> 00:32:18,669
IDS play about with there is a
distribution who

525
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:22,009
security on you you can roll out by

526
00:32:22,009 --> 00:32:25,100
idea system in about 25 minutes

527
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,899
I'm have updating stop playing with
Beijing techniques

528
00:32:28,899 --> 00:32:33,480
using Metasploit surprisingly though or

529
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,090
on on on another note Metasploit

530
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:40,259
it's very easy to the tact air

531
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:43,630
hugely easy to detect we could probably
together

532
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:46,559
right maybe thirty or forty rules
they're probably just attacked my

533
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:47,330
passport

534
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:51,190
then we could stick time box I make
become another bad

535
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:54,370
not be awesome we've got zero-day
protection

536
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:57,600
we detect mass boy yeah not bad guys

537
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,600
fortunately yet test the Pentastar

538
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:06,190
so we know week want to say is is that
would force was if you need

539
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:09,309
to stop monitoring you need to
understand what is happening if you

540
00:33:09,309 --> 00:33:10,320
don't

541
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,799
this is where all goes wrong a dog but
from security on you

542
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,549
said to me be kind rewind

543
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:21,870
you do you have this you know when you
use the right videos

544
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:27,250
and that they always have to be kind
rewind when he sang in detection systems

545
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:31,610
storage is cheap why do you not keeping
hold streams

546
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:35,549
why why are we not storing these you
know why

547
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:39,630
because we saw we don't do it and he's
absolutely right

548
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:43,769
we should be keeping home to the stator
release for certain amount of time

549
00:33:43,769 --> 00:33:47,429
so that we can start on one's what's
what's going on I mean

550
00:33:47,429 --> 00:33:51,799
how many of you chased down false
positives 90 s

551
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:54,840
really arctic fox yet

552
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,330
there is a God we have no idea what's
happening

553
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:01,659
is happening for a reason for no reason
it so I mean sciences

554
00:34:01,659 --> 00:34:05,539
you've are sick only those we tell it to
do

555
00:34:05,539 --> 00:34:08,960
CS spent some time looking a
false-positive

556
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,490
use

557
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:17,500
if it is not involved in your I if it's
not involved in your day-to-day

558
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:22,090
investigation than please tell me
because I'm gonna start to build

559
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:27,919
gauge what you're up to because you just
ignored me inside me off

560
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:31,440
false positives in the end are actually

561
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,780
let's be technical about it true
positives

562
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,450
they detect you know that that this
something happening

563
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:42,020
but most have you guys been will to now
sign of

564
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:46,179
on false positive but you don't
somewhere happen

565
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:49,550
all these penetrations that we've seen
across the board

566
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:53,200
these famous networks getting don't you
know Sony

567
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,280
you bet your ass there's an IPS in place
but didn't fucking the tact

568
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,440
I have know what known calls for Sean

569
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,859
a spot sorry about security about this
but about nevermind

570
00:35:03,859 --> 00:35:08,230
probably the most annoying homework
system that you know nor the venerable

571
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:12,950
for in my opinion IQ's false positives
way that you

572
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:16,380
you probably feel uncomfortable

573
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,560
and its even just to be an annoyance

574
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,470
I mean you can see people in he went
when I talk about false positives

575
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:23,900
because

576
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:27,790
no your pain feel it you know I see what
you guys have to go through

577
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:33,579
i sponsored by the literally deals with
25,000 25,000 false positives that

578
00:35:33,579 --> 00:35:37,150
Howard up you supposed to be able to

579
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:40,890
in your sped down time managed Kong

580
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:44,420
you need to go back to make that person
talking about what say

581
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:48,190
please give us an intact it was a junior
give us something

582
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:52,440
that we can at least now let's not spend
any more money on maximal

583
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,660
spend a bit more money on spear let's
move forward unless

584
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:59,599
actually look at this time

585
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,900
he should always obviously the whole
ability

586
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:07,400
that how system to tax making you
nervous about how that works is

587
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,900
its my package because you just gonna
change

588
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:15,140
out well you know believe your system
and when it tries to tell you that as a

589
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:15,579
No

590
00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:19,609
along going up homie if you've seen I
was fortunate enough to see

591
00:36:19,609 --> 00:36:24,619
Jason E Street talk Monday recently I he
was telling me about how

592
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:27,650
I'm there have been indicator

593
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:30,690
time before it was a false positive and
that you

594
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:33,829
out two months later they were breached

595
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:37,930
the long its job tell use the on
StumbleUpon taxed

596
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:41,650
what I longings I'm sure how I wonder
how many times you guys have signed

597
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,589
something of

598
00:36:43,589 --> 00:36:48,720
I'm an axe you the triples on use the
non-stop

599
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,690
so I want to spend a little bit have
more time talking about I idea that

600
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:53,240
we've got

601
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,810
we are running out minutes and it's
around so

602
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:01,339
is that one more thing colombo apartment

603
00:37:01,339 --> 00:37:05,569
so ever been up to not been making
friends obviously I'm

604
00:37:05,569 --> 00:37:09,010
ivy speaks a lot of people when I start
for Mike company

605
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:13,380
he said to me so I started on his
research to better testing for them

606
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:17,500
you have to pay the bills the I said to
us

607
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:22,150
what can you do what what what research
me gap as upon

608
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:25,550
and I thought there was expecting a
white paper unfortunate detached you

609
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,180
could think

610
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:30,020
telling them actually what I thought we
needed resigned without me having a lot

611
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,030
more work

612
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:36,380
next time I want just shot my mouth what

613
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,930
I've been talking to people about how
screwed up the city this

614
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:44,000
whole industry when it comes to section
actually is have you had to look at the

615
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,069
cells which it went

616
00:37:45,069 --> 00:37:48,790
someone says to you why the hell should
be kept work

617
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:53,220
arm I a

618
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:56,859
you know you don't have an ounce you
have to go in you the whole

619
00:37:56,859 --> 00:38:00,540
PR she that we call an industry

620
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,650
and if you noticed anyone who's have
purchased detection system

621
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,750
it'll always be operatives 10 big

622
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:10,130
full duplex able to detect we've got me
but we've got

623
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:14,089
not be detect although Moxie talks yes
but I have a thousand threats how many

624
00:38:14,089 --> 00:38:14,410
we

625
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:19,069
attacked only a we've got four duplex

626
00:38:19,069 --> 00:38:22,310
no one asking you is what you to tax

627
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:26,079
all well you know when we fall back too
late to reform their tough situation

628
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,540
please answer the question no one cannot

629
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,800
I'm leave you have to deal with this I
view

630
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,160
ever got straight answer about actual
detection in detection system

631
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:41,430
and you still brought to if there's no
choice it's there

632
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:45,130
I have had people tell me the

633
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:49,750
IPS is dat ready because they seem to be
deployed everywhere

634
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:52,849
we don't call my PS now they will call
next Jack

635
00:38:52,849 --> 00:38:56,390
a all we've got another TLA will call
will call them

636
00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:00,240
unified threat monitors in blah blah
blah blah blah blah blah

637
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,290
do you look at streams to tax your
detection system

638
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:06,670
top the problem is is that

639
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:10,750
the industry s pretty screwed up

640
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:13,760
story on Sep at all a

641
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,530
people hate yeah I guess industry
because the call

642
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:22,859
yes trails a knock-on effect this is
what average mind

643
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:26,589
I me probably people thing from their
store because the vent oh I D S two to

644
00:39:26,589 --> 00:39:27,890
get

645
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:31,290
John I mean I mean that's the real if it
because everyone calls

646
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:35,060
all shown what we do a like upon show
was

647
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:38,280
I'm sorry I'll either way over

648
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,109
there's no product cousteau enough's
enough now

649
00:39:42,109 --> 00:39:46,380
it's about time as an industry we black
go away with using times

650
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:49,790
that mean nothing to us we've got four
duplex nor

651
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:53,020
we want to know what actions sort of sin
of

652
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:57,849
so what cost me what we can do and I
said what we really need

653
00:39:57,849 --> 00:40:02,109
is an open-source testing methodology
the surprisingly

654
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:05,859
every time I go to conference month
about list of people come up to me and

655
00:40:05,859 --> 00:40:07,280
say

656
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,470
I saw some I really want to test our our
system

657
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:13,869
is this something i can download
actually not

658
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:17,270
sorry I we should think about it but

659
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:21,819
you can download I testing guy you can
build a web application

660
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:25,470
and find god knows how much literature
and how to secure development life

661
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,510
cycles

662
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:29,730
I see these things they've been around
since like 1972

663
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:32,750
detecting governments in all of this
source stuff

664
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:36,170
not in open source testing by them well

665
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:40,130
in which is really dropped the ball in
my humble opinion so I set to work

666
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:43,490
what we really need is

667
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:47,800
attesting died more than a testing guide
what we actually need is an organization

668
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,770
that isn't a factor that is purely about

669
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:56,470
I mean the great something we haven't or
what you know we can't argue

670
00:40:56,470 --> 00:41:01,040
against or what it how it's helped web
application development

671
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,190
yes it has its issues yes it's not the
the Bible

672
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:08,280
but tell you what's that somebody could
stop

673
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:12,170
at least that's something you know what
don't have our detection systems at the

674
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:12,690
moment

675
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:16,300
when of sin of I'm happy to tell you
that

676
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:21,280
I told Michael this is what we need to
do my computer review me

677
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,700
but they basically said yes you're right
we do need an open-source organization

678
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,940
that works purely about texan

679
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:32,250
that we can have a freely available I

680
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:36,460
testing guy you can come down and and I
think that's important

681
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:40,300
and proper documentation I spoke to a
number people about this recently

682
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:43,700
you know the amazing Ste

683
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,790
so famous thing without loss or stopped
at right

684
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:52,349
so source that's me what we really
should do should happen or sniff top

685
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:56,819
and someone else that to me you know
what should I should just stop fine

686
00:41:56,819 --> 00:42:00,450
you know because the problem with your
stock tennis it's not

687
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:04,619
democratically chosen I fair enough

688
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:07,890
I think that's a affect criticism I'm

689
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:11,790
doesn't mean that those top 10 shouldn't
be licked before missus the free

690
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:16,829
not to try for stack well I think we do
330 sleep in that really should you

691
00:42:16,829 --> 00:42:21,900
justice we need to find 10 I i think if
we start with five

692
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:25,180
and let it mature involved in 10 minutes
writing

693
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:28,599
is the right way doing because this
house to calm

694
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:32,180
from causes industry looking at things
and saying

695
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:36,020
okay I'm going to Nate's move my time
what companies going to donate some my

696
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:36,710
time

697
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:40,300
we are going to have a look at this is a
federation so

698
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:44,400
I've been speaking to people out the out
the concept announce the top five

699
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,040
and it's amazing the will have such
different opinions

700
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,859
will have similar stuff have been after
me maybe 10 to 15 people

701
00:42:51,859 --> 00:42:54,859
I know in the industry I trust and

702
00:42:54,859 --> 00:42:57,910
in some ways arsenic fastest officer
dictatorships we get

703
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:02,410
all running off the ground right nothing
we can do about

704
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:05,630
you know I wish there was another way
Paul looks like I'm

705
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:09,099
boss for a little bit as soon as we ok
running

706
00:43:09,099 --> 00:43:13,190
we invite people to come on board you
know common shareholders whatever

707
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:16,740
organizations trucks that use to make
this work I don't want to do on my own

708
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,990
I don't wants to be the ideas life

709
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:25,309
rest did bloody good job myself my
position but I really don't want

710
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:29,500
so it's amazing what people think some
stuff

711
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:34,290
is universally was but for the IDS guys
I can guarantee you the top five

712
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:39,290
always always always always the answer
is misconfiguration

713
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:42,780
I'm got to so many war stories about
this configuration

714
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:46,280
its K there was a company

715
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:51,240
that hot an IPS system between two
interest to 10 points

716
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:55,020
by the middle very popular and have had
a false positive

717
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:58,180
know how to turn a great trip was indeed
a I

718
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:01,300
pop yeah invisible traffic

719
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:05,530
well done the problem is is that

720
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:08,569
there's no documentation about saying
was good practice about the point guard

721
00:44:08,569 --> 00:44:09,950
your system

722
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:14,140
we need to fix misconfiguration is an
issue

723
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:18,210
everyone says this another thing is a
pre deployment checklist

724
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:21,440
nearly everyone universe tells me

725
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,500
what we need is some guy ditto says what
we need to look out for before we put a

726
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,069
product

727
00:44:26,069 --> 00:44:29,250
place okay

728
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:32,450
I have

729
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:37,250
the point guidelines this is another
thing that people talk to me about

730
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:41,579
how how do I passed roll out 90 s

731
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:45,730
I'm yours to use the universe away

732
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:49,470
i think is a community we've done it
with with web application you can apply

733
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:51,400
what we learn from all walks

734
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,660
and those organizations and we can
deploy this snake

735
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:58,270
oil filled industry that takes money
offers

736
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:02,640
constantly for poor performance we can
take some ownership

737
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:08,109
because if we don't do it focus

738
00:45:08,109 --> 00:45:12,329
and is this a people worrying about a
Mike misconfiguration

739
00:45:12,329 --> 00:45:15,960
want things is quite clear a star
testing died shouldn't tell you what

740
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:16,940
tools to test

741
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:20,510
they should tell you how to do something
should be a methodology

742
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:24,390
if your organization decides that
they're going to pay someone else to an

743
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:27,240
organization's test particular part
methodology

744
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,660
soapy it's not documents place to tell
you

745
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:34,530
how to do business so us that needs to
be

746
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:38,619
documentation individual organizations
need to make their own mind up

747
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:42,349
about how if they're gonna buy product
the taskbar probable

748
00:45:42,349 --> 00:45:46,770
it works now lost should work nicely

749
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:50,700
this is surprisingly the main

750
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:54,210
there's nothing on their part holding
page right now there is a Twitter

751
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,210
account that's

752
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:59,569
or sniff project nothing on there yet
I've been speaking about this for months

753
00:45:59,569 --> 00:46:03,410
have been home and problems how long I

754
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:08,250
so in October sucks gets more movement
and why would ask is there anyone who is

755
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,079
interested

756
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:12,930
eastman grab me send me a tweet sent me
email

757
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:16,710
anyone any involvement let me just
months shit you and saying why act

758
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:20,750
think this actually in this size about
because I need people to feedback

759
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:26,559
on how we don't before this because this
is gonna happen

760
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:29,809
I would love you guys im you know
