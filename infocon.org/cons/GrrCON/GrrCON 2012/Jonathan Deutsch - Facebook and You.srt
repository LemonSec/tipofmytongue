1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,620
so good morning everybody I'm Johnny

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,339
I'm just a quick review of being on from
Israel

3
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:10,940
income that's the farthest that anyone
has ever come

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,330
to and this place um

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:19,680
in my training I am in army officer
intelligence officer for its third for

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,109
about eight years

7
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:24,460
and the Israeli intelligence core then

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,359
I became a consultant for the Ministry
of Defence the Israeli minister defense

9
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:32,059
transferred for a few months for the
Department of Defense your Department of

10
00:00:32,059 --> 00:00:32,669
Defense

11
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:35,770
and the than now

12
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,879
which is my current position I'm a
manager at

13
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,059
the hectic said Van Security Center
which is

14
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,870
accompany acquired by Ernst & Young I
think that everybody heard of earnest in

15
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,879
young nobody really thinks I'm Ernst &
Young in this capacity

16
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:54,170
so what they did is you know the
american way that the

17
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,350
just bought someone so um

18
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,320
where I a former military on
intelligence outfit though we're about

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,460
thirty five guys

20
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,090
think were forty now um

21
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,409
acquired like a year ago we have all
sorts of analysts

22
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:15,189
geyser do Chinese Arabic Farsi Russian
and Turkish

23
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:19,560
is urs allow out there and you probably
are wondering why do you need all these

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,930
guys doing all these

25
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,229
languages because some when we do

26
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:29,079
an assessment security assessment we
take it one step further and that's

27
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:33,229
actually gathering intelligence I and on
intelligence that

28
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:36,119
you might have heard of you know like
one ability intelligence there's a new

29
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:37,659
her ability that intelligence

30
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:42,130
that's not intelligence what we do is

31
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,869
we assess and we gaffer and we'll talk a
bit

32
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:49,829
about what the tools that we use I will
give you

33
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:53,570
I a proof-of-concept for you to think I
love

34
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:58,570
on how to gather intelligence on what so

35
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:02,399
just a small %ah up primer on on
intelligence some

36
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,780
before we we actually go into this we
need to understand that are several

37
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,050
field intelligence

38
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:12,830
are we actually this talk is a bit about
sigan which is signal intelligence and a

39
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,430
bit about

40
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,640
human jus human intelligence now seconds

41
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,260
um is what you know as the guy in the
middle love the wire

42
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,709
you know like man in the middle but and
a for more capacity oven nation or state

43
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:28,879
somebody listening into the conversation

44
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,470
it includes I want to go into the
details in close mass in alan was

45
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,940
measurement intelligence

46
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:38,180
comin radar intelligence all the
boringest that most boring

47
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,450
a types of intelligence we're not
talking about these guys

48
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,620
awesome which is open source
intelligence

49
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,950
now which is actually reading and
sifting through media

50
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,730
open media and understanding what's out
there um

51
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,370
there are there's a lot of good stuff
and the open-source

52
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,489
I'm not open source computer style open
source

53
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:01,890
very different and there's web in which
is

54
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,940
arm a a sub practice

55
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,730
I've of sandwiches is talking on forms

56
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,680
but not exactly participating it's a
very complex

57
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,300
way to to say that it's different from
%ah cents but

58
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,640
down we talked intelligence officer they
have to make this difference

59
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,280
humint is the one that we all know James
Bond thats humint

60
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,629
working your magic around people so

61
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:33,379
let's go to our subject which is social
networking specifically Facebook but

62
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:37,409
let's talk about the most common
perceptions that if you work in an

63
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:40,680
in a corporation or everywhere else at
people

64
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,480
believe of social networks mostly

65
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,430
mass destruction right um

66
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,959
well we don't actually look at it like
this it is more of

67
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,959
our dream you know we would like to

68
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,400
be in the room the first day that
somebody wanted the director of the CIA

69
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,760
agents that will there's this Scott this
thing called Facebook

70
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,989
people actually put their content online

71
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:14,430
you'd only to find it they update it and

72
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,239
I love the American Way is the fact that
the CIA if it really like someone is

73
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:20,269
actually funds it

74
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:23,610
and one of the initial funding was by

75
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,800
up the venture capital I

76
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,750
guys from the CIA queuing to remember
name

77
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,949
I'm the funding Facebook they give it
five million 10 million I remember

78
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:39,080
the initial funding so fifty they're
really like that

79
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,100
no wonder so

80
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,889
they really liked it because you got 845
million

81
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:50,130
monthly active users and

82
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:54,770
when the Facebook got its on stock
altogether

83
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,930
arm they had to actually show all the
statistics that they're actually rights

84
00:04:58,930 --> 00:04:59,790
and

85
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,460
how much are fake profile home under
real profile

86
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,979
I love interesting stuff now not exactly
the property of the US but

87
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:13,310
for the rest of the world or everyone
who wishes to buy Facebook stock

88
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,050
arm and you can see the state ominous
just amazing

89
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:21,449
the amount of users you were talking
about active users not someone that

90
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:26,850
opened an account then just forgot about
it or unused I R fake profile and stuff

91
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:27,910
like that

92
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,509
actual users so

93
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:34,580
their lineup good and bad things that
could

94
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,880
come from Facebook um a very well-known

95
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:43,250
are example is oh what's it called that
the Arab Spring

96
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,740
and all sorts have a venues that it
happened

97
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,699
afterwards which is the Syrian
Revolution and which

98
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:54,880
using social networks a lot of

99
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,110
basis that they are ruled by Dec 30 ship
I

100
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,919
were able to assemble and rebels were
able to communicate

101
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,949
using social networks and actually one
voice can be heard over

102
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:11,639
thousands and millions I you guys from
me know this

103
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,860
I want the American now wave using it

104
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:19,530
an Invisible Children the a coney 2012

105
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,650
um which is also the way

106
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:26,080
I've using Facebook but of course

107
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,030
we're gonna hop over to China because we
need to talk about bad thanks

108
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:35,770
and some we have a very malicious and
won't see very malicious to a malicious

109
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,870
uses Juve Facebook a very well-known 10
K

110
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,910
that China suspected have actually

111
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,990
setting up a fake profile love one of
the head there operatives

112
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,020
and nato and actually friending

113
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,259
all sorts of nato officials and you know
your boss wants a friend you on facebook

114
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:55,090
you gonna say no

115
00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:00,250
I and they said yes an affordable the
fake profile they did not suspected that

116
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:05,009
the beginning and they got a lot of open
source intelligence on the specific

117
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:08,069
nato officials and funny thing is was

118
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:11,910
it these was that got the word the guys
from nato that are in charge

119
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,169
love cyber there's a yeah

120
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:19,479
and and now in Estonia in Tolland they
have fun

121
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:22,759
they have this the CDO we r remember a
lot of initials

122
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:28,270
I it's about cyber okay it was after
that the DoS attack the alleged Russian

123
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,599
the DoS attack on on talent

124
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:33,900
they open the center there and well

125
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,289
everybody could fall for it um

126
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:40,860
one of the major things is the
transition towards facebook when it

127
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,780
comes to

128
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,889
I jihadists jihadist activists

129
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:48,930
arm jihadist activists or jihadist
terrorists are

130
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:54,840
um of terrorists that to do their
activities in the name of God

131
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,129
we're not gonna say that specific name
of God because it has given rise to a

132
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:00,819
lot of problems during these last days

133
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:04,900
um so some we can see a transition
towards a

134
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:09,610
sure social networking arm the gaffer
here and they actually tell you

135
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,849
what is the specific targets that there
are after

136
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:16,940
arm its most common for de dos attacks

137
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,560
as much as it's not you know our a very
fretful

138
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,940
well attack vector it's still something
that causes destruction

139
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,750
I love business

140
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,250
so the real question is does anyone care
i mean

141
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:36,839
this is a growing field then you have a
lot of ability to do good

142
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:40,539
or bad so what does does anyone

143
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:44,320
think of this I mean besides the CIA

144
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,100
so apparently the FBI I are very
interested in and social media

145
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,620
as you might think and died actually
wanted to our

146
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,690
to ask someone to develop a tool for
them

147
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,820
so from actually went and our

148
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,540
that a tender online tender and they
asked for people to

149
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,760
give them you know where r an RFID and
ask them

150
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,060
could we develop this tool and I it's
all about social media

151
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,980
I'm force well economist that because
they have kinda high hopes

152
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,470
for distal um the actually want to be
able to have a worldwide terror data

153
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:28,620
and a US domestic terror data and the US
embassies & Company consulates & mission

154
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,529
what this is not exactly what you wanna
the Facebook

155
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:37,060
that's very nice but it's like getting
world domination by Facebook

156
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:41,600
it doesn't happen by day and now by a
tool

157
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,000
so the funny thing you know with open
source intelligence is a good data

158
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,880
examples that

159
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,230
someone actually asked them on their
site arm

160
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:53,769
do you have a to you mean Rd trying to

161
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:57,160
bring up their capability or so
something that no well this is a new

162
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,370
requirement for the FBI we've known

163
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,459
its not something we do that's good to
know

164
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:06,519
um we can see a goal over into

165
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:09,760
got the legal system now we had a case

166
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,130
not that tough are going August are
where

167
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:17,440
are the court ruled that information
into a that was gathered

168
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,760
using I am a profile from

169
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,140
someone that actually was a rat so now
that you know

170
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:29,380
are wanted to the to bring out his
friend and he wanted to say all sorts of

171
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,140
stuff

172
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:34,740
and the the judge actually allow didn't
say that Facebook users may actually

173
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,820
this site to keep their profile
completely private shared them only with

174
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,550
friends

175
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:43,310
or more explicitly with friends or
friends which means you

176
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,339
it doesn't really matter if it's private
that's you know

177
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:50,640
everybody can see it and we could use it
as Intel we could use and legal system

178
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,350
we can use it

179
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:56,180
wherever we'd like to so not only
intelligence

180
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,500
also the legal system so

181
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,640
what about the private sector what have
they done about

182
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,250
so um if you guys have heard the have
arm Anco else one of the

183
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:13,519
largest are oil manufacturers and Saudi
Arabia

184
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,079
I think it's the largest in the world
well also the world is there

185
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,279
I and they actually I reported

186
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,740
a breach a data breach on their network

187
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,790
and they actually went online with it
and they did under Facebook page

188
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,500
very bluntly they said well that's what
happened and down

189
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,320
or not you know very vaguely the later
later discussed the

190
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,519
more a details but very vaguely but

191
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:44,500
it was online see a lot of people liking
in this

192
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,829
this is this is a really funny hit so up

193
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:51,310
once once they've publish it I mean it's
out there on Facebook

194
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,899
you know what happens their employees
are commenting

195
00:11:55,899 --> 00:12:01,990
and you get also serve weird stuff that
I mean is that why my email doesn't work

196
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:05,990
and it's kind of a funny way to get to
know you know get your acknowledgement

197
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,889
on the attack

198
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:10,019
did it work are their mail system
doesn't work okay

199
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:15,160
so it's related and we have all sorts
OVA are comments and people giving IP is

200
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,850
within the network because

201
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:20,130
the guide to publish that was the
network administrator

202
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:23,820
so it was that there was a way to to
convict him instead of you know just

203
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,050
Eileen

204
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:28,200
they went online and it was private

205
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,110
I'm well as private data that we went on
to the public

206
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:38,260
go so we have a lot of things that
people say about their corporations

207
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,500
and people don't really understand that
this is private data

208
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,079
and they don't really understand I the
problems that

209
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:49,029
they actually a a cause once they you
know give out

210
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:52,470
private information of an organization
and really helps an attacker understand

211
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:52,839
what

212
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:56,899
is it that you have within your
organization I mean we have Lotus Notes

213
00:12:56,899 --> 00:12:57,660
as well

214
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,240
okay I don't know publishing it

215
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,519
so basically all comes to the the basic
assumption

216
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:07,870
I mean you do not have a bad for him
stability

217
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,839
is a Russian guys area

218
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,320
I have I have in israel week I'll about
a million

219
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,980
russian immigrants and there's a huge
are Russian community

220
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,300
and and I'm the guy that I have a good
friend

221
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,790
russian of course and he said while
these are Russian guys I so well how do

222
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,700
you how do you respond to see the beer

223
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,959
right next to that one this is this is
keen net

224
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:35,829
this is a good beers's said only
russians friend get this is really

225
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:37,149
shitty beer

226
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,209
I and of course

227
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:44,370
this this is only a Russian contraction

228
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:49,360
so a bit about hype I we're talking
about BBT

229
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,990
I hate using the words we have about to
a slight so maybe which is advanced

230
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,269
persistent threat

231
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:59,160
um also it's a buzz on what it does and
the fact that they have used all sorts

232
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,610
of advanced gathering on intelligence
math Phys

233
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:06,250
yeah you know but have above crap um

234
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,300
but let us understand exactly I

235
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,300
what is it that there after I mean

236
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,060
before we're talking about the Y let's
talk about

237
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:20,149
how do I find my target because this is
something that

238
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:24,149
people just dismiss sake yeah they one
out then they just

239
00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:27,709
single them out is that johnnie

240
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:32,740
okay and his coworkers okay let's find
johnnie

241
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:36,949
it's not an easy thing to do I mean
johnnie's not within the management of

242
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:39,019
Ernst & Young

243
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:43,930
you don't have them online and connected
directly to all his friends

244
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:48,120
ordered the saying goes to if assumable
the

245
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,389
Rs they would have been attacked with an
advanced

246
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:54,550
persistent fret that is a big if

247
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:58,250
um they would have done scoping far less

248
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:02,449
intelligence so let's just understand I
mean we're trying to fish someone

249
00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:03,459
outright

250
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:06,880
use spearfishing like everybody likes to
say

251
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,959
so how do we how do fish

252
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:13,160
I mean just like a set we have johnny is
1 percent you have the advance

253
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,860
securities under which is like 45 guys

254
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:21,480
and girls and up he why is like 250,000

255
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,699
that's huge even the israeli practices
like

256
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:27,790
I 1700 that's a lotta love

257
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,910
other people so

258
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:34,850
assist star of the basic assumption I
mean my attacker

259
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:39,230
I'll would actually know me he knows
that i works for you why

260
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:44,230
and that's a well we tried to willey
Google hack as well

261
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:48,139
well there could be an option but we're
talking about Facebook here and there is

262
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:51,389
a slight problem you know if he'd
actually use Google hacking

263
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:54,899
there's a small indexing more than
actually prevents it I

264
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:58,029
Yahweh they don't if if you know that
that

265
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:03,130
once you go to to the facebook when you
wanna translate something when you wanna

266
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,380
use map resources you always get

267
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,889
most amazing guy search engine in the
world big

268
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:13,420
just good for searching google um so

269
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:17,360
soda this is this is a small issue and
you can really do it using Google will

270
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:17,949
so

271
00:16:17,949 --> 00:16:22,800
cool having is out Anderson nice tool
called the harvester

272
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,690
on which actually helps you get all
sorts of names and phone numbers and

273
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,880
being research I don't know why being um

274
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,170
anne gets a lot of data a lot of data
but it's not really

275
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:41,220
it doesn't really help us here because
it doesn't have facebook aunt

276
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:46,100
remember most people have facebook not a
lot of people have linked and then you

277
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:46,870
know

278
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:51,630
it's really it's not something globally
I mean I i talked

279
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:55,889
virtually all over the world and and
only in Israel and the US I saw a lot of

280
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,949
people using Arlington

281
00:16:57,949 --> 00:17:02,240
jus ideal for gathering in 30
information intelligence but

282
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,760
are a case sup what's a basic answer

283
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,819
so let's think it over

284
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,679
ever heard above about that touch ref

285
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:16,160
maybe it's a basic hyperbolic tree

286
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,679
which means yeah I know that that that
doesn't really

287
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,539
look all that useful looks like an
angioplasty or something like that

288
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:26,630
but and actually as a good
representation at

289
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:30,260
when it does the an analysis it looks
like this

290
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,590
which for intelligence officer is a
dream

291
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:37,340
um what it actually maps out as the
group

292
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:41,340
within your Facebook profile it maps out
the connection

293
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:45,539
and in here you have hectic sedan
Security Center

294
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:48,690
I ran it on my profile which is great

295
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:52,400
I mean you have my officer school here
you got one of the units that serve you

296
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,090
got

297
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:58,140
now University stuff like that which is
ideal

298
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:03,380
but its kinda cheating because I ran
from my profile with my permissions and

299
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,000
I know

300
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,429
johnnie because I am johnnie and it is
cheating

301
00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:11,960
so a if we look at how touch craft does
that

302
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,690
it goes through Facebook's API it's
called graph

303
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:20,840
um you need to have a 20 can access
token to get there

304
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,049
actually wrote it down there is the
access token and every act as though he

305
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:24,650
gets you

306
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,900
grants you a permission for every
operation

307
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,950
so its kind and not the way to go

308
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,179
because we don't have permissions

309
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:38,429
so let's go back to our assumption

310
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:41,559
if we know your friends I know you

311
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:44,640
everybody knows you at a friends tell me
your friends and I'll tell you who you

312
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,429
are

313
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:48,750
let's see if it works so

314
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,940
others my profile page and my

315
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:55,650
for places listed right so

316
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:59,450
basically it's the same assumption for
all my colleagues

317
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:03,980
mean you could see it here as the
younger here see on

318
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,059
over place so

319
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:12,750
if we want and do it ourselves we could
actually achieve it

320
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,840
even that is a bold statement

321
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,460
as I set I mean we have this we have

322
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,350
that which is the friends list and
within the friends list we can see other

323
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,850
people that have the Y in it

324
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:31,660
but it's likely different all the time
so it's not really that much of an easy

325
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,070
search

326
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:37,799
arm you can go through every one of my
friends in a friend's friend in

327
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:40,980
this is done through a profile which is
not a friend if anyone

328
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,820
this is not linked to anyone

329
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,500
so it's kind of a simple solution isn't
it

330
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,789
I mean you just need to aggregate it you
need to search it

331
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:55,890
all by yourself mean it is simple is a

332
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,990
I found X so

333
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:02,390
but if we work out we need to actually
be

334
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:06,110
profitable me to make its and real time

335
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:11,090
and I have 400 friends and above in my
next and the next guy has than the next

336
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,500
guy has that

337
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,919
it takes a long time a long long time

338
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:19,950
about 1300 hours and just that's just

339
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,950
looking over to profile and marking it

340
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,950
so it's not really the solution

341
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:31,490
but let's think of it this is me very
good depiction

342
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:36,630
and I have a friend called along any as
a friend although for

343
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:40,650
I know along a long nose over

344
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:46,789
of a Muslim now for anyone that has
study mathematics it's called The Clique

345
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:50,080
okay it's it's a close group we all know
everybody

346
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,250
click could be these free could be 6
could be a lot of people

347
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,520
but the main issue is the fact that
everybody knows

348
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,760
everyone so it's a closed group

349
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,850
so here promising what was that help

350
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:08,270
so we have up we have a tool that we've
developed

351
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:11,990
I in a nutshell what does it starts with

352
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:15,809
a profile a targeted profile for example
me

353
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:19,650
and then it goes to my friends an
automated tool

354
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:23,559
it crawls through Facebook it performs a
recursion

355
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:27,570
that it goes through my friends my
friends friends and my friends friends

356
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:30,679
depends on the level that I actually
asking to go to

357
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:33,750
and a great an XML evolve these
individuals

358
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,000
and then analyzes the connections

359
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:44,000
so said i've watching the video we're
gonna wash into

360
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,340
so this is you know this is not a
masterpiece over to was just %uh for

361
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,350
proof of concept um

362
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:57,140
this is a profile this the two was this
one it looks like a browser because it's

363
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,030
based on a browser

364
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:02,160
course on because you remember what we
said that if we use

365
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,740
Facebook API Facebook will shut us down

366
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:09,690
after free trials free crawling able

367
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:13,040
mom Ivor give us a captcha up or Justin
I have

368
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,590
than I S axis but this is a me or

369
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:20,570
the fake me Leah the film on Pacific
profile

370
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:23,570
a woman no doubt um

371
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:27,890
she has no friends only two friends
there are not really related to me

372
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:32,210
I'm and specifically what I do

373
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:39,210
is I go when try to find me

374
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:48,760
what you need internet connection for a
it's a major issue

375
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:57,730
as we're waiting

376
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,750
up

377
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:03,010
that that has to happen of course

378
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:10,010
so let us see why doesn't

379
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:25,480
it

380
00:23:29,879 --> 00:23:34,389
we don't so we're gonna watch a video
year

381
00:23:34,389 --> 00:23:41,389
always have second plan

382
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:58,049
so we go through we at the at has a no
friends we

383
00:23:58,049 --> 00:24:02,049
go in search through yawning which is me
johnny's yawning you can see that

384
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:05,360
if you were his friend so it means that
you're not his friend she's not my

385
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:05,789
friend

386
00:24:05,789 --> 00:24:09,320
so she does start or get

387
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:15,140
friends a friend's get full of I goes in
crawl through my friends as you can see

388
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:20,580
and on PR right you can see it starting
on me I'm specific be

389
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:25,480
the target and that navigates onto
facebook and goes on to all my friends

390
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,270
and you can see here that scrolls down
because we're

391
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,870
imitating a browser any the scroll down
option

392
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:37,780
it involved that you found on friends
and then you manually go through all the

393
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,490
france

394
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:42,850
now I don't care because this is a tool
so it doesn't cost me money I just but

395
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:43,740
decided

396
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,870
works its magic right so

397
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:50,940
at the end while it is has crawled
through all my friends

398
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,159
I then take all the data

399
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,880
onto a different tool Facebook research

400
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,130
it loads all the data that was achieved
was a

401
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:05,900
aggregated and then what it does
actually as this definition

402
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,110
a finding groups a group of three

403
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:12,950
as alone of Phil and me as you see

404
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:16,549
an what does it actually compares the
connection

405
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:20,500
between the people has it found the
connection at

406
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,570
works its magic works his magic and then

407
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:27,480
once you once that they actually are
recognizes Rupert says bingo found a

408
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:27,880
group

409
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,150
arm and this Pacifica a

410
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:34,559
example you don't have it but we'll see

411
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:41,559
what happens because we do have the
process data

412
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:48,030
at the end we have a graph that looks
like this you're probably wondering I

413
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,150
mean that's not

414
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:53,429
that's not you know such graph of course
that's not that graph

415
00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:58,320
but this is information achieved from
someone which is not your friend

416
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,890
but as a friend of a friend okay and not
even

417
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:05,190
not a friend I mean I just someone to
crawl through Facebook

418
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:08,309
an on/off arris profile that his

419
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:12,100
indexed all your friends cuz it started
from

420
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:17,020
from Yani you can see that has all my
friends take the graph to load a bit

421
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:22,950
and then

422
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:27,570
if I drill down an icy and I just click
on any one of my friends I could see

423
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:30,650
a different connection between his
friends but

424
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:34,809
we are interested in these graphs that
we could see the connections

425
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:39,010
we're specifically going after each
enough for connection between

426
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:42,260
johnnie and his friend from tactics

427
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:46,770
from advance Security Center why is that
so important

428
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:52,030
well the most important thing is that
before both through the examples

429
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:55,400
it's useless arm if I'll go n

430
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,620
search on one of the profiles once I see
there's a connection

431
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:03,340
to me even if I'm not tagged their I
have one

432
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:06,820
profile on one photo on my profile its
easily

433
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,490
recognizable if an analyst gets the data

434
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:14,700
gets the list above all the group that
johnny is listed in

435
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,480
which is not an open

436
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,660
it's not open data I mean you don't go
out to the world and say

437
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,740
this this this is this are my friend
from high school

438
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:28,580
these are my friends from college these
are my colleagues he's on my colleagues

439
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,550
from this place

440
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:33,130
and so forth what a noun list with do

441
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:36,410
is one say he has this this type of data

442
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:41,560
it he knows that course that that step
he knows that specifically

443
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,890
it has to do it specifically you can see
group

444
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:49,680
likes tennis live yanni shy hand all
when they all fail

445
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:55,130
and the other we can actually the deuce
at these people are connected together

446
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:58,330
because what happens is that in every
graph

447
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:03,900
we have a different part of that group
why is that because not everybody knows

448
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,420
everybody on Facebook me for example you
have a good example that

449
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:12,180
my boss which is tile Moses doesn't
necessarily

450
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,310
no this guy who create on doesn't know

451
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:19,550
or is not friends %uh these people but

452
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:22,720
we can have stance in all groups

453
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,910
so there is a connection probably work
related

454
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:30,250
shy friend also in all the groups when
you look back specifically if you go

455
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,450
when asked I'll

456
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:34,740
which is a very good question on now

457
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:38,530
20 most employers he says well I don't
ask

458
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:42,370
my employees to to friend me on Facebook
if de friend me I

459
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:46,310
approved but so this is what happens
here you can see it on the graph

460
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:50,300
this is that the beauty of seeing at
with three graphs because

461
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,460
if you have to graph you have permission
to rip off route you have all

462
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,190
permissions

463
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:57,360
that's ideal but this gives you

464
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,500
everyone people there are not directly
connected

465
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,960
but are connected because tile
specifically

466
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,830
is the employer of these guys but he's
just not their friend on Facebook

467
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:13,590
so what an analyst will do is go and
sift through the profiles I mean

468
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:17,080
Johnny and tile could have the most
hardened profile

469
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:21,260
you couldn't see a single photo on the
you know the profile photo and stuff

470
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,130
like that

471
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:25,210
and if you can see the profile for just
puttin

472
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:29,900
isn't his mail on Facebook and click
enter and log and it will give you are

473
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,830
you johnnie and

474
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:34,420
you'll see the picture um and

475
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:38,960
I you could see and then an analyst
knowing who is Johnny how does it look

476
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,490
like

477
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:42,800
could go from the specific group he
doesn't need to go through

478
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,970
400 by the power 400 he has these groups
he

479
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:50,980
that they're closed group um this is
only a demonstration

480
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,080
I've close number but we can get

481
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,240
up to 10 individuals in a single group

482
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,730
so if you have this you could see thirty
people almost thirty people

483
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:05,080
on this specific I graph arm all
depending on

484
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,260
the actual connections between these
these individuals

485
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:12,420
and this is all opens opened and to the
public

486
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,840
coming I don't think that to be a friend
of someone there are

487
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,140
to all the tools that you know if your
friend of a friend

488
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,990
then you could do something the Act is
not my friend

489
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,300
nor is it nor is she a friend of any of
my friends

490
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:32,280
um but she was able to sift through and
crawl through all the specific profiles

491
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,990
and get all this specific data we did
not get

492
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:40,970
a single capture from Facebook told to
just two to run it to crawl through it

493
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:46,320
takes about a week okay a whole week
have just running in crawling

494
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,660
just aggregating the data and Facebook
did not do anything about it

495
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,780
the yacht is the most irregular or

496
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:57,230
anomalous profile in the world she has
two friends

497
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,930
which are free other fake profile and

498
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:05,260
she then crawls through have a facebook
and nothing

499
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:08,510
pops out nobody gives that you know the
funny thing is

500
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:11,990
if the app will start asking friendship
then

501
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:16,160
were a facebook will work their magic
and say of this is anomalous

502
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,190
but if you just watches profile

503
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:24,190
I mean that's okay you know so back to
our

504
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:31,190
to our discussion

505
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:36,970
I'm not saying at the end I'm not saying
not

506
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:40,330
use Facebook okay is

507
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:43,370
this is the a blunt statement butts

508
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:47,200
when I first II started with this

509
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,520
I had a lot of people from the
intelligence community that

510
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,920
that used Facebook and there may now

511
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:57,030
their main argument was you know

512
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:00,120
I mean I've heard my profile you know we
could do anything

513
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:04,970
and and they said well you know let's
see if there's something else that

514
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:05,890
people could

515
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:10,000
you know aggregate on us because we're
all hard

516
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,900
and there are a lot of people on similar
positions army intelligence is just a

517
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,450
close community but

518
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:19,730
core corporate management or

519
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:23,490
finance finances your main target as an
actor

520
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:26,940
and not because I'm Ernst & Young but

521
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,340
it is and the best targets I

522
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,980
a lot of people hold positions that they
don't understand how much

523
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:39,390
open source data could be aggregated on
them and what Rd consequences ovett

524
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:43,300
and just like these little piggies cons
going on

525
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:48,390
ever not their products you know are
actually it's given free but you know

526
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:51,660
if if if it's not that one then

527
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:55,170
your to product and yeah you are being
sold

528
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:59,170
so you can make your chili your choice I
mean

529
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:03,090
you could stay n or you can opt up you
can't really opt out but you know

530
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:06,920
you get my drift that's it guys

531
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:13,920
hope you enjoyed it here

532
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:15,809
any questions
