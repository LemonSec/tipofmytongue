1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:07,099
back from up by Scott Thomas always and
I some friends and their

2
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:15,009
I am I like the title says this is in
for a sec flameout

3
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:18,300
you might know InfoSec burnout this
one's

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,770
little bit different to not too much for
a stretch but

5
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,070
can get a little bit different kinda
view on things

6
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,689
I tend to talk too fast got a couple
friends in here that may waive it near

7
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,809
frozen now much smaller something so on
trying to slow down

8
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:39,250
om so basically the idea behind in for a
sec flameout

9
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,410
is burning out in information security

10
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,620
if you have your problems with your job

11
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,890
or now if you feel like you're getting
burned out

12
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,920
this is probably not a good idea so

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,230
when all this started was I read a blog
entry and

14
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,500
basically was burning out porn on
gasoline so

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,110
I thought this is preferable for that
couple things that were

16
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:08,140
covering here some personal cause and
effect

17
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,270
what i've seen for my personal career on
for a sec burnout and

18
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,720
the effect that causes on our personal
lives our also look at

19
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,909
can you avoid it other anything the
things you can do to try and lessen it

20
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:21,479
or

21
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,850
maybe deal with it a little bit is
basically with

22
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,970
the fact we work in technology we don't
want to end up looking like this

23
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,340
I want things that

24
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,630
attrition .org brought up was is that if
you are going to give a talk you want to

25
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,200
make sure that you tell people why
you're the person that gets to be up

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:38,560
here

27
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,979
so my personal you know why I am appear

28
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:45,310
worked a couple different areas I T in
the past om

29
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:50,000
I currently work as a InfoSec senior
specialist don't ask me I don't know

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,710
what that means

31
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:55,659
standard HR stuff and actually when I've
submitted for the call for papers

32
00:01:55,659 --> 00:02:02,399
I did tell them that I was all that and
a bag of chips on

33
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,040
boring stuff basically I young do my
CISSP to get past the HR filter

34
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,489
I am I got might of foundations version
3 which I actually look this up on the

35
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:12,000
website

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,370
they do say use it. as a tool I think
they think I T is

37
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:20,319
a buncha tools and I got my bachelors in
information system security which is a

38
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,540
lot of money spent for

39
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,629
nothing on idea some other search but

40
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:29,090
most people know nowadays that alphabet
soup doesn't impress anyone

41
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,000
you can say that you have every single
letter in the alphabet find your name

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,160
and nobody cares

43
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,200
says I said before we have a

44
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,530
a little bit different idea here between
burnout inflame out probably a lot of

45
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,709
you have seen the

46
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:45,170
you the burnout how for Marseille maybe

47
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,209
other talks on things that you know
cause you be a burned-out

48
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:52,310
in I T but my take on this was a little
bit different

49
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,900
because I'm not burned out from the nor
most of the people think

50
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,030
managers now buying in the I don't have
enough I don't have the tools I don't

51
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,239
have enough people to

52
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:05,790
you know do my job for help me with my
job mine actually is

53
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,830
%uh like I said about the bog that I
wrote I called in for a sec flameout

54
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,099
because I'm currently working in
information security

55
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:17,940
but I'm not doing the job that I want to
do I've started my career as

56
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,269
in security from a can a bare-bones

57
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:24,310
admin position I want to be a pen tester

58
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,269
I don't get to do that my company so
unfortunately I have to do all that on

59
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:28,700
my own

60
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,310
so I read a blog entry and basically try
to get now

61
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,049
my thoughts on paper why I was getting
burned out versus why other people

62
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:36,730
remember

63
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,900
little bitter the idea behind it was the

64
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,989
quarterback versus the third-string
lyman all your

65
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:46,220
now I hate this word InfoSec rock stars

66
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,440
are you think unlike the quarterback the
people that are

67
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,879
now ones out there doing all the good
stuff to all the fun stuff

68
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,319
in in one sec its right white papers and
things like that I'm in one sitting on

69
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:00,230
the bench waiting to get into the game
and not getting a chance

70
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:04,400
you know everybody else's got a break
their legs before it happens om

71
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,629
actually get confirmation from dual core
on probably a lot he has no this one to

72
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:09,900
listen to the lyrics on this

73
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,420
this little couple the song you how to
get an idea of where I'm coming from

74
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,680
its first was just week

75
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,049
came

76
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:21,330
20

77
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,690
36

78
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:28,979
process me on still on

79
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:33,249
every month 10

80
00:04:33,249 --> 00:04:37,649
this making all so

81
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:41,289
for anybody that has a heard that song
you definitely need to go listen to if

82
00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:43,169
you feel that you're getting burned out
your career

83
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:47,809
it the lyrics other are just spot on as
far as the way that you know people are

84
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:51,819
always working to my hours always
putting in extra time and neck anything

85
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:55,869
so to give you a little bit of an idea
of how I got to the the

86
00:04:55,869 --> 00:05:01,179
its area around in I love burnout
asserted out in a small computer firm

87
00:05:01,179 --> 00:05:05,849
in 1999 om I was basically that was my
first tech job out of college

88
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:09,719
you think Oh care I got my first tech
job this can be great

89
00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:14,019
unfortunately I get to do everything but
computers I was the shipping receiving I

90
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:17,959
I was the hey we need the signature
right halfway across a conduit

91
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:21,539
everything that they wanted me to do was
not technical at all

92
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:24,939
so I was also the only one with the
computer degree

93
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:30,399
oMG unfortunately because %uh that I get
kinda little bit condescending

94
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:35,839
tone from the management from me the
actual owners the company where they

95
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:36,219
were

96
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:39,239
you know all you were hired to do this
time you're hired to do

97
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:42,369
the tech job you know I was the one that
had the computer degree

98
00:05:42,369 --> 00:05:46,709
I actually got pulled into my boss the
VP's office

99
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:50,619
for my review for the first year and get
all know you're doing a great job we're

100
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:52,099
gonna give you a quarter an hour race

101
00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:55,669
I was pretty pissed so

102
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:59,139
ended up that I went to one of our
clients for about double my salary

103
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:04,089
so they weren't real happy about that
when I left but

104
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:08,110
that's their problem so I get to that
small CPA for

105
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,879
which they were offering me a pretty
good wage unfortunately

106
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:15,669
I was I actual choose my own title which
is land administrator

107
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:19,129
but when they said you know you're a
great girl and master that means all the

108
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,089
computer stuff right

109
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:23,739
ninety buddy who's ever worked as the
sole computer person

110
00:06:23,739 --> 00:06:27,679
in a small company if you're all that
computer stuff

111
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:31,339
there's pretty much anything with the
circuit board

112
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:36,709
I literally got a printing calculator
drop to my desk with a note that said

113
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:40,499
doesn't work pay the $15 bucks fine

114
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:43,669
om so after down

115
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:47,209
it's a 13 percent company so wasn't a
whole lot of work to do

116
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:52,050
after about a 10 months they finally
said that they were and teach me how to

117
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,099
do taxes because I know computers
problems left

118
00:06:55,099 --> 00:06:59,300
so you guys have probably given the same

119
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,069
response that I did which was yes Eli
arm

120
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:07,829
once I left that now their company I was
like okay I can make sure I don't go to

121
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:10,939
another small company said on work
myself i've a job within a year

122
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:14,259
so that was a little better bernau from
that first job that I've

123
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:19,829
basically work myself a job nothing else
so I moved to the enterprise help desk

124
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:23,099
so this is gonna be better right I mean
enterprise it's bigger

125
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:26,649
you're always going to have people we
always gonna problems that's gonna be

126
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:27,249
great right

127
00:07:27,249 --> 00:07:30,349
unfortunately anybody here ever work now
us

128
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:33,719
that look familiar

129
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:37,339
where's the any key

130
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:40,800
oh yeah and yeah my coffee cup holder

131
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,319
I got one loss to basically you end up
with

132
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,009
a lot a year run in the mail oring you
mean your questions

133
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:55,009
where going to hell was a vacation I'm
so basically I decided that

134
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:58,860
I wasn't gonna get where I wanted to be
an working on the Help Desk

135
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,999
so I decided where I need to go from
here

136
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:07,149
because the helpdesk was not filling it
all I'm guessing everybody's seen The IT

137
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:07,639
Crowd

138
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:11,469
om but the thing was I start time to try
and

139
00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:15,269
you know do love a soul-searching so why
am I gonna switch careers again

140
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:18,839
why would I want to do something
completely different and I'm not use to

141
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:23,360
and you're completely go to a different
side of it.

142
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,179
so I decided that now after talking a
couple different areas in ninety that I

143
00:08:28,179 --> 00:08:31,749
was really interested in information
security but unfortunately

144
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:36,019
I didn't have any candidate development
experience I wasn't you know

145
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:40,729
mechanic person that originally would
you know get involved in hacking or

146
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,959
you know wanna break stuff for anything
like that out I didn't take my parents

147
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:44,689
PCR

148
00:08:44,689 --> 00:08:48,199
when I was a kid or anything like that
so I decided that you know

149
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:53,000
one just doesn't be simply become elite
haxor side figure

150
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,290
how am I gonna get to this particular
area the IT world

151
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,750
so I was reading a magazine article
hours on helped us because I had so much

152
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,929
to do

153
00:09:00,929 --> 00:09:03,980
and it talked about white hat hackers
and this article

154
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,100
was actually a

155
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,620
what my dream job would be and it was
you walk in you get your coffee

156
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,130
sit down boss what services hey hack
into this company

157
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:20,130
okay cool me start gone you know packing
where

158
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,639
unfortunately pretty much anybody that's
done any kind and housing OES

159
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:27,130
that doesn't happen it's not that easy

160
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:30,279
so I said okay well how am I going to at
least get my starting this

161
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:33,329
home I can move into this area so

162
00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:37,350
I'd decide to beg for security job from
our security area

163
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,309
doctor managers doctor directors on my
what do I need to do to get in this area

164
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:45,610
and I scored a scary admin position if
anybody's ever worked in security admin

165
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:50,259
you know that that isn't exactly a
winning proposition

166
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:54,079
so I got to the Security admin and it
was basically

167
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:58,139
level to help desk just now with more
requests

168
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,360
unfortunately there I got stuck there
for about five years

169
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,370
so it was a lot of money Vizio any
access to the server

170
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:09,339
a lot i mean your stuff just like on the
Help Desk so basically I still wasn't

171
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:10,139
happy

172
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:14,709
I was talkin managers talking mine
director an RVP same

173
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:17,839
I'm not having any to be doing something
more technical I need to me you know

174
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,410
going into a position where I'm
challenged and I wasn't getting

175
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:24,250
challenge so obviously you get burned
out again

176
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,039
I got told that you're too technical
which from somebody that wants to be a

177
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,209
pen tester

178
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:32,630
that's the dumbest comment together
never so

179
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,039
you know obviously my manager Dan agree
with my career path

180
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:39,850
so I still wasn't where I wanted to be a
and fortunately the company that I work

181
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,009
for

182
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:44,709
is very very conservative they don't
wanna see anything break

183
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:50,079
for any reason so when you have a
company that has a conservative you

184
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,839
and you want to get into something where
you have to you have to be a little bit

185
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,329
more lover you have to break something
make sure that it's not going to break

186
00:10:57,329 --> 00:11:00,769
you know unknowingly see at can create a
to do list

187
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:04,089
how to get out at that position
sherburne out again

188
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:07,500
so the first thing I thought was that
well I need you want to get involved in

189
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,480
the community and I didn't know how to
do that

190
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,549
couple of my coworkers said well why
don't we go to talk

191
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:16,309
I had no idea what %ah Khan was at her
to black and Afghan had no idea there's

192
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,309
other conferences out here

193
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:22,329
so stark reminder to do list went to
talk on

194
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:26,059
Saban stocks like a alice is great this
is exactly where I want to be this is

195
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:27,439
what I wanna do

196
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:31,750
unfortunately you can just jump right
into that she gotta start somewhere

197
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,809
what their that did give me though is I
started out with

198
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:37,860
how much people when they got on the
talks all him on Twitter

199
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,449
follow me on Twitter here's mine you
know my handle white have a Twitter

200
00:11:42,449 --> 00:11:45,579
why would anyone give a crap when I have
to say so

201
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,919
at the end of the day I was like okay
fine I'll get a Twitter account and I'll

202
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:51,120
start by just following people

203
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,559
I'll just you know glean any information
I can get on it basically

204
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:58,089
and you get to the point where once you
start interacting with people

205
00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:01,209
you start to you know you actually do
started talk

206
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:05,149
on Twitter as well just listen also
start taking some classes that's when I

207
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:07,339
got my CSS parm much books

208
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:12,039
I'm still not where wanna be I'm still
Stockham still burned out

209
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:15,610
I also you know you won't want to work
with people my sector

210
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,879
here in Michigan is great they always
have these meet ups they do stuff

211
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:23,009
unfortunately I live in the middle of
nowhere so there's no it took me two

212
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:23,679
hours to get here

213
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,419
I don't have anybody I can just run down
the street to an hey what's going on

214
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:30,529
run backtracking on decent some fun
stuff so

215
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:34,500
unfortunately that wasn't an option for
either

216
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,379
other issues that you get when you're
trying to move into a new new position

217
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:38,039
is

218
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:41,610
you're going to end up being a junior so
you got junior pay

219
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:45,160
which I mean you can understand because
you not I'm senior position young at

220
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,309
senior at that position you're gonna
have to take

221
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:51,779
a pay cut to get to their unfortunately
also I'm not a spring chicken

222
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:55,470
so I'm not going to get I'm not be able
to drink from the fire was like I used

223
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,740
to when I was 18

224
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,789
so you end up with no more time spent
reading more time spent you're

225
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:01,529
researching trying to get your tools

226
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:04,829
to work the way you want to and using
less results either the time spent

227
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:07,750
because your brain just doesn't absorb
it is fast

228
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,279
also I will work in Chicago so I've got

229
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,709
an hour after each way that's me most
days on whale

230
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:19,159
I sleep on the train I I just can't stay
awake long enough to do

231
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:22,860
you know to run a virtual I'm on my
laptop or anything like that

232
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,399
service the burned-out down this is my
career path so far

233
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,579
and I try to put together a couple
things are what to do

234
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:33,149
how to get to you now where you wanna be
where I want to be anyway

235
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:37,289
and basically you're on fire you need to
figure out how to put it out

236
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:41,189
and what you can do to can lessen so
what to do

237
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:44,199
a lot people tell you know read the
manual

238
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:47,289
there really is a manual for this I mean
it it's gonna be individual for each

239
00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:48,449
person

240
00:13:48,449 --> 00:13:52,089
so the couple things that I have found
out though is

241
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:55,220
the first thing to do is unclog just
like the song says

242
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,640
you have to get away from things I took
our culture Syron

243
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,689
I completely unplugged in salt water and
in reading email

244
00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:05,089
you have to get away from technology for
you at least a couple days ago

245
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:08,760
any on it certain times just let you
bring refresh let you

246
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,929
you know can't take a step back relax
let the stress go down

247
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:17,689
and you know basically it'll be there
when you come back

248
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:21,159
another thing is is that our security
industry is huge

249
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:25,589
you're gonna have you run the gamut
every operating system every platform

250
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:29,209
you can't know everything you're not
going to be the best network and test

251
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:30,549
you're not going to be the best

252
00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:33,839
risk management person at the same time

253
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,179
you can't know everything she got a pic
an area I love security

254
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:41,039
and make it yours and just basically get
good at that one area

255
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,769
but I'll select funny

256
00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:48,189
another thing is that are do one thing
you'll notice by coming to these

257
00:14:48,189 --> 00:14:49,179
conferences

258
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:53,159
our community is very very helpful and
you get people that will set up

259
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:56,519
you know web sites that you can run
stuff against your people that work for

260
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:56,850
you

261
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:00,959
work with the three tools your people
ages basically will do anything they can

262
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,319
to get you where you want to be

263
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,779
om so anything you can do to network
with our industry

264
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:10,339
by coming these conferences by
connecting on Twitter even just going

265
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:13,409
you having a beer or something insane
hey can we sit down talk about

266
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:16,649
axe whatever it is that's going to help
you om

267
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:20,649
and the last thing I had for it was your
proper tire going on

268
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:24,209
fireman go into a fire there always when
they turn out here they're always

269
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:27,649
wearing the proper clothing before they
go do this so

270
00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:30,799
with our industry we're going after the
proper clothing as well

271
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,870
and put on our big campaign easing go
for

272
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:39,220
yeah so that's my presentation

273
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,589
may have any questions or anybody have
any feedback on anything I

274
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:46,929

suggestions that you guys have

275
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:49,789
