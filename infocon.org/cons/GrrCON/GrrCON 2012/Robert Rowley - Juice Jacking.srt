1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,530
you all for being here this talk to me
about the stacking 101

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:07,259
on my name is robert rylee recently
began working for spinal ads

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:12,990
underworld Trustwave under the pilot's
department as a security researcher

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,900
so so going to get started with that in
the first question the obvious question

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,930
is who here actually knows what do
stacking is

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,070
here's heard it been a victim of it with
it

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,689
a azo that I wanna hear from

8
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:30,869
from emails an era so what is it anybody
wanna say

9
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:34,470
you is there

10
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,600
what it is its beware beware when
charging your phone

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,570
don't forget to hit on the the best part
was before

12
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,900
I done this when I started searching
google for the term do stacking

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,559
that term the those two words together
meant something completely different

14
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:50,690
which accounts and sage

15
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,199
has a

16
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:57,290
so effectively using what I mean to
become

17
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,100
because this image is terrible between
my screen I in kind of you here

18
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,879
it's these is making all these kiosks
here that you find in airports

19
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,380
I do malicious things space each in an
atrocity in the first place even know

20
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:08,830
what you need

21
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:12,470
you when you're flying into and IBC
decide to make one that's malicious

22
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,850
and Disney novel things so when jumpin'

23
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,950
right away explaining the building
behind making one of these

24
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,330
the intention was that I'll a key issue
give a little background is that

25
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,000
this was the idea came up during a July
4th party

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
like last year bracket which is like a
month before Def Con

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,240
and me when my friends were just like be

28
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,649
base a it came to him with the idea in
like count talk back and forth and

29
00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:39,969
within a month period of time

30
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:44,490
we had a malicious kiosk already built
it the Brit basic components were simple

31
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,119
it was

32
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,990
1/2 hardware will have software up the
other computer

33
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,299
you want to get in a box a with a lotta
USB cable dangling out everywhere

34
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:55,460
and then you won't have to suffer that
runs on the computer so for

35
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,549
the definite purpose he's on the next be
a live CD I use the utils package

36
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:02,619
has everything you need to start
modifying and tweaking with all the

37
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:06,759
the base and USB interfaces USB devices
and then a few custom shell scripts

38
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:09,819
makes everything go super easy and you
do a lot of the radically

39
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:13,770
bad things from that point a so for
those im

40
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,930
don't know I I can call my south
africa's at me with a hacksaw

41
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,220
going to a laptop just cutting it
cutting it in half so it fits

42
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:26,230
into the box and that's it in the
actually in the box it looks

43
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,500
it so we definitely UPC and a

44
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,190
BC an Iomega cd-rom drive n you

45
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:37,280
put this box somewhere out in public
only put the box out and

46
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,360
at a security conference is i feels if I
and the be safe to some degree because

47
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,240
those should be the people that are
complete the like cognizant about what's

48
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,900
what's what other for techno technology
up so you you might see this actually

49
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,720
and today the chief this is by the worst
thing ever built in my life

50
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,410
it looks terrible there's a plastic this
there's a plastic spoon from laptop

51
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,940
sees big rivets that should be /c say
this is something bad

52
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,470
effect the be a the lock in the back in
the box was a more expensive than

53
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,260
anything else there because the guy who
won

54
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,470
me build this Riverside had access to it
it's really high and super like

55
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,100
a like thousand-dollar a padlock and
we're more for the people

56
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,630
breaking into the kiosk than we were to
her about liking or do anything else we

57
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,280
just forget the

58
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,470
they just break it open tearing out like
a hobby one because of course

59
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,670
what it what do we do we did the by this
everything possible

60
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:32,030
we decided to the point isn't that fun
and I apologize for that messed up

61
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,030
waiting here this is when you convert
between 8:30 p.m. PDT lot

62
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,590
it just destroys your slides but the

63
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,580
so we decided we're going to play the
fun and we actually daily depleted in

64
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,980
evolve means the wall of sheep

65
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,430
room whichever side helps put on BC runs
it I

66
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,890
says the room if you guys enough in the
youth room we have a giant projector

67
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,860
that displaced people's passwords that
were that were sent over plain text in

68
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,330
the network

69
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,430
and its its busy though all sheep the
room for the sheep to go to

70
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,590
and is entertaining because well

71
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,100
actually going to this thing as large as
hacker conference a 33 a lot like the

72
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,380
Wild West I figure that the

73
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,910
the kiosk was gonna be attacked so I had
to take a lot of special

74
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:15,320
precautions and I'll a kinda mention
that in the bill components but

75
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,500
a the best part about this was at at
that you're at the Rio

76
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,500
there was a payee cell phone charging
station

77
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,789
in the hallway and pay cell phone
charging station was giving customers

78
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:29,669
and it was hilarious because I see
people every once in a while falling

79
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:32,800
into error like grabbing a credit card
out to plug into this thing that

80
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,259
connects over I don't even know what
some sorta wireless network connection

81
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:35,680
to do

82
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,070
credit card of we're just or your credit
card on it and

83
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,410
and I'd see them and I say he did you
know there's a free turkey

84
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:46,490
station Lake it's over in the wall a
sheep room there is like also wanna go

85
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,909
check that out in the gay just kicks off
in a go check

86
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:53,629
a few minutes later and sailors because
you would think that that Khan

87
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:56,699
100 the was our second conference be
would be

88
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:59,979
beria you know aware this threat or at
least the

89
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:03,550
at the time and they would maybe take
cautions maybe think about it

90
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,419
for second before putting in and that's
absolutely wrong people

91
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:10,520
hundreds of people the end flooded

92
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,159
a handshake hear some evidence like I

93
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:17,330
an anti-gay is does your space up

94
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,900
and this constantly happened all all
weekend long

95
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,610
I'll we did a lot of the stars of the
show you what the screen says real quick

96
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,900
so this is what the screen inside the
box look like this nice a happy friendly

97
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,770
cell phone charging kiosk

98
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:35,150
Anna them in after that yes new basie
detect whenever USB devices plugged in

99
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,719
we've detected that with what the screen
to show this

100
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:42,310
face he says you know you're stupid but
he

101
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,740
you cannot just player on your
smartphone to a public kiosk

102
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,810
you know they can be your your date is
at risk like

103
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,050
other actions getting taken likely
taking that far out it

104
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,569
metal a little reading the getting up or
out and unit is is safe

105
00:05:55,569 --> 00:05:58,969
to enjoy the free charge for now up

106
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:02,289
was interesting to use that there was a
lot of threats with I think that the

107
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:04,180
main threat

108
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,529
was actually the primary concern when
we're building this was a you know he's

109
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:08,229
gonna plugin

110
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:11,300
that was wrong be I that no

111
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,150
that somebody's going to actually attack
the device so we had you a lot of

112
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,840
special things during the build process

113
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,009
to defending and somebody actually
attacking the computer

114
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:22,259
basing while they've had a fun dinner
while they're attacking the kiosk it

115
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:23,490
turns out the biggest threat was

116
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:27,449
physical because the whole contraption
wat about 30 pounds

117
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:31,999
somebody could just walk up and taking
it nobody did obviously still have it

118
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:35,020
Anna the the other tackle the Hoosiers

119
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,719
good wild guess and tell me what the
other primary method of attack glenn has

120
00:06:38,719 --> 00:06:40,680
already seen before

121
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,160
right

122
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,080
the teensy I A you could do teensy which
is a little tiny meet manager

123
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,630
like using a program with me the room
entry keyboard animal

124
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,940
when you plug it into the computer it'll
just on ninety-one mucho like keystrokes

125
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,380
and mouse commences at that that would
be a than the primary doc is turns out

126
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,410
I'm giving up

127
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,720
USB ports so you can plug in USB devices
doesn't have the phone

128
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,110
it could be a keyboard literally any USB
inner the human interface device

129
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:10,030
a which was fun to actually work because
it just requires disabling day

130
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:15,770
the modular kernel another but

131
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:20,160
yeah I just you can disable USB HID in
the Linux kernel and just like book like

132
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,969
no no no USB key was work

133
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:29,760
when they said it to an iPod

134
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,270
you know if you can give me an iPod they
can send keyboard commands then we'll

135
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,120
test it out

136
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,120
yeah I'm gonna get a free iPod when I

137
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:44,120
strangers iPod in the world is gonna
have to yeah it

138
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:51,050
is possible to make an iPod act like a
keyboard it's also possible to make an

139
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:51,830
Android device

140
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,919
act like he was a going to the in the
sake actually reprogram your Android

141
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:55,530
device to

142
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:59,760
to assert BC when you plug it in action
says on keyboard by the way

143
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,389
the USB and it will just start in
putting basie just act exactly like a

144
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:04,110
USB keyboard

145
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,850
so other ideas no right cool

146
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:11,180
that was it. the primary threat which
was taken taken care of be

147
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,479
be a just kernel module so

148
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,560
after Def Con there was actually an
interesting could be with her I would it

149
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,110
work on

150
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,460
and I've actually building through the
new kiosk that figured some people

151
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,100
might have seen the the blue one and so
I and I decide I want to build wanna do

152
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,050
a little more

153
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:32,620
active activity against the user and I
do want to cut another EPC half so that

154
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,500
the company one

155
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:38,360
up you'll see here in a minute the new
trick that indeed it was

156
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,140
was that it would monitor you take your
unique USB

157
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,760
airbase your device eighty and monitor
it and say this is how long you're

158
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,550
plugged in for

159
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:50,240
so that I can do metrics today saying OK
average people talking for this long

160
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,800
period of time and I can't say how many
attacks can

161
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,089
connected in that period of time

162
00:08:56,089 --> 00:08:58,810
was funny is even though it already been
released

163
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,630
using a couple months later people still
plugged into it at a much smaller

164
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:06,170
conference I think about four people for
din a

165
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,970
in what in the the hours ahead at one
before my talk was given at the end of

166
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:11,410
the day

167
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,899
and it was great because actually but I
can stage in and hadam

168
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:19,300
yet another question where ID

169
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,260
I brought the the hardware for it but
again bring the whole one because I'm

170
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:27,380
from California so I didn't wanna like
travel across the country the giant like

171
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,220
kiosk have a lot to get pictures of them
so you can show you what they look like

172
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,459
unfortunate I can it bring that one here
because

173
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:36,120
and I would hope that nobody would have
looked into it anyways who would have

174
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,270
looked into it

175
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:41,589
well I know a few people would have
custom plugins the MIT in booth

176
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:46,140
their cell phone charging stuff I
nothing to do with that but they

177
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,150
actually have cell phone charging I
cables

178
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,430
out on their bill out on the beef in the
second I saw that I said strike up

179
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,260
conversation as a KD wanna

180
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,310
at my charging device honey

181
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:00,100
the for those either here in smart about
it

182
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,460
I might you may be a USB hub that's over
there in about Lake

183
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:10,460
an hour or so in just we'll see to plug
into it I have a battery for a head

184
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,850
is is it modded nice

185
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,350
a so so this is it. how bad that he also
looked

186
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:22,080
I do this by myself again I mention the
blue one was the worst thing I've ever

187
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,910
built this is the worst thing I've ever
built

188
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:27,540
you can see the details really this is a
big black box

189
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,060
this is free it doesn't explain that
cell phone charging you anything it just

190
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,970
says free

191
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:36,610
am is still a bit it worked

192
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:40,670
he also we like fifty pounds so I drag
this thing around like set it up in the

193
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,270
key in the

194
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:45,140
in the in the conference area and people
still boarding getting the specific

195
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,060
details but you like

196
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,580
we were there is a curve because I
didn't Victor I is the

197
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,660
image right there's like old Jaggi like
Pixley like this a plastic on the words

198
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,800
like cracked and broken

199
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,080
it was wat hilarious that people still
plugged in

200
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,800
but what I learned from to work on was
actually a very interesting

201
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,800
difference is the people who did plugin
a

202
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,200
I got to talk to them in a I said why
did you again you know what was

203
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,640
happening

204
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:12,040
la 10 the best story was that it was in
the he was the guy was the first got up

205
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,590
again it was right after the keynote

206
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,300
he walking Latino made a beeline for the
for the kiosk imploded

207
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,590
and the guy was hilarious because was
like why would you make a beeline for

208
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,530
this unjust destroy yourself like that

209
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:28,110
and his explanation was that his wife he
called them and his battery died

210
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:32,140
anything does an emergency so it when it
happened was is

211
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,220
it was a stress response he become
inches and like he decided that

212
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:40,070
a nothing was worth it in that his only
focus was that he needed each are just

213
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:40,550
bone

214
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:44,530
to obviously contact his wife this is
probably true for

215
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,870
everybody here I'm by they're probably
exceptions but

216
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:51,170
if your phone runs outta battery you you
think

217
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,920
like reflect on yourself a little bit
and say wow I'm getting a little bit

218
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,220
inches right now I may be stressful
especially if like

219
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,930
years to make another call you or your
boss or something was happening at work

220
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:03,240
you're more likely going to do something
that's not secure

221
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,270
if you are paying attention and that's
that

222
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:09,940
part of what like the interesting
feature intricacies this attack is that

223
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,220
something really simple attack

224
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,180
really stupidly simple but it actually
it was awful lot of other

225
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,320
David points BC possibilities your
doctor become successful

226
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,580
but so that was it for to work on

227
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,680
actually gateway battery packs everybody
at work on it for din because it was

228
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,050
silly

229
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,210
everybody who admitted they plugged in
there a couple people that didn't want

230
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,600
to admit to me that they had pulled in

231
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,380
and then I'll accept was out back on

232
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,060
a book on I by a point I'm actually

233
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:42,890
collected a mini ponerse a little tiny
BC over the BRT about her

234
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:46,560
and a I didn't know anything really to
do with it and then

235
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,610
it so we came to my mind that it was
really really small much like a

236
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,170
Raspberry Pi lot of other devices

237
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,840
it's running Linux and it has USB and
suddenly I built

238
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,250
probably the smallest use tracking
device if it inside

239
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,680
so easy by comparison that's an EPC it's
a 7-inch be

240
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,400
laptop MIA's bike make basic

241
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,520
criticize I mean if its in this box for
the most part and here

242
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:15,160
so so this is the EPC with

243
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,670
the a USB hub as I need to build that
little kiosk

244
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:23,100
and this is a battery pack which I
purchased

245
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,410
because well I'm not gonna be the guy
that gets caught with this and so this

246
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,880
is standard USB that effect is actually
pretty badass one

247
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,540
you may notice that something fits
inside the other thing so

248
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,870
feasibly you can build a battery pack
which is malicious burning a little mini

249
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,860
Boehner Raspberry Pi device inside

250
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:42,280
running out for years we have that was
kinda wanna try to build here and I

251
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,090
didn't get it done

252
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,240
up so after farrakhan

253
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,870
actually did a little bit effort because
I knew I had the Minute Rice version

254
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,570
and I went over to Kinkos and actually
printed up a really nice looking

255
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:57,630
like poster board that it needed a more
than the poster board I just needed a

256
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,610
post I need something

257
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:02,340
to display the fact that you can charge
and something else that all

258
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,650
busy all the sorry the phones and

259
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:09,990
this is the by the best when I built
looks the cleanest a

260
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,380
earlier when I think like one person for
din because is is

261
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:17,980
you the location race at the kiosk was
in a pretty bad location is directly

262
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,610
across from the ET and that said welcome
to the danger zone

263
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,270
so people are pretty hesitant about
putting things in an electronic to an

264
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:24,890
earlier one

265
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:29,560
a also about halfway through the day
like just after a game I talk

266
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,570
I let the kiosk out there but somebody
at a

267
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:36,760
taking power cord of they thought that

268
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:42,150
little USB to Lake BC One table 2 50 he
see our Bible DC adapter those buttons

269
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,800
the wall they thought that was the
computer

270
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,910
so somebody actually snagged my power
adapter and turn the whole device of

271
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:51,870
this hilarious because that was the
computer at all the computers literally

272
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:52,430
glued

273
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:56,220
inside this little bar this little on
busy would container in the back

274
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,730
the the whole kiosk BC the poster board
ansonia tried to stall

275
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,060
his face he tried to steal my my
computer like I got Europe own plug-ins

276
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,390
like this not upon forget all

277
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:09,130
you get laid one dollar device and
making pretty pissed

278
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:12,230
lol guess

279
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,920
guess that's what I get so what I want
to mention is that

280
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,520
so after Def Con is actually were most
the media pick this up in is very

281
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,950
interesting

282
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:25,290
is that the media that was I mean BC
between yes and applying it was very fun

283
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:30,270
aside benefit was that everybody's just
started talking about in the

284
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:34,040
think is Brian Krebs who coined the term
she's checking which

285
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,830
which is great because that they see me
he gave it some salinity

286
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:41,240
the Seagate a reference for everybody he
wrote about a first

287
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,560
then after that I was like TG Daily
which is Tom's Hardware basically

288
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,140
I I'm going to 30

289
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,250
seen it it is quicker then

290
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,250
MSNBC talked about it so easy I like
everywhere

291
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,850
every every big if thing manners
everywhere in Twitter &

292
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,350
is kinda funny desi fake watch Twitter
feeds for people talk about you stackin

293
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,960
Anna but the most important thing is
that the exit the

294
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,080
it was fun for me he was easy because it
was such a simple idea

295
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:14,000
there are some complexities I could if I
put more time it seems like building a

296
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,190
turkey us they don't look like

297
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:18,570
crap but any too many a

298
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,950
and the most in one thing those is such
a simple idea and assists

299
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:26,630
ice use easy to execute I got actually a
lot of good press back from it I got

300
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,100
more than a day for expected

301
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,450
one of the things I want the mention
about in this talk is a simple enough

302
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:31,740
like

303
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,830
I didn't do some crazy awesome like
complicated thing

304
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:38,460
attribute a really simple concept
together and I just did it

305
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:43,120
in doing something simple and simple
concepts and deploying them and actually

306
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,770
doing

307
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,420
pretty things other in the world you
have to get a lot to get press coming

308
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:46,930
back to you

309
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,430
you'll be surprised as to what little
things you might do that using curse

310
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,240
upon them

311
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,930
that actually get a lot of publicity in
and if you like a good is a good vibes

312
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:55,180
and

313
00:16:55,150 --> 00:17:01,730
people know me now as a g-string I or
the mustache guy which one

314
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,520
so I machine again sir some technical
points about the stock as well

315
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,770
I've got to talk about something
technical otherwise you guys gonna kinda

316
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,160
miss it

317
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,790
so I never ideas you get last choice

318
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:17,490
but to her what are the eighth here is
that every as to not get jacked from a

319
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,870
from maliciously us charge it

320
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:25,069
in your pocket

321
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:30,830
we have bring your own cable me on fable
charger yep

322
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:34,060
with the SD card a1 relaxes the SD card
bill Sykes is your phone

323
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,500
yeah so it'll be able to do a lot of
things are

324
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:43,730
Android specifically will cease to be
able to access Bandra debugger

325
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,800
turn off USB debugging is a good one and
but make sure you've actually turn it

326
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,220
off as a few months the ones

327
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,850
a what's funny is in a lot other

328
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:56,070
the customized ROM sexy turn on USB
other debugging by default

329
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,610
and you want know this until actually
didn't know this myself until I plugged

330
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,360
in and I checked the phone and when I
did the years the utils

331
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,270
against lead my phone is a co you're in
debug mode on my cock crap

332
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:10,010
quake there was because I just did a
fresh install its energy mater something

333
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:16,180
and they leave debug mode turned on any
other

334
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,890
can encrypt the file system yeah you get
your we actually really good idea

335
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:25,679
because in your field accident what

336
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,830
yeah you so you think of that version
and then do more tax than

337
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:32,059
but a little every event early frankly I

338
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:35,400
it what's funny is a lot of these ideas
and one that I doing here was USB cable

339
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,049
neutering

340
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:39,490
which is the one that I always here
first and I he because a I'm a guy

341
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:44,490
and I like that word a is busy removing
the data pins

342
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,640
from your from the USB cable and I
thought well that's really actually

343
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,830
course whatever he says well you know
there's four pins

344
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:55,070
power and data yeah

345
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,779
you should have one made up

346
00:18:56,779 --> 00:19:00,220
the

347
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,530
well it is back feed

348
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,060
20

349
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:09,290
you can a mobile they're again nearly
ended I mean like all to come up here

350
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,270
cuz you're talkin

351
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:13,660
you need to give me a beer become a few
there you're gonna move on

352
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:20,660
you be busy for the next them

353
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,280
yet through that

354
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,019
yeah

355
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:33,320
pic

356
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:40,120
neither of those something good helpful
it's not your fault

357
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:47,120
alright well so

358
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,280
yeah yet

359
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,230
interruption free for 10 minutes now act
a

360
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,840
and shows that young hey

361
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:07,600
took back to this is a hug so somebody
mentioned you know so I think so we

362
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,220
mentioned

363
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,700
you power of advice which is cool but
actually some devices

364
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,040
this is different for each individual
device unlocked the soul I access the SD

365
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,610
card

366
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:19,240
even while the device is turned off so
not perfect I

367
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,450
so he did mention this is next one which
is confirm Asian before

368
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:27,220
amounting or debug axis that's a great
one yet remember that every phone's

369
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,980
operating systems actually different
some OC

370
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:33,740
Android specific responds bizarre there
ron is wholly different how to handle

371
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,610
this in some phones

372
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:38,080
surprise to me sometimes I find that the
phone actually left

373
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,530
that me in debug mode after the last
time Ordonez before

374
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:44,600
allowing ABC charge be easy access the
SD card

375
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,529
all right now

376
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:50,630
which one

377
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:55,200
iPhones %uh all the majority my research
actually was with older iPhones

378
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,050
which are mentioned a was is find a
funny I totally obliterated older

379
00:20:59,050 --> 00:20:59,660
iPhones

380
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,620
say that the first gen iPhone you're
screwed new iPhones actually do have

381
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,960
protections against this which

382
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,160
verify a who you are are

383
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,380
before BC they're fed the puck into the
right computer before and

384
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:15,240
this is the red the addressable

385
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,880
d-va brute force attack against the
phone but I have been able to get my

386
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,160
hands on an iPhone 4

387
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,340
or newer to be able to actually test
these things out unfortunately

388
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,040
but if anybody wants to and at once to
put the phone on line

389
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:31,520
talking to my USB devices a way more fun

390
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,590
try another good one is having a a

391
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:38,470
backup battery which is what I basically
do now because I don't even know when

392
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm gonna be able to get to a power
source

393
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,410
or not so it's always it's just have
backup battery somewhere

394
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,980
he tried a lot of things in the looks
pretty cool when you actually have your

395
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,340
phone

396
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:54,340
charging for mobile days the AM I beer

397
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,160
if I minutes

398
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,230
housing

399
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:06,700
okay i well i at five minutes on a burn
through a lot of this

400
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,960
a so these are my preferred method you
actually is there

401
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,220
a being a backup battery and bring your
charger are actually he once was as the

402
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,559
way things are within your control

403
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,700
and I don't like USB cable routing for
second reason because

404
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,769
remembering to bring your neutered data
cable you might as well remember to

405
00:22:21,769 --> 00:22:23,110
bring you back a better something else

406
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,899
so that's that's my two cents I

407
00:22:26,899 --> 00:22:30,360
for businesses matter policy for users
its a matter of getting the right

408
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,500
devices so River this summer the air

409
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,389
it's kinda funny what I've notice is a
trend since the last time

410
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:40,260
busy sites are given this talk
originally

411
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,790
I is that I so noticing that people were
keep looking into the

412
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:47,500
the power adapters which you can really
see here right there's not really a

413
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,280
power strip

414
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:52,660
right next to the USB charging station
if you were really smartly just for them

415
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,070
to the

416
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:56,040
thing behind their moving charging
stations on the way to the plug into it

417
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,180
I saw a couple times at the airport as
is quite funny

418
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:02,930
a specifics for a few devices enjoyed

419
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:07,060
is meet me very majority the ROM's ship
with an ass before mounting

420
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:10,360
that's great double check your room
because some of them don't I

421
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,140
this differs from to ROM especially if
you're doing I like the energy market in

422
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,080
your own mater

423
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,040
like your own is the hacker on our
customer ROM double check

424
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,230
again you not even so you're on because
all the majority those will leave

425
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,290
debugging turned on

426
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:26,330
and ready by Gary require axes

427
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:30,340
all talk on itself the malicious things
you can do effect I know somebody who

428
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:30,980
did talk

429
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:35,180
you can look it up is Twitter handles at
because look at what he did with our

430
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,280
physical drive by

431
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,580
attacks that stuff is really wicked
because he may see does methods where he

432
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,160
can

433
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,270
brute force your screen lock key

434
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:47,790
and as well as BC grab your Google of a
basie token

435
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,880
and then login as your Google user
Freedia the other devices

436
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,140
that's own talk thats but its it's a
special

437
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:59,560
condition I also mention 8 addition
mention Android actually which is what

438
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,220
are the batteries

439
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:03,920
where's my phones don't so you can
actually have extra backup batteries you

440
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,650
are required to use proprietary

441
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:09,270
cable which means that the cancer
specific cable for that one purpose

442
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:14,050
on William hi market control the
original iPhones at auto sync which

443
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:17,260
literally that there is life inside me
me as I mentioned just again who had

444
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:17,700
everything

445
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,300
of the device no one's use a dickey

446
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:25,410
encryption key so both devices both the
device in the computer have to agree

447
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:29,120
are basins and drinking before they
before communication can take place

448
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,050
is a key before so I have not done that
yet I

449
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:36,100
so let's go to advanced topics really
quick

450
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,250
you know what I did with a with you
jacking

451
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:42,680
a base if you want I can evolve through
do similar to what I did

452
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:47,210
and teen royalty what kiosk push our
phones pulled it off phones

453
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:50,440
you do it no it's just something is
doing for traffic monitoring which is

454
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,630
busy pointing device id: I mention this
as well with iPhone section the device

455
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:58,550
eighty is your also your you didn is
getting a lot of press that the it said

456
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:02,310
unique device identifiers for your phone
which gets dumped via some

457
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:05,810
to buy some programs as well as turned
out to be a USB as well with no

458
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:08,400
authentication required your device will
give up a TD ID

459
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,260
you can also attack existing kiosk
there's this much stuff going on in a

460
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:13,840
kiosk

461
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,870
so you can actually malicious attacks
directly against it I

462
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:20,180
this is the unique a going back to the
early part pushing the stock has the

463
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:20,600
unique

464
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,410
that stuff that had to do stop people I
Def Con from attacking

465
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:28,030
us a PC tech kiosk getting control so

466
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:31,910
young the chaos is is the idea that you
know forgetting about the OSC just

467
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,610
transfer always attack modesty

468
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:36,770
your laptop or PC use infected phones to

469
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:40,710
in fact other laptops or other phones
there's a device

470
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:45,470
in another talk basie about a teeny
where you can be CD direct ATV

471
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,680
ATV accident may see phone to phone
attacks %uh

472
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,390
awesome even a power your Raspberry Pi
power really tiny stuff

473
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:56,940
so summary is court read is the kiosk
its design issues usability first in

474
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,040
this was a major threat

475
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,110
until like two years ago or basic last
year when the

476
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:06,220
corrected all this then a the complexity
goes well beyond the kiosk

477
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:10,700
now infected PCs so on so forth and is
just on our because

478
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,290
you can track people monitor where
people are located if you know the

479
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,510
unique device identifiers

480
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:17,880
your for that person's phone you know
where they are when the fog into their

481
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,980
USB to device

482
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,980
somewhere located BC that you have
access to WSB

483
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:26,360
devices are also mention I felt I should
use their

484
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,490
when the other summary points is usually
have fun because if I hadn't decided to

485
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,040
go out find strives for anything

486
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,610

think everybody while she for
