1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,280
have so don't have instilled into my

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,640
actually product manager for a pal to
network said been with them for a little

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,319
while now

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:10,860
I before that I worked at

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,269
when the big 5 defense contractors doing
a electronic warfare

6
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:17,789
R&D programs which I electronic warfare
is

7
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:20,789
basically kinda radar version I've have
all the

8
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,400
the cyber worst effort you I care about
a lot and

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,689
but those two are crossing pass as more
and more nowadays is everything

10
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:31,340
and that getting to RF at some point
another seamus out but that

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,430
interesting stuff but that's not what
we're here to talk about today

12
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:40,290
have today a what I thought I do is a
person first together to look at

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,430
a take a closer look at some modern our
trends

14
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,829
what we're seeing their their
capabilities evolving into are what the

15
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:48,079
back channels look like

16
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,100
I on an application-aware appliance

17
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,920
I will be looking at some date also add
a statistical level someday we collected

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,100
from wildfire which is a

19
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,219
a service we launched back in November
last year I

20
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:03,789
as so I'll just get a quick overview
that service and a little bit

21
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:07,630
also take a closer look at the weather
very targeted

22
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:11,920
at targeted attacks we've seen recently
in this in the skate around actually

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,950
hand and what that looks like an and a a
quick overview of some

24
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,740
some reason skate events as well on
there is a very good I skied a specific

25
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,229
talk actions from a few hours ago which
is really good I

26
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:26,689
recommend you check it out if you missed
it I answer that will get started

27
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:31,360
I just want to do a quick introduction
love at the service will call wildfire

28
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,259
have I promise I left my sales had at
home this is not a sales pitch

29
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:38,820
at all I just wanted to introduce the
technology see know where the data is

30
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,619
coming from that we're going to talk
about

31
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:44,360
as a wildfire is a cloud base and boxing
environments

32
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,320
I sandboxing now where are looking for
the behaviors performs on the host

33
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,590
i doing automatic termination as to
whether or not it said benign or

34
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,299
malicious

35
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:56,590
I binary I and it has a number things to
do that

36
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:00,180
so it's kind of an overview the flow
here I Inc

37
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,149
the sandboxing myself course nothing new
there's nothing novel strictly about

38
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:07,180
sandboxing everyone's got different
techniques arms looking for different

39
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:07,729
things

40
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:11,310
and doing different things with that
data but somewhere between automated

41
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,690
I verdict determination you know is it
bad or good I

42
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:18,950
to just plain raw forensics data
collection but what makes this

43
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,569
particular set up a a little bit unique
is that this is for the first time to

44
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:23,670
our knowledge that

45
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,280
basically sandbox I like this and have
this capability has been

46
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,030
added as a capability I within a
firewall

47
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,200
whereby networks that deploy this
firewall can

48
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,450
send-up suspicious files to the service
I practically in real time

49
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,720
and that allows us to collect some very
interesting data I

50
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,349
very good data not honey pot based data
but you know stuff it's getting real

51
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:46,030
world

52
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,599
custom and enterprise networks so the
malware

53
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,980
basically is is caught on the firewall
or the samples I should say before there

54
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,099
is a determination made

55
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:57,909
alright sent up to the sandbox I enter
data centers it's analyzed

56
00:02:57,909 --> 00:03:02,069
I will let its phone home into all that
internet stuff it wants to do

57
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:05,470
I which is very important for from our
to be able to talk to the internet

58
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,250
from Sam boxing perspective a we see

59
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,569
behaviors I very common behavior for
example is that that now where will for

60
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:18,519
will first reach out to a Microsoft are
comical about comic shirts got Internet

61
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:20,569
connectivity before starr's to do
anything bad

62
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:23,690
I once the internet check checks out I'm

63
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,190
will go to know when I P checking
website what is my IP dot com something

64
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,670
like that

65
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,580
trying to its external IP address fine
networks running and only after that

66
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,629
second check

67
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,959
our checks out will actually start
executed I

68
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:39,879
what it's really designed to do for some
forms usually is falling back home

69
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:42,150
talking to its true commerical servers

70
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,250
back a you know under the attackers
control

71
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:50,959
so take a look at some other data were
able to collect at this was over a

72
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,209
one-month period earlier in the year
believe this was a

73
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:56,360
April 2012 at during that time

74
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,890
I we discovered I just under 16,500

75
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,819
a unique new malware samples in the
networks that were installed at the

76
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:04,950
service was deployed on

77
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,500
ass was a unique I knew our samples not
coming to pick its

78
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,569
this is by file hash I have and

79
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:15,830
of those over 16,000 I'm a full
two-thirds of the samples were not

80
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:19,739
detected by any the top six and twenty
the products that we routinely monitor

81
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:20,680
for detection

82
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,449
are this is not using virustotal data
after those even or fires total

83
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:28,540
I you know bar stools is very good at
doing what it does

84
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,169
but you only get one hundred percent
confirmation that something is or is not

85
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:31,979
detectable

86
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:35,570
if that samples actually been uploaded
fires total I'm so

87
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,229
for that reason I we basically built our
own sordid many

88
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:42,900
buyers total light capability are
looking at a subset of those basically

89
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,080
that the who's who of

90
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,500
7.2v products and I O and that's how we
came up with that that two-thirds number

91
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,150
so

92
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,199
I'm to some it's a total shocker to
others it's

93
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:55,440
it's not not really at all surprising
innocence kind where we find ourselves

94
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,600
today in spirit if

95
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,990
arms are static signature based on our
detection I'm not to say that it

96
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,810
it's going away or should go away it's
been there forever probably always be

97
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,430
there

98
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,220
at Sparta certainly defense in depth
strategy but this is simply

99
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,919
where we are today are with techniques
that are readily available to everyone

100
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,330
to to pack in off the skate an hour to
get around static signatures

101
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,620
observer site polymorphism I every 30
minutes reading every single time hours

102
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,199
pulled down from a server

103
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,000
hosting its roots repacked to to evade
detection

104
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,810
are the next fight over we see that I
also love those over 16,000

105
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,630
on our samples af eighty percent
generate some sort network

106
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,979
activity I shouldn't come as much of a
surprise either right

107
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:41,210
this is now where home in the game now
is is

108
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:45,229
sabotage IP theft Data Expo

109
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:48,789
you need the network to do those things
with no control are you need to be able

110
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:50,690
to get in and get out communications

111
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,400
and so the only way to do that obviously
is is just had a network indication

112
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,340
now love though those eighty percent a
full 60 percent almost

113
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,660
on our samples exhibited what we call
I'm evasive traffic

114
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,229
so let's look at what evasive traffic
looks like I

115
00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:09,419
some these are strictly faces but it is
interesting but we just put them all up

116
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:10,110
here

117
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:14,229
I just for a completeness I'm that first
category is by far the most popular this

118
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:16,360
is short HTTP headers

119
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,470
this is out you know for those familiar
with what HTTP headers look like

120
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,460
I'm budget in the clients like web
browsers and job in those kinds of

121
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,050
things

122
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,080
I typically have your long very verbose
working HTTP headers

123
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,720
most now where you know be people was
pull together some real quick to http

124
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,560
paste command control protocols in eight
maybe we have what you better fielder 3

125
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,600
the bare minimum just to get the traffic
flowing are so short

126
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,590
HTTP headers is often a giveaway that
that some things running at

127
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:47,770
on the network that probably shouldn't
be that next category over

128
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,949
unknown traffic I we determine

129
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:54,120
/url the way we close by and on traffic
is we run it through

130
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,120
I our protocol an application-layer
decoders

131
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,720
and so these are running on on all ports
operator all the time

132
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,729
and trying to identify you know is this
HTTP IRC

133
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:09,690
SMTP those types of things and then
we'll go out one level up and and try

134
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,759
and identify specific application

135
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,780
if traffic feels to me any those
criteria in its unknown

136
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,910
I will dump it in the unknown been which
you know you want to take a

137
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,169
will close look at that traffic was
unknown and possibly control the traffic

138
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:22,680
if you're interested in controlling

139
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,620
a modern our so I don't traffic when we
going it to customer sites and we see no

140
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,830
traffic on the network which we knew we
always do

141
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,340
eyes always want two things it's either
custom in-house software

142
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,410
proprietary software for which we have
no knowledge of and and so have to go

143
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,690
you know right signature specifically to
identify their software I

144
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,379
whenever to and more commonly is it's
now running on the network

145
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:47,810
it's using proprietary protocols using
proprietary Christian

146
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:51,710
I'm simply doing a by text or across the
thing

147
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,319
arm anything to just already have a
anything that can do anytime smart

148
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:58,020
scanning on that web traffic

149
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,590
I the next category over use a dynamic
dns fast flexing

150
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,970
he's been around for a while I they're
pretty popular

151
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:08,629
you know for anti takedown attempts
anti-gay

152
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:12,129
blacklisting techniques and so on and so
forth and I we get into

153
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:16,050
I think http is the next most common
what we call them what we mean here by

154
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,330
faith HTP

155
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,430
is basically non HTTP running over the
standard HTTP port so

156
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:25,129
I anything that's not RC compliant web
traffic

157
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:28,440
over forty 443 8080 other sports

158
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,159
I'm just to evade bastard for this a
strict stateful inspection firewall

159
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:36,380
are just to get that traffic out the
door it's something totally different

160
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,789
but it's running on the sports that
everyone knows are open

161
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:43,200
than me see the converse is that which
is I

162
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,550
HTTP over non-standard ports are so

163
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:50,459
they want to leverage a city pizza great
for calls free for controlled easy

164
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:55,570
win32 API is out there to help you out I
but they want to use non-standard ports

165
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:59,130
I just to get around you know appliances
are security devices that might be there

166
00:08:59,130 --> 00:08:59,930
looking at

167
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,610
specific predefined ports two beers
their first going on

168
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:07,410
on so you know you might have for
instance asshole rules looking for

169
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,230
specific command control patterns

170
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,990
but first part that really say well that
that's only working at HTTP

171
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,480
ports and that's a predefined variables
out there that's has a minute set a poor

172
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,500
sense looking at so

173
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,029
that's why they do that I'm in the last
two categories and IRC

174
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:24,660
on on standard and non-standard ports I
used to be pretty common

175
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,860
still out there a little bit but not
nearly as much as it used to be

176
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:32,029
I just because it's a red flag not
really too many more

177
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:35,700
legitimate uses a fire see in today's
enterprise environment I and if you see

178
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,470
it

179
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:43,470
its its it is usually red flags so not
as popular as as it used to be

180
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,940
as so going back to the AV coverage
question

181
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,630
this is a little bit the histogram here
showing the first one week

182
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:54,100
have any coverage stats services
starting from day 0

183
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,300
when our welfare service first attacks

184
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,350
brand new never before seen now where
and then going seven days past that

185
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,660
I this is sorta the breakdown that we
see it's pretty typical breakdown of

186
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,820
how if the vendor coverage changes over
time

187
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:13,260
and so this was a belief this was taken
from a January this year so

188
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,350
I pretty much what we expected to see
you almost

189
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,769
you know very little coverage up front I
and

190
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:24,029
been the cover star to fill in overtime
sometimes however will see samples that

191
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:25,019
get covered

192
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,529
I'm weeks or even months later sometimes
never simply because

193
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:32,170
you there they're extremely targeted the
never touch a better honey pots or than

194
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:35,709
never seen on an endpoint with maybe
product that is able to do anything with

195
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:36,500
it

196
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,050
so there's a variety reasons why that
might happen

197
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:45,850
I will so did couple experiments just
for the fun of it to see what's

198
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,459
this traffic from some reason our
samples that we see with wildfire

199
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:53,160
look like if you're looking at it are
through the files point of view

200
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,490
as so we took a couple sample start with
what we call

201
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,490
shows an example our sample number one
arm

202
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:03,029
and this just gives you kind of an
overview the tax behaviors we observed

203
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:07,209
that an hour to do and if you can see in
the back or not but it lit up our system

204
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,120
like a Christmas tree and interest

205
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,829
almost every behavior we look for this
this basically did

206
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:16,220
I anything from are

207
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,390
you know messing with the security in
proxy settings on the web browser

208
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:23,149
are creating installing drivers and
services starting XQ doubles and

209
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,890
processes from me

210
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:28,500
user docking for things like that that
typically are not found

211
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,260
in which in its software I also did on
the networking site a couple

212
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,190
a couple behaviors you can see those
errors point2 a connecting to a

213
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,269
non-standard

214
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:40,820
up HTTP port and also producing unknown
traffic over the issue to be

215
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,839
HTTP port so let's take a look at that
network traffic

216
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,060
you open up in Wireshark Casey kind of

217
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,649
scant reports on the source I am helping
run will be on the destination side

218
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:54,700
most the sessions by far around the 1k
range

219
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,040
are pretty typical for polling phoning
home getting your commands

220
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,980
are very lightweight traffic a couple
sessions there definitely are

221
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,410
to note are roughly in the three to five
hundred K range which is pretty much

222
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,769
at a giveaway that okay it's now pouring
down second stage or

223
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:14,329
updating itself I was take a look at
what that traffic looks like

224
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:17,870
I so we basically took the P caps from
that now where

225
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,970
I during its now secession time for a
min in while firing we played at three

226
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:22,990
plants

227
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,430
and we look at the logs inserted to get
a feel for you know how this looks from

228
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:29,279
an operator's point of view if they had
no idea this was running

229
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,500
I miss if they were running a service
like like wildfire looking at what that

230
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,630
now was doing

231
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:36,970
anti-cancer to see here on the
application category our application

232
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:37,779
call

233
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:42,200
on the the the app's that it was running
I it kind of false made between

234
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,470
your DNS web browsing and on TCP DNS web
browsing and on TCP

235
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:50,700
and and so let's take a look at what and
that that unknown

236
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,829
at TCP their I'll stick with it with
that session was

237
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:59,610
and we open up the PCAT and almost
immediately anyone it seems for you know

238
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,870
exact which working at you have to
ms-dos

239
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:05,029
in the header in there with the dead
giveaway string

240
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:08,730
I and so basically this is just opening
up a raw socket

241
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,459
and pumping out a binary to either
update itself or

242
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:16,070
or pull down additional capabilities
another rat or something like that

243
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:20,000
arm and and it was over standard-issue
peep or so

244
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,740
yet another example of how you know
without doing any dish inspection if you

245
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,930
just have open ports

246
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:28,010
it allows now in its got in your network
somehow already

247
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:34,209
to pull down second stage capabilities

248
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:37,940
us take a quick look at one more I will
call this Trojan sample number two

249
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,560
and we look at the logs that it produces
on the firewall

250
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,209
and we see a couple things here they're
a little bit out of the ordinary we see

251
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:45,570
our web browsing

252
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:49,940
I over I go higher restricted or at some
reports

253
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,930
we'll see unknown you TP over the DNS
453 which

254
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:57,620
also is highly suspicious and and we
take a look at

255
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,660
let's take a look at the 453 traffic I

256
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,889
and Wireshark and we see Wireshark
sparser crank on it and

257
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:08,000
the questions and answers the numbers
are I off the charts

258
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,300
ridiculous not real and then later on
the the parcel of course crash on it

259
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,329
because it's not at all

260
00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:16,399
valid DNS and if we take a look at this
one

261
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,949
the pick-up service once rocky cap it's
basically the same exact thing it's

262
00:14:19,949 --> 00:14:21,660
downloading second stage now where

263
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,279
tunneling through the opened in s'port

264
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,910
that said the attackers try and make any
easy for you this is this is the easiest

265
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,959
thing to do is just

266
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:33,220
trying to through an open port was
totally bogus non DNS data

267
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,410
are a little bit more sophisticated
attack in my do something like this DNS

268
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,449
tunneling which some might be familiar
with

269
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:41,620
I just totally RC compliant DNS traffic

270
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,070
it's using tax records and the

271
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:48,410
recursive queries to an attacker control
DNS server

272
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:52,620
and tunneling for TCP data through DNS
it's a great way to get free wifi at the

273
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,540
airports

274
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:58,670
if you are 7 DNS server I was also very
convenient and handy too

275
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:02,920
this week following anything you want
over the DNS port even if you are

276
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,149
looking specifically for DNS

277
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:08,899
got to have serve another layer of
intelligence also looking for

278
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:12,180
you know is it's actually legitimate DNS
or is this one of these

279
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,500
example application you see on the left
side there on that

280
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,149
that really aren't legitimate DNS

281
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:23,240
I a quick look at curios just by show of
hands real quick

282
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,630
how many people are would say they're
very familiar with curious

283
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:31,000
but it so a couple but that's on it or
not ways and

284
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,410
everyone's time with a little bit have
little bit a back story here so curious

285
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,990
and has been around for a while in
various permutations are

286
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:42,370
the result I'm not today's is we do pick
up a ton a curious intercepts since we

287
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,329
are basically

288
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:46,540
a sensor in in customer networks and and
a

289
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,910
and the for teams able to take a look at
at new malware including you

290
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:54,170
actually experience eyes so this
particular botnets had a long history

291
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,279
started this storm then while attacking
curios

292
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,829
on the that name the game here release
form spanning

293
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:05,339
just as fun spamming is its you know
main profit maker

294
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:09,420
on it can also do de da saying I and
drop additional now where

295
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,240
it's had a long command control
evolution it started out

296
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,339
as basically merging and you don't you
like

297
00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:20,149
prepare protocol are migrated to XML
over HTTP

298
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:24,339
migrated to you serialized objects or
HDPE

299
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:29,180
a there's been several takedown attempts
each one has been moderately successful

300
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:33,089
for that now where that day but then the
net new variant is compiled

301
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:36,110
and put into production in circulation
hours later

302
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:39,860
and we've seen that several times now so
and it's still there it's there today

303
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,949
its its I'm doing what it does best

304
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:46,820
on so I you know how to propagate

305
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:51,190
well the same method is used the hope
that this whole time as well as couple

306
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:51,459
new

307
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:55,029
new method so we see the social
engineering emails we've seen infected

308
00:16:55,029 --> 00:16:56,089
web sites

309
00:16:56,089 --> 00:16:59,699
I it harvests email addresses from
infected hosts all that stuff

310
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:03,690
I we also saw it use a targeted Facebook
amber not targeted a Facebook campaign

311
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,030
after the numbers were taking way down
after that crowd strike

312
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:11,480
take down in March arm there's a huge
Facebook campaign launched a

313
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,760
basically affecting people through most
wall posts I was very successful

314
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,819
I we also saw them I payoff

315
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:22,630
fight stock but need to get the numbers
up we also souter wildfire

316
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:26,140
a lot and now we're out there that was
totally unrelated and totally unrelated

317
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,200
campaigns with nothing previous to do
with with curios

318
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,640
are starting to drop a curious partnered
on infected host as well so

319
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,140
on you know you can never beat to
surprise really but it's just another

320
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,230
example if

321
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,140
have different bursting associate
different group meeting certain deals in

322
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:40,980
and getting

323
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,480
other payloads drops I you know the
right people and and

324
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,559
piranha money I also another interesting

325
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,570
addition in the latest variant out was
the

326
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,970
inclusion up the got LNK Microsoft
exploit the 2010

327
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:01,850
at 2568 see on this was made world
famous by Stuxnet for those if more

328
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,900
Stuxnet this is one the propagation
method stocks new and used it at that

329
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,250
time it was no day

330
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,100
arms and it's no wonder anymore I but
this allows you to

331
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:14,120
property infected machines just by
inserting a USB stick with the malicious

332
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,100
make file on it

333
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:19,140
was a shark at are even if you are under
stable under on the host which

334
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,590
most PCs now the default configuration
Windows

335
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:27,340
I and certain secure environments they
make sure that arteritis disable

336
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,770
so in without a run the sable this
allows you to infected host

337
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:34,280
just by sticking the USB stick and and

338
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,350
as with a lot of now where in this type
category

339
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,600
we see the focus is on are even Asian

340
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,500
rather than anti analysis anti-mouse
this is just not their priority

341
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,520
for these particular actors I

342
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,640
in terms of evasion now we see you serve

343
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,970
a Packers they had migrated from UPS to
custom packer

344
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:58,669
on we've seen the pay was changed every
30 minutes

345
00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:01,890
so the emphasis is on evading the
traditional AV

346
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:06,270
a signature-based detection I interns
the Italian's this again we saw that the

347
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,130
be very in

348
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:10,450
I with a custom packer put in a couple
into debug tricks

349
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:15,740
I in the dot C at least from the samples
we found out they were basically no

350
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,980
anti-mouse districts in there whatsoever
which is pretty easy to start

351
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,640
just being in picking it apart and
persistence is not particularly stealthy

352
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,169
there it's basically just right there in
the registry

353
00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:30,360
I'm there is no hijacking a legitimate
processes or anything like that

354
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,830
I it's it's pretty straightforward once
it's on the endpoint

355
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:38,230
enter the capabilities and how those
have evolved I

356
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:42,000
against it's primarily spamming botnet
has been it is today

357
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,450
I I did ask line as well I so do you
host

358
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,580
able to host OS detection so is running
out for its for instance

359
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:53,130
a Service Pack 2 Windows XP and earlier
I'm it knows it can get a raw socket

360
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,380
andy san flooding

361
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,789
of its running a later operating system
in OC it can't do that and I'll just do

362
00:19:57,789 --> 00:19:58,309
you

363
00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:01,700
at the user level anyway I'll just do
connection based

364
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,130
flooding I'm in the more

365
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:09,080
interesting things at all actually do a
full the peak app install

366
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,429
and start monitoring yes and be FTP SMTP

367
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:16,480
up three up for stealing financials to
to you of course further

368
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,250
propagate itself I else oh is that

369
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,409
makes good use if ever open source
libraries

370
00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:28,070
I'm whoopee cap we just talked about a
boost

371
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:32,289
I crypto plus plus critter plus plus not
use just for

372
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:35,549
equipping its own phone communication
but actually use it to you

373
00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:39,450
ID credit any FTP and cripple FTP
passwords it might be stored on the host

374
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,870
I'm by by local FTP clients I don't use
those to log into those web sites that

375
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:44,340
that

376
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,740
that person might might oversee and turn
those web sites

377
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,340
into proxies to watch further infections
not to

378
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:56,059
a host additional payloads and so on and
so forth

379
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:59,169
I it going stealing also is his

380
00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:03,039
I'm made its way to the latest variant
I'm not just pick one

381
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,820
wallet stealing which I mean let's be
honest not too many people are

382
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,870
the coin wallets and now it is but going
to become

383
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:14,120
the pic when mining I is is big business
in the bonnet circle now

384
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,620
and now we're taking advantage of CPU
cycles but cheap you as well

385
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:21,570
using the massively parallel a computer
capabilities have cheap used to do those

386
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:24,770
work at home for show your problems I

387
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:28,429
that you need to do to write to mind
points so pretty cool stuff in the

388
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:30,320
curious side so that's been published

389
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,490
time I've seen some that earlier I but
its

390
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:36,990
it's always changing a a little bit so
what cue track that stuff

391
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:40,880
I'm now a quick look at switching gears
a little bit

392
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,159
to the industrial concert industrial
control system ICS and SCADA

393
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:48,190
environments I

394
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:52,370
its it's a definitely got a lot of
people's attention and DHS Department of

395
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,580
Homeland Security

396
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,750
I just put out a study

397
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:00,539
few months ago that in 2011 ice skater

398
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:04,549
cyber intrusions spite five-fold over
the year previous

399
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:08,039
I and so it's its goal on people's
attention I'm

400
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:12,159
is put out by DHS which runs TSA so

401
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,070
take it with a grain of salt but they're
probably right about this its I it is

402
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,360
within a problem

403
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,620
and so won't spend too much

404
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,840
on the flame Stuxnet issue I'm sure a
lot of view of

405
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,000
reddit link about it but just wanted to

406
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,070
cover very briefly what its capabilities
were

407
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:33,039
how it spread you know what is
persistence look like nowadays with you

408
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,210
concorde advanced capabilities look like
nowadays just a little said everyone

409
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:37,510
said i wanna talk about it

410
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:41,990
another campaign you can kinda compare
it to these types a campaign so

411
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:45,700
a flame for for people have been really
following the stuff love the experts

412
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,720
attend every night flames probably
actually the precursor to Stuxnet

413
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,980
I even though was discovered much later
I it was

414
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,390
its its speculated to be based on the
information gathering

415
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:00,610
stage have a campaign like Stuxnet

416
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:04,370
during the week on work so I it it

417
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:07,700
did a lot of things lotta a violent or
getting lottery con

418
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,039
had over 20 modules that can be loaded
and unloaded to things like

419
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,250
recording the audio from the PCs
microphone on

420
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:17,600
you can monitor Skype calls take
screenshots keylogging

421
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,500
I you it turns over to Bluetooth pecan
and try and set data from it once

422
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,870
Bluetooth devices and phones in the room

423
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:27,860
I also look specifically for I AutoCAD
files

424
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,860
pts in text file so these are things
that

425
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:34,390
it's that are useful for determining
okay what kind of state environment I

426
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,200
looking at

427
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,390
I'll you know any design documents
related to where I'm running that kinda

428
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,330
thing

429
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:43,000
I cells flame and Stuxnet which which
occurred

430
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,020
I arguably later I was discovered
earlier

431
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:50,100
are I of course was what did a lot of
the interesting things

432
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,250
muscular a quick I'm just what it did

433
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,600
which was that what we know why is it
interesting for small was the first

434
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,820
I an hour that people are aware of that
actually manipulated overrode

435
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,980
PLC code programmable logic controller
occurred are so that myself as

436
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,390
is pretty remarkable on also remarkable
is

437
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:12,080
its a specific conditions that required
to run

438
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,080
I this is a perfect example extremely

439
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,279
targeted I'm our that that took

440
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:22,429
many resources to identify exactly where
they wanted to run

441
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:26,240
so sleepy for other presents a specific
SCADA system

442
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,510
a a specific variable frequency drive
manufactured by just two vendors one

443
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,010
which is based in Iran

444
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:37,539
I and it was even looking at the current
rpm rate other centrifuges making sure

445
00:24:37,539 --> 00:24:39,570
they're specifically within something
like

446
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:44,159
850 hurts to 1200 hurts I'm so basically
exactly where they want to run is the

447
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:44,909
only place

448
00:24:44,909 --> 00:24:48,000
that the matter would actually do what
it was designed to do

449
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,140
and of course is designed to you
modulate the rpm to the centrifuges to

450
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,740
eventually

451
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:56,020
destroy them I the command control
pattern at the bottom

452
00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:00,090
I is pretty typical of him was saying
earlier about the stages at their

453
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:02,130
command control traffic and how it
started

454
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:06,010
test the waters and phoning home and
this is basically exactly what what

455
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,360
Stuxnet did as well

456
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,500
checking Windows Update at checking in
to send a calm

457
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,000
and reaching out to the troop command
control domains which were I

458
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,570
of course socially engineer themselves
out to to look like

459
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:23,289
they wouldn't stand out in a in a URL
Aug at an organization like this

460
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:27,700
so transitioning from those examples to
something that we found recently

461
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,289
II at a at a particular network this was
a

462
00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:34,770
a major raw materials manufacture in
Central Asia

463
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:38,559
we found a pretty sophisticated

464
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,330
industrial espionage in exploration
sample an hour

465
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:45,919
he was a spear phishing email me to look
like someone that the

466
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,179
victim knows very well I the attachment

467
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:52,240
was very relevant to the time frame that
this was discovered

468
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,700
I it was named that end of Syrian
President Bashar all

469
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:01,200
this also on is basically the exact same
time on the serious stuff was exploding

470
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,529
arm and usually when we see now we're in

471
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:08,970
in wildfire the vast majority of it is
seen by

472
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:13,890
anywhere between I am roughly 10 percent
to 25 percent of

473
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:17,260
all the firewall state that we have
monitoring I

474
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,980
and this one this one sample there's a
single session from the single

475
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,510
network and was never seen anywhere else
again so right there

476
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:28,470
can if you know emphasizes you know
maybe we should take a look at this

477
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:33,049
on technically I on on on the technical
side there is no packer used at all

478
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:37,860
I which again it's pretty common
actually to the really targeted attacks

479
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,400
you know you're not gonna have any AV
coverage for something that you just

480
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,350
built

481
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:45,270
out specifically for this organization
it's all custom stuff 100 percent

482
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:49,150
and packing it really draws attention to
yourself what I mean

483
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:52,799
there's software out there those
techniques out there looking at I

484
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,299
at bit entropy and things like that you
can tell pretty easily that this is not

485
00:26:56,299 --> 00:26:59,039
a run-of-the-mill execute upon that
there's a packer Houston

486
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,590
why do that if you don't need to this is
no point

487
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:06,299
I interjected code into standard
processes in notepad in the default

488
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:07,460
browser to stay

489
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:12,230
persistent with very little to serve
bring attention to itself

490
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,900
at the c2 was in lebanon which is a
country in the area

491
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,529
and and its capabilities were were
fairly

492
00:27:19,529 --> 00:27:23,520
are remarkable again we see the a remote
recording

493
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,539
have PCs PC audio I we see standard rat

494
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:30,740
functionality for shell access

495
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:34,230
installing running new software a mess
with the filesystem

496
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:38,010
at a tax bill that I think we also see

497
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:42,360
I pretty sophisticated re contact
function so

498
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,380
profiling the hostess running on in the
wired and wireless network

499
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,730
and doing so quite pervasively so doing
for

500
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:52,830
mastering capture on the entire hardware
software environment

501
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:56,350
are looking I for its mapping every
other Matt confined

502
00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:00,240
same with wireless so pretty interesting
stuff there

503
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,270
I and then what really got us going on
this was that it specifically search

504
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:07,809
for arc files and for I

505
00:28:07,809 --> 00:28:11,299
people in the state a community are
might ring a bell more so than others

506
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:11,799
but

507
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:17,510
arc is a basically an extension that
some SCADA software gets to compressed

508
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:21,059
PLC images basically so

509
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:24,230
by looking for art files were sent to
working out what is running on this

510
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:24,820
industry

511
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,870
on this company's PLC's both

512
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:31,779
for sabotage purposes potentially for IP
theft for

513
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:34,880
for various reasons that you might want
to get just 24 imager

514
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,590
exactly was running on that scale
infrastructure also targeted TeamViewer

515
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:44,120
I TeamViewer as you know our remote
desktop access basically

516
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,620
I'm it also tends to be used heavily in
these types environments as well

517
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,899
are you have work stations that are
connected to sensitive hardware

518
00:28:50,899 --> 00:28:54,710
hour or two PLC program stations things
like that

519
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:58,220
veteran-laden virus I might be in
continue to be in a hundred percent time

520
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:01,070
there's a lot of promoting into these
types of environments that have all this

521
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,200
equipment setup sweet

522
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,760
you just team view in and they're
they're good to go a continuing

523
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,480
development administration

524
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,230
obfuscate environment so specific
targeting a team euros was also love

525
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:11,880
interest from

526
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,880
from a scale appointing a

527
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,210
what got our thread engineers very
interested is that

528
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:21,549
it promptly identified are reserve books

529
00:29:21,549 --> 00:29:26,080
and profile them and sent up in a movie
at the time the open source

530
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,320
rings are all working we're using in the
service and the service

531
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,840
set that up to be a the attackers well
I'm so

532
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,919
definitely it knew what he was doing I

533
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:40,179
after this targeted attack things were
cool for

534
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:44,090
for several weeks or months forget which
but very little activity

535
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:47,190
I and then a couple months later we
started to see

536
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,240
a slew of this attack on our running

537
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,820
or are being Apollo Tyres total so it's
not as interesting we took a look at

538
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,690
those

539
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:58,880
I and ended a little more research in
turns out well this is now

540
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,220
I sold in a cracked form as the Arcam
rat

541
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:06,029
and various hacker forums and

542
00:30:06,029 --> 00:30:09,120
without some other capabilities
mentioned earlier so it's got a chicken

543
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,549
the age thing we're not sure

544
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:14,210
which came first I but we do know that
the that the one that was discovered in

545
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,440
this state environment

546
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,840
how was engineered specifically for that

547
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,380
type environment as opposed to the the
more widely available one that we can

548
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,899
find online now

549
00:30:23,899 --> 00:30:28,070
I'm that graphic at the bottom there is
a is and I don't work

550
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:31,140
at a at the command control handling

551
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:35,590
so it's just a giant staircases giant if
else basically looking at the command

552
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,399
code essentially from the attacker

553
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:41,760
to perform any one of the forty plus
activities we side capable of performing

554
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,789
so

555
00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:47,020
I'm definitely more than your average

556
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:53,649
remote access or even specific a
targeting our campaigns

557
00:30:53,649 --> 00:30:57,149
I so you know what are the threats
specifically to to ICS

558
00:30:57,149 --> 00:31:00,779
I I at this level at this technical
level

559
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:05,580
there's not that much that's really
unique at to ICS and state

560
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:09,529
I you know it's an hour running on the
networks gotta get in somehow

561
00:31:09,529 --> 00:31:12,630
gotta get out somehow at this level
there's

562
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:16,090
there's not a lot of difference going on
what is different

563
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:20,899
is why's it particularly vulnerable and
there's a lot of reasons why

564
00:31:20,899 --> 00:31:24,440
was particularly vulnerable first and
foremost it was just a product if it's a

565
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,159
rare

566
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:29,440
I it more was started in the sixties and
and a lot of cases it was

567
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,399
double the spring on the program had an
and taking a crack at at the stuff

568
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:37,059
and security was just not a priority at
the time and there's a lot of

569
00:31:37,059 --> 00:31:40,659
emphasis placed on the fact that you
have an air gaps network arms will see

570
00:31:40,659 --> 00:31:43,210
the next chart that may or may not
really be the case

571
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:46,669
I most threats were at the time at least

572
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:49,700
Insider based a a lot of insider attacks

573
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,990
there's a lot of sumptin that there's no
value in going after SCADA systems which

574
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,880
is certainly not the case anymore either

575
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,210
are there was I a lot of thought that

576
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:01,450
ace security through obscurity no its
minorities you know

577
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:05,429
obscure protocols that than no one knows
about except for a tight-knit club

578
00:32:05,429 --> 00:32:08,360
which not so tight need anymore this
conference is urs published on a bill

579
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,320
users

580
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,250
know if you want to learn anything you
want to learn about I i dnt 3 a.m. on

581
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:13,679
bus

582
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,500
you know you're minutes away from all
the material you need to to successfully

583
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,360
implement that protocol

584
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,240
so I mention that I am you know that
that whole

585
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,130
relying on air gaps the aircraft quality
its cable networks its troops on the

586
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:29,980
time

587
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:33,250
but not 100 percent a time so this
actually was a

588
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:37,690
project developed by I mister leverage
at Cambridge is presented at the

589
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,850
additional bond s4 conference earlier
this year on

590
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:45,500
and he built a tool that just
automatically to scan the web finding

591
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,830
a SCADA systems that were directly
behind public IP addresses any

592
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:51,950
integrated with Google Maps which is
cool all the time course

593
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:55,789
and conveniently used a red and green

594
00:32:55,789 --> 00:32:59,090
pins for at

595
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:03,340
SCADA software that was in was not
vulnerable to published vulnerabilities

596
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:07,840
so there's a lot to read their as you
can see I and 17 percent

597
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,130
I require no authentication when he
entered into the services

598
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:14,340
now at this level it's impossible to
tell automatically you know which ones

599
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,519
are honey pots verses

600
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:19,700
reno true vulnerable systems that are
actually in charge of critical

601
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,000
infrastructure persons

602
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,950
as you some random whatever but he did
sample he did

603
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:28,289
a sample a few these and did find some
very

604
00:33:28,289 --> 00:33:31,909
interesting somewhat high-profile SCADA
systems that were directly accessible

605
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:35,899
by public IP I'm and they've since been
working with the people involved here

606
00:33:35,899 --> 00:33:37,429
and trying to mitigate that

607
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:41,130
I'm but a and that's not even counting

608
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:45,080
you know the the SCADA networks that are
really air gaps

609
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,860
there's their segmented then there's a
VPN and some other network

610
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:53,100
which has a connection to a larger
network Michael we went to a remote site

611
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:56,039
with a shared that doesn't have a lock
on it with some work station sitting

612
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,990
there is running Windows XP

613
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:01,039
hand and by the way you have in place
from home that can be peeing into that

614
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:01,510
so

615
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:05,100
wants a different links in the chain on
that back to be pretty weak

616
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,750
so relying on the on air gap networks is

617
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:12,790
is not necessarily wise thing to do this
of course this picture

618
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:17,119
minus that mean text on I you this we
can't read an article about Stuxnet

619
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,770
without saying this image

620
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:21,470
I and so obviously even if you are
listening to one hundred percent air

621
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:22,250
gaps

622
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:25,359
I mean they found a way in disguise
network and

623
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:31,359
you never know who's bringing what in
over USB sticks and and what-have-you

624
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,929
I'll one more interesting thing related
to ICS and SCADA

625
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:39,079
at what are the DHS organizations is

626
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:42,230
certain time specifically I ice yes sir

627
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:46,750
that that kinda handles responses to
critical I'm ICS issues

628
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,970
and periodically they'll put out these
notices to critical infrastructure

629
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:50,820
owners

630
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:54,560
whence there's some new massive cyber
intrusion campaign that their detecting

631
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,119
from some nations stator

632
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:59,130
or some other actor on and they're all

633
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,500
I have typically unclassified for
official use only

634
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,079
I was leaked to the media somebody's a
written about others are to serve

635
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:06,859
ignored

636
00:35:06,859 --> 00:35:10,540
I but there was one in particular that
that went out recently

637
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:14,010
about a gas pipeline sector intrusion I

638
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:17,130
and its it's remarkable how much
cooperation now how much im from

639
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:17,849
information

640
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:21,770
ICS and critical infrastructure owners
are getting out from from organizations

641
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,900
like these are specific information
about

642
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:27,180
about specific artifacts to look for the
network for example

643
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:31,240
I'm a so it's it's definitely helpful

644
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,240
it's better than nothing but if
something that caught our attention

645
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,690
and a lot of other people's attention is
the I

646
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:42,099
advice for the recommendation now that
DHS is giving to the critical

647
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:46,810
such orders which is if you see an
intrusion campaign

648
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:51,900
I log pervasively log everything you can
capture when you can find out as much as

649
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,339
you can passively

650
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:56,400
but do not kick out the attackers and
less

651
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,130
critical infrastructure is in imminent
danger so

652
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:03,700
pretty interesting stuff it's it's worth
a a little bit a shift

653
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,849
in what people are used to and what
you'd expect a response to be

654
00:36:06,849 --> 00:36:10,420
I but you know you take another look at
this in new

655
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,990
start to realize exactly why they would
want to go about it this way

656
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:16,720
they want to learn just as much as the
attacker wants to learn they want to

657
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,730
learn who they are with their tools are

658
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:22,400
on how to better off and for to defend
and

659
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,570
uses information other in other ways so
I'm

660
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:30,220
so pretty interesting I so

661
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:34,520
in delivery cap let's look at know the
threat space

662
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:38,720
now how's the landscape changed how's it
stayed the same

663
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,490
and the attacker to some extent has has
changed are grown

664
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:45,740
a more advanced mean you hear the bass
persistence dasher

665
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:49,329
and that's that's certainly the case
we've we've heard that capitol city tax

666
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:50,730
strategy has evolved

667
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:54,690
to some extent I if you're going after
data in a database you don't just

668
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:56,060
slammed the database

669
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:59,820
you have to go alone slow you social
engineering employees

670
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:03,530
that may not even have access you help
when we passed throughout the network

671
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:06,910
you finally get after what what you're
after and then you get out

672
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:09,910
so that's that's a little bit different
than it used to be

673
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:13,020
I the migration from itself replication

674
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:16,200
to controlled release is also very
important for this type attacker

675
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,859
I so and you know what you're trying to
do a bride attention-getting spam

676
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:20,869
campaigners

677
00:37:20,869 --> 00:37:24,990
already das campaign or serve a more
activist I campaigns

678
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:28,210
on it's to your advantage to go low and
slow into

679
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:33,050
to specifically release your payloads to
the specific people but rafter rather

680
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:33,599
than

681
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,210
habits are self-replicating I we visible
spreading typeof

682
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:40,599
now appear words and the techniques
themselves

683
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:43,670
I have also changed to to a degree I

684
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:46,690
certainly there's there's still a
Windows phones out there but by and

685
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:47,339
large

686
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:50,800
I the OS's a are getting harder

687
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,829
I'm so that's good I but then that means
you shift your focus elsewhere

688
00:37:55,829 --> 00:37:58,930
so rather than go after the OS attackers
go after the

689
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:03,040
the soft spots browser bones Browser
Helper vaughn's

690
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,990
java phones these are all things that
you can get out through the browser

691
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:10,440
turns us all spots and they're getting
hit over and over again

692
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,579
you know PDF is number one turns PDF
exploits

693
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:19,450
I job was making the news over and over
again we saw another job to come out to

694
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:22,460
yesterday I think it was no job no data
effects

695
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:25,640
every platform so I you know

696
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:30,109
don't make your job harder than it needs
to be. go after go after what's easy

697
00:38:30,109 --> 00:38:34,030
I'm avoidance have traditionally
signatures we've been talking about this

698
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:38,660
so its with the tool boxes are available
nowadays it's it's almost reviewing a

699
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,349
lotta ways to get around static
signature stuff

700
00:38:41,349 --> 00:38:46,070
I and and a server repack upscale do
what you need to do to get around it

701
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:50,540
its its it's not that not that difficult
and having communications recite samples

702
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,450
about as well

703
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:54,490
using non-standard ports proprietary
encryption

704
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:57,630
on anything to get around appliances
that are you know able to

705
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:01,020
look for that and block the unknown
stuff

706
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:05,380
I'll so it's the same other what's the
same really I mean

707
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,349
bold ability is remotely exploitable
vulnerabilities insider threat unaware

708
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:12,650
users I don't know that don't have a
security-conscious

709
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:17,140
mine on you know no ones breaking the
laws of physics here much less computer

710
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,030
science or

711
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:20,890
at the end of the day those things are
always going to be there that's the way

712
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,740
it is its way

713
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:27,460
you know has been a movie for for quite
a while

714
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:31,200
and that's I had prepared for today so
without a hen

715
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:38,200
opened up to questions

716
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,030
now we know what environment

717
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:49,360
OS specifically with wildfire rice oat
so today I

718
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:53,570
the the service runs in a specific
environment with specific supported file

719
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:54,180
types

720
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:57,650
and so I I you know if you can't run a
can't run

721
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:02,290
I were not I in our particular product
or not proxying anything or not blocking

722
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:04,420
anything the first time he tries to get
through so

723
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:08,390
and the in that case a base with you
know all I'm of course we're always

724
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:10,210
looking for ways to

725
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:13,380
to increasing your platforms are
supported on the number of

726
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:17,240
file types who support most types of
things but but

727
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:24,240
all yeah if you can write him

728
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:31,039
anything else

729
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:32,150
all right thank you very much
