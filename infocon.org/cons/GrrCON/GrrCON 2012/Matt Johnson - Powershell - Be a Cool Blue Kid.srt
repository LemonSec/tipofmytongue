00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:04,920
II

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,710
this my talk power show beer cool blue

get started there some other stuff we're
gonna go through a managerial intro

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,219
myself you really have to actually
listen to that

5
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:19,920
are some basics a powershell go over
some files and file system stuff

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,859
well as user access a little bit systems
management and some rap

7
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:30,260
at I'm a system analyst for a nonprofit
organization

00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:35,140
and Southeast Michigan I'm also the
founder the PowerShell

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,460
Michigan power shows users group which
is cannot do anything right now so that

10
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:44,789
at hopefully gonna change later this
year I am a moderator on the hey

11
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,559
scripting guy forms if you're not
familiar with the hey scripting guy AR

12
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,690
website at Microsoft it is the area to
help people learn PowerShell

13
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:57,980
give arm actually things you can use in
your job so here's a variable

14
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,270
printer variable it's actually really
cool but they're performs

15
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:06,030
and I am a moderator on their well as a
judge Microsoft has scripting games

16
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,860
every year to help you in PowerShell

17
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,150
are either from basic or advanced are

18
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,920
judging is fun but its that's a lot of
scripts so

19
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,310
I you should try it out of your use
PowerShell in PowerShell

20
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,460
arm you throat remember my sack

21
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,490
arm whether they like it or not

22
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:30,579
but I am a avid gamer in a huge sports
fan

23
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:33,720
so my phone goes off in the middle
here's it's probably the White Sox

24
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,369
losing

25
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:39,689
and I'm yeah and a

26
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:43,159
I'm a father cue a future hacker are he
does

27
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:46,380
crazy things that I am thinking to
Europe to do yet annie has been to a

28
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,630
wonderful wife who have him this weekend
that I feel bad for her

29
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:53,460
I'm not an expert alright

30
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,899
like to pretend I am but I'm really not
I'm really my sex power show expert

31
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,149
and yeah they they've probably suffer
through that

32
00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:04,399
there's a ton a sysadmin stuff in here
blue side

33
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,729
are that's what I am normally do I don't
do read

34
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:10,970
side so we'll by a lot of the sadness of
does

35
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:15,950
tempted technically translate over the
blue side my employer

36
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:20,060
doesn't feel this way are either does
Microsoft I feel like I every site has

37
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,310
to have that line in there so that's why
that's their

38
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,390
and as you find out I think I'm funny

39
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,420
and I talk too fast so get over it if
you don't like it there's the doors

40
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,349
so I what's going on you anyway right

41
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:35,910
hopefully you all have seen this if you
use Windows seven

42
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,290
an OPP to the other version for Windows
as well but

43
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:43,599
you need should use this looks like a
DOS window but it's a lot cooler them

44
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,269
and us 1

45
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:48,300
you haven't heard willpower shows is a
task

46
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,310
automation framework I automate
basically

47
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:55,769
everything op from tweet now these guys
down here in my sack to

48
00:02:55,769 --> 00:03:01,150
are the senate my wife the grocery list
it's insolvent every Microsoft operating

49
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:01,810
system

50
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,620
it is getting better are so much better
you

51
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,540
once you start you some partially meant
when does there isn't no literally

52
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,349
you're gonna wonder why they haven't
done much in years

53
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:15,530
I heard someone comment today saying
that PowerShell makes when does actually

54
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,400
usable

55
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,040
hard arrives kinda cool off

56
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,489
and the current version is 30 I have
some 30 stuff for in the very end here

57
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:26,400
but I've still new and I didn't wanna

58
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,260
give you guys have stuff so there's
times a support

59
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,280
I support everything on here except the
compelling one

60
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,849
on here the compelling topics I'm gonna
do a talk proud later this year or next

61
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:39,540
year

62
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,920
are with walking garlic docent give up
stuff

63
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,010
but is there is a deep integration with
all these products

64
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:51,250
you can be I i don't remember the last
time I opened actually agree we

65
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,500
to manage half its products Skakel
alright

66
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,239
we're gonna go over some little basic a
language stuff

67
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,900
if you've are no a partial as you can
check your phone connects all but

68
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,939
a commanders like a command but

69
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:10,680
it so a lot cooler it is our vets Mike's
Subs actual

70
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,480
definition but it is a command the you
can make your own

71
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,329
which will get a couple minutes that's
when you read about power show you can

72
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:20,419
hear the command list

73
00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:24,449
it is are there some examples appear
like get help write-host register for an

74
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:25,009
object

75
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:28,669
its it's a very simple thing to pick up
Mr you

76
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:31,960
type in get dashcam and it'll give you a
whole bunch grams in it

77
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,380
actually you look at it and see what you
wanna you know

78
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,740
you can find out what you wanna do
there's a naming convention when you get

79
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,470
scripts

80
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,780
or download stuff off the internet
there's power show it should follow the

81
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,860
verb noun

82
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,050
format if it doesn't and you might want
to point them to the Bourbon

83
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:52,150
the here's how to write PowerShell code

84
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,720
stuff but it's a you'll see a

85
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,690
you see a lot of people don't use it but
there is a naming convention and you

86
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,570
stick by their

87
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,800
98 verbs that Microsoft uses like show
get

88
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,889
register stop terminate

89
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,720
never used for me but that's cool II
then there's aliases for those people

90
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,380
who

91
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,550
don't want to type out get dash mailbox
they're able you have

92
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,850
G&B on their side get child I know miss

93
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,860
actually dir miss the powers over in
order

94
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,979
but you can type dir and it'll do the
same thing or

95
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:28,460
alas for you on UNIX guys

96
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,000
you should not use this is just a sign
up don't use aliases and your scripts

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,270
because if you share in someone like
what the heck is that makes for easier

98
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,949
to read a few

99
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:39,650
I before CommandName saw and you wanna
see all the aliases

100
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:43,250
get dash alias you can make your own to
so if you don't like

101
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,199
to type you can make your own an alias
your whole thing if you want

102
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,650
and get help is your friend I make sure
that you

103
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:57,830
thanks Chris I use get help I use it all
the time if I'm not typing get help once

104
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,419
a day

105
00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:03,330
I'm now I'm not tryin

106
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,009
yes they do I temp completion is in the

107
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:10,240
consul and the built-in editor to give
you power editor to

108
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,990
which is really cool it will now version
3 will cab company in the editor

109
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,520
so an adult and intellisense to

110
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,900
yes intellisense are you people who use
it. even tell some slight

111
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,280
awesome well flexible so

112
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,710
there I for the UNIX guys don't worry

113
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:35,370
do you can type things you know man Kat
cpls

114
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:40,979
there's a there's multiple aliases for a
lotta commands

115
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:45,910
I it's kinda I think it's kinda weird
but whatever make people happy

116
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:49,539
now we're gonna talk about running
scripts are outta the box

117
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:53,270
you download a script for my website
might get home side whatever you won't

118
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,590
be able to run it

119
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,180
you have to change execution policy when
this first came out you really are

120
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,620
managed to secure the future to stop
Iran

121
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,349
run scripts and and people like relic

122
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:08,860
pop up for our Matt who writes the

123
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,110
power spoil module show that we are
really when you run PowerShell body XE

124
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,030
you can say bye pass the wrist

125
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:19,449
execution policy execution policy is
just basically stops you from

126
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:22,470
doing something stupid like outta the
box

127
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,770
you buy it but are its

128
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:29,870
yeah it's there you can set its just a
minor based on user

129
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,590
I'm a fan of just setting up by User
into the globally doing that

130
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:37,410
are there's a switch and a command that
you can run but that on the Internet

131
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,449
iraq cover that and it is not a security
measure

132
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:45,680
if just to stop dumb people from being
down

133
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,110
this is what I love about PowerShell is
you can make tools

134
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,610
how many times have you like and I wish
I had something I could do to do

135
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,300
you now I have axe I need to repeat it a
million times

136
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,300
I it's what I do a lot of the time I
make my scripts reusable

137
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,889
sharable share my blog a sharing with my
sect members I

138
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:09,410
share mall attack part there's one other
awesome things about this

139
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:12,440
then there's a huge community miss high
behind

140
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,849
making tools and sharing tools there's
passcode there is

141
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:19,520
Mikes of sight for getting scripts
there's times in different places

142
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,139
so this literally is it's like

143
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:27,379
now bash scripting or batch scripting
buddy its there's a lot more formal

144
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:30,360
stuff behind

145
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,360
this is part of that modules modules are
a bunch scripts

146
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,390
or compile the are coda where some other
stuff that you can put that put together

147
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,940
to make and share those tools

148
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,229
one other examples I have later as I
have a module to help

149
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:48,980
at it host files and it's just three
functions are pieced together that I can

150
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,990
important to my session and go on wash a
geyser

151
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:57,700
over is good for repackaging scripture
sharing

152
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:03,279
group PSC axe which I'll wolf mentioned
in his dotnet talk earlier is a great

153
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,589
collection of scripts on it

154
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:08,339
always updated office 365

155
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:13,360
you can manage the entire are online web
version of Microsoft's offer

156
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,050
feel that way an NTFS security is
another call on that will get into here

157
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:20,000
in a minute

158
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,970
how many times have you run a command
and wish that you knew what happened

159
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,380
what the output what's Powershot has
ceased to wonderful commands built-in

160
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:30,410
call start and stop transcript they will
record your

161
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,320
command and the output for everything
you do so say

162
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,200
a.m. your change a bunch to users over
to a group you can

163
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,959
log the whole thing so you have actually
a backup watcher debts even go back and

164
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,750
say yeah actually move that on this day
at this time

165
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,640
so it's to really cool

166
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:55,160
with couple s minutes notes ira how many
people are familiar with programming

167
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,160
gotta gotta gotta everything's an object
which means that you can take it

168
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,140
pipette for use in the pipeline
innkeeper manipulating stop until the

169
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,070
app

170
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:08,320
usually when you build a powerful
statement the end thing is always

171
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,769
your formatting so I'm gonna take users
I'm going to modify them and then I'm

172
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:16,820
gonna print them out to a text file that
I did all this work

173
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,040
pipeline like in UNIX 1x at all

174
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,630
you cannot pipe one command to another
two get

175
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:28,709
the variable things all variables are
are prefixed by dollar sign

176
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:32,540
new name anything you want except there
some special variables

177
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:37,000
our car how many there are but there's
the to underscore dollar sign which is

178
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,589
the current

179
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:42,640
thing in the pipeline or true and false

180
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,649
and anything in the stock works in
version 2 are about

181
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:51,649
so let's start off I'll permissions I
don't know why you guys but I hate file

182
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:52,680
permissions it's like

183
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,550
literally is a pain in my ass I don't
like

184
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,779
you can the gooey yeah okay

185
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:03,380
and X calzone Kells we all

186
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,740
I'm in my least I know a lot of people
not to use some but their

187
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,550
really not user friendly they're really

188
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:14,160
so built in the PowerShell there's get
inside AC out

189
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,899
these things are painful to use at best

190
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:21,240
I'll show you an example or that in a
second

191
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,579
by a you really if you're using this you
are

192
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:29,380
0 I you know you might want to drink and
watch

193
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:33,320
MacBook are

194
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,290
so here's a demo OVR actually how

195
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:42,470
bad the permission ng and windows are

196
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:49,209
for PowerShell for this is here we're
gonna creative director a quick

197
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:53,279
now work in our league this on talk

198
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,860
we're gonna this is the command to get
are

199
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:01,600
but ACLS for that folder and format less
gonna pretend to a thing that we can

200
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,410
easily read

201
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,860
you see here there's a whole bunch stuff
administrators

202
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:13,620
MT system and authenticated you're
basically this is the default

203
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,160
ski access so

204
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,180
he reminisced or the ACLs into a
variable so that I can act

205
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:25,290
on here is this race here we're gonna

206
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:30,290
say that we're gonna set access for a
protectionist something you have to do

207
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,720
America

208
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,279
I now I'm never ever change that so

209
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,970
here's what the next thing we're gonna
do is we're gonna set a

210
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:42,550
rule that this is an access control
world that gives domain admin for

211
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,589
control

212
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:46,899
over that directory that is

213
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:53,300
how long that is painful type a command
prompt literally painful

214
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,769
here's another and then this tree here
this command will add it

215
00:12:56,769 --> 00:13:00,240
to this variable so that weekend make
sure that

216
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,040
back it applied rene go through and do
this

217
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,200
again for domain users

218
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,279
and they're going to get the Modify
permission

219
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:17,240
we're gonna add it to the role

220
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,680
yet am I don't work it did earlier today

221
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,740
so basically what this is going to do is
it is

222
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,899
when I what does work and demigods
taunted them earlier

223
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:33,730
are this basically will set all those
permissions on here

224
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,920
all those lines just to Sat permissions

225
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,950
on their that thats that's painful to me

226
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:45,649
so

227
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:49,470
you conscripted you can put in there if
your gonna do the same for missions over

228
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,050
and over you could write a script and

229
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:55,390
sentido folder variable and of it goes
on all

230
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:59,020
permission that folder for or you can
write a function in past of

231
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,700
I I have bought two functions included
in my

232
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,570
I might get something in here that
actually take some removes father

233
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,899
permission to use USB

234
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:12,040
on AR i computer so all

235
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,959
I had to do a person DOD project at work
I

236
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:19,510
but really basically use this you have
to spend some time the MSDN

237
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,260
documentation

238
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:24,070
I don't know how many you really like
MSDN documentation I don't

239
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:29,120
oh yeah yeah anti-arafat wolf likes it
too

240
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,600

00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:47,180
I there is a

244
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,410
there are some help though and a
gentlemen

245
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:55,060
removing the Andre are from Mike shot
made a on Isola PowerShell module

246
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,370
to our to help out with this

247
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,730
so I'm sorry well user how those

248
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,940
actually goes for some

249
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:11,199
or

250
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:18,199
good thing there's nothin

251
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:24,110
this is that NTFS security Montrose from
here so repack triple scripts you can

252
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:24,890
download them

253
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,560
I'm just important so I can add the
commands and my partial prop

254
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,490
you can add that line in the scripts to
get the functionality of the modules

255
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:36,570
there's problem out there are

256
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:43,570
II so

257
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,459
you sir

258
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:51,190
you sir I I really show you guys this

259
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:55,579
we r this this year's the pipeline but
it's a whole lot easier

260
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,790
gonna get backup folder I'm gonna add a

261
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:02,610
arm access control and Hereford a
madman's accessory for control

262
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:06,310
at a whole lot easier right to me and
this is free this is a wonderful thing

263
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,060
to use

264
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,420
so I am I don't work that it was pretty
cool

265
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:16,570
keep I

266
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:20,070
so the next thing that we're going to do
is

267
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:23,420
amok monitor file system changes

268
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,820
and I know that some people have a at

269
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,449
automated tools do that but I don't I

270
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:35,000
not where I work I'm not before I needed
to monitor file car

271
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,209
make sure that up mock certain filed in
popup are you monitor something exchange

272
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:40,510
like you can monitor the

273
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:43,529
drivers folder at sea drivers folder

274
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:49,540
on to on the computer to see if the host
files changed so there's a lot of things

275
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,480
you can do with us

276
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,970
the this nor hear about the PowerShell
session no

277
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:59,620
hour at a loss aggression here for a
second every time a lot of PowerShell

278
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,550
window it new powers of fashion so
anything you do in one

279
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:08,220
will not transfer to the other unless it
does make system changes so if it

280
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:13,290
changes permissions and its gonna state
but if it I is loading a module

281
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,949
or doing something like this code
example it's not gonna stay

282
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:19,959
its gonna go away unless you make a
persistent some other way

283
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:23,309
this the demo

284
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:27,370
it can write email right to host logfile
longer bans

285
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:31,490
your Tom the different other stuff that
you can anything you want to do this and

286
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:31,850
this

287
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:38,850
information to you can

288
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,820
are

289
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:54,820
so actually

290
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,490
iight first I'm certain variables in
Belmont but

291
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:05,380
this is where it gets kinda call
Microsoft and PowerShell loves dotnet

292
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,220
are to enjoyment of me but

293
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:13,540
to other people are there's issues
especially if you're straight dotnet

294
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,190
developer

295
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:18,490
gonna basically what this is

296
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,930
is loading the that class

297
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:27,790
filesystem washer certain this variable
one other primers on the period have to

298
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,620
the file path we set up earlier

299
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,020
this is going to include all
subdirectories on their

300
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,090
and enable raising about so any

301
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:41,240
time that something has changed this is
sending a teacher to actually allow the

302
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,840
system

303
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,210
us this liner here lecturing us at

304
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:50,670
on any created event we're gonna write
to the actual host to the screen

305
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:55,440
that something was created this next one

306
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,820
changed third one deleted

307
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:04,510
on the fourth one is renamed so

308
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:08,370
first we're gonna create a file I

309
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:13,170
monitor the staff taxed you see right
here says that its

310
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,500
actually been created so if you wanna
some email that the file was created

311
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,440
files created you cut you wanna laga
mein entry that

312
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,070
the file was created in this directory
so that man you can audit your about

313
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:23,810
locks or

314
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:27,270
you are you wanna tweet out that there
is a file occurred

315
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:32,600
you to act here gonna add the word
content one

316
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,170
so that file and save it

317
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:40,310
that's gonna note that

318
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:45,379
it was changed

319
00:19:45,379 --> 00:19:48,679
I'm here's the content actual content so
get content

320
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:55,129
miss like type financial account rename
the file

321
00:19:55,129 --> 00:19:58,289
there's the Rename so basically what
this is

322
00:19:58,289 --> 00:20:02,429
shown you that you know you can
basically monitor your system you can

323
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:05,909
monitor change you can do a lot of stuff
like this on it %um a fully automated

324
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:09,159
so that you can hand it off to people
who I am doing a

325
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:14,100
you know this careless watch Rachel
change and these are just on registering

326
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:19,350
to make sure that I don't do anything
weird for

327
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:23,539
yet

328
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:28,179
alright and let's move on the user's I

329
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:32,409
there's a lot of in command scripts
functions I creating users you can look

330
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:33,409
that up on the Internet

331
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:38,590
or Mar you and everyone also but we'll
see what information we can gather

332
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:43,629
she was gonna I here's a script that
actually goes through and

333
00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:48,769
but you all below our local users on the
system so you can go right click and

334
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:54,269
whatever but this actually is if you are
change the computer to the name on the

335
00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:56,029
computer I'll show you any uva

336
00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:59,669
other computer name are the computer you
say

337
00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:03,080
what users are on there and

338
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,080
group the same way have basically just
changed

339
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:12,169
but I remember mation you select ever
gets a little weird them

340
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:15,789
lot of stuff I you'll see a lot this is
to get

341
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:20,610
administrators to a computer and this is
a function and you can paste this into

342
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:25,249
a herschel prompt and use this over and
over so I can say get local

343
00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:26,159
administrators

344
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,269
space bob's or bottle 1

345
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:33,659
and I'll get bob's other admin time bob
box

346
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,850
so here all I'm doing is to give an
example of things that you can do you

347
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:37,169
can

348
00:21:37,169 --> 00:21:40,840
take import and then act upon it using
like W my

349
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,110
and then there are some %ah reg X down
there for

350
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:49,289
Yuvraj ex-lovers don't like Richard or
services

351
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:52,960
arm I one of the biggest pains I see

352
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,460
on a lot of the time is that the service
account is not running under

353
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,769
is running or something I didn't know
are you find a machine a lawyer who

354
00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:05,220
install that my wife sequel server
running under you know this person

355
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:09,500
user the Select you are at this confirms
service accounts script that's on my own

356
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,090
get how

357
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:15,159
will let you check what

358
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:19,610
service accounts in here and basically
this script will go through and do that

359
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:23,379
what I'm shown here is this is this is

360
00:22:23,379 --> 00:22:27,129
the Central Powers are here I'm getting
there list a computer names

361
00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:31,450
I'm piping it to confirm service
accounts and then all I wanna system

362
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:31,899
name

363
00:22:31,899 --> 00:22:35,350
for computer name this plane in the
service and on the service is running

364
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:35,710
other

365
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:40,690
that is basic power this is muscle while
love it cuz I can take this from

366
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:44,730
30 seconds on on audit when any daughter

367
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,909
yes

368
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:51,100
and assume I get have thing that you can
download I

369
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,070
this ray here's the core part is that
you don't have to just text file

370
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:58,850
so if you have the actor-director
command was floated you can say

371
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:02,820
yet all the computers in this are you
and then confirm the service cuts

372
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,119
yet are you can actually right there man

373
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:09,090
and get all the service counts so
there's a lot of things you can do but

374
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,179
this is a central power

375
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:13,369
bustles why oh why I love it because
it's just

376
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:16,529
it's easy to use yeah

377
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:23,529
sup

378
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:34,250
exactly

379
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,100
yes

380
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,230
you some stuff like this you can are
your computer for more famous

381
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:42,720
you can go and are there one other
scripts I use to ron was

382
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,350
I would actually do this again
server-side run these late check service

383
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,300
names check

384
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,360
get admin stuff again email myself once
a week

385
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,240
to see just to make sure that everything
was wasn't was so hunky-dory

386
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,970
especially on systems that are kinda
expose

387
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:04,100
special internet price sir you could

388
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,800
and you could say after select you could
save it to a file

389
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,000
I am do it that way or you can right to
a database

390
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,770
there stunned the things you can do this
doesn't have to stop it start name this

391
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:18,090
you can keep on going you can do
everyone with a

392
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:22,230
so it's it's pretty cool sets

393
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:27,570
I there is a from a mine does of
forensics and we needed this said

394
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:31,580
are overuse around the domain this is
really easy way to get

395
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:36,300
sets their function I get account that I
will actually get you the said

396
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:40,020
you type in the domain name in the user
get Jenny said

397
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:44,050
and you don't have to be admin to run
this actually kinda shocking to find out

398
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:44,420
that I

399
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:48,600
you know that about tracking users

400
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,190
this one are friend Ryan wanted this

401
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:56,130
this actually will take and scan the
security log

402
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:59,700
for login and logout that's all those
are when ideas over there

403
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,770
and time ID in creative soul give you
any user

404
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:07,510
that logs into the computer on that time
that

405
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:13,010
sense that day I'll tell you anyone
whose argument so

406
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:16,500
where we go into gets a little more

407
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,550
complicated but I'm basically doing
that's that

408
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:23,960
teaming up there and I'm

409
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,170
right next to a computer so this is
basically

410
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:31,580
I'm doing the hash table appear this is

411
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:37,270
are hash table up there is what I'm
passing down here so get when event

412
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:40,820
hash table has all those things in there
so I can go get sick

413
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:45,540
computers I can tell you who logged in
on what's of you

414
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:49,640
basically something against a list of
all your computers and environment you

415
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,500
could track

416
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,990
where everyone logjam for our sense a
certain time

417
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:58,370
and get Pam Indian created you can add
the user name but

418
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:02,600
that at will take forever to run by you
can at least see if they're fact

419
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:07,100
activity wanna find out some other
profound PC

420
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,180
release we're gonna do user profile
we're gonna select

421
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:14,530
said last year's time in local path and
you can find out see

422
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:17,840
of something larger PC this is one of
the things that I've

423
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,470
wrapped into a function that I share
work as our aidid's

424
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:25,330
the song to log on to the computer I can
find out target that

425
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:28,430
I

426
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:32,430
are let's do a little system.out.print
are I think Oh spouse

427
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:37,240
you know I its some you have to do it
sometimes

428
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,160
least in my experience and I don't
exactly ever like doing I gotta remember

429
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,940
to go

430
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,860
may try madman make sure it's now
read-only stuff like that

431
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:49,110
are I made a module that has a

432
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:52,610
the some holes found ministration but
you have to run it as

433
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:55,920
happened so fast I know the summer

434
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:02,330
saw

435
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:05,880
so host file module arm I'm just
importing it

436
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,020
so that I can use a and the

437
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:13,050
first command that I have I have an air
show how so show any line that actually

438
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,350
has IP address

439
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:18,110
and host name on there even if is
commented out so sometimes

440
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:21,940
are I do that sometimes common outlines
just to make sure but

441
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:26,500
for auditing thus far for wonderful here
as a

442
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:31,610
well secret sir idea

443
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:34,850
but you know at a local number don't
worry I think if the actual

444
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:39,870
I you have the its command what

445
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:43,340
on that I made with some primers of
secret server

446
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:47,930
their summer after a run at host file
entry

447
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:51,140
now it's inside the host file so you can

448
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:54,880
add or take away host file entries am

449
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,090
we don't want well secret server to be
everywhere so let's remove

450
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:01,450
entry welcome say that it's back to
normal

451
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:04,630
so this is one other issue tool that you
can do

452
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:09,520
to make sure that fewer you

453
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:16,350
can new here some firewall fun

454
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:20,870
missus are this is version 3 his
commandments are specific to this

455
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:25,670
this might stop some up I will stop that
stuff if you can block

456
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:30,290
actors from block ports and stuff like
that are are subtitulada fire rock metal

457
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,100
so when does a

458
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:35,010
so there's lbs 12 13 14 commandments

459
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:39,430
where before you had to use an API you
had construct this big long

460
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:43,300
complicated thing now it's real simple
to add rules

461
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:48,280
my hair there's an app firewall we're
gonna allow all telmap

462
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,270
for inbound here's the telnet server
remote addresses

463
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:56,050
anything I'm a local subnet we're gonna
allow that simple

464
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:59,290
and straightforward here wear to school

465
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:03,180
this is Black Album telnet

466
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,300
telnet server but here's what's really
cool

467
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:10,880
is the policy store so from your
workstation if you're an admin intimate

468
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,150
running as a domain admin

469
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:16,240
and you want to add this rule to the
Group Policy Objects a goes out

470
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,610
yet policy store domain name in the GPO
name

471
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:24,000
and of it goes ago favorite anti the GPL
so you can deploy

472
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,550
usually so top from a really cool my
spine

473
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:31,280
arm even cooler

474
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:37,120
is a a you normally so if you have
multiple computers are your admin and

475
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:37,450
your

476
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:40,880
trying to get some stuff done you don't
you're not using Group Policy

477
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,080
my usually general use this in a DMZ

478
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,930
of fashion so sim session is basically
our

479
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:52,050
remote connection to compare kinda like
SSH for Windows

480
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:56,620
is the it is encrypted and can't release
net for the stuff of the wire the

481
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,130
credentials or anything like that

482
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,410
pecan no you prick or but our

483
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:05,460
and all the tests and everything a much
tougher awesome and pastors and actually

484
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,820
test to see if you can actually see it
and i couldnt which school

485
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:13,150
basically I can then automate

486
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:16,450
are at additions are

487
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:21,170
are also like I create a whole buncha
sessions like computer 1234

488
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:24,290
and a preacher those I can go and/or

489
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:28,730
are remove the allow tell narrow so this
is one of the core things about

490
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:34,430
are so that in person so I know I'm

problem too

527
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,320
because some people just paste text up
in there and it doesn't format right or

528
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,640
somewhat placed on like to put caps on
their code I generally take scripts

529
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,400
allow the time and clean them up

530
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,900
like I i actually physically do that are
my

531

mental issues I guess by the cuz I like
tabs I like and I'm so I like

532
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:28,630
certain things the way it look a certain
way not a developer I like to play one

533
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,400
but I'd

534
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,600
I'm not one but I still like it nice and
pretty code so

535
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,669
not really but at are some other

536
00:33:35,669 --> 00:33:38,669

so it's if let's get a lot easier for
someone to use

557
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:31,440
I read an article the other day that if
an auction on take about 10 minutes to

up to 90

562
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,590
sorry

563
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:04,530
but I know why you're askin so on now

564
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:08,160
but there there are a lot of stuff to
help there are a lot of all

565
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,800
there's hi guy at f5 who made a

566
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,540
reply Cup Series a post on me that
conversion

567
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,970
like md5 that to all this now bill them
here I he provides a

568
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:24,440
md5 scrap there's one MPs the act so
there are people who are like okay

569
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,380
I'm coming from a UNIX background here's
where I need to go

570
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,550
and I there there are web site other to
help you do that

571
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:38,550
so besides that

572
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:54,280
it

573
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,859
it like learning any other new language
there are there are gotchas

574
00:36:57,859 --> 00:37:02,460
by are yeah

575
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:06,130
you a less than equal to arm

576
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:09,560
greater than its I'm dash GE are

577
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,820
greater than or equal dash anarchy is
not

578
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:16,140
on dash EQ is equal so there are some

579
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:19,700
it it we're but when say

580
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,329
the first time you picked up a
powershell script you look to something

581
00:37:22,329 --> 00:37:23,250
and it was a

582
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:26,740
if statement its actually a lot easier
to look at that

583
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:30,010
them now are something else

584
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:33,210
saw you can actually say if this

585
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:38,210
is not this than so if there's actually
it's a little

586
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:41,720
easier to read but it is a little
confusing cuz when you go put like a

587
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,109
less on their doesn't work

588
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:46,460
like otherwise it redirected to a file
name me now

589
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:51,730
test you know for your life like that
there was lives for stay with PowerShell

590
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:53,099
way back in the mail

591
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:56,869
a hundred thousand test 1234 so

592
00:37:56,869 --> 00:37:57,589
something
