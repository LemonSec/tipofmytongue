1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,330
this is punch on the country

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,649
we flip the White Rabbit together on
yearly

3
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:11,769
my name is will think

4
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:15,969
I am the systems manager and security
manager for financial services

5
00:00:15,969 --> 00:00:21,880
and I did you have occasion to get the
right code occasionally

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,119
both systems sometimes even get
generally those discussions are some

7
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:27,699
like this

8
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:33,020
we're a gala to some is usually I'm
doing more the management the risk

9
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:40,020
management that this 1i think myself but
I think this is

10
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:43,230
this ten-minute you make a lot of
assumptions

11
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,399
name wall have a beer I wanna free up in
clear up some assumptions right away

12
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,920
head of role that at the gate everything
you're gonna see here

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,070
is I'm been developed with people more
I'm

14
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,309
down I have course all the Dover are
along

15
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:05,309
Scott Adams are only here today how you
guys a story before we can tell the

16
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,580
story go to the backstory right gotta
know the backstory

17
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,150
that's always so let's talk way way back

18
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,150
when long long time ago when mankind
were in caves

19
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:21,759
we always want to send messages right to
communicate elaborate corny

20
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,119
boys needed the some messages phyllis
was not very efficient

21
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,700
and thankfully communication theory the
start developing better ways to talk

22
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,369
about how we

23
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:33,780
nations first innovation was a to be
right

24
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,759
a send a message to be e2b knows good

25
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,270
was great for star I was much much
better and Ryan but also pretty boring

26
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,930
thankfully in 1978 there is an

27
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,170
innovation radical innovation and how we
communicate

28
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:54,009
thanks to these gentlemen reversed
shamir Natoma better known as our site

29
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:56,810
and their innovation it wasn't

30
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,380
mutual he exchanged emails kinda cool

31
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:05,740
that's to map here and was it something
that you could buy

32
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,369
and smash you want to get a dual
security feature

33
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:13,629
knows even something more fundamental
than that some hack something

34
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:16,750
sodium see Rs a broad us

35
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:21,790
Allison much better than saying

36
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,260
a to be else wants I like that much
better

37
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,340
out because but still we wondered who is
else who is Bob how do they know each

38
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,269
other with the backstory this created

39
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:36,280
untold controversy is people argue back
and forth roused by

40
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,560
fair I what was he was wrong

41
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,879
et cetera if nothing else geyser nothing
else

42
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,190
talk check out xkcd you stay can

43
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:51,450
house bob you classic yes so we still
wanna who was

44
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,489
else about the world have to wait a long
time or the 10 years 11 years as a

45
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:57,040
matter fact

46
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,400
the next major innovation I'm are with
our neck

47
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,200
major innovation from Scott Adams who of
course in 1989

48
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,950
launch the Dover and fine

49
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:14,750
we could else wants to talk

50
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,019
and they're not having here

51
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:22,099
so now we have

52
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:26,620
house yes indeed

53
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,430
this is so

54
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,120
this is the story about some I'm gonna
tell the story and parts

55
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:40,030
and cuz Alice wants to talk to Bob but
of course they're secure

56
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,030
ask yourself WWMT right you guys have
the the braces Mb

57
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,599
those you don't spend as much time over

58
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,989
you may not know moorlach preventer

59
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:54,670
information services who famously in
town security is more important and

60
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,480
usability

61
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,930
so we must ask what would more tact do

62
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:05,170
the course mark stop just fun

63
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:08,840
sir Roy have a cast

64
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,950
else wants to stop ok bob mock more dick
wants to stop them

65
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,359
I'm gonna walk if you can round hunting
counter-punch with house

66
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:19,579
yourself in work I'm gonna give a
demonstration them

67
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:24,790
applicable code some notes hack not
lessons are in e-learning

68
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:28,840
design your own guys I'm going to use in
it is gonna go fast

69
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,520
talk fast as well as demos are fast so
feel for him

70
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,900
were me on twitter for you

71
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:42,900
control

72
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,080
so it just gets worse yes I wrote some
code to demonstrate

73
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:56,810
so if you guys all lil bit lame but

74
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:03,810
I hope you'll bear with me surround one
right else wants the park work so we

75
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:12,680
have is a simple financial services
terminal server

76
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,480
right for users out morning large and

77
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:24,130
the number one for users

78
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:28,330
al bobbin log when the server

79
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,610
number one count we have covert channels
is because

80
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,940
every time we have a legitimate
communication channel win friends have

81
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,000
the possibility

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,370
the very real existence a covert so here
we got shared folder

83
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,600
which is meant for legitimate business
use

84
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,610
people for speaking out after lunch but
right

85
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,940
anytime we have the ability

86
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,570
have we have misuse and access control

87
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:00,860
first set up a network house

88
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,230
talkback whatever they want and

89
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:11,230
a course

90
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,550
course more I can see those files you
can see it their taxes got

91
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,840
rights this is the house changes a good
admin goes

92
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,910
right now you're probably years which is

93
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:30,760
are we gotta get a better

94
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,639
that's not good clear tax wall show me
so the next morning do here's a run it's

95
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:35,930
with

96
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,440
think from here on out every single time
around around gonna be

97
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,389
a yes on she's gonna log n

98
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:47,490
and use simple encryption a

99
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,620
out but just 32 characters

100
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:57,470
you wanna use as your area went to the
found once you typed

101
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,080
unit code is going to be cooked yes sex
gonna be in bed

102
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,660
I'm gonna be in bed into attack

103
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,490
basic for boom

104
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:12,800
now Bob goin' run the same and to the
same after

105
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,510
force they asses matter same passphrase

106
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:21,760
ok for them I one thing out

107
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:27,280
she's pretty smart read them and we
gotta read she's using secure Springs

108
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:34,280
secure spring memory you look it up
magical

109
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:40,930
rainbow and so you can grab out smart

110
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:46,380
still looking me notices history right
now get some restraint

111
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,380
so

112
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,570
work new number prime force the crypto

113
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:58,060
world we refuse to do it somehow

114
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,789
slow them right I mean the the
all-purpose have any good

115
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:06,449
slowdown just screw

116
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:10,699
a massive now so we can mix up

117
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:13,740
there's any coding of Pfizer

118
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:20,740
by missing course code so

119
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:32,830
which is saying that out wanna

120
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:37,060
it's fun Oregon

121
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:42,310
to text files are good but in terms of
being a covert channel

122
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:46,110
defensive you can see that it's not very
covert

123
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:49,150
is again see it right so that's take

124
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52,420
up actually use the of the one thing
that

125
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:56,650
can be messed ninety a fast as active a
primary yes

126
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:00,210
world up we'll see but there is the
underlying real

127
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,890
much from you get the primary story and
you got

128
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,350
the of data streams each file can have
as many of them

129
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,500
here gonna do the same thing passphrase

130
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,330
file which is good I'm gonna cat spring

131
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:18,890
one for bob one house with this jet
streams ours actually

132
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:24,400
of hearts the filesystem cannot be seen
can peer into action that nap

133
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,939
art but I can't be seen with explore

134
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,430
BC man from by default

135
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:36,650
pretty pretty over should check back and

136
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:40,450
can see mitzi

137
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:47,450
hey wait a minute I know that house
Marcus Group

138
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:56,700
yes because that happens again on the
primary screen

139
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,220
of instrument back or back their chat

140
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,310
I one way

141
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:07,860
morning delve into this using process

142
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:13,350
process minor free from Mike marxist oh
I think I should say is this is a demo

143
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,600
much

144
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,710
of re cup or trial

145
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:22,620
up process on a free tool process my
show you other

146
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,860
read right fiercest says for

147
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,970
else well at sorry

148
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,350
go ahead into the directory doesn't see
if they're

149
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,570
still doesn't see a is actually for
slash

150
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,590
are which is the man man on its jumpin

151
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:45,160
powers only man showed by default there

152
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,820
very much nicest reno's

153
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:53,140
going one way we can up our game house
bob is inserted using something

154
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,350
obvious like else says bob says used
words

155
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:01,090
I like with over perspective usually
administrator sees a globally unique

156
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:06,970
ago Windows Mac which is great you want
them

157
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:13,970
the back saw will use a good but you
know at this point morning or something

158
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,070
markets 1 system security apart awesome
in dotnet

159
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:24,880
scripting very very you see that's
awesome here's the code

160
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,700
you guys aren't which job partner of
services

161
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,850
by the phone right ETS

162
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:35,880
without with that now is done box except
go into

163
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,110
yeah things a lot of people overlook

164
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:43,480
you can access higher when the third
utilizing

165
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:49,610
drop services and importing sprint
allows us to do it yes

166
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,760
oz actually do some March things

167
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,970
see not for attack IVC

168
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:00,520
hiding arouses suspicion got a base64
value

169
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,720
a good administrator go away without

170
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:10,260
andropov and terms the fence is all
comes down to periodically scanning

171
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,380
anyone in this room check there when the
servers recent

172
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:19,110
see yes now we don't think looking for
stuff right I look

173
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:26,110
things we know anything in there never
doctor nice you walk into the room

174
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:33,120
ourselves round one round two I know

175
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,360
see 20 route

176
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:45,360
are more like like so many in this room

177
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:49,950
like some self Star Wars maybe not as
much as common but he really likes

178
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:53,020
unlike most people in this room right
property

179
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:57,960
mellow reload pretty humble morning not
got a good so

180
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,760
round two morning strikes back what
we're gonna do with morning intercepts

181
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,570
and information

182
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:07,460
memory never gonna mass with yeah
foreign thing to know

183
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:12,200
is this really is a fight now Bob
sometimes out I'm sorry house

184
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,440
sometimes morning they're going back and
forth in this particular episode

185
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,550
morning so

186
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,650
we are using a tool for Louisville
because

187
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:30,880
imager with grab sample memory analyzer

188
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,350
this isn't you know in terms of
recording is done with this product

189
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,710
me about data recorder sec because

190
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:42,350
every so thankful will be sitting here
watching

191
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:46,040
really but up the key thing about crypto

192
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,320
no one brute force is gripped I mean say

193
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,180
you got a bunch are but no one in this
room or

194
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,360
right this is no way it works what you
gonna do

195
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:02,910
you're gonna steal the passphrase on a
memory or you're trying to information

196
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,610
when for someone to do is look for that
aspirin

197
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:10,580
processes systems to restrict not in
here house

198
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:14,690
wait a minute yes yes

199
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:20,950
there's the past but the max of
documentation told me 1pm memory

200
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:24,610
the third why's that the reason why that
is

201
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:28,350
were using W yeah these ABS

202
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:33,030
and WPF week's top all over the memory
like crazy even if you using secure code

203
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:36,370
of still and remember

204
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,640
housemate cat socks you know I don't
want music

205
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,030
awake so will that more like Barack

206
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:46,080
now spock i'ma show you something

207
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:51,460
the first time I realize this were
considering right chilled

208
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:56,110
goes here we've got house bob their from
a server this is a hyper-v instant

209
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:01,710
earlier and morning has access to

210
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,770
you can save a VM the same thing save
your workstation dumped everything

211
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:05,560
America

212
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,180
this part is not sped up I want to watch
back

213
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,320
who's gonna save it is gonna resume

214
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,700
you save it flushes all memory to death

215
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,960
now resumes now backup knows that

216
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,390
server never close just pause for a
moment and then pick back up

217
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:28,410
send so imagine a web server

218
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:35,410
i met your database all these instance
house gone unnoticed some imposter

219
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,300
I want you gotta happy that memory

220
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:43,230
and start look first thing we have to do
we've got a pause

221
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:48,440
is actually extracted to adopt for were
doing there

222
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:54,140
all

223
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,500
so what we do to rehydrate is use this
command here

224
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,930
guys can see it the tools called beyond
to

225
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:05,790
lovely name

226
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:10,800
320 Bell Mike sup bike once we get in
the VM to BMP format

227
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,040
we can look at it with something about
very about

228
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,610
fans yeah

229
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:21,060
awesome fill you don't count

230
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,720
and ask you no no you can't you're
awesome

231
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,010
so what about 30 who is check in now

232
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:34,220
whole other don't files right so we're
gonna do four things

233
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,690
so sorry we're going to pull out the
actor processes

234
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:41,050
memory for tires system certain

235
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:44,580
exes product the process if we want to
reverse the code

236
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:50,110
are also gonna fall the specific process
member was important because you don't

237
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:55,010
crypto you tack we saw are you getting

238
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:59,260
if the app is displaying it's our
development

239
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,990
whose volatility scroll through and all
of this

240
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:07,100
information out once that's done all we
have to do is use

241
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,140
like strings the morning jump on

242
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,860
more Springs work house himself for

243
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,320
mark

244
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,230
what appears ok

245
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,840
and points at the process ID

246
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,970
1996 with happen to be that of this from
jack

247
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:29,500
and boom there comes a cat their cat
misses

248
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:36,500
fourth displayed yeah

249
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,900
so it's the only key still on the
messaging their tax

250
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,250
we can now look at what but Sun

251
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:52,240
guide his one thing we can do

252
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:58,360
is use its cool calls arms are snoop
soup again it's free it's a pink coat

253
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:58,840
black

254
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,980
think they realize with W yeah just like
Windows Forms outs right this is off

255
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,320
boss

256
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,950
for communicating with your you I'll so
using

257
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:12,290
who likes you you can snoop to or look
into

258
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:19,190
active running yeah and you can see

259
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:23,340
there you can see every you see a but
you can change

260
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,730
you can insert message so maybe morning
wanna

261
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,780
talk for bob more

262
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:34,690
every everything is right there

263
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:38,660
so some notes for

264
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:43,010
acker obviously stuff is available
memory even stuff you don't because

265
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:46,940
and the key thing which i think is
pretty funny stuff

266
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:50,059
hampering very very lights

267
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:56,179
defensive side there's a lot of security
features within that net likes

268
00:18:56,179 --> 00:18:59,510
your strength which is great and every
the documentation good

269
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:02,870
this is great you sit down with us a
good

270
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:09,160
my sack at a coffee shop what nothing to
happen to me

271
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,160
but I could happen because a its

272
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,470
needs to be trusted whatever's Kors a
bonus no

273
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:21,540
for anyone considering about service ask
so

274
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:25,000
who owns I provide access

275
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,510
that member and whoever roles

276
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:32,590
both legal or administrative to prevent
them from dumping that

277
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:38,220
memory or round re

278
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:43,929
ok back vermont

279
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:47,860
so round three

280
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:53,480
to the low caps so

281
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,419
got an issue without seeking you bring
to the data stream course because

282
00:19:56,419 --> 00:19:59,070
morning expose

283
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:02,480
that's we're going to use stake
specifically

284
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,980
a pitcher or as you guys probably know

285
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,240
bitmap 24-bit right Rd

286
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,429
three bites so if you take massive

287
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:16,550
one bit at a time righted

288
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,740
into pixels from to

289
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,270
300 pixel for %ah Twitter size message

290
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:27,210
which can read it right file and you can
do it so in such a way that doesnt

291
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,340
visually

292
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:32,790
chain ob you can do so in a way that

293
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:38,270
doesn't file size: because wrongly
massive and you can also do some

294
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:45,270
everything use the some created here we
got out

295
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:49,970
she wrote her message now

296
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:53,880
will go and again

297
00:20:53,880 --> 00:21:00,880
house

298
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,760
0 in the butt of that so one other ways

299
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,980
people figure out this thing is looking
at certain arts

300
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,510
to figure out there actually was if I'll

301
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:14,990
so we can stick renowned arbiter

302
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:18,950
stick anywhere in the files on X

303
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:23,500
morning do so using process

304
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:29,110
monitors sees got re right and you can
jump

305
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:32,440
the file and take a look at it the Seas

306
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:37,450
women the dates have changed rhetoric
years that doesn't make much sense

307
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:43,700
so what's going on knows the course

308
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,570
for real right he's going to use
something called PowerShell

309
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:51,660
comics SCX I get that right yes yes

310
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,900
not gone much in power on this got a
great cock are so

311
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,990
Mac up we're going to use

312
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:01,970
have to get it right with md5 hash

313
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:07,550
because no small changes in pockets big
changes run mb5

314
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:14,550
now us whether morning sure enough the
next time warner runs chain

315
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:19,460
that only tells us the file change

316
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:24,840
doesn't else to change why the change
what the so for that we can use it we're

317
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,310
going down

318
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:28,890
and going to the audit settings we can

319
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:34,170
on it for the specific people in this
example water so look at everyone what

320
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:34,710
are they doing

321
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:39,070
successes are going to do one more
setting that is

322
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:45,510
in the local security policy the
mean-spirited and tell

323
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:50,800
windows where those audit go rent just
as failures

324
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,020
log next time house goes

325
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,210
that a bubble up

326
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:03,370
system and be present 30 now we can see

327
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:10,370
was Dallas with library no slow house
was clearly

328
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:19,660
modifying right right so

329
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,990
how did she do that how did that work
one week

330
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:27,810
you figure out what that using are doing
as use a tool called

331
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:30,920
that got is also free

332
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:35,140
and allowed drill and the source
expanded and

333
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:39,380
I'll and see exactly what here we see
where

334
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:42,550
fine writings

335
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:49,550
going and going

336
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,040
said themselves so

337
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:58,690
attack not staying especially
significant bit wanted it very very

338
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:02,100
very very and source code

339
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,260
if you're in a hostile environment your
source code is open for anyone to look

340
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:11,750
because the way from a defensive
perspective

341
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:16,900
hearted really what we need to do as we
need always be logged your security

342
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:20,870
right prevention is ideal tax is a must
can assert

343
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:25,240
prevent allies communications because
they're or legitimate businesses

344
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:32,240
we should be acting using Arctic just
got around for

345
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:39,250
for our right houses of

346
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:45,690
there's a thing about neck

347
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,820
on a memory map file for those are you
classically trained

348
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,850
upside not more grab

349
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:55,190
a finer to remember and start reading
writing

350
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:59,150
memories was a asking

351
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:02,480
do set this up now

352
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,070
we just red wrote our message there
unico thats very

353
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:10,540
so long of course were also use that
same

354
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:14,370
least significant you think

355
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:18,420
there's no bitmap resort using rather
than actual using

356
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,420
assign fights from

357
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,430
from file randomly re light sweet crude
all

358
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:27,800
bites one by every bit message and then

359
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,560
that are massive and about about

360
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:36,730
going at this camp throwbacks

361
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:39,940
good acted by

362
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:44,990
us not good not gonna show up

363
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:49,810
auger otherwise pretty good way

364
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:56,650
to avoid and if you look

365
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:02,650
again drugs and some system

366
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:06,170
so-called win or BJ when I V J

367
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:10,720
show you all your that are open right
are you

368
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,680
now you know some front that we use

369
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,560
with for new tech image

370
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,890
with awesome because this here ministers
you can see why

371
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:26,530
as with all over the place here's the
base named object and before

372
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:31,970
don't see with back with us like you see
the point is that

373
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:35,070
ones in everything now ChanServ

374
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:39,030
Minister Singh like dump

375
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:45,380
memory we can take a look at that use
again

376
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,480
take a snap

377
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,480
remember prague

378
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:57,320
and then we will Evan

379
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:04,000
and I was search with research for

380
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,310
look at it memory see again it's

381
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:15,060
is you can also see all the random

382
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:19,090
all the random bites down

383
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:23,350
around 400 random

384
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:28,930
point I'm work you know

385
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:34,750
source code district before I know it so
one thing about that night is

386
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:39,810
courses source first obfuscate source

387
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:46,810
using called battle for dotnet this is
free on trial basis 90-day free from you

388
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:50,470
can create a powerful solution with lots
affects people's

389
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:55,040
or you can simply just battle one or

390
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,410
babylon with wants you

391
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:02,540
once you like you can set

392
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:06,860
different such as which one spring how
many passes ago

393
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,950
I'm what other sort about the station
one

394
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:13,150
boy see iraq soaring or

395
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,700
overhead run it over the next few

396
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,690
and that's gonna change all the fun name

397
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:25,000
whiners and the strength monaco's an

398
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,520
that member last time around right front

399
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,970
steganography don't look year

400
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:38,570
jungle things like that now only
expanded to see we've got

401
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,660
weird I'm red

402
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:46,220
but there are just basic by we compiled
the main

403
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:51,750
look and see that not only

404
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:55,490
other methods stuff but also all the
strings exhort

405
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:59,580
about header

406
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,670
which is good makes it very hard to view
that source

407
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:09,670
a slowdown more which is even more
important and advises

408
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:13,590
so in terms of attack at least
significant bit is usually only five

409
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,890
images in stock

410
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:18,650
you can use it anywhere in person have
the first you want the best but

411
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:21,760
creating a whole bunch ran very useful

412
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,140
overtown item noise

413
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,580
first memories very very is the needle
in the haystack

414
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,650
Prince right we want have good

415
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:35,770
haystack if you have a covert channel
thats

416
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,860
labeled I'm you taxes hours talking
about

417
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:42,350
and your messages unico

418
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:45,570
their tax you know you basically have a
needle in the haystack

419
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:48,910
look something like this:

420
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:53,290
even even the slowest was a minister
will eventually figure out with him

421
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:57,940
something wrong with this picture and I
tried

422
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:03,250
up so you really want something like
this

423
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:07,090
Mozza little you can make your own

424
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:10,460
using on and this is actually the

425
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:14,450
upset the signal to noise we talk about
was too much noise you're gonna miss a

426
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,290
single

427
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:19,120
were being over we actually won lots
lots

428
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,310
lot Singh sure that we're getting

429
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:28,950
you can do that Isaac

430
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:32,440
I'm defensive side if you're in a
hostile environment after go

431
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,920
and if you think your son or a talk
about it stock

432
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,920
security is essentially slowing down
hacker do whatever it takes to slow him

433
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,350
down

434
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:43,870
never going to prevent morning again
eventually

435
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:50,870
out vice versa at by sometime

436
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:57,610
skits just around five

437
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:01,800
more texting us it's on a memory can't
see

438
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,590
can't log camper van his friend

439
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:08,950
fights source more is good

440
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:14,040
amor prod doing you're using

441
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:19,200
Walker production as my so we

442
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,850
we've got a dime of orchard we're gonna
enable ap locker

443
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:28,260
them by

444
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:31,550
rules or throws you

445
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:35,950
gonna hashes where faulkner works is
that

446
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:39,440
when you go to axe you code as through
the UI

447
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,160
the council when the third area

448
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,870
which hash using service

449
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:51,050
perhaps listed run code not bubble

450
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:54,260
as rules

451
00:31:54,260 --> 00:32:01,260
even able once this is done

452
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,690
no be very good prevent

453
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:09,410
role house running anything morning
allows for someone

454
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:16,410
thanks

455
00:32:17,499 --> 00:32:21,659
not ones going all

456
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:25,469
she's not several different ways

457
00:32:25,469 --> 00:32:29,289
first over there

458
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:36,289
out those Ron memory map out again just
from

459
00:32:37,149 --> 00:32:40,299
I remember this from 2003

460
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:43,429
double directly

461
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:49,819
to see Ross so what is a couple cool
thanks you

462
00:32:49,819 --> 00:32:54,239
use powers right knee turn shellcode

463
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:57,409
executed really I'm house morals

464
00:32:57,409 --> 00:33:01,419
goal some she's going to use an app that
does work

465
00:33:01,419 --> 00:33:06,419
Mike work so on word

466
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:09,969
saver file summer

467
00:33:09,969 --> 00:33:13,229
so us

468
00:33:13,229 --> 00:33:20,229
Melissa

469
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:26,309
now we're gonna go and we're gonna naval
developer

470
00:33:26,309 --> 00:33:31,740
ribbon for security purposes ever go

471
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,880
enable now was right macro

472
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:41,880
cool load a macro

473
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:47,580
houses Richard

474
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:54,580
vandenberg based research users with
macro

475
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:58,570
works is actually makes usable Walker

476
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:02,730
work trust them past by the security

477
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:07,940
trust so would just simply

478
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:12,960
Ron on that and now

479
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,399
back that is bypassing

480
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:23,399
locker

481
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,980
and I like that that's all full
nostalgic good miss Melissa

482
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:31,909
days work or something of talked about
her work

483
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:38,589
obscured Robert some Tamarack I thank
you guys for your page so you're at work

484
00:34:38,589 --> 00:34:42,060
macros basically the whole years if you
try something

485
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:46,089
you trusted tell to try something else
and there's always a way around

486
00:34:46,089 --> 00:34:49,419
secured so

487
00:34:49,419 --> 00:34:54,909
defense perfect integrate control works
awesome always a way for

488
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:59,079
from actor around just around

489
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:03,869
sets so ap lockers not working well

490
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:10,510
will do it will separate Al Sabah
brightness camera this from all sources

491
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,640
Marmont it's not working well

492
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,890
but house on a beady eye Bob another

493
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:21,800
instance then see how they hearsay

494
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,849
got 3 p.m. house next on

495
00:35:25,849 --> 00:35:30,720
house Bob our windows 7

496
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:37,720
I 192 168 from Bob's

497
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,390
wanna

498
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:45,030
uses with Windows intrinsically way back

499
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:48,109
before Moss we had our PC more
procedural

500
00:35:48,109 --> 00:35:52,480
call right which I was over SMB call

501
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,670
makes work what's nice about

502
00:35:55,670 --> 00:36:00,319
are thankfully a

503
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:05,670
very simple you use our and is a very
symbolic you simply

504
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:09,609
handles the retransmit handles

505
00:36:09,609 --> 00:36:13,420
the best everything you need to worry
about

506
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:16,770
so you need to do is set up an impact

507
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:20,050
then login

508
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:27,050
sorry I would then be other Sanchez
again

509
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,339
yes so we code unico

510
00:36:33,339 --> 00:36:36,630
embed an RPC packet

511
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:41,520
Microsoft Windows work or act

512
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:48,520
echoed the screen are pieces very

513
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,410
very lot

514
00:36:53,410 --> 00:37:00,410
so need on perspective pretty confirmed
that now morning runs

515
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:09,030
does first problem you tryin

516
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:15,609
pack after hyper-v can I don't know why

517
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:19,990
this in 2008 you can rescues

518
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:25,460
just right

519
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:32,089
rate but then we can pack

520
00:37:32,089 --> 00:37:35,140
capture what is gonna help

521
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:38,740
workout number ask you guys ought to
suspend disbelief a little bit we're

522
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,410
gonna send these messages across

523
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:44,630
work where see them are their art
schools

524
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:47,650
back hyper-v rescue motor

525
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:51,990
hatch listeners but there are paper
towels so

526
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:58,990
we will help and their

527
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:07,400
there

528
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,150
you guys the back but said and sending
that message

529
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:13,240
and requiring the stem racked up sixty

530
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,300
thousand 307 are

531
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:23,300
see try finding a massive your

532
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:27,140
have appeared spent all night trying to
find

533
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:33,800
and say forget it fine

534
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,250
very one pack actually message

535
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:40,410
other us re other across

536
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:44,730
there you see the fights again promote
when this perspective

537
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:48,660
your Windows admin reagan know that RPC

538
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:55,600
special months ago no

539
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,130
Obama snow the clout if you're in the
cloud

540
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:02,190
worry about who has access your
hypervisor you have to worry about you

541
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:06,990
have access can I sniff my can I look at
the inner

542
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:13,170
interview right are dense is now
reaching into the hundreds of thousands

543
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:16,480
almost over communications are inter I
provide

544
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,930
don't goal something ask

545
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:24,210
from a defensive our site

546
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:27,300
actress back this is all about again I
months points

547
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:31,600
a typical financial services from which
I may or may not

548
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:36,210
know something about seas around 600
million pack

549
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:39,570
day sixty percent of those happen to be

550
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:43,840
SBR see which means 300 400 million

551
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,960
some most adding over our PCR

552
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,580
XO

553
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:55,880
actual discussing this with look my
second their

554
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,600
Thomas network security you know what I
would do

555
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,890
I would just look at the entry values
and my

556
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:06,280
yes pop right out I thought that was
really cool so

557
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:10,780
ice Explorer just atrophy is the
measurement firm Asian right the

558
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,060
difference between randomness

559
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:15,440
all its rolling

560
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,610
average to retake the number once every
three week code

561
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:23,860
point let's compare that random never
once every three

562
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:27,670
running is actually about point 52 about
double

563
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:31,400
that clearly there's probably

564
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,120
some different in Akron an

565
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:40,500
ran but noises are so we got

566
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:46,130
only eight points run into and say wait
a minute that's point 95

567
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:49,320
Iran but we wanted to be 50-50

568
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,660
his double right at another

569
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:56,310
left's so now for every had

570
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:59,530
everyone 0

571
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:02,810
and Iran be over that signal noise

572
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:06,240
now we've got we value that's whose ran

573
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:13,240
was at do RTC well

574
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:23,710
well

575
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:30,710
the

576
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:38,660
ok so thank you

577
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:44,050
has shiny

578
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:47,790
so we can use

579
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:52,440
match calculator that's within the stock
and actually

580
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:57,730
just simply runs the frequency Beach so
we can look at the frequency character

581
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:01,000
this massive preconceived Americans

582
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,950
happens are to it we can also do

583
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:11,070
is look are fights and look at a
comparison

584
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:15,370
by for example pack after valor see and
then

585
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:21,790
run the HP calculator now getting here's
our message we're going to use the

586
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:22,610
default which in

587
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:25,630
this the graph RTC and you see very

588
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:29,160
was it 15 also we have jumped the are

589
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:33,320
up 15 seconds we simply calculated or 12

590
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:37,350
seemingly random by is random by face on
the frequency

591
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:40,930
of Anarchy pack all we have is

592
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:46,540
blue it's just like a QuickBooks lose
our message all the rest is ranked now

593
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:50,350
you can have it go out bills exact same
or

594
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:53,410
space this particular case I'd an

595
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:56,520
by jumps make up the mess it up match

596
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:01,050
value 3.6 seven-point which is real
close

597
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:04,340
well within range I'll the Senate
revalue

598
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:11,340
are see next time you see about

599
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:17,250
he figures that covert channel should
mimic the entropy

600
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:20,450
over out so

601
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:27,130
gots a strong good and you know we want
strong got around seven put in a

602
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:27,810
firewall

603
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:32,930
the tricky thing about firewall in
dotnet

604
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:39,150
is that in order to past station we need
to get a shot

605
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:46,150
yet admin with different ways you get an
extra capture the password hashes

606
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:51,360
memory using volatility which is awesome
there's a man

607
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,390
thing we could do

608
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:58,750
excuse himself I mention earlier than
drop services

609
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:05,750
as a lot of fun because officers love
them because we can run with 33

610
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,760
130 one thing you can do is excuse shoko

611
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,920
thats things up so do

612
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,590
with intrinsic right down shoko I got
show

613
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:22,690
guys

614
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:27,540
calculator gotta get a calculator run be

615
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:31,380
first demo you see the show could pop up

616
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:37,490
background no fail because XQ would
launch calculator

617
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:40,490
another

618
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:45,040
them all we can do terms as launching
air

619
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:49,550
miss I've

620
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:53,080
there's

621
00:44:53,080 --> 00:45:00,080
the actual show that up an ass is as far
as my point here goes

622
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:04,230
show gonna have to give me some
suspension this plea else to do a lot of

623
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:05,180
different things

624
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:09,410
yet axis you take four years

625
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:14,820
drop services scary really is it scares
the death because

626
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:18,970
you can run so-called do anything 133
yeah I and

627
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:22,470
their attacks like powers Lloyd and
social to

628
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:27,120
were people now of the web streams down

629
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:30,510
shoko you the exact same odors that just

630
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:33,910
play and runs with everyone's also

631
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:37,150
this map five passes ap so

632
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:40,460
Parker had prevented Cup

633
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:47,460
scary scary thing around eight we keep
growing tech

634
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:51,450
controls she keeps punching wrong
Frankie gonna

635
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:54,630
the quintessential demo

636
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:58,440
for

637
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,290
covert channels is right because paying

638
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:05,660
usually just think about with but of
course

639
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:10,250
hando hairy any by on a great time was
i've seen

640
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:13,730
thing is actually using staff rights use
happy with I found

641
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:19,710
transfer out a whole file here

642
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:24,460
without about were you spank organist
and as:

643
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:30,960
messages betterment impact some and sued

644
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,070
now promise much noise by the

645
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:37,380
17 and noisy

646
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,590
Facebook as oppose

647
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:47,250
RTC which lots

648
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:51,570
I know it's is running as admin just but
as IP address

649
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:55,990
outside Ross now nope

650
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:59,190
see you get this are the exception cuz
because

651
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:02,370
because sockets require access files had

652
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:06,920
local security last them and that's also
why you gotta run

653
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,960
some demos as a minister

654
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,940
open up Iran the council as admin

655
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:20,940
log back

656
00:47:28,689 --> 00:47:32,069
now the such open now San back

657
00:47:32,069 --> 00:47:35,819
listener

658
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:42,819
message

659
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:54,090
good

660
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:57,400
thing works work carry

661
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:03,250
like pretty handy terms of defense is
similar to what we talked about

662
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:08,410
with houses we always want to be lot of
people not people in this from now

663
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:10,720
people a lot of times Obama

664
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,840
network operations summit like

665
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:17,410
what do you mean you watch internal I
only watch my

666
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:21,270
my my firewall was born

667
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:25,320
hack capture and other people who are
most are using

668
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:29,140
the foot that differently most people
are blind North Nova

669
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:34,140
cuz its you can't seem to the packets

670
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:37,220
no idea was that a real pain was that a
massive

671
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:41,030
now you can also not see things

672
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:48,030
which will look at house

673
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,310
never stop improving round nine were you

674
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:59,000
base64 no basis for you base32

675
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,170
code I mention with RPC that almost

676
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:06,940
coming with him about when nights
ministers retransmit breaking up

677
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:10,930
fragments can't do that with the mask
because here or axes

678
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:15,150
outside gonna build a protocol within
protocol which means we have to have

679
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:15,490
some

680
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:20,550
coding break so we're going to use

681
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:23,580
base32 which is five thats for character

682
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:29,490
$1 billion each one is going to be a
mess about your message you're pregnant

683
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:30,250
have you

684
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:37,250
and the other four bits well actually
I'm

685
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:44,280
format okay I'm

686
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:48,580
where this looks as well XQ

687
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:52,650
man excuse out to I

688
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:58,520
you can passes out massive because using
looks like any other traffic

689
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:02,830
very weird one thing you notice because
work

690
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:06,170
Cody information we get a lot of A's

691
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:10,010
live 0: saw up her game a little bit
Iran

692
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:13,099
now we're setting up messages in
sequence

693
00:50:13,099 --> 00:50:17,010
you know some smart people so ima your
shortest masses always

694
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:20,950
there's obviously something so of our
game I love

695
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:23,980
more and randomly send now randomized
messages

696
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:26,980
which receive the first

697
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:33,980
every character you looked at reassemble
allows us to use DNS request the past

698
00:50:34,109 --> 00:50:34,880
firewalls

699
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,349
call this never stop growing cuz

700
00:50:38,349 --> 00:50:43,700
a certain home improvement store
actually was recently credit card

701
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:47,540
stone how they get out use very similar

702
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:54,540
for an offensive perspective again we
want to do more than that 4-pack

703
00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:00,570
we can also do things like virgin ass
responses names

704
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:04,930
fouls because from also and

705
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:09,400
so relieved here else and Bob had

706
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,619
really good right blue team a reprieve
you guys

707
00:51:12,619 --> 00:51:16,099
me walk Roy I'd rather not know

708
00:51:16,099 --> 00:51:20,359
just leave it a mystery

709
00:51:20,359 --> 00:51:24,599
right up sunset after a good friend of
mine let pointed out that really

710
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:28,880
really 10 rounds this was a real
corporate environment house about

711
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:34,540
Dropbox so Store app

712
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:38,369
when you're being covered forming ideas

713
00:51:38,369 --> 00:51:41,760
want lost signal more notes right that's
right

714
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,240
over we want to mimic the answer work of
the hay

715
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,020
when you pick up you know that you know
that look why

716
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:53,589
decrease the likelihood of being
identified using with using naming

717
00:51:53,589 --> 00:51:54,210
conventions

718
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:58,099
wind in with other things I'm and we won
increase the time

719
00:51:58,099 --> 00:52:01,339
an effort once identified for defense
atty

720
00:52:01,339 --> 00:52:04,930
figured out because they're on the same
pressure of the west calling

721
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:08,160
when you coming home we want to see you
and

722
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:14,960
there's a good overlook there's a
channels we went through

723
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,690
some act drop services again

724
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:23,140
powerslide check it out our show's
awesome really scares me right now

725
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:29,790
or if anyone has control WPF tampering
is right find you see

726
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:33,599
memory always a good time

727
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:40,050
without and spoke again should be to
avoid

728
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:45,790
yes I yes and respond in terms of the
fans

729
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:49,490
got crypto got secure spring source code
obfuscation

730
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:52,530
all access decreased like

731
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:56,250
roles here always are Rd

732
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:59,599
process auditor network be that
information

733
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:03,109
Sam is actually about initially

734
00:53:03,109 --> 00:53:08,839
now one a good way to as a reminder

735
00:53:08,839 --> 00:53:12,830
all these attacks everything discover
people more time I'm

736
