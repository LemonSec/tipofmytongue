1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,260
below good afternoon

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:07,450
thank you for attended my talk I this
called Android

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:11,190
in the health care workplace a case
study okay

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,889
will but about me as we get started here
my name is Tom Richards

5
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:18,289
I am currently a security consultant at
Citadel

6
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:21,470
there's my Twitter if someone wants to
follow me

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,130
the vehicle on my website with a block

8
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,740
put some stuff up there some other
followed all the stuff I work I

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,140
and some other products I got going a

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,020
some certs Samantha offenses security
stuff there security plus

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,840
a GSA Japan a hacking stuff

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,430
so I have 18 published availability
assessments to my name

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,250
a seven of them have had CDs assigns
them all open source software

14
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,879
up also developer for a poon berry pie

15
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:55,850
which is a script to install pen testing
scripts on the Raspberry Pi

16
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,070
was here the Raspberry Pi a riot

17
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,489
so caught up with on Good Hope I also
have a little

18
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:07,180
iPhone script called who file which uses
Google to look up

19
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,740
a file types based on a URL its in
backtrack since are too

20
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:17,520
so if you have the base install you
already have it are important note so

21
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,920
yes I work for security consulting
company

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,720
this work that i'm talking about. was
done at prior to my joining the security

23
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,220
company

24
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,400
so i am not violating any NDA's here

25
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,320
I i do block out some IP addresses and
some product names

26
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,360
just because not everything the present
in here has been fixed

27
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,500
if you have more specific questions just
come up to me afterward I'll be free to

28
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,180
talk to you

29
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,159
but just since this is being recorded I
wanna keep some stuff off the record

30
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:48,320
alright so

31
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,970
why this talk or as we know or hopefully
we know that mobile

32
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,170
is a ever-growing in expanding

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,610
%uh sector IT it's just

34
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,219
exploding everyone has a cellphone at
this point and most people have

35
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:05,320
smartphones the talks have alluded to

36
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,369
I in companies are obviously looking at
ways to capitalize on this growing

37
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:11,510
market how do we make money

38
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,120
on this market so we see people rushing
to the market

39
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,390
or taking previously ran applications
and poured in them to

40
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,980
other platforms and they're essentially
making mistakes that web developers for

41
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,280
making fifteen ten years ago

42
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,720
then obviously security is a concern
since this is a purity conference

43
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,410
and this talk is focused on security
issues that I found

44
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:39,410
alright so will be more background

45
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:43,519
I used to work for a home health care
company which

46
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,940
think I'd like visiting nurses so if you
had I need for a nurse to come to your

47
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,550
home whether it was physical therapy or
if you have a wound we are dressed

48
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:56,440
in clean and stuff generally we had the
elderly patients we didn't have a lot of

49
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,340
younger people as it was physical
therapy

50
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:03,099
arm so we were dealing with patient
information you know so hippo was a bit

51
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,560
concerned we had sought Security numbers
diagnosis

52
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,090
I medication lists addresses you know
everything to think up on someone we

53
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,400
would have their information or to
conduct our business

54
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,200
so if a obviously is a concern for us
and we have the fall

55
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,690
and we need to protect that pH I

56
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,830
that a personal health information we
need to make sure that's not exposed

57
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,950
there's no breaches

58
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,440
I I'm from New York so we don't have

59
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,640
IX trends in breach laws like
massachusetts does

60
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,420
but we still have to follow under the
federal guidelines for when stuff

61
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:37,989
happens

62
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:42,310
so generally what people do with tend to
worry about encryption

63
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,629
we want to focus on Wednesday of is

64
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:49,730
in transit and also when the data is at
rest we want to make sure

65
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,140
and and that pH I is secure

66
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,739
for those individual so we don't get
subjected to millions of dollars affiant

67
00:03:57,739 --> 00:03:59,590
I think there was a couple

68
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,810
I insurance companies I had like hard
drive stolen and were subjected to

69
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,980
like millions of dollars a fines for
having those a hard drives stall

70
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,780
I also think there was one it was a
company that was being investigated

71
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,989
and the government asked for a certain
subset of records

72
00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:21,560
on a number asians will start over like
20 they want you know these 20 patient

73
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,220
records

74
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,889
what the company that was dumped all
other patient records and mail them to

75
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:26,840
the government

76
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,930
yet big no no so they just violated all
those peoples

77
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,949
pH I so they got you know we were
investigating you within 3 violating

78
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:35,639
more things

79
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,790
so they got fined you know a lot of
money so we don't want to be fined

80
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:43,350
if you're for profit agency

81
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,620
old look the background so

82
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,900
home health care company I we started on
a platform that was windows-based

83
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:55,080
so all over feel staff ninety percent
ever stop was of field

84
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,979
peso was all nurses and a

85
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:03,490
your LP and thus and home health ate the
whole northeast and have devices from us

86
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,590
or just the nurses the LPN said

87
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,199
and they would go to your whole perform
whatever where they had to do it at the

88
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,340
check your vitals

89
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,259
or arm you know make notice of it was
done on a Windows based laptop so we

90
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:16,940
knew how to secure

91
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:22,370
windows-based laptops are in what we did
is we transition to a mobile platform

92
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,360
City

93
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,820
when the person when then have to go
although the laptop wait for the Startup

94
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,660
type in the password

95
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,120
open up the software which was up bear
by the way god-awful software that we

96
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,100
had

97
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,380
and then start doing their work so we
went to a mobile platform they had

98
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,630
I Android tablet Samsung Galaxy Tabs

99
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:46,389
so they would go just turn it on and and
fire up the app

100
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:50,600
and go in and do their work it would
really made the visit I am come down a

101
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,650
lot

102
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,860
so the more flexibility and mobility was

103
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,860
you know a driving force for us to try
it switched to this platform

104
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:03,460
because it made our core users happier
do their work

105
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,569
so it was a new product it was
originally on Windows Mobile

106
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:12,130
well as mobile six 5&6 it was written
for and the company when they went to a

107
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,889
new release they've released it for

108
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:16,889
in droid I since Windows Mobile

109
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:21,100
has been declining quite a bit as a win
here havin a Windows seven phone or

110
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,039
Windows 8 Phone

111
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,979
yet say that's why arm you know Android
er i OS as well I would expect from

112
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:30,880
people in this audience

113
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,139
i think thats and has K so

114
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:38,160
they've really had a code base and they
just for data entry

115
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,590
a quick thing here we had to deploy 250
and retail what's over the space of a

116
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,430
month

117
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,530
in order to accomplished adult resident
a laptop

118
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,380
I nvm solutions at the time sucked the
most you could do

119
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:54,120
is put a policy on forearm passcodes

120
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,410
and wiping devices really not much else
with

121
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:01,259
of Rio Frio that have too many API's
it's gotten better now

122
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:05,639
with ICS you got encryption got you can
start to control applications that are

123
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:06,630
on the vice

124
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:10,319
which is pretty cool but at the time we
have limited %uh solutions and there was

125
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:10,960
no immediate

126
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,759
so we literally turn on and unpacked

127
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:19,800
and set to our standard 250 devices

128
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,940
is horrible someone wants to make money
find a way that image

129
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:27,259
Android tablets that is a huge orders
and read in general that's

130
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:31,000
a big need for people who is mass
deployments

131
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,880
or so the software it was an Android app
so was a pic /a

132
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,750
I it was not a bit still is not
available in the market

133
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,289
so that have a developer license say
that's developed it and they had it as a

134
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:43,440
download link

135
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,280
on the company's website kinda good you
could just find it by accident you have

136
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,750
to go looking for the PK

137
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:54,129
you're going to a sorta rivers in us a
clinician's would sink to get data so

138
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:55,849
well after they set up the

139
00:07:55,849 --> 00:08:00,069
device they wouldn't think it would
communicate back to the company's

140
00:08:00,069 --> 00:08:03,560
servers not ours so it was a it was a
cloud service

141
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,680
Software as a Service so we would

142
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,710
so they would think back to them and
then we would connect to the host base

143
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,319
at back in our office is the access to
information

144
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,379
questions about so you know the
transmission day in the store today to

145
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:20,520
where to biggest concerns so we brought
it up to the vendor

146
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,629
we said hey what are you doing to
protect the stuff

147
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:29,310
they told me they have a 128 bits of
encryption

148
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,750
when we work sinking data and that

149
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,159
the data on the device was encrypt

150
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,860
okay so there was some sort a secure
container was in the application

151
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,169
that that data was secure

152
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:46,610
alright my goal so I said

153
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:51,790
are they lying to us how do we know I
wanted to find a way to compromise this

154
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,649
patient information in some

155
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:57,250
way so I was into it like a complete
assessment of the application I was

156
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,510
seeing if I could break it somehow

157
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,860
that would get me the pace information
and thereby

158
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:08,910
violating have are so how they perform
the assessment

159
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,990
the Android emulator is a pretty cool
Pisa software you can install on your PC

160
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:17,070
and that you could I in Solvang what
went for development because of

161
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,450
occasions on it

162
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:22,660
so that gave you easier access to the
vice the files a filesystem

163
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,959
and also easy access to brow what's
traffic

164
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:29,810
going out into Wireshark on here machine
and

165
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:34,750
what's the traffic at a time I said
we'll what am I looking for

166
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:39,709
on oval device how do I didn't know what
secure what's not you know what what am

167
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:42,390
I looking for what issues exist on

168
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:47,220
mobile I found that all lost has a very
handy mobile top 10

169
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,070
just like they have the web top 10 you
know what kind of all abilities would

170
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,170
you look for

171
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,690
on wall so that was what I use to guy

172
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,260
in looking for the issues with the
software

173
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,990
by first case authentication
authorization

174
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,000
so after you downloaded the application

175
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,390
you only needed to pieces of information
to set it

176
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:12,329
up and start working that was the server
name

177
00:10:12,329 --> 00:10:15,800
and the 1890 so the server name

178
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,980
was specific to the company

179
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,589
okay and it made these were fired it in
barracks

180
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:27,660
that happen to be sequential so in our
first round of 250 conditions

181
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:32,070
whatever the first one was the last one
was 250 about that

182
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:35,860
so if you had access to one of those

183
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,079
you could then start stepping through
the application as

184
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:43,560
potentially anyone else when you have
one piece you can start

185
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,180
there was no way to tell the in approved
device from being configured

186
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,420
as a when European a blackberry Minister

187
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,459
okay so you know when you get a
provisional vice you had the activation

188
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:54,149
code

189
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:58,209
yet there was no activation code so if
you just had these two pieces invasion

190
00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:01,790
you can configure the application Asarco
answer so

191
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:05,709
I thought okay that's a pretty good way
to start let's see if we can compromise

192
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:08,079
the server name in 1880

193
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,240
somehow this was with the setup screen
look like

194
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,450
so you would just input the server and

195
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:19,860
input these Radian hit validate and that
it would bring you to the screen to

196
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,600
enter a password

197
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,170
password the user password was a locally
stored

198
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,399
and there was no complex requirements
see you could have a password up

199
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:34,339
a or a password officers nevers we used
a series of

200
00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:38,779
are letters for ours it was five
character randomly generated passwords

201
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:40,410
is what we use

202
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:43,279
the kids some simple but that was as
local historical figures so there was no

203
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,390
other

204
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:48,640
ascent authorization or syndication on
that besides on a device

205
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,910
so that's why it I the and the server
name

206
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:56,149
were critical to compromise any other
way because there was no

207
00:11:56,149 --> 00:12:00,440
other step just those two pieces of
information

208
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,209
data at rest I said okay how are they in
practice

209
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:09,649
they were using simple and had a single
database that was also backed up to

210
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:14,010
the SD card okay can I open that

211
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:19,290
single database I could it they were
using the user's password

212
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,120
2as encrypt that database

213
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,579
so you know access the device could
leave the compromise

214
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,600
I didn't explore the option of trying to
hack

215
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,399
that password that was stored outdoors
on but the database was at least encrypt

216
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,750
it both on the SD card you can just pop
out someone's SD card in this have the

217
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,420
whole database they were

218
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,810
doing their diligence for that I so that
was a good first step towards okay

219
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:46,839
well as they're doing something right
let's see what else we got going on here

220
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:51,010
data in transit whole members at 128
bits of encryption they said

221
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:54,050
well apparently they do it over Port 80
HTTP

222
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:58,649
which was kind of a surprise to me I was
quite a figure other and do that

223
00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:03,100
so there was there was no SSL they were
just use in normal issue 2p

224
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,889
to communicate back to the back and and
they're using POST request

225
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:10,350
to receive their faces so the
application make a POST request to the

226
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,010
server

227
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:15,260
a server will inspect that whatever
information it happened to your question

228
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,440
okay so now I use in I know using web
protocols

229
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,769
so let's see you know how it plays

230
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:25,690
you know as a web app hi I think it too
much into that

231
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,740
Canada see that okay

232
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,720
so this is an example love up the post
quest going through

233
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,720
obviously have locked out a the station
'it's

234
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,149
but you can see that it was just post
into these

235
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:42,230
for this request and I was getting stuff
back so through the sync process it

236
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,040
would like

237
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,300
authenticate the user to the server and
then say okay I'm here sir give me

238
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,820
information and then

239
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,300
as I did multiple love these per
different users to Paris or is it

240
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,079
develop

241
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:56,940
and I saw they do the same thing every
time as starts request I could pull out

242
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:01,740
table names from this thing arm after he
saw the plane text later

243
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,120
I but this was this was really bad

244
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:12,899
simple POST request as a show you what
is making a POST request going through

245
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:18,060
eyesight know if you went to that sink
one-dot the vendor dot com slash Falcon

246
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:22,269
it showed a form-based log on just in
the clear a city P

247
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:25,550
port 80 I tried to connect to it on SSO

248
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:29,630
and it the nine-day so then even have
SSL turned

249
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:34,300
on on the sink servers and it was just
some web form that they wanna meet a

250
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,690
liking to at that point I stopped cuz I
wasn't gonna

251
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:40,959
the NFL is I in also if you went to

252
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,190
if you look at the previous screen

253
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:50,850
it's hard to say but what it would do is
mobile device hound heard of Owl

254
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:54,449
which stop how was just every name for
an ASP page their use in

255
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:58,290
ISP not even aspx the process these
requests on the back and

256
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:02,470
um it would spit out some love this
custom in Cody and then I found

257
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:06,120
when I was going through the request

258
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,089
session handling there were no cookies
there was no

259
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:13,730
a out-of-band management to make sure
that this was

260
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:17,070
a legitimate request so if I

261
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:21,440
took the request just replayed it back
to the server

262
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,370
it with spit me that the information if
I was to return ID

263
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,639
so there was no way to authenticate a
session there was no session handling

264
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:34,600
it was oh you want information here

265
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,889
okay so now all the fun part
insufficient transport layer protection

266
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:43,779
so we had no SSL so we had obvious
issues with that so now

267
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:48,009
anyone if they were a and a coffee shop

268
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:52,440
and we're doing a sink which we actually
harm in New York we operate in different

269
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,660
counties

270
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,790
and Sumner counties had very poor cell
reception

271
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:01,279
like we're talkin between like Albany
and Syracuse were it's really just

272
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,190
I think except a couple of small towns
so the cell towers in the hills re

273
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:06,820
hindered

274
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,829
3G connection so we advise our staff to
try and find

275
00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:15,880
a coffee shops libraries I any place was
open access points they connect with

276
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,459
think christopher's concern was like I
can even make a phone call from my house

277
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:21,089
I have to drive get outta my

278
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:24,470
house walked out into my driveway said
only the one tree and then maybe I'll

279
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,060
get a bar of service

280
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,940
you know my daughter has to go up in the
attic to the one when they would hold

281
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,820
the phone out the window said it
expected

282
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,529
you know that's what we're dealing with
it is it is areas so we told people to

283
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:37,019
go to open access points

284
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:40,990
so what I found is they were using
custom including

285
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:44,990
on the device is it wasn't I anything
that was

286
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:50,750
it stood out as like you know base64 or
some crazy you tee eff

287
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:55,160
it was i really custom they voted
themselves

288
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,500
I actually some plain text was available
in the requests which was

289
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,970
kind of interesting that's hard to find
out

290
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:06,130
and again there was no it was not in
court at all

291
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:10,850
so this 128 bit encryption I don't know
what kept order for they had that told

292
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:11,939
them that

293
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:15,049
hope for tech I should probably be
slapped in no longer

294
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:18,260
be allowed to work in cryptographic odd
because that just

295
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:23,199
wasn't true so I was able to stay then I
started analyzing protocol

296
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,309
on my did reverse the PK and start to
look at it but it didn't come out

297
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:31,070
as pretty as I wanted to so I want to
see if just looking at it I could

298
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:34,070
find a way to compromises information

299
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:39,480
okay so server name identification again
everything's in plain text

300
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,720
what you think the server name was

301
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,640
I as a couple so really

302
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,470
right there so as I guess I was watching
like the things go through and how they

303
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:54,450
had the pattern and that thing popped up
in a big NO every single

304
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:57,660
it was just Rochester was at Rochester
underscore

305
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:03,049
a I don't know what a score a wish for
but the server name was just Rochester

306
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:07,320
so that was kinda interesting okay

307
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,360
I have to puzzle now how do I find it in
ninety

308
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,289
so as i sorry to watch the trafico some
more

309
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:18,460
and analyze like different pieces at the
same pieces

310
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,620
different parts at same piece at a time
%uh the sync between different unite is

311
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:27,789
I noticed this so with this request
occurred at the same period of time

312
00:18:27,789 --> 00:18:30,910
in in the sink as it was going through

313
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,929
and justice two parts a different

314
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:37,950
so what do you think those two parts are

315
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:42,179
the age in a day rape because that's the
only that it's already told them that

316
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:45,340
hey I'm Rochester I wanna start talking
iraq has a server

317
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,780
okay what could that possibly be it
could have been other things

318
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:53,559
but it turns out at happened to be they

319
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:56,929
Andy

320
00:18:56,929 --> 00:19:00,730
so I tried to figure out for sorta crazy
ways

321
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,770
how I'm going to practice

322
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:08,580
so sorry looking through a running low
on time so they're with us here so

323
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,350
this with the role hex above the packet
so I took those two parts that were

324
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,799
different hola never read

325
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:17,179
and those are the two parts that were
different when I took though that

326
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:17,880
affects

327
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,179
in converted back into decimal actually
gave me the 1880

328
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:26,650
so I didn't even have to go as far as
trying to write a way to reverse

329
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:30,590
their a their protocol

330
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:34,070
however this works it did and I tested
this on

331
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,770
a couple different used to make sure I
wasn't as crazy as hell to be

332
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:39,380
happenstance five different users I did
this on

333
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,190
at the same point I was able to pull out
the session ID okay so now

334
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:46,400
I have the server name and I have a
genetic

335
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,760
we know everything sequential I could
step through my entire organization and

336
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,049
get

337
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:55,130
every single person's information Social
Security numbers

338
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:58,600
there what medications are on their
doctors their address their next of kin

339
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,910
phone numbers addresses

340
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:05,860
everything we have on them I can now get
on every patient

341
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:09,650
pretty bad rate so let's tell the
vendors say

342
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,940
if it broke what do you do to fix it

343
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,130
so I brought my boss if you said oh my
god that's scary

344
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:19,840
can you like right up it'll tell the
vendor tell the vendor

345
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,970
took them two weeks to get back to me
they were at a conference and they said

346
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,130
we're going to look into this

347
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:29,270
the they came back and said they were
aware

348
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:35,419
love these issues prior to me reported
them

349
00:20:35,419 --> 00:20:39,049
so the first part doesn't tell me the
128 bit encryption

350
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:42,049
aircraft with a pitch live

351
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:45,559
a everything else he told me they had
planned

352
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:48,860
on implementing SSL this was back in

353
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,919
2011 in the queue one

354
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,580
of 2012 that's when they wanted to
implement

355
00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:00,409
SSL we were the first company to go with
this product

356
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:05,159
as a as a new client and they had their
role in the south to offset older

357
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:06,280
Windows Mobile

358
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,990
so they were there like the
fastest-growing

359
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:13,159
I'll home healthcare software company in

360
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:17,049
in the US and that's what they were
doing they said oh no we're gonna wait

361
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:19,510
to do as a way to do so.

362
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:25,100
there so their plan I had to deal with
the authentication issue there for us to

363
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,650
implement setup codes which they did
that right away after I told him about

364
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:31,210
this the next really really sticking out
which is like

365
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:35,630
three weeks later required setup codes
so the next major product release

366
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:39,090
so it would randomly generate a code on
the server and we would have to enter

367
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,409
that into

368
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:43,610
the ap the tablet aware that a software
okay

369
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:48,909
it's good for step I SSL took a while
SSL took like three months

370
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:52,470
I had tested it for a while it took them
a while to put it in

371
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:56,059
but I still wish I had an older person
AP caseworker show you the differences

372
00:21:56,059 --> 00:22:00,409
but I'll have civic to older version the
picket

373
00:22:00,409 --> 00:22:03,640
okay so want to go to protect herself my
company

374
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,409
spent millions of dollars on this
software between all the license we had

375
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,880
to do for the host

376
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,970
and the field verges this wasn't just
some simple software that you know you

377
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,890
picked up for a couple has out now we're
talking millions

378
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:19,140
to implement this you know through and
through to the trail everything

379
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,120
what are you gonna do what would I have
done differently well we ready asset

380
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,990
they were secure

381
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:27,240
and eight they outright lied to us so

382
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,890
ask people when you go into mobile stuff
have you had this

383
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:34,980
at independently tested by a software
security company

384
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,450
I work for one but there's also ones out
there that do mobile security

385
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:41,700
that specifically do more scary so ask

386
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,809
if it's been assessed I can you get a
copy of that report

387
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:48,520
or just the fine is that they had and
what have you done to mitigate those

388
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,409
issues and

389
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,760
before ISSS of to yourself

390
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,549
Apple was a little more difficult to
assess than Android because you have to

391
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:57,289
have

392
00:22:57,289 --> 00:23:00,980
an Apple product to do it you have to
have max and iPad

393
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,710
I and rate is like easier to come around
you can do and/or the suspense on

394
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,840
Windows Mac

395
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,740
or latex and that's really all you
needed was to get the pic /a

396
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,360
6 hard look at yourself all I did was
open up Wireshark

397
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,780
and added more stuff in the back end but
for accomplishing this goal

398
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,030
open wire for daughter look at it

399
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:25,669
or you can yourself have the app
assessed by security company

400
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:30,669
after we submitted our thing they said a
week after I submitted my present my

401
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:34,590
abstract to them they had another vendor
that was looking into them

402
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:37,640
have the app in the penalty tested by a
company they came to the same

403
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,080
conclusions I did

404
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,940
so you know the other company was doing
the right thing for way that we jumped

405
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,270
into the software

406
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:46,400
and fires issues

407
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,010
thank you for coming
