promised me program

124
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:53,509
the rescue boat mentality doesn't leave
circuit

125
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:58,800
bcg program patients that there are all
questions with no bad information

maybe start working away crestor
skillset to relented executions of the

129
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,479
industry could work

130
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,330
his case this is an example splinters

131
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:18,969
so really started really mostly for you
you know

132
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:21,750
i mean really respondents

133
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:26,000

identified acceptance by heart shipped

134
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,799
out articulate precisely

135
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:32,265

137
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,869
and if you get a certain moral which i
think that's life

138
00:07:36,869 --> 00:07:39,599
it was that every single users password

i think this is a new cease-fire to talk
about it

166
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,540
so

uh... usually talk are

171
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,076
there's uh... assembly voted to have

172
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,960
if you look for

173
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,400
the thing about visiting boston south
unfortunately is

174
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,959
beach recovery you are at all as it's
somehow has kind of intrinsic protection

178
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,590
pecorelli expecting that

179
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,280
with all the world's plantation

180
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,940
answer honestly

181
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,460
uh... and we've just

182
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,140
wrote that s the options see below

183
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,160
and ask you what you see there is no
authorization

184
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,093
there's nothing to prevent it from

185

just holding up w her or anything else

186

uh...

188
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,340
so in this case there's no indication

opposite australia which is one of those
groups like the second secondary

190
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,113
actually going to begin with but there's
there's no way to go as well

191
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,010

198
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:32,450
just ridiculous and what you get when
you get

199
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,880
so a lot of evidence

200
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,930
uh... here's another one for you

201

as far as the anaesthesia excuse me here

229
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,329

people explore energy etc dot com

236
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,970
since it does

00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,036
in this case another example of uh...

238
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,300

241
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,346
what's interesting about is working and
why i thought this was

00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:31,340
all overseas if you look at the top
looks very serious cure

utilities regional first to see more you
street usual asked these things

244
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,890
what what turns out

245
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:41,370
you've got to the rest

246
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,149
that hold on to the top science class

247
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:46,180
heidi terrible

248
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,046

249
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:52,740
excuse for chandelier pre-taped user

250
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,530
it's actually just got the

251
00:12:54,530 --> 00:13:00,910
were they had been basically insidiously
evil anti reprimand you sir

252
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,370
athletes harold narrowly think of me and
i have been coming

253
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,430
mostly that so

254
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,959
before closing that first tier and one

255
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:13,990
lacking any sense why things tak

256
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:20,990
and i didn't know what i feel so good to
me that house irony

257
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:26,170
soho the mediation is this is part time

258
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:30,660
and find a

259
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,970

waistline multi-party balance by next
alcohol so

261
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:42,016
protecting their legal in the process
time you can see what you want to get

262
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,309
mine

263
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:43,530
but you can't

264
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:48,140
in good conscience levels charts what
sector after

265
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,150
he's got

266
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:53,310
question on what happens at that point
just

267
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,800
general objects of

268
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,029
up in this case

269
00:13:56,029 --> 00:14:01,280
exceeded by the dollar

270
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,180
though the person who had been sitting
on a fixed it

271
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,580
you know and changing things that
business

272
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,910
insurers this year

273
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:11,610
so it does not have to make the epistles

274
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:17,270
now it's very obvious that hadn't
happened here is that

275
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,700
oblong leader

276
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,810

depressing about credit card horse must
not quit working

278
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,300
and let's get it fixed

279
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,420
so i said we don't want to keep her
friends they don't have the opportunity

280
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,200

sauce zero going live

283
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:43,750
it was over you don't see so who are in
a higher tax on his part

284
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,080
so there are any emad stopped

00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,770
any received all the money

288
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:03,750
and is this seems like it might be a
ordinances collects old

289
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,640
all that's necessary

290
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,190
and contacts and this is still true as
far as i know this closely checked

291
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:14,480
e middle east is your last cardiac

292
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,590

293
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:22,320
excuse my property other sides qua non

294
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,380
you know it's actually issued

00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,779
but relinquish opera houses and

296
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:28,439

distasteful creatures

299
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:32,770
so there's a lot of

300
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,510

301
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:36,580
our credit cards untouchables financial

302

307
00:15:54,989 --> 00:15:57,870
an interesting situation that's all

308
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:02,160
i've worked diligently to get something
out

309
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,693

he wouldn't fix things

312
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,320

320
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,720
this thing however is

321
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,010
unless we're going to be a trial subtle

322
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:58,110
it doesn't matter he's our campaign

00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,190
now the last four sizzling

492
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:46,656
n_s_c_ war prisoners assault is there as
far as possible injections he works for

493
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:51,970
exploited in this case to get my fix the
issue of the terror with this

494
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:56,850
three have released or aggregation your
personal was released just begin

495
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:59,630
open-source

496
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:03,896
you don't really should actually
expelled once well-intentioned problems

497
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,270
but just have asked

498
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,160
union

499
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,180
blacklist

500
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,590
uh...

501
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,640
warrior

502
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,680
you've more contest

503
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,010
supporter

504
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:19,179
uh... irreparably comparable receipts

505
00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:22,960
and this is one of those allegations
that only once

506
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,660
i will definitely have the subject of a
principle objection protected himself

507
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,450
all my own solution a pc street all that
stuff

508
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:35,080
absolutely neutral reason practice

509
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,559
and standard

510
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:40,480
cardigan

511
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:46,920
and will not be a lot of what's wrong
with this involvement

512
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,130
now i think it is an excellent excel

513
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:51,450
if this isn't it true

514
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:55,870
q actually did strategies for you get
the rest of the so there's this kind of

515
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:58,080
a top la jolla webpage

516
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:05,080
so what year is wrong if everything else
will indeed that isn't true resistors

517
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:16,110
so what about his work

518
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,850
trusting that could be so

519
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:21,820
unless you guys holding a reluctance
presentation

520
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:26,260
cookies are obviously i think that the
other alternative time it gets below

521
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,500
boston's immediate on

522
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,210
what it is

523
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:33,679
if there is a complete cocaine user

524
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,460
n or akochcincy

525
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,850
and as a group called the past

526
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:41,990
even if it will have reduced staff

527
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:45,710
demanded my tension to return

528
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,450
it's okay

529
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:51,190
and what was function drawer this
traditional makes these

530
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:55,190
this is actually a traditional
advertising for the analyst everything

531
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:58,310
happened is is individual relentlessly

532
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,360
on the issue

533
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,459
inadvertently

534
00:28:00,459 --> 00:28:03,140
so ivey is one of the borrower

535
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,160
are rivers at that point

536
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:11,409
creativity is the jury has to be to
prove you want to stop medline

537
00:28:11,409 --> 00:28:16,559
by making those cookies with bill gates
i don't mind on any sign-ups

538
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,809
pasta at four o'clock publication
bypasses vanishes or something i heard

539
00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:21,640
your honor

540
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:28,639
armed forces reporting you know spacers
walking about one thousand dollars

541
00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:31,300
so that's kinda

542
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,700
for more ridley is a plan to set up

543
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:39,309
first off anyway i would ask for past
recoveries mental histories in chambers

544
00:28:39,309 --> 00:28:43,019
there's no benefits for cookies packer
asks the cookies

545
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:46,700
um... p_h_p_ actually after his actions
or a recession

546
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:50,510
what's actually goes away user prisons
inmates first report

547
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,559
uh...

548
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:53,450
if there was a session

549
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:57,780
and a bunch of your issue you should be
pretty

550
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,650
replace cash

551
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:01,383
were all those kinds of everything
should happen

552
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:05,610
conduit believes the whole nation ever
uses or homepage

553
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,150
it's distancing

554
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,660
so there was a bit

555
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:12,340
she says practices swift action haha
crash

556
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:19,180
and they forget chapter sixty eight

557
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:24,850
so caesar dressing two products that is
applied to

558
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:28,916
now there's the slightest point that
we're not sure that your version who

559
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:32,570
does it mean that they actually
existence blindside

560
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:38,670
so became a legal residency

561
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:43,350
and in this case the voters believe that
the users return and boulder

562
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,830
to prevent speech

563
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:49,563
now i'd like to actually centuries
roster and i think it's a part of a

564
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:55,270
process three sisters if you want to see
tried at one twenty two so yea

565
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,760
your voice up

566
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,799
color in this case this is the rules

567
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,600
they want to be the bowlers preventable

568
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,610
uh... or i guess that is the path

569
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:11,310
to department store religious weekdays
fine exceptional replys

570
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:15,460
beijing bottom patents

571
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:19,549
so some useless aimed against with
posters express

572
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:24,459
p_r_ repairing relations with the
solicitor bradley did what's know as a

573
00:30:24,459 --> 00:30:26,480
preconceived notions

574
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,320
turns out they're not

575
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,120
these are all in all aspects from

576
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:33,410
assassination and i've slowed eastward

577
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,560
and this is all

578
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,600
sick getting respect

579
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,930
solicit

580
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:42,170
we don't understand why it has been
delayed softwares

581
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:45,630
i'm sure that you are right it is legal
fees

582
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:50,490
basket i mentioned that this is release
letter dot but you cannot however this

583
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,956
is released their freedom

584
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:53,190
comments

585
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:56,770
and telling me that my bottom softwares

586
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:59,710
which is whole loan processor

587
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:04,470
obvious ninety-two policy english our
software that's going to be asked for

588
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:07,640
so big big big bought and all

589
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:12,610
in the case of a symbol

590
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,210
what works for you

591
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:16,010
disturbed by the security of all

592
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,610
and policies general

593
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:22,000
this is a illegal or so it works

594
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,310
alerting them to be a man who writes
from

595
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:29,100
augusta national's liability ours but as
i said

596
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:33,840
uh... doing ok surpluses security act to
show other people how do we have

597
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,930
attacked

598
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,880
that's a nice hustler

599
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:43,880
how the law

600
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:48,283
so i think i think it would be
consistent with his speech the last

601
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,930
three times and it was

602
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,309
how about human hair

603
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:55,690
awesome must explain something no one
ever everyone looks at me

604
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:58,040
civilian are

605
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:02,610
business and a lot of bravado that
you're willing to see that your heart is

606
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:05,149
so important to the world

607
00:32:05,149 --> 00:32:08,630
galena monotone explained that see a
mask

608
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:09,580
users

609
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,910
returns schedule he was going to be

610
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:18,350
lists

611
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:22,720
ahd a nice to be in this particular

612
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,790
and this is a

613
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:26,990
this is a surprise the sun came across
town

614
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,870
this is the reason if you are in process

615
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:36,000
if you're lobster want not just forgot
or your senior senator network engineer

616
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,750
this is the reason why we should be
involved

617
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:43,690
of course it could be safer and we don't
talk to you

618
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:46,190
what b-sides softeners

619
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,080
software

620
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:52,720
so that he had in boulder gets lost

621
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,009
obviously happy days

622
00:32:56,009 --> 00:33:00,100
it infuriates it's it just by knowing

623
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:04,100
well i mean this is the purpose beyond
what you can call me if you want more

624
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,470
which is

625
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:10,880
protecting everyone else pronouncements

626
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,190
acts all that's left

627
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,950
that's my oscar round-up

628
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:17,400
on tuesday we're gona

629
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:21,400
uh... permits for my own wall

630
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,720
different for uh...

631
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,340
that he's actually

632
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,559
bills i don't see

633
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:30,350
now what's important about that is that
cd

634
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:34,110
past some sellers you know he starts

635
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:39,799
not less taxes they never stalls young
voters are you doing today about one

636
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:41,910
alleged fax line

637
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,200
it's class

638
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,540
so both parties that when you do certain
things like files calls

639
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,960
she will actually be in the last
district

640
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,500
head was at work

641
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:58,529
it will be one peacekeeper

642
00:33:58,529 --> 00:34:00,279
art

643
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:02,630
rato

644
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:06,350
we're going to be a simple

645
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:10,950
uh... so this is a very nice because it
seems completely obvious active renters

646
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:16,879
actually that you are also you know rule
dot com slash file that he he

647
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,689
uh... biol walls

648
00:34:19,689 --> 00:34:22,659
it could be a tank whereby

649
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:28,389
resolves the issue ob gyn includes heat
treatment people renders the scores were

650
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:29,749
happy

651
00:34:29,749 --> 00:34:31,440
so a lot of people do

652
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,899
you so that you don't get a lot a lot of

most of the differences in terms of
problem

705
00:37:12,549 --> 00:37:15,359
is of their sar you know

706
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:21,009
so but it's not that i'm very responsive

717
00:37:47,449 --> 00:37:49,809
most women if there's a contract

718
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:53,049
and the reality is most people working
in those things

719
00:37:53,049 --> 00:37:54,999
that should be removed today

720
