some I'll 14 his reason interesting
point that

24
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,700
these customer ever arises must have
become

25
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,700
are our company focuses on small
mid-size businesses

26
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,070
hope that all its arms fire things

27
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:01,409
major so his high-profile our customers
lost power

28

they don't we know homes for anyone is
cloud

112
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:41,379
my favorite 67 person responsible for
their clout

113
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:44,860
prong so very clear

114
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,949
forum emission by them he was talking to
the service they have no

115
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:52,319
home house through so what's in it

116
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,560
well asking remediation house through
Google

117
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,990
and your family room toms

118
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,930
arrested his of

119
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:08,599
virtual so all individuals oscar wilde

120
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:14,400
once again my research not terribly
useful information

121
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,080
user they don't understand how security

122
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,099
do in your opinion mines your

123
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:28,099
so know that so

124
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:32,180
practitioners women's

125
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:36,300
you and so jewels how people

126
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:42,200
we all know how securing personal
responses for baseball

127
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,529
up to live stream arms

128
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:50,709
of all policies procedures on allowing

129
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:56,250
sports you arms fire thirty-percent
response

130
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,620
styrene after synergy reason why it
happened

131
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,370
while is because here which is a

132
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,550
pretty good but

133
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:09,699
eighty-five percent losing grip some
other to your house

134
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:12,980
is the heart of love you arms uses movie
production

135
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:18,040
for whatever Res and you won't

136
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,329
morning signatures were responsible

137
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:24,660
version so is just one among these feel
of

138
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,810
whose you arms awesome uses

139
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,890
almost all whose information

140
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,410
I'm so excited state will get it from a
store

141
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:39,029
if you look at all these papers all

142
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:42,550
occasionally of reference ferries humans

143
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:47,029
I'll security history as were first
being radical

144
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:50,290
possum yeah it's happening I within

145
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,790

173
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,780
me so warmly reserves fires service

174
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:45,010
army last more as

175

guys

176
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,990
base all our products from was shooting
them

177
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,520
all these Martin's have some form all

178
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,530

those analysts the nest with the
incidents were called

190
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,520

fault-tolerant

192

whatever without a loss is being rumors

242
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:00,670
all personal the transfer of power

243
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:04,560
anything murder sensitive information
more problems

244
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,100
and provides all 12 percent

245
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:13,880
our clients upward impacts on my mind
whereas only one percent

246
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,980
shot was mom's hahaha yes

247
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:22,200

248
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:27,140
naw I asked him how long does pass pop

249
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,680
so that losses but

250
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,010
there's no indication who is from have
at

251
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:37,220
you know klom arms your

252
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,930
and fast kind-heartedness the opinion
that

253
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:47,610
people who've never a horse

254
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:51,250
six times more likely happens always is

255
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:55,250
purity their allowing files from

256
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:59,090
size their leading machinations %um

257
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:02,100
just or the options you know

258
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,950
all around more people passwords things
so

259
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:10,240
idoney are in harm's more secure with

260
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:17,040
from prosecutor so

261
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:24,040
we have chosen differences but house you
have a problem

262
00:17:26,509 --> 00:17:32,030
is rather interesting

263
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:39,030
chers miles

264
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,640
so for whatever reason we don't have an
explanation for this is our

265
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,410
understanding of

266
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,750
but isn't point clockwise at

267
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,870
points was times harding's

268
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:58,020
our records is Asian force

269
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,350
for me group you know law

270
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:06,320
we will see over time over about but

271
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,540
attackers more are all attack

272
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,830
haha we cruise

273
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,860

track but thats

328
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:06,980
fashion data about 10 credentials

329
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:13,110
is in special items he doesn't hold back

330
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:16,920

falsified

383
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:52,900

in knowing that job not be seen by an
expert

404
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:18,910

405
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:22,210
is his boss researching

406
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:25,560

410
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:44,130
a reason for today your eyes very soon

411
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:48,330
I'm blast his rise whose

412
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:52,310
I'm and weekend

413
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:56,070
security researchers continue of passion
when

414
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:59,260
the same farms silly policies

415
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,290
you know we help you any you know

416
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:06,370
me getting angry sends all

417
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:09,370
and improvise you know I

418
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:12,920
a reference %um vision that no I don't

419
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,250
and she is a who knows what house

420
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:19,390
find it now worms by all you knew that

421
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:22,580
when you hear that an expert says you
all

422
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:25,860
westerns along rates

423
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,310
euros arms very very well 10

424
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:33,880
I think which comes with

425
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:38,150
doing this don't resolve the issue
securing our customers

426
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:43,840
and developing hours rule I'll

427
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:50,840
sky

428
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,120
school
