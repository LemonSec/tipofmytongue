measures other nor on detected early is

212
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,910
using why how much the way he's not be

214
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,780
a notion that hong see the unit is

215
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:27,600
liability Louis those

216
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,380
be measured out of my

217
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,770
shitty and the six holes

218
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:40,320
communities tax i think is overdue that
we shift our focus away from worrying

219
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,940
about

220
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,250
internet pass and

221
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:51,250
shoes is to humans

222
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:57,230
sana sana about so suppose

223
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,570
the word come up with a tax on homes

224
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,920
you next time lines

225
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,470
Kachin one like someone were to use so
here's measures

226
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:13,200
proposed I'm our User leading

227
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,640
news or beaded but CD power in disbelief
reviews

228
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,700
who wants it him their top mine

229
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:25,930
when I'm the now which is an ass

230
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:29,210
to leverage on Journal network

231
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:32,589
so NSSC

232
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:36,650
or reliability reputedly not release
literature

233
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,650
and I think arteries defenders down here

234
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:42,790
so much well you know it's happened
twice

235
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,830
and you can attack once since

236
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,950
is sort of like

237
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:53,550
on for a defender

238
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:57,589
you leave home is live at you

239
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:03,560
place is lynette from

240
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,310
attackers US last if I had known you
want

241
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:12,330
room by when he plays three times

242
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,440
rapper that even

243
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,690
here

244
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:23,490
wine in on this is usually have the

245
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,170
that the mace

246
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:30,830
these schemes attacks are rarely

247
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:34,900
sin

248
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:39,120
a UCSB dungeons they're usually

249
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,950
hard ass a text /b

250
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:46,310
reveal a taxi go on for any

251
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:49,550
room leads limbs chain

252
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:54,660
is on you need to move along these lines

253
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,790
she then liabilities

254
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,970
interview ones is hun disgorge

255
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:05,560
right if I need to attack the lesser
utilities

256
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,579
but every time and actual answer balsam

257
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:12,000
know that news I mean the Lancers

258
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,119
for me right so that's critical

259
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,160
on known as home

260
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,530
from disappointed you didn't manage

261
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:25,540
St on %um you

262
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,590
as jewish as you want your sassy si

263
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:32,580
is you design on arm

264
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,230
climb ones

265
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:40,000
as well right but as hacker

266
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,410
use situation right also loss

267
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:48,110
tax sags in here I'm is the hardest part
about these

268
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:52,830
cities okay

269
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,890
hard money by power is now the other
metrics

270
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:00,620
rivers night %um so this is

271
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,470
around their of the nation's how man's

272
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:08,670
is cost loss data how much

273
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:12,590
and that's all I'm good

274
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:16,150
on adding again we look at this

275
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:19,169
attacks the syrians G

276
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:23,620
intermediate points

277
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,150
along Angie good now low-impact if you
were measured

278
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,940
connally's their power

279
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,650
power be very high are so how much
leverage

280
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:38,679
his hands so I'm exploding on lead to

281
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:43,510
compromise lesser and its happens be
long until you read

282
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:46,900
home because reasons

283
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,900
Dana monster pod

284
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,080
allows to bounce that attack that

285
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,910
duties on what i'm saying is that your
feedback

286
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:01,250
high-powered you lot leverage

287
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:06,240
on dismally thats

288
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,380
straightforwardness commerce detected

289
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:15,190

Zhen years how home

291
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:22,960
common design euchre

292
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,400
and this lines up pretty well

293
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,840
the other measures that are out there
movies

294
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,800
from attacks you I know shouldn't be
spending my time

295
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,000
tracked down was jus Ryan Newman

296
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,300
sama's

297
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,530
through two-stroke lead was scheduled

298
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:48,770
tax on homes might like and

299
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:53,020
gives

300
00:19:53,020 --> 00:20:00,020
probably examples

301
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,070
that runs here times

302
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:11,880
only Hawkins

303
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,580
higher tax right nice I'm disgruntled
employees

304
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:22,700
ups have access rain is jewish

305
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:27,440
your house talking about

compromised s say right

307
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,250
employees Ross wrong website his right
back down

308
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,710
be remotely controlled somebody else

309
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:43,000
common floor use

310
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:50,000
scenarios wires ass so row harmonize

311
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,990
cameras arm tracking these years

312
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:58,409
because i am just very rare stuff so

313
00:20:58,409 --> 00:21:01,860
is where the social Zacks governments
Murray

314
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,960
and smoothly these

315
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,590
home later earlier solutions to the
discretion

316
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:15,590
not covered yet so hard right Google

317
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,919
result these chapters racketeering
happens

318
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,419
and was escalation and a distraction

319
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:34,419
set those aside two years later but
these other chapters

320
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:38,669
are just the way I'm the about when I'm

321
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:42,500
by myself a new jersey number this is
how mine

322
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:49,260
afterwards some

323
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:53,950
for the first three in these I just do
with dole's

324
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:58,190
sample and

325
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:01,929
so previews the first taxes announcers

326
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:05,200
uses mindless I'll

327
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,559
example attacks against services that
are an honest

328
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:12,950
intentionally or in the case of a

329
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:18,679
that'll really you see my message om

330
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:22,320
their husbands because we use

331
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,210
me in nineteen eighties

332
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:31,330
use on a regular basis this list change
over time

333
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:35,679
somethings terms all some things never
die

334
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,190
slick the VMware directory jerusalem

335
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:43,690
a couple years ago there run into the
whole time

336
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:46,980
is becoming rarer rarer year ago

337
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:51,169
now I'm homes those

338
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:55,220
generally ash yes I'm nomas

339
00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:01,030
sessions old neurons minister in

340
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:05,900
long time and I'm just numbers I'm here

341
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:10,169
for the different measure SAT our
visibility dreams

342
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:14,520
and I don't mind getting plane about
these numbers

343
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,640
I mean their didn't deter

344
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,640
gasoline but I think the same is true
for

345
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,679
for all major systems are out there but
how do you like the

346
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:30,630
things lose perspective the stuff that
