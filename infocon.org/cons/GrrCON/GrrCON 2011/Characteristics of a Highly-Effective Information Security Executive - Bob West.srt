332
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,440
governance is the foundation for
everybody

333
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:39,119
the Manasquan impact surprised prior
contacts

334
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,629
you have to have frank conversation
right now

335
00:20:42,629 --> 00:20:45,970
the only as far as yeah soon and

336
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:50,820
must-carry programs that I part who has
analyzed

337
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,820
for I and once more

338
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,649
or it hasn't worked the exact E and you
can read

339
00:20:57,649 --> 00:21:01,559
resources you also can have different
people roundtable

340
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:07,129
to happy compensation soon so once you
didn't even as the morning stars sang

341
00:21:07,129 --> 00:21:07,960
the role

342
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,409
wraps up policy for you

343
00:21:11,409 --> 00:21:15,269
and you leave you know everybody in her
room and read

344
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:19,289
says yes these policies make sense for
us and houses

345
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:22,330
one vary based on industry haha so

346
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:26,320
good policy for a financial services
company doesn't necessarily mean it's

347
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,159
good policy for manufacture

348
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,570
here Arsenal I or

349
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:35,690
years back things are good talents
community

350
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:38,929
I'm unnecessarily otherwise

351
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:41,950
so he said passed in a sense for the
organization

352
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:46,119
and once once South Pasadena is let
people know

353
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:49,720

354
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,659
is very dry hot ass there's a
significant message knows

355
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:58,690
organizations I'll be has most people
have come

356
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:02,070
out background security baird's

357
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:06,739
reaction as okay want to hold you I saw
sprawl

358
00:22:06,739 --> 00:22:10,700

359
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,509
what is Miami to you activities

360
00:22:14,509 --> 00:22:19,529

they are

361
00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:22,940
not things are Ryan point here things

362
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,690
the executive team needs to I hear
things that

363
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:30,559
now people so there's multiple messages
that need to be

364
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:35,109
community early and often the other hand
I see is that

365
00:22:35,109 --> 00:22:38,359
people make yeah sprang to mind

366
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:41,799
