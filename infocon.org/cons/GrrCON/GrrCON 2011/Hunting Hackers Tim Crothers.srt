2
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:02,570
spies

3
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,630
like xbox stopped so

00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:08,730
anxious

6
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,349
it's quite a lot of talk about

7
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:14,880
actrix co parts all

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,189

9
00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:18,929
or someplace across pops earlier

10
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:21,649
you may have picked up there is an

11
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:23,390
rescheduling

12
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,579
t_v_ high-t_ security folks

13
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:27,320
i_t_t_ security

14
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,409
a long time

15
00:00:28,409 --> 00:00:31,240
personally upsetting hairspray

16
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,860
any activities at once we look at what's
going on

17
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,400
is worse today but it was

18
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,190
and heretofore so

19
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,940
what

20
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,370
what the world are we going rock if
there's anybody here that doesn't happen

21
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,230
are often virus or

22
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,200
all of these other rates solutions and

23
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,670
authority brett butler value

24
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:03,350
but that's not solving it despite what
all vendors wonderful again

25
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,030
sold let's talk about

26
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,420
ac

27
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:12,670
i've focused on areas i think dot

28
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:17,160
looking

29
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,420
so black images brittany's talk today

30
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,790
his acts on lots of people

31
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,920
from new york

32
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,450
so copies

33
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,810
political advocacy actually boxes

34
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:37,140
is there for all outside entities they
happen to have a nice to protecting

35
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,440
customers

36
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,420
why im interview

37
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,090
right so these are literally

38
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,590
taken from a life sentence for her

39
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,980
that were used literally against the
company and i have no idea if it's in

40
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,940
the law

41
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,470
that they were calling

42
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,810
saturday tallest walk right up to work

43
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,730
so vast network of what's up

44
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,460
trying to buy a little bit

45
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,530
after all the answers right now i don't
think anybody's got all the answers

46
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,560
despite what they say in two thousand

47
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,069
seattle words he's got answers

48
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:10,389
into a terror

49
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:13,290
so they have all the answers

50
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,019
latvians tried but what these are my
thoughts now i want to have special

51
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:20,969
problems one

52
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:21,919
relief forces

53
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,750
because happy

54
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,840
advantage to work with those of you can
really give upset so

55
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,290
as much info should be sir

56
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,629
exchange that i have

57
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:33,909
so what you're going to see

58
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:37,139
please don't forget that all of my work

59
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:39,530
i'm sure a maintenance in here

60
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:42,210
well this is based off a lot of people
for and

61
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,690
reason attachments to what was one

62
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,639
hi measure out the credit for other
people's work

63
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:50,399
but secondly i think just as importantly

64
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:51,939
this is not

65
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:54,039
a solo sport anymore

66
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:55,919
this is a team sport

67
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:01,180
so it you think that you're going to get
me right security by herself

68
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,000
and i don't make it work for a little
colony reacted

69
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,469
you're the security slash never managers
slash

70
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:10,739
audubon dot right

71
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:17,339
on what golden leicestershire casts a or
altogether really resources right you

72
00:03:17,339 --> 00:03:17,959
are

73
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:20,499
that you can swap intel

74
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:21,719
because it

75
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:24,780
all why directors i can't pay

76
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,109
understand what they had to do

77
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:29,539
at or right

78
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:31,639
all

79
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,840
no too much about that

80
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,229
is not possible

81
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:38,640
because humidified somehow they should
be

82
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,280
went berserk expert

83
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,559

84
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:45,119

00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:06,060
because the original a was really

173
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,539
itself

174
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:09,999
pc users worldwide

175
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:12,919
ashtec's hit that right

176
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:15,310
certificates

177
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,309
later on today to see some of the state

178
00:08:17,309 --> 00:08:19,430
as you see

179
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,909
or to look at these spots and you'll see

180
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:25,569
have architects

181
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:26,910
sparks

182
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,349
all of these states that we do

183
00:08:29,349 --> 00:08:31,199
helpless mister

184
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,839
better be aware

185
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:36,080
say

186
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,979
which need to be aware that the best to
transport also tells bad guys

187
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,140
letter

188
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,080
mcpeak dinner

189
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,740
so i guess more massacre

190
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,180
so here we start moved around so we
polled passwords

191
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,670
we transfer the background to sprinkle
tables

192
00:08:54,670 --> 00:09:00,260
or and asap essences for that purpose is
to have them as well right

193
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,040
police sergeant who does all the parties

194
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,060
who discovers boxes here

195
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,859
noticed we started this out there at ten
forty four

196
00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:14,180
reluctant to

197
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,130
carol and long-time writing

198
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:23,640
so reduce your hair removal at odds with
internet users

199
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,880
marisol and back to work with that

200
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,529
you edge and it was that would

201
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:31,360
right up front

202
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,420
there were installing that made me get
back to you later

203
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,860
an

204
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,590
coats and list

205
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:44,009
but we see is one of the simplest and
most economists agree ground

206
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:46,830
is a good at all

207
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:47,940
itself

208
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:53,089
it was the academic background
globalhunt knocked on your windows live

209
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:55,020
skydrive act

210
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:59,540
someone can run as fast and

211
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,650
backwards across the network

212
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:09,650
okay so until my passwords passwords for
these six classes died of heart heart

213
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,980
because that you

214
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,760
ironic

215
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,820
on those boxes that it's five minutes
we're going to be imovie laterally

217
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:25,120
and instantly passable

218
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,120
so everyone out there

219
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,750
all what's involves a

220
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,420
much more on the scene

221
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,220

287
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:57,510

297
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,350
when we get it right

298
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:27,160
but candidate and looking for

299
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,160
we pull it together

300
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,530
to compress it up

301
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,880
and i'm going to push it up

302
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,680
hahahahha

which changed

306
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,700
so

307
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,610
what we just looked at

308
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,270

it'll start moving beyond

344
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,490
just looking at

345
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,810
that polygraph test checkbox checkbox

346
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,880
content in you

347
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,590
communities house

348
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:43,670
jasper axial

349
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,240
all right

350
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,569
alternating they'd go on for a long way
route

351
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:53,040
right sequence action hundred e power

352
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,000
if we don't want to know why i don't
think they said

353
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,060
okay

354
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,720
so we're going to get

355
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,740
right loving kisses and what your
government is lying

356
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:06,720
every paragraph ever worked with every
company have her call in to help

357
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,500
basically look like this

358
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,140
on a good day

359
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:15,720
it so much courses colorado's in the
real world we've got lots to see what

360
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,750
priorities and what reports and i want
all this it'll stop

361
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,780
while they're working on

362
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,369
sult let's talk a little bit obama

363
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:27,400
how we go about

364
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,240
finds that freight moving beyond that

365
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,789
basic paris

366
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:33,640
relying on that

367
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,890
well let's think about this

368
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,650
its perspective

369
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,710
they have needs to do

370
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,810
nick

371
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:46,020
tigi accomplish things just like you do

372
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,250
so what we're going to pay for them

373
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:52,780
let's focus on that because that's what
it's called recently

374
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,240
well enough normal activity

375
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,509
made team somehow

376
00:17:58,509 --> 00:17:59,780
peanut works

377
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,970
in such a way

378
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:03,110
we don't know is that

379
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:07,690
the easiest way to cover the specified
ones

380
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,920
cameras inside cells

381
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,470
there is nothing

382
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:19,400
that they can do to victorm these signs
evening look at the right place

383
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,440
attractive

384
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,570
figuring out what those replaces all

385
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:28,490
they don't want to collect the data
repeated just print it out to a young

386
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:31,610
couple allsec indians who are different

387
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,020
lols writing

388
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:40,020
or maybe or correctly notoriety
detection

389
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:46,420
expert at b except for characters it
doesn't work there

390
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:51,460
externalities times for us it were
looking for that

391
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,550
affidavit

392
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,029
still there

393
00:18:55,029 --> 00:19:01,260
excited about how forcefully but usually
easiest part

394
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:05,960
soak the xbox so i think he's

395
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,840
the wanted maliciousness

396
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,110
so far

397
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,070
this is just a suggestion

398
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:12,930
when you watch

399
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,220
tonight

400
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,700
on medicare whenever it is

401
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,300
back to the office

402
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,370
start looking at it from the perspective
on how

403
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,730
how can

404
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:24,580
pushes the individual or environment

405
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,110
if you want to get ahead

406
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,230
anticancer

407
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,800
normal activity if you want to get into
qualities

408
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,010
cops and you want

409
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,470
at starbucks

410
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,030
so if you ideas on this right

411
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:42,050
uninteresting

412
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:47,740
most of the activity everywhere is the
exam

413
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,240
the reason is simple

414
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,150
all our networks virtually all other
networks

415
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,570
unit were used to practice your whatever

416
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,539
that pretty much

417
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:58,310
open exit doors

418
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,130
regarding

419
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,940
qigong access the web

420
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,220
so

421
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,170
the bad guys got access to the world

422
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,300
stirs allotted

423
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,629
but again we think this is the house

424
00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:11,910
right

425
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,529
these nothing else

426
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:16,640
gyros arsenal

427
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,570
because yes we still got a lot of web
traffic to sort through

428
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,460
but at least we're looking at the
website

429
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,850
that's what's looking at all traffic

430
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,539
when you start looking again was black

431
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:33,070
you're i'll accept it looks like

432
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,970
there's going to be addressed

433
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:39,540
injustice right up

434
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,590
yet and careful here to help

435
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,940
candidates

436
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:49,280
so their even things like they know we
have things like tom

437
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,000
pressed blocking

438
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
acceptable science a black hole and
stuff like that right

439
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,530
so what they want to use for most of
their command and control the stock on

440
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,710
what

441
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:04,020
which had been service

442
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,680
salty harvard

443
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,640
belligerent someplace with hitler

444
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,440
the microsoft network

445
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,820
inside are

446
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:19,080
microsoft networking as a group called
him

447
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,580
all over the place of witness

448
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:26,160
a bad guys use a different

449
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,300
yes it's still microsoft networking

450
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,810
but if we go back

451
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,010
how many times have we got users

452
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:36,120
making all these posts actions

453
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:40,120
baseline the domain users list

454
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,420
blowing things like that he had picked
up

455
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,430
all of those things

456
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,590
marks

457
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:49,970
supposedly steven stark right now
understanding these individuals and as

458
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:54,200
easily let's go over signs of those
fools apartment

459
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,150
okay figures and popped up that
determined not to be

460
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:04,620
he did not was round one you on this box
yesterday's captain we're going to

461
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:09,120
on comparable closer that box

462
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,619
because got practiced here is gonna in
every by some of my

463
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:15,800
does not

464
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,460
some stopped

465
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,570
all right

466
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:25,000
there must be said it was from a he
doesn't give them

467
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,029
intact

468
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:29,540
that certainly brought towards our
tension

469
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,270
we both got part of me

470
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:35,370
ardently desired rate protocol

471
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,550
used by

00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:43,550
counting buchanan nita argued from

473

sold yet

476
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:55,140
understanding your networking really
looking beyond just the service

477
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,739
you can't find this interesting injuries

478
00:22:57,739 --> 00:22:59,570
except for

479
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,050
start right

480
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:03,270
not constructive

i'm cracking argues votes

483
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:13,370
and anymore

484
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:18,080
you were segments that was the laws too

485
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,940
so let's get started

486
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,640
so where we look for that matter

487
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,880
what he has a you pat

488
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,590
trackpad understanding but that active
directory

489
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:33,390
is the building in the bath aboard mir

490
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:38,100
it's great because it's got all these
are at least all computers

491
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,700
insider

492
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,850
and so on the system

493
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:47,149
and excellent behind using

without setting off right now

499
00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:02,799
just from your action director of the
house

500
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,570
acts of them are going to have been
talked about that on the road what did

501
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,520
you hear is undermine sovereignty

502
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,290
in terms of the body

503
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:13,620
can't look at it from the perspective of
the bad

504
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,399
behind

505
00:24:14,399 --> 00:24:17,750

december

508
00:24:20,499 --> 00:24:24,230
and understand how he normal users
people got it

509
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,380
must sign with

510
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,890
some interesting things would be sitting

511
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:35,270
most of which probably would not want
just and he's in

512
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,140
some

513
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:41,040
what chances are really really good so
are

514
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:48,040
and so on stop you realize what it is
and similar along

515
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,080
is cost you're prepared him

516
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,540
soul and of course the age of five
hundred interested in detail back at

517
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:03,070
work here your network they need to find
him

518
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,330
solo

519
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:08,330
multiple authentic haitians armed he he

520
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:08,950
the

521
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:13,299
so wet user i walk into the box

522
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:14,870
it might look at the

523
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:17,590
active directory locks up without buying

524
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,100
there's a big secret

525
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,790
unto you

526
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:24,770
assisted need to read the signing into
the box

527
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:27,830
there's a completely different invent

528
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,660
the agency in your loss

529
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:34,510
p_s_a_ why don't you come onto my box
across the network

530
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:38,760
they're both login success is the big
difference

531
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,709
hydrabad new i don't think so

532
00:25:41,709 --> 00:25:48,370
to be looking at my watch investment

533
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,370
right back

534
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:51,139
again

535
00:25:51,139 --> 00:25:53,230
places where possible

536
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,679
writing but that's that's

537
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:56,050
all i'm talking about

538
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,110
is one of his

539
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:02,520
and of course international trade right
so if i hardly ever

540
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,920
somehow they've got a without

541
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,470
because even bigger setback

542
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:11,639
there's no caveats earrings so when we
look at those laws earlier and they were

543
00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:14,380
going to have you gotten down on that
right

544
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:18,720
detection and actually that was a
government of the screen burst through

545
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,289
the receipt once was reasonable

546
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:25,370
essential international trade their man
intro

547
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:29,050
one of the really batman's or whatever
it is that there will be right you heard

548
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:32,990
her siebel database occu work email

549
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:35,960
i want to know who's going to be a
research company himself

550
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,880
the added outside

551
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,559
so via larger most of the groups that we
see

552
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,050
releases

553
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:46,539
argues in a row

554
00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:49,280
by no means isn't the only day begins

555
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:55,010
how is the last legitimate uses for
using all of them is all

556
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:57,670
wet when i think the rar file handy

557
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:01,100
uh... him

558
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,380
writing

559
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:08,410
armendariz all sorts of ways with a
little barrels per person per innocence

560
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,130
the

561
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:16,130
comparing the reliance beginning of the
bottle with a lot

562
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,090
you know i mean you know

563
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:23,159
autopsy or any of that stuff to do that
for you right

564
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:27,690
integrity what wasn't said alright
here's what the final say they are

565
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,880
here's what's really in them

566
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,410
indianapolis has spots in his greatness

567
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:36,010
this is the menu solution

568
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:38,130
what is some places ruble

569
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:39,780
credit because

570
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:43,550
it's very unlikely that most of your
users

571
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:47,559
army products

572
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:54,210
and if there are people who might be
another reason to investigate the bball

573
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:56,020
now interestingly enough

574
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,820
in on the

575
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:02,110
what the chinese recently blatantly
which is

576
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:05,949
to realize that city stingy technique

577
00:28:05,949 --> 00:28:09,860
they're using the dropbox oxide itself

578
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,919
slowing down

579
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:13,230
school about stuff now

580
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:18,410
syndicate dude you know i i karthik
dropbox electricity through is the

581
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:22,830
manager outlet really cool and useful

582
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,049
slow-mo

583
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:28,470
drop boxes with uh... melamine firewall

584
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,470
dropping on dropbox

585
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:33,890
go pick it up but there are so many
other your

586
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:36,049
insanity

587
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:38,370
elizabeth thank god

588
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,280
i had

589
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,880
and of course ultimately

590
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,000
the other thing that they've got to do
is they don't maintain access

591
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,080
soul

592
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,850
eight years are

593
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:52,510
that actually an individual's rocket
particularly what did you use your

594
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:56,120
themselves made needs

595
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,110
slightly are

596
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:00,760
is a lot where you have resigned

597
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,960
was more

598
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,950
regardless of his life his regardless of
background

599
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,800
so yeah

600
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,740
remote access routes

601
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:19,289
so pay special attention and you don't
hear anti-virus for andrew has confirmed

602
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:20,730
bags

603
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:23,960
if you see poison ivy popping up someone

604
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,500
it's not going to be happy with my
return

605
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,220
isn't it

606
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,460
you know again

607
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,260
you're going to be

608
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:35,170
there's blood in times beach uses up
when

609
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:40,020
i would suggest that the box vehicles
are one of these don't provide your

610
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,100
tools they have a love for him

611
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,969
and don't forget brian

612
00:29:43,969 --> 00:29:47,830
post workshop servants or any just
either

613
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,190
ultimately

614
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:52,970
there's only two places that are going
to do business persistence in city hall

615
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:53,999
writes

616
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:56,550
or using drugs

617
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:00,890
sodium and what you want to do did you
want us to be pay special attention

618
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:04,110
soooo and gary before you

619
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,400
action ninety-six your professional

620
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,500
to be zero in here about the gist

621
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,910
religious stuff you know

622
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:18,900
self so we talked a little bit about god
gives us all how do we coddled saddam

623
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,500
right

624
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,760
firstly foremost and he strongly
recommend you start

625
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,299
insults or

626
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:27,890
intel

627
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:33,070
donatella house and lots of or intel
comes in go into the monthly artist

628
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,610
statement

629
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:35,600
at the beginning

630
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,860
talked guys including absolute

631
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,820
use an instant

632
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:49,220
especially in west michigan nurse really
count votes right

633
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:53,930
and most of them are perfectly happy
with shearson relieves

634
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:58,350
what you've been doing telling yourself
right so we look at these log files of

635
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,690
the other

636
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,360
popu

637
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,400
antigens

638
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,620
endorsement until about noon right

639
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,900
so uh... this is not this is a

640
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,070
financial right

641
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,259
so in

642
00:31:12,259 --> 00:31:13,740
julie's

643
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,709
i do it

644
00:31:14,709 --> 00:31:16,039
a log files

645
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:20,820
cases started recording stars interview
long lines right

646
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,890
but its rules that i saw him he was
planning techniques

647
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,370
when i saw him his

648
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:32,950
what is life that i saw one twenty mins
brisbane dot has just been censored but

649
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:37,510
in the real loss ever it doesn't

650
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:42,130
walls boxes we're talking about
rebounded were they were

651
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:44,500
so on and so forth but i think

652
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:50,120
so we start clinton's to others from
monologue filed in a big deal

653
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:54,390
worse though every time you see this
happen

654
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,710
you've reviewed the data

655
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:59,660
to get thrown so not so

656
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:04,139
you know what are you talking about what
articles you ask me

657
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:06,740
you were

658
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:11,770
before all varieties that you should
remind because you know

659
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:14,740
campgrounds

660
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:19,039
one in very short or you can help me be
comprehensive

661
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,669
and what are does

662
00:32:20,669 --> 00:32:22,250
what we call them

663
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,110
idioms

664
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:28,480
right celebrating this alliedgroups
you're sort by

665
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,660
now if you can have

666
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,980
to develop

667
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,289
signatures

668
00:32:34,289 --> 00:32:37,820
house stuff but stopped it is the magic

669
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,870
is eugene star

670
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:44,230
reconciling the signatures happening
right now we see what holds out

671
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,480
and intended

672
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,770
and we're going to n_b_c_ levels on

673
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:53,910
and that's what we're doing with
catonsville upgrade is not good

674
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:57,670
you know and you can see i didn't know

675
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:01,799
right everybody eastbound it doesn't
matter what

676

because that would be doing

691
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,300
or dangers

692
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,760
made some confinement

693
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,930
we want to receive their techniques

694
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:57,780
a little things like that the vast
antoine

695
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:03,270
look for how how easy is it alright a
store singer who was for us in the

696
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,670
capitalism

697
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:09,179
filter that through writer he's a broom
or whatever

698
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:13,039
for wandering

699
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:18,059
amazing

700
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:19,889
yet right

701
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:23,099
i would disagree with it

702
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:24,709
but he has not

703
00:34:24,709 --> 00:34:28,609
that ain't reckoned he hears the
techniques

704
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:31,839
you want to see the extent he is

705
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:37,589
you can't look for those things in
exercise that you want

706
00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:39,379
that's that's the key

707
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:41,159
and of course science

708
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:46,010
ninety-nine advises out because of
course i'm kimberly sharia law students

709
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:50,639
there's some forecasts that the who's
going to abide by the end of the odd

710
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,129
visit what should be done

711
00:34:55,129 --> 00:35:00,699
if we get if you had a loss right which
usually start attending this vehicle

712
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:01,819
okay

713
00:35:01,819 --> 00:35:07,069
you start we find that signing and we
will forever be helpful here right

714
00:35:07,069 --> 00:35:07,870
so

715
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:10,659
the hard part is the first one right

716
00:35:10,659 --> 00:35:13,359
so defined that first one

717
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:18,389
me with my dad passed away and he'll be
don't actually past that

718
00:35:18,389 --> 00:35:24,369
whatever operated competition on it and
and and he's brought to you from types

719
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:29,280
and legitimate use was not doing
whatever it is the needs of unity

720
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,789
you pull back

721
00:35:30,789 --> 00:35:34,030
and that's where it all the stuff like
the sites comes in

722
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:37,720
so where was a talking to handbook for
early

723
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,429
who also stalking

724
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:40,529
to them

725
00:35:40,529 --> 00:35:44,380
because if you've got one

726
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,449
you've got a hundred

727
00:35:46,449 --> 00:35:49,960
what did they do not a hundred yards one
person network

728
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,750
is probably

729
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,699
wannabes

730
00:35:52,699 --> 00:35:53,849
abedi

731
00:35:53,849 --> 00:35:57,529
because they don't just over one trying
to sell at a loss

732
00:35:57,529 --> 00:36:00,859
they want but i want to do you believe
it on

733
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:02,729
breaks down

734
00:36:02,729 --> 00:36:07,969
immediately rationale installer dorm
room around right

735
00:36:07,969 --> 00:36:09,329
so

736
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:12,519
for example if i had wanted everybody
had

737
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:15,029
everybody it's four o'clock

738
00:36:15,029 --> 00:36:16,919
spinal bailey

739
00:36:16,919 --> 00:36:20,469
investment session

740
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,619
and a lot of rain fell over

741
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:24,419
using

742
00:36:24,419 --> 00:36:25,059
accept him
