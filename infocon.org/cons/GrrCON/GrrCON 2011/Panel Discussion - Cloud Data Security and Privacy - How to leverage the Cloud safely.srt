145
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:47,919
one of the original

146
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,499

156
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,289
periphery subcommittees village in iran

okay so obviously there is the
businesses need to go there and and

184
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,600

188
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,610
so bothers me is a software support

189
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:13,240

if you're a defense the internet you can
do that

683
00:35:43,799 --> 00:35:47,699
but if you really have at least of all

correlational

750
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:34,559
what value do they should be acting

751
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:36,669
i didn't need to see

752
00:38:36,669 --> 00:38:39,810
eugene human resources consistently do
it

753
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:45,689
what's his role to get more information

754
00:38:45,689 --> 00:38:49,849

mohanty human resources inventory

756
00:38:53,889 --> 00:38:57,150
the extent of the matter is that at the
new security

00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:01,470
but maybe something he doesn't want to
be traveling to resign greedy or here

758
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,519
right now

759
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:04,639
for example

760
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:07,129
it's nice to know to be a role

761
00:39:07,129 --> 00:39:09,200
when it was really wrong manager

762
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,400
this is market development yet as part
of your security systems and windows

763
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:13,539
block

764
00:39:13,539 --> 00:39:19,799
but if all in one place here rip-off
grounds

765
00:39:19,799 --> 00:39:21,739

and then we go with different systems
yes i do you need i think so

770
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:35,429

00:39:38,989 --> 00:39:41,369
all fire one single person

773
00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:43,489
now whatever pc user

00:39:43,489 --> 00:39:48,309
with bob we can suck it up

775
00:39:48,309 --> 00:39:49,430
entertaining

776

778
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:54,929
pennies

779
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:56,639
resulting additives

780
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:58,329

783
00:40:06,769 --> 00:40:10,739
were born in general

784
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:15,529
role that doesn't work where most people
do not have the rating systems

785
00:40:15,529 --> 00:40:16,410
lawyer

786
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,069
information below

787
00:40:18,069 --> 00:40:20,879
if paintball turkeys unpopulated

788
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:22,389
and even in the world

789
00:40:22,389 --> 00:40:25,589
the roles in through that much of your
support

790
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,470
unless you have an activity

791
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:33,559
advances toward important for managing
vendor

792
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:35,109
so now we know that it is

793
00:40:35,109 --> 00:40:39,719
administrators and knowledge

794
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:41,649
frequent repetition but

795
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:45,709
the holocaust needing information here
okay

796
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:48,389
wrote for an extended

797
00:40:48,389 --> 00:40:49,629
judaism

798
00:40:49,629 --> 00:40:51,849
there's been a lot darker and more

799
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,939
pgp plus detractors

800
00:40:54,939 --> 00:40:56,749
if they're coming into town

801
00:40:56,749 --> 00:40:59,720
speaking deputy editor and my dad

802
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,239
so we can seriously affect

803
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:04,599
alas lots of where they want you to

804
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:06,689
there's a lot of the windows system

805
00:41:06,689 --> 00:41:09,489
and you can use your account for web
services

806
00:41:09,489 --> 00:41:13,622
one of the people at work i want to know
mr donahue wants to cut what you think

807
00:41:13,219 --> 00:41:14,589
we have ninety

808
00:41:14,589 --> 00:41:19,789
are interested would be prepared to use
that money

809
00:41:19,789 --> 00:41:22,529
olesco across the border or not

810
00:41:22,529 --> 00:41:24,089
where is that there is no way

811
00:41:24,089 --> 00:41:25,139
wasn't certain

812
00:41:25,139 --> 00:41:27,659
easygoing networks i have to do anything

813
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:31,519
if you go into that war is that we do
know i work on it

814
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:34,190
and by i think the basics of these laws

815
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:38,799
even higher tax on contracting

816
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:42,430
so it should be fall basic attributes
right out of our city

817
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:46,079
are very peaceful and my block

818
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:47,309
and the next decade

819
00:41:47,309 --> 00:41:49,709
you have to have the ability to listen
to him

820
00:41:49,459 --> 00:41:51,279
titanic and judi

821
00:41:51,279 --> 00:41:53,849
andrew agnew's environmentalists

822
00:41:53,849 --> 00:42:00,209
you don't have many things that you
wanted to have that based on your policy

823
00:42:00,209 --> 00:42:04,919
ability to try and use that as i went
through resulted from the union

824
00:42:04,919 --> 00:42:07,070
the aaa apparently there are

825
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,459

00:42:16,029 --> 00:42:17,439
inquiry into the next

830
00:42:17,439 --> 00:42:19,289
iraqi facilities

831
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:22,679
method where you are going to happen

832
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:26,909
alcohol has to get involved in germany

833
00:42:26,909 --> 00:42:28,899

834
00:42:28,899 --> 00:42:31,059
black finally did

835
00:42:31,059 --> 00:42:34,589
it doesn't work all our congressmen who
borrow

836
00:42:34,589 --> 00:42:36,839

837
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:37,829
over here

838

one hundred onto

841
00:42:46,549 --> 00:42:49,799
and they'd be able to get information
robbersons which is

842
00:42:49,799 --> 00:42:52,540
better meet your or our community what i

843
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,119
