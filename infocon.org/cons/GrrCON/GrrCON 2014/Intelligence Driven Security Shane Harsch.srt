1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,460
alright

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,790
so welcome to Friday your comp

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,839
I'm chain harsh seen solution principal
at

4
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:15,809
arce and that big fancy title

5
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,250
for consultant at large in just

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,859
general annoyance to the sales team arm
my

7
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,789
my role is really to help people
understand

8
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:30,759
the challenges there in the marketplace
today the challenges that are

9
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:34,200
EN the war all

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,340
know what's happening the the attack
surface

11
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,399
everything that they've got to deal with
and help them to process in a line of

12
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:42,239
course with

13
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,680
what are shaped does but the interesting
thing about what r say does now

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,910
is they were really moving into

15
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:54,640
that trusted advisor security program
management

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,920
development type role and that's very
different from

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,010
haha many tokens you wanna buy how much
corruption

18
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:07,880
me certainly we still do that but go

19
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,520
when you look at what's happening in the
world today when you look at what's

20
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,500
happened to us

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,110
historically right there are a lot of
things that we've learned discovered

22
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,470
along that journey

23
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,759
and that we really want to hell

24
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,890
everyone now in the out the world with

25
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:29,310
facing show one of the biggest changes
that we

26
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,720
realized is what's changed in

27
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,990
security operations and security program
management overall

28
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,399
what are the challenges that you're
facing how is it

29
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:45,259
that we can best help you adapt to the
world and we call that

30
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:48,969
intelligence-driven security regardless
of whether

31
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:53,399
you're looking at this from what arce
products you know you you

32
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,689
you could buy that's not what this is
about this is about

33
00:01:56,689 --> 00:02:01,539
changing your perspective on how your
security operations are running now

34
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:05,890
and why that change has to occur you
whether you partner with us you part or

35
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,270
someone else doesn't matter

36
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,729
the change has to occur we can't keep
doing the same the same things that

37
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,569
we've been doing for the last twenty
years

38
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,720
and expect success is insane right

39
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,520
so that's how we have to move it forward
to hopefully

40
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:26,440
that's the takeaway you get from today
this is nothing new

41
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,900
these are these are conversations that
you're having all the time

42
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,510
the sophistication peace

43
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:38,290
is one of my favorite pieces because a
lot of people assume that when we talk

44
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,910
about statistic Asian

45
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,010
that what we're talking about is all
they've got some new

46
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:48,390
you know new cloud-based got some some
new zero-day exploit in the answer is no

47
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,390
not really

48
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,850
right D exploits that we're seeing that
to get introduced

49
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:57,530
out in the environment a relatively
straightforward you know they're doing

50
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,230
the same types of things depend doing
last 20 years

51
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,319
what the sophistication speaks to you

52
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:07,030
is how smart they are about

53
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,290
how they deploy that attack

54
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,350
how much they know about your
environment

55
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:18,739
when they go into it right how much they
know about what targets to hit within

56
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:22,720
your environment and that's what we saw
firsthand

57
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,340
during our breach experience just

58
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,790
we were completely blown away how much
they knew about the

59
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:37,420
internal structure of our network right
in the past they wanted to take

60
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,519
to to get to their target which they
never achieved but nonetheless they knew

61
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,459
where they were going

62
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:46,049
and I was incredibly big surprise we
estimating

63
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:49,069
you're working with with the FBI in our
partners we estimate that they were

64
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:50,620
probably profiling

65
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:57,319
the organization for over a year and
that's the type of sophistication that

66
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,160
we're talking about

67
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,690
its debt patients it's that the
liberation it's not just a random

68
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,280
lash out let's go this site

69
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:12,280
it's knowing what they're gonna do about
in this is really

70
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,079
this is really the challenge that we're
facing is that we realize the security

71
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,440
teams are missing attacks

72
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,870
or you know when we look at certain
high-profile situations

73
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:26,580
they have fantastic teams

74
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,880
and fantastic technology and it's a
process that fails

75
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,009
and the process

76
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:38,020
in in in that situation we're talking
about company

77
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:43,110
like large retailer located soda that

78
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,430
the process failed because

79
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,560
a prioritization a business operations

80
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,740
right we can't we believe that we can
sustain

81
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,830
any downtime in in the conduct of our
operations

82
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,139
therefore we're not going to pursue the
syndicator

83
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:05,599
copper well turns out that was bad
choice

84
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:09,849
but it wasn't that it wasn't detected it
wasn't that they didn't have the right

85
00:05:09,849 --> 00:05:10,870
team in place

86
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:16,500
right we had a a failure a process well
now that failure process would get the

87
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,740
the recognition that it should that well
the next time this happens

88
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:26,409
yeah we week you know we will possibly
impact our business operation

89
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,490
but it's not it's not going to cost this
is much

90
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:34,280
as the potentiality and we recognize
that we're willing to accept that

91
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,470
it becomes a risk management
conversation and ultimately that's

92
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,430
all we want to have happen in security
operations

93
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:47,080
is to you be able to have that risk
management conversation

94
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,539
tap the confidence in our metrics the
confidence in our data

95
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:54,250
the confidence in our process to
continue that comp conversation from a

96
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,270
position of strength

97
00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:02,270
and and inform position

98
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,990
now slowing down right

99
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:09,010
where sheen a lot more activity then
we've seen

100
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:13,540
in previous years and still

101
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:18,100
this is the biggest challenge is dwell
time

102
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:23,320
in were giving the bad guys too much
time

103
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:28,419
in our environments the by the time that
we detect damn

104
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:31,720
it's too late in you already

105
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,190
they've already gotten their their pay
data and they've moved on

106
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,860
and you're just trying to pick up the
pieces to understand what was stolen

107
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,500
right so you can make a good accounting
to your board but

108
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,760
the reality is that's that's not gonna
work we meet you

109
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:52,789
rethink our approach to security
operations

110
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:57,450
Inouye that we put the system's and the
processes in place

111
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:02,320
that allow us to limit that 22 respond

112
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,830
with last time the mount wall time that
they need to

113
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:10,780
capitalize on preach so basically means
you get about it day

114
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,479
or chew to attacked validate

115
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,990
and remediate any incident that you
liked

116
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:21,650
go that's not a lot of time

117
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:28,110
now out at all

118
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:34,320
point-of-sale intrusions nobody can
detect

119
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,980
not reliably and show

120
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:41,640
work always looking at external parties
coming up and I DEF

121
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:48,020
mean it shouldn't be that way should
absolutely up

122
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,600
and unfortunately the trend lines

123
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,650
really aren't working in our favor up we
continue year-over-year

124
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,660
continue to see the lack I'll

125
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,640
response time and the majority
organizations

126
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,730
up that that have been breached up

127
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:13,310
and I think part of it is because

128
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,630
security is often thought love

129
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:20,580
as as a cost right is a cost center

130
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,760
a profit center to cost center and so we
want to minimize that as much as

131
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,490
possible

132
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:31,580
yes that's true however it's a lot more

133
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,289
like your personal hell it's a lot more
like

134
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:41,960
talking about health care there are lots
of things that we don't want to have to

135
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,880
pay for

136
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,880
but yet none of us really wants to die

137
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,610
and therefore we have to consider these
choices

138
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:55,820
in that context and yes businesses don't
die but businesses can cease to operate

139
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,870
in its very much that same conversation

140
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:03,410
if you make widget acts

141
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:08,020
and all your intellectual properties
stolen and now which it axes made for

142
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,210
one-tenth the cost

143
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,580
you can make it and introduced to the
market place

144
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,620
that will kill your business

145
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:19,320
and i've seen first hand in the
positions that

146
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,440
that I've occupied I in the industry

147
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,820
where you know i sat down to have a
conversation

148
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,200
wish the legal and operational
leadership to the organization to say

149
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,750
look

150
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:35,390
we know you spent four million dollars

151
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:40,060
supporting warranty repairs on parts
that you did not make

152
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:45,660
so your lack of information security for
their intellectual property

153
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:50,430
has a tangible cost when I'm talking
about brand impact or anything like that

154
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,230
has a tangible cost $2.4 million dollars

155
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:59,590
so now let's start to work through that
conversation unfortunately that

156
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,350
conversation was not well received

157
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:07,010
all and I don't work there anymore and
it's very much

158
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:10,850
a head in the sand type mentality and
that's

159
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:14,720
really what we gotta trying to pass a
lot of what we do when you guys all know

160
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,330
this

161
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:19,210
a lot of what we do isn't really expense

162
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:23,170
sure there's yo great awesome technology
out there

163
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:27,260
and my company and my parent company
would be more than happy to sell you a

164
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,740
truck loaded equipment

165
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,880
but at the end of the day it's about the
people

166
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,839
understanding what to do with the
information that they have and it's the

167
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:39,480
processes around how they do their job

168
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:46,480
that matters most in this is this is
essentially what what we have to do

169
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:51,330
you know what we have to be in this
constant state love

170
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:54,990
here we've got our are corporate Fitbit

171
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:59,500
on right and we're tracking constantly
testing constantly

172
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,830
always aware of what the state of our
current operational health is

173
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,290
and when something is amber aunt

174
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:10,290
then we look into it take

175
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,430
is this

176
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:15,720
significant enough that I need to take
action what of are

177
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,110
the criteria

178
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:22,650
for me to take action against the since
is it

179
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:26,350
is it noteworthy you're not right into
establishing that rigor

180
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:32,730
around how we deal with that were
missing attacks

181
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:36,790
there's a lot of things that are
happening

182
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,790
that your traditional controls can not
perceived

183
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:44,420
process network yet we all know that
things are happening

184
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,320
go so that's a point that we've got to
address

185
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,560
in our operation your standard blocking
and tackling technologies

186
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:59,090
your firewalls your IPS there absolutely
essential

187
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:02,150
would never proposed building a building
without doors that lock

188
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:07,570
go but at the same time just because you
have locked doors on your building

189
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,740
doesn't mean someone can't get in and
steal stuff

190
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:15,140
and this goes beyond a defense in depth
conversation

191
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,480
its what is the role of all the
technologies that you have in your

192
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,030
environment

193
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:23,520
efficiency

194
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,200
while it's great that

195
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,810
we can log into a server run TCP Dom

196
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,260
go get all that data pulled over to my
desktop

197
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,300
open it up in Wireshark start pouring
through it

198
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,750
open up our cm try to correlate that
with the logs

199
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:48,750
all of those steps take time and the
unfortunate thing is when

200
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,900
you take that time and realize 0 I'm
barking up the wrong tree

201
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,350
it wasn't a server I should've been
looking at that sir

202
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:01,070
or wasn't that poor on on course which
was this other ports and I really needed

203
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,930
to capture

204
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:05,950
not to mention the fact that if you
capturing after the fact

205
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,360
that's only going to work if the
compromise continues

206
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,040
that's not necessarily going to help you
with the compromise occurred two weeks

207
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,649
go show we have to make it possible

208
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:22,720
for your for your analysts to operate in
a more fish Chen

209
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,350
and timely manner them

210
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,970
and SIM isn't enough your

211
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:35,320
your traditional law collection analysis
is simply not enough that is a for Anzac

212
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,810
operation and to a certain extent it's
only going to validate

213
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:43,839
the impact that caused you to recognize
the breach in the first place

214
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:50,839
you need to become hunters

215
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:59,329
I would classify traditional security
operations is blocking tap

216
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,959
we put up as many walls as we can we
look at all the windows that we've left

217
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:08,990
open and we try to block anything that
matches known patents

218
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:13,190
up but that's about it that's about the
extent

219
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:16,440
traditional security operations and
fortunately

220
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,020
that's not giving us the visibility that
we need it still leaves you

221
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:25,920
as prep you do not take on the predator
role

222
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,589
in that type of situation in order to be
a predator

223
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:32,910
you have to be looking at things as
they're happening now

224
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:38,120
and always the wolf that moves up next
to the pond

225
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,440
hoping for deer to come up and drink is
going to sit there

226
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,440
for hours in hours looking at nothing

227
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,760
until that opportunity arrives any n

228
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:54,730
sees that pray move into position

229
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:59,000
we can spend all our time looking at
nothing

230
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,250
that would be completely inefficient

231
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,389
so something's gotta give and how the
hell that fits together

232
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:08,699
and it's really

233
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:12,519
this intersection visibility and now
Asus an action

234
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:16,170
we need to maximize the amount of
visibility that you happen to your

235
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,100
environment

236
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,060
we need to understand what actions are
going to result

237
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,160
from the things that you observed go

238
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,170
and we need to understand how that
analysis comes together how to keep

239
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,350
bridge from

240
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:34,139
visibility through the action what are
the criteria for us to take action

241
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:40,149
right now what we're seeing what we're
seeing firsthand with our customers and

242
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:40,769
I'm sure

243
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:43,860
possibly what your experience when you
look at

244
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,649
budgets associated with information
security this is a pretty fair

245
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:49,610
representation

246
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:52,769
what we see we got eighty percent

247
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:56,240
I'm prevention 15 percent on monitoring

248
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,680
and five percent on response year

249
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,170
incident response plan might be a
two-page document that says

250
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:08,709
well alice is going to take point and is
going to call

251
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:11,660
everybody on the senior leadership and
tell them what she's doing when

252
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,699
something bad happens

253
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:17,399
that oftentimes is the extended the
interest

254
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:24,399
that does not align with what we're
seeing in

255
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,290
what we're seeing in terms of the
attacker space right

256
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:35,089
if all these bridges are occurring in
all of this preventive technology

257
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:38,930
isn't stopping it

258
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:42,420
then why are we spending hollis money on
the preventative technology

259
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:46,649
if it's not going to work we

260
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:49,810
when you look at when you look at the
arse a breach which is a a poster child

261
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,050
example

262
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:57,750
0 how this can go bad we've got
two-factor authentication

263
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm getting into an our environment
around the world

264
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,569
right with the password rotation

265
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:10,510
every 30 days we do security awareness
training

266
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:14,199
to make sure that everyone's aware of
what the current challenges are

267
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:18,500
and were security company hi

268
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:23,119
when you look at our breach and the
thousand phishing emails that when out

269
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,770
17 individuals clicked on the attachment
in the email

270
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:34,540
and two people executed so if we eat

271
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,640
understanding our role in the industry
in the employees work there we've got

272
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,480
some pretty

273
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,840
security savvy just general general
employees accountants everything like

274
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,580
that understand the stakes

275
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,270
and yet we still had that happen

276
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:52,250
once they're inside wonderful

277
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:56,120
password hash replay the baboon just
moving laterally through the

278
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,000
organization moving towards targets

279
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,410
all of our preventive technology

280
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,990
did nothing right

281
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:11,770
actually didn't help much it was a
zero-day exploit so there's no signature

282
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,909
480

283
00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:17,879
so really causes us to think are we
spending up

284
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:23,649
our money on the right sayings and this
is fundamentally what we're proposing

285
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:27,389
is that you look at your budget and you
think really hard

286
00:18:27,389 --> 00:18:32,209
about what those tools are doing your
classic

287
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:36,849
you know I a classic red flag is one yet
week had an awesome I P ass

288
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:41,649
that we only have a detection mode okay

289
00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:46,289
so what's that doing for you right it's
generating a whole bunch alerts that you

290
00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:47,869
don't have time to do anything about

291
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:52,489
thanked 0 so think about where your
money's being spent

292
00:18:52,489 --> 00:18:58,039
and understanding that you will be
breached you will be compromised

293
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:02,159
so you have to have a plan for how you
respond to that an orderly fashion

294
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:05,200
and that plan can not stop

295
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,159
with the security organization right
it's got to go across

296
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:14,419
in the HR and operations into your
business leadership

297
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:17,159
and there has to be a plan that everyone
agrees upon it doesn't have to be

298
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:19,309
complicated it doesn't have to be
lengthy

299
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:22,829
you don't have a three-ring binder
binders filled with 400 pages

300
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:28,200
response actions but it has to be
comprehensive and has to be reasonable

301
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,749
to fit with your business risk profile

302
00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:33,759
and that's going to take time that's
going to take some expertise

303
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,559
be also to think about well what can we
do to her improve our visibility

304
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:40,759
right in taking a a classic

305
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:45,159
arce breach as an example what could we
do so that we could have detected that

306
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:46,059
that was happening

307
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:51,440
right when it did minute that that excel
file

308
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,369
was executed and started doing weird
things to you that machine into the

309
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:57,179
environment

310
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:00,989
how could we have no in because pretty
much

311
00:20:00,989 --> 00:20:04,499
any other attack that we're going to see
is gonna follow that pattern

312
00:20:04,499 --> 00:20:09,299
right it's going to end up leveraging
credentialed access

313
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:12,889
generally using the environment and the
way it was intended

314
00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:16,619
you know doing network access to
different machines but

315
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:19,359
we're going to see some aberrant
behavior out that and certainly we're

316
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:20,959
going to see some maverick behavior

317
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:24,719
in the memory of the compromised
machines so how can we improve our

318
00:20:24,719 --> 00:20:28,840
visibility

319
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,020
and that's where we see

320
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:34,440
there's a four-point data collection Dec
absolutely has to occur

321
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,780
full packets fall logs

322
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,920
and point disposition

323
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,770
I'm not talking about virus and NetFlow

324
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:50,140
is we recognize collecting

325
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:54,280
every packet that flows over your
network is probably a lot of notes

326
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,170
but when you look at your zones have
trust in when you look at the

327
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,270
architecture

328
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:02,690
love your organization your ingress and
egress points right

329
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:06,280
there there are very key points were you
know

330
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,990
that if there's a compromise that date
is gonna flow along that path

331
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:16,880
and that's where you need to collect all
packets

332
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,710
you want net flow from your extended
operation see you understand any factor

333
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:25,490
or any transition up the session that
was started coming through any of those

334
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,270
points

335
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:30,230
you need to understand what's happening
on the endpoint at all times

336
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:35,429
that then goes into some system that

337
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:40,280
we get some captured on dating rich
right that that is informed by

338
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,990
acid information business risk
information

339
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,559
what's on the target how valuable is it
how critical

340
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:51,090
is it to our organization that that data
not be compromised

341
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:54,610
is certainly that should change the
priority what's happe

342
00:21:54,610 --> 00:22:01,610
once all that date is put together

343
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:10,000
now we need to run some analysis on but
that analysis cannot be man

344
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,330
right it has to be automated there have
to be some heuristics that you set up

345
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:20,200
that are going to allow you to
essentially separate

346
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:25,169
the hay from the needles

347
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:28,049
so the you can focus only on those

348
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:32,639
events that might potentially be
incidents

349
00:22:32,639 --> 00:22:35,929
and to get that done number down to a
manageable level

350
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:39,440
and the more information that you put
into the system

351
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,519
from firewalls for IPS is from DLP

352
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:47,259
from server logs right more information

353
00:22:47,259 --> 00:22:51,960
you put into the system the more
intelligent

354
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:58,960
and the more refined the result should
be now the all that noise is out of the

355
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:03,979
way

356
00:23:03,979 --> 00:23:07,749
now that we're left with a pilot needles

357
00:23:07,749 --> 00:23:11,259
we have to decide which one of those
needles is the sharpest in which ones we

358
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:12,340
don't care about

359
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,049
so and arce

360
00:23:16,049 --> 00:23:19,169
are critical incident response center
which is headquartered in Bedford

361
00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:20,399
Massachusetts

362
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,729
is the Critical Incident Response Center
for

363
00:23:23,729 --> 00:23:27,479
arce as well as the entire EMC
Federation

364
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:33,279
go figure are say is the security army
BMC's of course that's what we do

365
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:38,149
we process $65 million the vans from
security devices per hour

366
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:43,200
so is coming in from our DLP
environments coming in from our IPS

367
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,389
environment firewalls

368
00:23:45,389 --> 00:23:52,190
everything 65 main event for our with
this approach with this methodology in

369
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,330
the technology that we

370
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:58,029
we employ that distills down to ninety
incidents per day

371
00:23:58,029 --> 00:24:01,259
right map to high medium in

372
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:05,590
and lower risk categories as informed by
our business risk on text

373
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:09,499
and that means with us after fourteen
individuals

374
00:24:09,499 --> 00:24:13,090
we can provide 24 by 7 incident response

375
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:18,080
to our entire global organization and if
we see

376
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,700
an increase in the number incidents as
is output by our automated analytics

377
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:28,080
at that point we have a risk management
conversation

378
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,010
right now for her start to see a trend a
hundred

379
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:35,890
110 incidents per day over time is it
gonna cut it anymore

380
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:40,040
show becomes a do we assume more risk

381
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,330
and two min our environment or

382
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:51,120
we hire more bodies because we know how
many ft ease map to the number of

383
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,570
incidents that we won managed

384
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:57,130
sure management conversation completely
supported by metrics

385
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:01,070
its no longer a wall my gosh we're
overwhelmed we don't know what to do

386
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:06,900
right we've got solid solid data so it
scales

387
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:11,410
if suddenly we're dealing with a hundred
million events per hour instead of

388
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:15,890
$65 million well we know that that's
going to you

389
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:19,320
cause a a requisite change in our
staffing

390
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:24,750
and that last bit there

391
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:31,700
integrating sock backs practices it
doesn't really matter

392
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:37,370
what your run book looks like as long as
its comprehensive in a long is a

393
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,580
achieve your objectives the biggest
challenge with you run book

394
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,490
of course is making sure that everyone
is

395
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:49,290
a hearing to it every step of the way so
in our belief

396
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:52,950
that means that that run book has to be
integrated into

397
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:56,000
the tool whatever that to Liz

398
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,750
and helps that analyst not not forces
damn

399
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:03,010
but enables them to follow it completely

400
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:06,730
and now also leaves behind a nice

401
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:11,560
track record love what was done so that
when it asks relates to a different role

402
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,980
that that person can pick it up

403
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:18,370
and know that everything should have
been done has been done

404
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:21,400
and that's a critical tweets

405
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,100
go

406
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,610
go

407
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:30,820
and it has to be modular I think it
would be

408
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:34,740
extremely arrogant a boss is a company

409
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:39,389
if we were to come to you and say you
know what we can help you rebuild your

410
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:40,139
security

411
00:26:40,139 --> 00:26:44,190
management program by you're gonna have
to get rid of all the technology and

412
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,279
tools that your ego

413
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:49,570
right I think you would be right to
pretty much throw us out

414
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:53,269
it have that were to happen because it's
an unreasonable position

415
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:57,169
so we have to understand how we can work
with this

416
00:26:57,169 --> 00:27:00,299
module early understanding caps

417
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:03,490
you know that might exist in those tools

418
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:07,710
and coming up with compensating controls
for them from a process perspective

419
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:12,340
in the shift is to

420
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:19,340
this concept risk-based data collection
that we need

421
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:25,669
our basic view of the environment what
has happened

422
00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:29,620
we need the deep view our up the
environment what is happening right this

423
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,409
moment

424
00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:35,740
completely because everything happens
over the network if you capture all the

425
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,620
packets

426
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,760
you should be able to figure out what is
happening

427
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,299
we need to be able to go wide so we know
the extent of the impact to the

428
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:45,130
organization

429
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:51,529
we have to be able to understand whether
or not an end point was compromised

430
00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:54,899
right when you look at the steps for
Internet handling

431
00:27:54,899 --> 00:27:58,139
and you get to your you move from
containment

432
00:27:58,139 --> 00:28:01,210
to eradication the most important part

433
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:05,070
at the end of a ratification is being
able to demonstrate we

434
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:08,230
got 100 percent up this

435
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:12,060
and for

436
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,310
have these exploits unless you

437
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:20,280
unless you have some way to you identify
its memory profile

438
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:24,780
as it's running and then to demonstrate
that memory profile doesn't

439
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,980
exist on any other machine you can't do
that

440
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:32,140
you can point to artifacts that exploits
a well

441
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:36,410
we don't see these ports open on all of
our machines

442
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:39,660
okay that's great that's good that's
helpful

443
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:44,390
but that's not proof right that exploit
could be sitting there in a dormant

444
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,140
state

445
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:49,180
and hasn't triggered yet you want to be
able to go and no

446
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:53,320
yes this exploit did Ron on these
machines or did not run on these

447
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:53,960
machines

448
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,280
you have to be able to demonstrate a
negative otherwise you won't have

449
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,630
you can't really sit there in full
confidence know that eradication is

450
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:02,400
being complete

451
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:09,300
go

452
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:13,270
organizations need to collect process
and story plot through data sources

453
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,580
including asset data

454
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:18,430
identity information network traffic
NetFlow endpoint forensic information

455
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,220
center

456
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:23,500
in this data volume is part of what
transforms yesterday security now says

457
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,580
in today's Big Data Security analytics
go

458
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,760
at a lot of data processed one

459
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,870
not gonna sugar-coated go

460
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:36,980
right there's a lot of data when you
start capturing four packets

461
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:41,310
and you start analyzing all your logs
and you start putting that all together

462
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:46,620
it is a lot of data but there are ways
to approach management of that data and

463
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,200
there are systems out there that can
help you manage that

464
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,710
the a dupe is a great example a running
against large datasets

465
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:57,950
and that can help you give visibility
into large data volumes

466
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:01,690
in so

467
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:05,640
what we propose is an
intelligence-driven architecture that

468
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,840
focuses on these

469
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,360
aspects ability did visibility brings
that real time data enrichment

470
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,480
put it into analysis that detection

471
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:21,480
is informed by live data feeds that are
coming from multiple sources

472
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:26,000
so you can understand or or more
importantly

473
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,490
the automated system understands what's
happening in the environment two day

474
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:35,620
and things to look for on that data sad

475
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:39,040
to minimize the amount of time that you
have to spend manually

476
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:44,720
analyzing and then that goes into your
security operations

477
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:51,720
motto whatever it is this is what we
think

478
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,750
it looks like this is the new model

479
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:04,650
for security operations management we
also have to recognize

480
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:08,820
that all of that data needs to be
archived

481
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,360
there's a difference between the data
that's valuable in the moment

482
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:17,090
and the data that you want to reach a
name for archival purposes for possibly

483
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:20,260
forensic purposes in the future or
should you miss something that you can

484
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:24,080
go back to go

485
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,290
if the average dwell time

486
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:32,160
that these exploits require is three to
four days

487
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,060
and we agree that in order to manage to
that

488
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:40,550
you need to get your response time down
to between one and two days

489
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:46,060
then realistically I don't need

490
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:49,540
30 days of live dado

491
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,590
right %um hey maybe

492
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:57,460
seven days 14 days at the most once the
operation is humming

493
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,790
go and then anything beyond that is

494
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:05,210
is an archive up because we should be in
a position

495
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:08,330
that we don't need to look back forty
five days

496
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:15,330
and understand what happens

497
00:32:17,129 --> 00:32:18,820
the power of this approach

498
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:22,109
is how much it enables

499
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:28,700
a single analyst do their job night said
earlier about what r Cirque model is the

500
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,989
sixty five main events to ninety
incidents

501
00:32:30,989 --> 00:32:34,200
which basically means that

502
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,999
the majority those incidents that pop

503
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:44,789
need to be evaluated in 10 minutes and
after 10 minutes

504
00:32:44,789 --> 00:32:47,799
that analysts has to decide

505
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:52,429
this is or is not an incident that we
need to respond to

506
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:55,720
then they can spend up to an hour

507
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,759
digging into that incident before they
escalate

508
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:02,830
so they can to go to through a two-stage
process

509
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:08,590
an arms length is this bad and if I
think it's back at arm's length

510
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:12,070
that i'm gonna spend up to an hour to
validate a and then after that our

511
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:15,629
either have to kill it or I have to send
it over to you

512
00:33:15,629 --> 00:33:19,580
a stage 2 investigation handed over to
one of our hunters

513
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,369
who's gonna then dig into it do a
malware analysis on it

514
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:26,830
Iran that they can spend up to you about
a day

515
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:32,460
going through but that's the power
having all this information available

516
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:39,460
to those tier 1 analysts because I

517
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:49,040
paint a complete picture go

518
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,080
and as I've been saying this really goes
beyond technology

519
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,340
they're great technologies out there
that can really help you with this

520
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,660
but fundamentally we've got to look at

521
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:05,730
what is your overall cyber defense plan
right

522
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:10,660
how are you planning to conduct a
incident handling what is your overall

523
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,860
strategy roadmap to move you

524
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:16,400
down the maturity path wanna get you up
to that

525
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:21,110
NextGen sock design and implementation
what does it mean to head be driving

526
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:25,630
a security intelligence team as opposed
to a security operations team

527
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:32,630
so those steps

528
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:38,440
just the initial planning and thinking
through what you want to accomplish

529
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,230
and understanding who within your
organization

530
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:46,800
would you have to work with and order to
enable a plan like this

531
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,330
understanding the tape a transformation
that we're talking about

532
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:55,770
him

533
00:34:55,770 --> 00:35:01,690
but the biggest challenge a ball is
really the staffing up this

534
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:06,400
we put brake technology in place we can
implement some great process East

535
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,850
but we've got to have the people that
are operated an

536
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:14,330
you know it's it's great to see everyone
here jerk on and these are the type of

537
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:15,810
people that were talking about

538
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:20,580
but it necessarily has to move beyond

539
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,720
just drawing from the pool I love

540
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,940
go computer experts

541
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,460
we have to think a little bit outside
the box

542
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:37,460
and fundamentally what we what is it
that we walked out of a security analyst

543
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,400
puzzle-solving go

544
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,830
troubleshooting we want someone has a
mindset

545
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:50,610
to say this doesn't look quite right I
need to figure out what's broke in and

546
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,370
where are the missing pieces

547
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:55,650
go

548
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:58,890
we can train them up on the fundamentals
and networking

549
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:02,110
or Windows system administration those
are dozer

550
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:08,450
easy thats cut-and-dried but if they
don't have that puzzle solver mentality

551
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:12,100
it they're never going to be successful
with it

552
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:16,660
the other thing that makes hackers
amazing people

553
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,150
is the fact that they can visualize n
think

554
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:25,080
and move beyond the original form of
whatever it is that they're looking at

555
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:31,350
and they can try to do something outs
with it

556
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:36,090
what are the best success we had in our
in our own Cirque

557
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:39,880
was we hired a diesel mechanic as a tier
one analyst

558
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:44,210
other using Internet Explorer he didn't
know much about computers

559
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:48,090
but he knew

560
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:51,090
he could visualize an entire engine in
his head

561
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:54,780
and when he heard something in that
engine based on its sound he knew where

562
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,390
it was

563
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:59,020
malfunctioning and what part up the
engine was probably malfunctioning and

564
00:36:59,020 --> 00:36:59,600
therefore

565
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:03,720
how to go and get it and get and fix it
and

566
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,540
I'm happy to say that after two years
he's becoming whatever hunters

567
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:11,800
he's moving up to a tear to roll because
he

568
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:17,200
he really understands the objective that
they're trying to achieve

569
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,650
now yes it did require us to train but

570
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:26,000
that's the fundamental outlook that we
want to see

571
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,520
in our analysts more show then

572
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:36,110
10 years of Cisco networking experience
go

573
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:40,590
so one other things we did our say is we
put together

574
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:44,920
a security operations module

575
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,260
or model that reflects what we do in our
own Cirque

576
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:53,770
and we asked ourselves what skill sets
are necessary in each of those positions

577
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:54,240
because

578
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,360
we know those people are going to be in
those positions for ever

579
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:01,200
right they are either going to advance
up

580
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,810
through promotion or they're going to
advance out

581
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:09,520
other opportunities and we want to see
people succeeding in this

582
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,660
industry so we certainly can have an
old-school corporate mindset that we

583
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,390
want to hold them back and we never want
to train these individuals

584
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:22,830
right so now out of necessity we said
we've got to be able to provide the

585
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,020
right skills

586
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:27,170
not just the computer skills but the d

587
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:32,200
the analysis skills necessary to do this
and that's the thing you need to think

588
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,940
about your own staffing model

589
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:38,580
when you look at the positions that you
occupy what is your plan

590
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:43,980
for turnover what is your plan for

591
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:47,570
when those champions that you have in
those roles that have been with the

592
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,890
company for maybe 10 years finally
decide elite

593
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:53,860
right how do we move away from the hero
base model

594
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:57,360
up security in it. and get to something
that is more

595
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,380
stead more reliable

596
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:05,810
so we broke we broke down

597
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:10,270
into three tiers so level 1 level 2
level 3

598
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:14,540
and understanding the types of skills
they need from base

599
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:19,000
I told a German analysis to into the
handling response in understanding the

600
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,980
fall

601
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:25,000
process not just standing in front of
the console in going through the steps

602
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,470
that

603
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:29,050
that we're reinforcing with virtual but
then also understanding threat

604
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:29,770
intelligence

605
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:33,290
what does it mean to conduct could
threaten tell jeans where the skills

606
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:34,530
necessary there

607
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:39,619
what and then moving up finally to Mauer
now sitting it now getting into the

608
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:44,070
to the département and then be able to
understand how all that comes together

609
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:47,490
sorry are sever defense workshop is
actually about

610
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:51,160
having the whole team work together
doing

611
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,950
mock incidents and handling that in a
controlled setting

612
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:58,369
go so this is what enables

613
00:39:58,369 --> 00:40:01,810
are go Critical Incident Response Team

614
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:05,570
to continue to grow and operate go

615
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:12,570
in these courses are all available to
the public as well what so why

616
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:18,369
are we doing this not just arce but we

617
00:40:18,369 --> 00:40:21,369
as security professionals why would we
talk about

618
00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:24,760
shifting our approach to this
intelligence driven approach

619
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,630
the benefits are the

620
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:33,630
the top one right there we want to be
able to detect analyzed before

621
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:37,190
attacks impact the business it's the
business

622
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:44,190
impact that we want to avoid we know
we're gonna be breached but let's at

623
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:45,760
least stop them

624
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:52,760
before they take anything that we have
complete capacity

625
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:59,410
to investigate prioritize and remediate
and complete clarity and how to do so

626
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:04,819
that your team can grow and evolve

627
00:41:04,819 --> 00:41:09,109
value working at your organization
because the opportunities that it

628
00:41:09,109 --> 00:41:10,300
provides

629
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,920
and those are opportunities that are not
only going to allow them to succeed

630
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,349
within your organization

631
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:19,410
but allow them as a career professional
to move upward and onward

632
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:26,410
outside the organization so that

633
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:33,450
that's what we mean by
intelligence-driven security is changing

634
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:34,319
the approach

635
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:38,430
visibility analysis and action
