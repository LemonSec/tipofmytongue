million soul

28
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,869
which again is five times mean yes
populations so

29
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:52,090
request small but us if you

30
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,700

side

38
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,570
on a good site we have cell one company
called across

39
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,030

trial because done in

43
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,150
escorts and presented by screening

44
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,640
have

45
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,670

today

62
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:55,230
Sol be gonna be talking about the ball
to a hundred mobile application soul

63
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,840
ATK basic stuff analyzes how how do we
do it

64
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,489
static dynamic Andrew I will be showing
your arm

65
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:05,859
them all quite a few demos all of a tool

66
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:10,920
that to me actually made it so are you
receive it you can have a lot of let the

67
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,440
fun

68
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,940
Richter and certification and are you
gonna see that

69
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,470
you can cheat almost any gain and black

70
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:25,470
hemlines call to you unless so okay
who's actually using Kendrick okay

71
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,900
everybody iraq yes

72
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,139
so orchard drink evander publication

73
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:38,539
presentation no I'm just getting jizzed
just welcome truck i cant

74
00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:41,810
so worried today of actually there are
here

75
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:46,650
quite calm living in a quite complex
working order for just take a look at

76
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,500
that I enjoyed

77
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,669
all equal system you see that there are
a lot of love

78
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:55,320
well different kind of points and
locations

79
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,520
obligation frameworks and Clyde recent
section where

80
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,889
and everything that goes with it enjoy
I'm

81
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:06,349
on the other hand we also have all

82
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:10,970
lotto reliability inside a mobile
application are 40 fire

83
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:14,090
0 poster so

84
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,460
last year on research and they found out
that mind

85
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,770
and mobile application have some kind of
lost inside

86
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,830
arm although this reports

87
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,930
arm let's say one year almost one year
all

88
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,260
what they think this thanks haven't
changed that much

89
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,349
maybe in my now it's like seven or eight

90
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:36,810
mobile applications have different kind
when abilities but

91
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,189
its bill I it's still interesting call

92
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:44,020
or got mobile application and this one
is

93
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:48,020
more recent so in a Sept I'll

94
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,520
they found it so a lot of mobile
applications

95
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,969
so oh man in Middlesex just

96
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:58,889
they're just not are properly validated
SSL Certificates

97
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:03,550
graciously connections & Co

98
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:07,139
definitely there are some other frank's
like there's definitely a need

99
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:10,330
big need for testing mobile application
because a lot of requests

100
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,349
all started from began

101
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:16,689
and then last year I and some sometimes

102
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:21,129
when you're looking at the mobile
applications reflect now the

103
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:24,960
source called when you look into source
called terror or

104
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,039
forcing the source concerts like my
tonight developments in OB

105
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,060
because you can find love lotto I'll

106
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,949
mighty basic misconfiguration basico

107
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:39,979
failure sings for school and assists
talking on

108
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:43,330
from our experience because we have been
seeing be analyzed a lot of

109
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,349
modifications

110
00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:48,580
so actually writes this is still

111
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,259
up present for ECR actual because
manager

112
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:55,439
stare focus on the due dates and I'll go
first

113
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,960
focus on the futures not the security
and then dnt

114
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,680
uses actually don't care about security
so if we would go

115
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,050
well I'll get a picture kind of like
this

116
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:12,149
I'll so I the antigen all developers the
bad guy I'll because everybody's after

117
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:12,919
him

118
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:16,419
after manager are you implying so

119
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:20,000
today we gonna be doing a little bit
through worse engineering to date the

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,509
case

121
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:23,830
up before that we need to go back to
basics

122
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,919
now see how I'll actually Hollister

123
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,460
things I Tom ha should you do it so
awkward it already

124
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,020
took apart some I'm a pic /a and
certification

125
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,669
are on okay gonna see direct from the
guy

126
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:42,920
recipe ru gonna see that it's not that
hard

127
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,200
was a cart mile mile

128
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,360
and you get it back to us pretty good
source quotes are from

129
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,630
from from replication arm

130
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,690
so what's actually a pic 8 just got
basics are advocates

131
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,840
andric package for my its nothing
wardens

132
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,850
specials that also you can just three
name it

133
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:08,050
on your end all sorry or all I'll make
arrests

134
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,190
to as if fired and Jess I'm packet all
normally its

135
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,570
written exclusively in giallo with some

136
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:19,000
made to fly brewster might be written in
c/c++ plus plus

137
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,110
they have lotto other components like

138
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,580
to riches tourists broadcasters here's
the they're not and

139
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,070
can't restore so off from a developer
sites in all

140
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,810
all what does this mean you have some
kind of source calls you have the

141
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,260
resources like images

142
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,860
I'll stylized and other assets

143
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,880
you package them are you create

144
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,890
followed by court goes to class
inspector

145
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:50,120
you sign it anti-pollution publisher to
a Google

146
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,690
all crystal Sol

147
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,520
how hard it is to get for CPK if you
want to analyze its

148
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,820
you have to help so easiest way would be
copy from the phone right

149
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,900
taken from phone or you can pull it from
the phone

150
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,500
or you can take it from a backup or you
can you from

151
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,460
taken from a web on a web page it good
download it for you

152
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,760
so you don't need any Google Google
account or

153
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,800
oh there's another way you can download
it from a non trusted source like

154
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,530
for example Russian Foreign and all

155
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:29,810
1 store who wants to install

156
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:33,800
some kind of and certification from

157
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:40,140
Russian on the ground for you might find
that guys that

158
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,180
they also go a wager

159
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,360
google it can I just five type a pic 8
you will get a lot of

160
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,360
AP case from so

161
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,589
the next step toward if you have an AP K

162
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:54,750
so you have if you want to reverse its
back to those

163
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:59,880
for scorching heat from some tools going
so all actually girls

164
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,400
normal unit on to love them three of
them the defense

165
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,800
on which level you wanna go but normally
text majorities

166
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,830
won the way to go I am and if you're
kind of amazing and you don't want to

167
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,010
use all kind of

168
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:19,630
all my see come online tools you can go
to the compiler enjoyed a calm

169
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,980
you just upload it or you're a PK and it
does it for you

170
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,320
so you get the source you get back
source Co

171
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,950
Sol I it's very

172
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:33,680
simple process as be set so it for one
for example you wanna pick from the

173
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,140
phone

174
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,140
you just pull put it on from your phone
you know unzip it

175
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:41,660
or just called X jar and all you know
arm

176
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:46,260
with a JD degree arpa you use it and you
get the source code

177
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:51,029
so are going to just show you that's
really that simple

178
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:55,279
so I just followed its one on

179
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,360
Singh

180
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:05,360
long so we have our

181
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:15,639
18 PK here

182
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:19,309
also is what sets

183
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:23,119
is ex-juror jar

184
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:26,429
one game that we gonna play a little bit
later

185
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:30,829
and claw now what we're doing here the
compiling from 20

186
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:34,139
Dallek classes docked x5 rection

187
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:37,279
described us the composite and get your
jar pot

188
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,509
so if you're familiar with the dollar
store since you know that that the jar

189
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:44,819
the jars are actually well

190
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:48,809
white coats which contain so charla are
trying to prove a class

191
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:52,319
so if you wanna see it what's actually
in sight

192
00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:57,610
just go it's just go and see and you
will notice that

193
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:02,589
sometimes I'll that sometimes you have a
problems

194
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:06,809
or scrotum start I'll

195
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:10,509
sure I'll

196
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:13,589
cool you this

197
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:18,730
this is one one class they compile its
sewers it back

198
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:22,009
and do you notice something special
about that

199
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:25,439
if you go with your classes lanphear

200
00:12:25,439 --> 00:12:28,860
a ABC

201
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:33,290
so they're quite good developers write
who understands what the

202
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:37,850
and the Class A and Class B and Class C
or actually what is done

203
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,759
what what did they do before day I'll
publish it to the Google

204
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:47,049
look like there i insert some kind of
office cation

205
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:50,100
also its really want to make

206
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,399
are a liar noise of Panther service or
security researcher sore

207
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,379
security analyzer you know it's really
really hard from why because

208
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:01,779
now we have to have in your mind in
order this class

209
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:05,860
its some thinking all the glass a mean

210
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,959
I don't know what and there are some
kinda very able to see inside to see

211
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:10,339
that

212
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:15,079
they're a very able Zvonareva be be a
waiver CNN's

213
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:19,169
sometimes arm not everything gets the
compulsory

214
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:22,220
cadre up kind of harm

215
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,670
part called him a brother sometimes you
know it's really good to see what's

216
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,649
actually in there

217
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:30,999
why because it lets me see if you wanna

218
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:34,739
you democrats are it's really good to
check

219
00:13:34,739 --> 00:13:37,839
what kind of methods harder for example

220
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,660
auto we have here to the

221
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,089
dump answers I'll so

222
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:50,179
might be interesting summer born quentin

223
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:55,149
later but you're gonna see I gonna be
I'll are showing on the democrat

224
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:59,649
this method great the really good are
good

225
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:02,720
really helpful if you call it came

226
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,309
I during the game play saw

227
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:09,910
as you have seen its not that it's not
the cart

228
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,779
to get back to the source code om

229
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:17,649
and if you're lazy one there's of Dexter
a dick slaps .org

230
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:22,699
or you're just register and you just
uploaded a pic /a and it does lot of

231
00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:23,480
stuff for you

232
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,170
so it gets you an ally style kind
permission is using

233
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,399
it actually runs application ceaser you
can

234
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,540
you can get there P cap so you see what
sexual is handing over to the network

235
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,790
and thought some other some other
interesting stuff

236
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:42,139
sorry shirley's 1 that's the way to do
it okay so

237
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:47,179
Maori reversed reverse-engineered or a
PK so we gotta

238
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:50,279
kind of source called almost source cock

239
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:54,610
and 31 to analyze it so if you want to
analyze it what

240
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:58,959
do you need to know boosts

241
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,339
Java developer who has been programming
from job developers

242
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:06,230
okay will see that y'all

243
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,639
it's not necessary to be super duper
Jolla developer

244
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:14,470
to all to all analyzing

245
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,550
up but she need to know a little bit how
bill

246
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:22,199
all programming languages look like all

247
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:25,690
if you're going through a static
analyzers you don't see all top dollar

248
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,959
run 10 replies so

249
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,430
when the application is running what it
send it to the server what is getting

250
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,410
back as a reply

251
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:36,250
you don't see that are we have seen that
sometime soon although

252
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:40,600
applications already office Kate and her
name and what's the most important

253
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,170
think when you're analyzing the AP case
it's that you identify important segment

254
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:45,759
and a coke

255
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,970
what would be important satin segments
in the court like

256
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:53,209
right thing to do. database

257
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:57,350
sending to the server doing some kind of
critical stuff that's

258
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:03,089
interesting and tell ok from our Spanish
like 20 percent from the coach it's

259
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:03,750
really

260
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:08,040
important so need to check it other 80
percent it's not

261
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,870
that rally were interest so you're
looking at the source called

262
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,339
so you're doing static analyzer send
some things need to be

263
00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:20,040
all lucky you know that button at the
grueling all

264
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,699
ferial issue lucky so a all

265
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:27,269
let's try to read some Java

266
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:31,360
Jolla caught by the mall its is visible
in a so

267
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,860
can somebody guess what's actually up
doing this

268
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,459
all this piece of coats from Java

269
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:42,389
if you to compile it you can get your
you get the same

270
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:46,560
a saying a same results anyone

271
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,790
so this is

272
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,490
kind of server right I

273
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:57,370
are calling API safety got PHP

274
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:03,350
what would be do and I'll give you a
hint that that

275
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,589
actually to gain so what with came to

276
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:10,550
if it's going for saying some stuff to
the server

277
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:17,550
saving game the Act you see here have
two parameters

278
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,480
so one ST one issue what would be you

279
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,690
user yeah user ID so milan is winning
the game what would be DT

280
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:34,100
if you're playing a game score

281
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,490
yeah so the score so all

282
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,850
and the fact you're looking at that kind
of laws

283
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:44,340
source called the compiled from a mobile
app mobile lol

284
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,179
Android game and how would you cheat or
how would you

285
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:51,480
out to look what kind of the tools you
would you need

286
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,120
to arm to be due first that journey

287
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,740
that well you want to do that your name
is going to be first one on the left

288
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,990
what kind of tools would you need what

289
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,140
proxy wind that

290
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,300
would you need approx are just go
through though

291
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,620
you're all pressure all in a web browser
it would work

292
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,920
so you should just say PSR your score

293
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:20,380
soul I don't welcome millions and US in
your username and

294
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,780
you're done subject you can see that
from law firm all from all

295
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:29,150
doing spectacle analyzes officer Scott
are sometimes here you see

296
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:33,830
also kinda this most so those there's a
new server

297
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:37,540
going through all using SSL connection
to some pack

298
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:41,960
and furious username and here's a
password

299
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,179
so you can get this some kind of also

300
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:49,520
user names and passwords just mom
looking at those stores call toll

301
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,550
Android applications and if you're not

302
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:56,460
feeling lucky enough venue get this

303
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,140
not saw total the conformational dollar
stores Corp

304
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,610
and some kind of security tokens in some
kind of

305
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:07,540
really interesting Creek to stop okay

306
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:12,670
if you're doing dynamic to analyze its
what would what we normally do

307
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:16,840
our we just start-up approx Rs

308
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,900
already mention from someone before and
I'll see what's actually

309
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,799
the application setting back backing for
you can do the bugging

310
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,890
now but you said that

311
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:31,640
you took apart already application did
you do also the bugging

312
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:38,120
a separate little bit well the fun a
pain in the ass

313
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,330
yes or the body hits you know I'm if you
wanna

314
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:45,470
do some kind of raw met a in real time
knowing when you add a budding

315
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:50,590
step-by-step you know going to the
nights repainting that anther

316
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,799
way it's using reflection and you're
gonna see it

317
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:58,510
what dream what we done I'll with my
colleague and to initiate

318
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:03,440
much more much more easier so if you
wanna test it should just start similar

319
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,610
to read the proxy

320
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:08,169
misinterpretation and more later and use
kinda who's using

321
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:11,720
work for lap other tools

322
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:17,690
out the purpose really she really cheap
and really good luck so if you wanna

323
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:21,470
youths its it's a way to go did

324
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,500
then you just run application fee ok I
know for also requests and replies are

325
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:25,960
going

326
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,990
are back at fort and maybe for good

327
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:32,640
also if you check the logs stumps
precious another files that are

328
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,929
application success I excess so
different from normal kind of

329
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:41,320
request that you see and sexually they
requested going

330
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,860
call thats that supplication that we
have been

331
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,690
a the compiling instance using to see
the request

332
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:52,299
of maybe its interests interesting to
hear that

333
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:55,790
every request that's going to the server
it sending some

334
00:20:55,790 --> 00:21:00,929
also your piece of information from your
device can anybody tell what this is

335
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:07,929
what that would be

336
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:09,679
mac Address yeah

337
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,409
sold your device is sending mack address
to the server and all

338
00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:16,730
why why is this because they're doing
Khao

339
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:20,659
there %uh identify anchor device just
setting the mac Address

340
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:24,399
soul and also other love the other
interesting stuff

341
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:28,899
and what you're getting back all if
you're

342
00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:32,509
going to man in the middle know
sometimes you get

343
00:21:32,509 --> 00:21:37,470
this back can anybody the code what this
is just looking at it

344
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,779
yeah

345
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:46,309
me had former first group you I would
also say basics before but if you try to

346
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:47,429
decode base64

347
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:51,269
its little bit the french know it's in
cryptic dance top 40

348
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:54,320
but you're gonna see that's actually all

349
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,039
results of the game if what we gonna
play it

350
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:03,990
know sexually shouldn't summers are so
you cannot decode so what else do we see

351
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,950
Albany we are analyzing a mobile
applications

352
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:11,429
some 100 bucks from receipt different
fortifications

353
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:16,059
pension system looks so you should check
very sure during tantalizes

354
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:19,200
some kind of special identify risk are

355
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,080
inappropriate day to start in local C
koon database like your usernames

356
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,029
passwords that through your blog
interpretations logging on

357
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:30,070
internal IP addresses their love banking
application

358
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:33,120
there are exposing internal IP addresses
just

359
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,539
developers forget the take them out
before

360
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:41,690
are going to production some kind
sometimes and you also see hardcoded

361
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:42,899
user names passwords

362
00:22:42,899 --> 00:22:48,049
and I also stress cases slacks inside
the coat

363
00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:52,279
all which also contains the usernames
and passwords protests

364
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:56,549
testing environment okay so we have seen
now

365
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:59,950
call a little bit spectacle I'm alive
from the number clan alive

366
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:04,299
but there's some other stuff there we
gonna talk okay reflection

367
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:08,100
what is reflection that so you're using
it lol

368
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:14,440
repair tool so it's actually ability to
inspect the namic to the classes are

369
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,260
at the wrong time so it's actually like
job looking good Joe

370
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,420
trolling all just this year on I'll

371
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:26,180
are your own classes and the methods and
attributes:

372
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,740
arm was different

373
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,390
know if you're using the body versus
reflection because with the reflection

374
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,270
you get the relief

375
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:38,100
high-level view you got all the objects
you got all all methods

376
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,370
are you can excess so you can read

377
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:45,980
albright you can change our
interconnection you get interaction with

378
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,530
your application you can

379
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:53,230
also do this if for example if just so
all methods into or reverse

380
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:56,590
I'll even if they were declared to
privatize

381
00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:00,190
private or protected sorry come do

382
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,420
do it all so the fact you have all

383
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:07,330
dressed all variables can change it
called my pics

384
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:10,380
are you can write your %um Jolla coat
and

385
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,680
send it to the application and so it's
gonna be

386
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:18,370
all executors so the other friends that
we are using kids Bichel

387
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:23,710
hurts anybody use Bichel it kind of job
to interpret took interpreter

388
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:27,360
it's really small it scripting language
and saw

389
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,700
its really fun to play with it and
sometimes

390
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,860
vibrant did we choose it because
sometimes you're also

391
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:37,620
kinda lazy and we don't wanna do it all

392
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,100
also be used to be shell okay so we have
a

393
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,640
study guide the dynamical analyze its we
have a reflection

394
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,330
but we're re 12 some more so

395
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:51,890
are weird digging deeper of our tongue

396
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:56,430
owning the research and desist what came
out

397
00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:00,340
this research high-tech Julia tool all
bitches

398
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:03,740
public %uh market Cup you can use you
can play it I will get

399
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:07,850
fell you're all at the AGM so we created
a fixie

400
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:11,010
so what does work seen actually dust

401
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:16,510
decks it takes a picky wreckage inject
some kind of all services in sight

402
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:20,380
and be shell and other all stuff that
we're using

403
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:24,760
and you can connect it and then are you
can interact with a trained at

404
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,039
at the wrong time so this is how

405
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:31,479
the French are made of so we have a
night Android saw

406
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:36,749
device you have your own approved AP K
and sure be rejecting

407
00:25:36,749 --> 00:25:41,710
field service ambition livor be shared a
lot Robert library which is used all

408
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:46,239
for some mock interaction and executing
Java Oracle

409
00:25:46,239 --> 00:25:50,070
of your connecting over 80 be are using
TCP

410
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:53,529
and we have really are

411
00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:56,759
really all it's a complicated green

412
00:25:56,759 --> 00:26:00,879
that I'm gonna short little bit later so
actually what does this

413
00:26:00,879 --> 00:26:04,889
she bash script I know berchenall
regarding the show show: shock now

414
00:26:04,889 --> 00:26:08,349
bash it's not too bright rates group but
no

415
00:26:08,349 --> 00:26:12,429
I it's actually a better script what is
it about what does it do

416
00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:16,779
so it copies a PK it unzips of go

417
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:20,409
back smallest classis no I and thats are
called

418
00:26:20,409 --> 00:26:24,080
inside then my dog then smaller back to
classes decks

419
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,809
change hand-written manifest why we need
to change it because we really want to

420
00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:30,190
chat some kind of commissions

421
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:33,580
are replace its removes all signature

422
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:38,389
signed the Camp and install its and
start the service and stars agree and

423
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:40,089
accuracy that's it's really

424
00:26:40,089 --> 00:26:44,339
easy to our it's easy to use so what do
we get free texting

425
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:48,039
reaction cat chest all objects

426
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:51,779
we can execute methods are you re you
can even

427
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:55,009
program it around am runtime: gonna see
how

428
00:26:55,009 --> 00:26:59,849
done so are just before I'm gonna show
it could the demo

429
00:26:59,849 --> 00:27:03,700
you the dishes degree that's actually
running there so

430
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,539
whole stop so here we have to all
application to classes

431
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:10,879
are sexually run lot its runtime

432
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:14,070
so you see that you have class issue had
two methods you have

433
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:19,539
all kinda stuff all along the right side
to be happy lawyer info about classes

434
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:22,289
and also watch it so if it's some kind
of girl you

435
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:25,599
were able it's important you can %uh do
it and here

436
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:27,470
digits writer John McColl

437
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:32,980
and crawl when you execute its actually
executed inside the application okay

438
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:38,460
are who likes demoss have you seen
enough denmark also at the Grove condo

439
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:44,120
%uh so-so okay I'll let right through
all

440
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,960
that tried to see it I was asked if I
pray to the democrats

441
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,570
I'd heaven but I'll let try our luck

442
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:55,700
okay com Showtime

443
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:01,409
home just

444
00:28:01,409 --> 00:28:05,870
she search

445
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:08,880
occur com

446
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,720
here you can see of screen of my phone

447
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,760
so I'm not using camera later career
like

448
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,490
the real hard work although it's kinda
alt it's broken and

449
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:23,419
so a kind of slow but well but anyway

450
00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:26,789
so sure if I play it and see that's

451
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:30,070
interacting so sure have a home phone
call

452
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:33,789
and follow 0 now let's start one

453
00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:36,860
are let's start

454
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:41,409
long one application on the phone and
circle

455
00:28:41,409 --> 00:28:48,409
action going he seemed

456
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:55,760
strong sometimes stops working

457
00:28:59,859 --> 00:29:00,269
see

458
00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:03,879
works he has already know harmful

459
00:29:03,879 --> 00:29:07,080
your interpretation was not running its

460
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:11,350
showing the well

461
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,380
come onto

462
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,130
host see that the

463
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:20,330
it already has some kind of publications

464
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:24,850
are insight so if we gonna go with the
right click

465
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:28,190
you see that you're getting caught
runtime: all

466
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:31,409
a all applications and so

467
00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:35,840
variables directly are from the from the
application itself

468
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,100
and so he received it

469
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:43,539
there are some of the Ravens are all on
the red

470
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:47,840
color arm this means that the were able
to stitch

471
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,010
or change from the last three for our on
the left so

472
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:52,760
refresh

473
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,730
to among to

474
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:00,610
I'm to

475
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:06,160
let's try it mom all class democrats

476
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,190
to something's really hard to

477
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:13,440
I'll to rights to

478
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,160
we me

479
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:24,630
work to

480
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:29,690
I'm mmm

481
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:32,870
kids are good on and use search

482
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:35,870
go on and then shoulder ok 30

483
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:39,270
demos om

484
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:45,639
while okay

485
00:30:45,639 --> 00:30:49,669
I'll phone is it would think and saw

486
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:52,820
meanwhile we will expand a little bit
more what's be

487
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:56,229
are researched it go further have to
change in KPK

488
00:30:56,229 --> 00:31:00,639
so last year all something all CCC
congress

489
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:04,349
her in Germany between girl Christmas
every year and a new

490
00:31:04,349 --> 00:31:08,190
New Year are there have been fun
presentation

491
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:12,119
%uh done by calling winner and she had a
really good

492
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:15,429
saw dynamic dole work instrumentation

493
00:31:15,429 --> 00:31:18,749
our presentation about that so she can

494
00:31:18,749 --> 00:31:21,789
actually hook are doing droid so

495
00:31:21,789 --> 00:31:25,820
native calls soul all people in a bit in
all

496
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:29,099
thinking can reuse this an hour

497
00:31:29,099 --> 00:31:33,549
research so all we were a little bit
clearer searching little bit more

498
00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:36,719
and what we found out that we can do the
same

499
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:40,019
Frank without changing AP case so what

500
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:43,479
are we doing are we to kiss

501
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:48,539
a private some kind of his from case
examples so instead of changing KPK

502
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:49,499
speak

503
00:31:49,499 --> 00:31:54,219
actually hijacked running processes are
in our case this is the court process

504
00:31:54,219 --> 00:31:56,849
midsection loath rape case from I'll

505
00:31:56,849 --> 00:31:59,969
are all from aw

506
00:31:59,969 --> 00:32:03,759
from Android reject sharp library
interprocess

507
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:07,279
and really injector Rick seen and to all
the leverage that

508
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:11,029
me that are needed inside this so inside
this process

509
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:14,289
so all what do we get beat dis

510
00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:19,209
I'll actually mean drug gets rid of
change in Cape the case anymore

511
00:32:19,209 --> 00:32:23,299
so we're cooking the native methods I'll

512
00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:27,289
and we are getting the same same kind of
effect I'll

513
00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:30,859
what's difference the difference that
that you need a rooted phone

514
00:32:30,859 --> 00:32:35,059
the first method you didn't you me you
don't need to read

515
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:39,700
Georgia phone so its was working create
a PK song mum

516
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:44,039
rooted phone and you could duties in the
so lets you

517
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:46,850
this is smile

518
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:49,010
I'll working with coverage better

519
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:52,630
to get them all cans

520
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:58,109
with him I go

521
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:02,330
well not just see

522
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:06,580
on I'll

523
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:10,340
was I'll

524
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:17,340
because I really had that are

525
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:23,479
hard time getting up to its source to
Internet

526
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:26,909
because here we don't have on

527
00:33:26,909 --> 00:33:30,320
were from stable wifi

528
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,389
and I hope my

529
00:33:33,389 --> 00:33:37,399
that know once though her my WiFi
network

530
00:33:37,399 --> 00:33:41,529
sets mom try

531
00:33:41,529 --> 00:33:46,119
okay

532
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:53,119
well King

533

emblem home

534
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:01,609
months and try our luck

535
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:06,099
can only years here search

536
00:34:06,099 --> 00:34:09,990
again on you see that

537
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:14,629
there are some the service started quite
short notifications are actually that

538
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:15,200
was there

539
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,419
service started tho me

540
00:34:19,419 --> 00:34:21,179
started actually are all

541
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:24,460
are I'll our service inside application

542
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:29,040
sorry for going now one not
certification see that

543
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,889
all the dynamic less is better loading
all

544
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:38,270
see manual I'm year old methods that
there comes on and try

545
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:42,500
I'll tried to access the other classes
that are in sight

546
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:46,149
so we are now doing this all using
reflection so asking

547
00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:50,110
what kind of method sir Access Manager
member of that class

548
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:55,060
there's a path aunt if you don't believe
it to be running inside the application

549
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,669
let me show it to you

550
00:34:56,669 --> 00:35:00,720
so go return or just

551
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,200
coping in a bit of the COPE see that
should say hello Garcon

552
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,040
14 Hong unification

553
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,310
are try it again I'm doesn't

554
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:18,380
must 0 %um

555
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:21,950
Graham can be location we have

556
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:25,910
starts its months it starts

557
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:30,270
and if we knock racer quotes here

558
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:36,400
insights and executed

559
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,040
should say something that's

560
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,990
ger conscious appear

561
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:49,990
on Channel

562
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:57,230
Michael little

563
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:03,840
let's try again I should really

564
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,390
creates yarmulke next time the

565
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:11,720
harder try again most

566
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,650
G %um

567
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:23,060
see

568
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:30,060
is okay see

569
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,230
confederacy that peras

570
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:40,260
hello kirk on so actually running inside
application

571
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,620
so if you wanna play now the game arm

572
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:47,280
before we have seen that her this
completely disappear cations game

573
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:47,870
sending

574
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:51,790
you know request was her incense getting
back some kind of answers

575
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:55,340
so if we wanna see what's actually
inside that

576
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:59,150
so what kind of works arm

577
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,790
Varinder or you can just simple

578
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,869
simply I'll

579
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:08,119
them to tell come to Turlock

580
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:11,519
see you you're getting some

581
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:15,009
some kind of works see that we're
getting

582
00:37:15,009 --> 00:37:19,069
this worse it's actually we should get
sick if we're playing the game

583
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:23,039
see at the wrong time all

584
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:26,420
why is this well why is this possible
before because be

585
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:30,200
have seen before that though they
actually there are all requests coming

586
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,619
from the server encrypt

587
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:34,650
so you cannot the cryptic but for all
its

588
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:37,700
let's do it again well see there are
different

589
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:42,450
all well

590
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:46,920
on different ports or might might be
your bitch

591
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,420
he gets lets a little bit more
interesting all

592
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,779
before wreaths when we're analyzing
their through the source court

593
00:37:54,779 --> 00:37:59,420
be sold affects readers are kind of
methods that's called dump answers

594
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:03,700
so I tried to run dis mattox and see
what's

595
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:09,210
I'll mike is gonna do sorry for trying
to execute

596
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:12,869
execute this method you see that
something has changed on an application

597
00:38:12,869 --> 00:38:13,799
so

598
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:18,450
we now got all here we got to know all
the answers

599
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:22,599
over over apps already application

600
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:26,749
so if we interact while see

601
00:38:26,749 --> 00:38:30,859
defendant the you

602
00:38:30,859 --> 00:38:34,549
training don't doing

603
00:38:34,549 --> 00:38:39,420
and are different Hong

604
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:43,369
fucking games or well as see just
calling one method

605
00:38:43,369 --> 00:38:46,599
effectually dumps all the answers but
let

606
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:50,089
get smaller let's

607
00:38:50,089 --> 00:38:53,369
do something little bit more crazy you
wanna win the game

608
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:56,459
every time no fordice

609
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:59,749
there's a a little bit more coat

610
00:38:59,749 --> 00:39:02,889
but not that much now it's like

611
00:39:02,889 --> 00:39:06,479
kar Kong

612
00:39:06,479 --> 00:39:10,909
it's gonna be winning the game every
time so we just

613
00:39:10,909 --> 00:39:14,919
based the pay secure was sexually what's
actually we're doing

614
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:18,759
we're just taking from one I'll from one
hash map

615
00:39:18,759 --> 00:39:23,679
so all the answers looking into the
results and let's see if we can

616
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:27,229
are we can all Rangers game

617
00:39:27,229 --> 00:39:30,269
so as you see you have share

618
00:39:30,269 --> 00:39:33,739
so we have Sep their application %uh

619
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:37,239
parameters and actually that's the call
that he brought

620
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:41,630
it's actually sent to the today
application its compartments interpreted

621
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:46,069
I know it seems running in the iran
contra and a life

622
00:39:46,069 --> 00:39:49,359
law like low a

623
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:52,389
life mobile application so

624
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:57,419
all when the time's up you know are we
could play it now but I don't wanna mess

625
00:39:57,419 --> 00:39:58,009
it up

626
00:39:58,009 --> 00:40:02,219
too much because otherwise we will get
300 score salt

627
00:40:02,219 --> 00:40:06,089
possible 200 course but well

628
00:40:06,089 --> 00:40:09,229
see that so it's really com really

629
00:40:09,229 --> 00:40:12,609
really interacting Hall this

630
00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:16,689
anti-free if we take a look at the
source quotes you see that's

631
00:40:16,689 --> 00:40:18,980
really not that special

632
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,890
all its like one 2345

633
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:25,300
all 123 or fire

634
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,790
678 lines call I'll but

635
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:33,609
why did we go through all the steps saws
doing camelot static analyzers

636
00:40:33,609 --> 00:40:36,910
because we need to know which karnal

637
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:40,760
variables for holding girl a whole /img
/url

638
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,859
holding our answers so if we

639
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:47,730
take a look rate for a couple seconds
you're gonna see that the

640
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:51,339
auger Khan should be though all

641
00:40:51,339 --> 00:40:55,150
should be reading all spectrum other

642
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:58,760
think why five seconds and then

643
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,109
I'll she

644
00:41:02,109 --> 00:41:05,980
somewhere up there who

645
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:09,150
is this true

646
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:12,930
yet so we're the first place

647
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:16,980
actually this is gas there in all guest
at the same as good com

648
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,349
got it sending two times so I casts ID

649
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:25,180
because we change it here to god.com but
still holds somewhere else

650
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:30,069
well running occur all

651
00:41:30,069 --> 00:41:33,839
try another on lover well

652
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:37,730
try another friend so as a measured
before we changed little bit

653
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:41,119
also took to all hooking a methods

654
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:45,440
so this is kind of other principal but
for that to be the rooted phone in

655
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,020
little bit

656
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:50,099
knowledge hollow should be hooking the
method songs right so it's kinda

657
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:55,010
more all more low level stuff but
slipped trying

658
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:55,820
on

659
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:59,110
identification and strike to get

660
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:04,040
onto the device well so let's go through
and

661
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,340
shadow so we are on the phone

662
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:11,720
let's go to com superuser

663
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:16,640
aren't and then we need to hijack are
hijacked though

664
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,670
the growth process I already know that

665
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,940
so I got after each herb with has a IDO
for

666
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:28,380
140 and we're hijacking goal.com enjoyed
to vending

667
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:32,620
up occasionally sexually either the
Google Play sawyer

668
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:39,420
re try to do it 3 this im sorry to be in
the right director

669
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,690
going think director

670
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:47,080
words holding car hijacking here

671
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,120
and be hijacked

672
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:53,380
an hour if on my phone if I opener or
Google Play Store

673
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:59,160
you see that so actually it should be

674
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,700
I'll should be

675
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:06,880
a hijacked the methods which de klerk
altman the Google Play its

676
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:13,600
I'll starting up can put the skins

677
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:20,600
on try again well

678
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:40,040
am

679
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:44,830
working %um

680
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:51,830
Huntsman look like that the democrats
are not on my site today

681
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,040
so we could just gonna skeptics and you
can

682
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,230
you can contact me afterwards so

683
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:08,610
well third actually pros and cons with
change a great the case and then short

684
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:09,110
so

685
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:12,390
I'll if you're playing with a pink case
there's no need for you to

686
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:17,630
phone all is have to download modifying
an upload aldape case

687
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:20,630
for going for do think enjoy all

688
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:24,160
there's no need for a pic a modification
because we know that some kind of a rape

689
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,080
case for checking

690
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,630
if we have produced some modification of
them

691
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:32,240
are you need the root of all and you
need a more skills

692
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,460
because they're actually shared
libraries loading term call

693
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:39,020
term some other stuff gone so

694
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:43,120
actually one-third oats challenges the
cat all

695
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:47,340
it's not only for Android so the whole
concept can be used also for

696
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:51,630
almost all kind of our general
application are

697
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:55,030
sure that reflection is still not that
treat right

698
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:59,810
girl different kind of methods that all
kind of tools that are already there

699
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:00,580
like Java

700
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:05,940
nope up but they didn't work and this
year we also attested rhetorical from

701
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,720
school one customer so actually

702
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:11,950
in a half a day me adjusted it's a
little bit the script and actually

703
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:15,830
inject them tried to Oracle form so we
were living inside the local farms

704
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:19,180
and you're playing we all kind of method

706
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,890
minecraft each also might be that

707
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,900
there %uh that's the way to use

708
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:33,359
so and the other rates may be creating

755
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,160
because I I didn't put the Colts source
code inside their

756
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:36,539
so we are playing at the normal getting
