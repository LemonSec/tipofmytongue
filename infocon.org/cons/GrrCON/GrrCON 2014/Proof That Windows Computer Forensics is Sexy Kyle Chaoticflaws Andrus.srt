but I'd gotten back up

28
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,320
up sector that I I got hired by my
current company

29
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,080
up fortune 500 till the company been
there for about five years the start of

30
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,780
it just happens inside

31
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,860
account that their level support so lots
of that it was no

32
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,350
OS an app to plan and working with
clients that you're working on

33
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,910
I'm also I did a lot of trouble shooting
honey

34
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,950
utility utility companies in general
have a lot

35
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:05,100
like to see aP's and so a lot time
someone would come in at Atlanta

36
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,440
like a custom written script and then
they're completely forget

37
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,640
or that person like leaves and no one
has any idea how it works but it doesn't

38
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,830
run on time then you're screwed

39
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:16,740
it so I'll be thrown and I would learn a
technology that was thrown at me

40
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,030
sure how it works what's going on so i
got really good likes this internal

41
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,590
tools

42
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,050
using like add pokémon

43
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,080
and like Process Explorer using things
like a

44
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,530
Windows DBG to try and figure out
likewise bro what's going on

45
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,330
was actually a patch to install now
prevents this application running

46
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:40,040
I do stuff like that and then when I got
a friend's ex I moved over there

47
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,410
I security side in our security Cyber
Security Operations Centre

48
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:48,560
and started working there I coming to an
end point securities like McAfee

49
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,540
encryption/decryption its are now
pushing to forensics

50
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,640
and so last year actually took that

51
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,950
sans course for friends their windows
friends now sis

52
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,970
which was a lot of fun like a really got
to know the

53
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,290
operates a small part come in a
different perspective right now it's one

54
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:05,570
thing

55
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:09,140
you don't fix things is just like on it
you really get

56
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,690
as much time as you like to really learn
it and compare to friends ex where you

57
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,430
really need to know how the apparatus

58
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,269
works too much detail level I really
enjoy that

59
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:22,470
and its kinda continuing my addiction so
it's a sin

60
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,269
Creek general terms were quick to talk
about %uh

61
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:29,420
your computer forensics is a branch
served as your friends science

62
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,220
pertaining to legal evidence found
computers and digital storage media

63
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,920
thank you Expedia

64
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,530
it's my personal definition

65
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,990
friends ex is figuring out which roomie

66
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:45,720
logged in your computer over the weekend

67
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,680
girl pictures

68
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,320
that actually an may learn and gain and
get ripped a locker now you know

69
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,840
somebody 10,000 rupees a try to lock
your computer

70
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,910
yeah additional artifacts as an object
additional interest this can be

71
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:04,910
the the

72
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:19,019
that was beautiful clip

73
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,320
security to my site I'm you never know
what happens %uh

74
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,510
so it is a large fact is kinda like you
know

75
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,770
a piece that it's been fine weather be
like in email it has like the smoking

76
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,600
gun like

77
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,500
email the boss said I'm going to kill
the server tonight or

78
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,620
you know look at a configuration file
for something

79
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,980
I'm so i was thinkin artifacts amazing
word

80
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,930
are factual at a rare refer to all these
points at evidence they can't find it

81
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,660
and the operating system I think about
artifacts is like Pokemon

82
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,230
I gotta catch em all I'll and then
linked file

83
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:56,110
ever heard like click File this is a
shortcut file right what kinda interest

84
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,750
in public files in the Windows operating
system is the creative

85
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,450
all over the place for different right
reasons I really quick way to think

86
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,200
about this

87
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,750
you look in your about your user profile

88
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,390
and the recent items: you'll see all the
athletes file the recently played with

89
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,030
Chelsea like

90
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:14,790
you know like a thumb drive the kinks in
Sundre at like 10 or like home drive

91
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,480
that I went to

92
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,669
or the document how to conserve boss to
give you a raise

93
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:22,150
up

94
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:25,340
you know soon these are actual email
they're all the shortcut files

95
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,020
looking back to your recent items at
their personal use so you can create

96
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,850
these you listed automatically

97
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,290
on that so last witness

98
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:38,479
presentation together I may make it
really easy which is cast equipment 07

99
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,630
and we're going to be gone through this
like it thousand miles an hour

100
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:46,040
the idea for the stock to try naked sexy

101
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,290
was to show you very quickly or some
areas that you could look for

102
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:54,050
if something happened to your right so
if you want your computer relax and

103
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,130
watch the bathroom and

104
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,370
ship coworkers like I do that's Italian

105
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:03,090
that things happen so but I noticed that
was going through this a lot of the

106
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:07,010
like really cool art actually find all
the registry so if you're not familiar

107
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,800
with like the Windows registry too much

108
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,620
somebody's will be like a hawk you
really know that that's no so after in

109
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,070
school

110
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,280
or beer so in general the registry if
you never looked at it before

111
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,150
gonna have a couple a group keys in here
so like trying user an HP users

112
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,420
excuses in the whole like

113
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:28,390
sharper every single profile it comes in
you gonna have akita it's created on

114
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,770
their

115
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,870
holds information about the user app
settings for their stuff like that

116
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,240
and then encourage users it's going to
be the

117
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,580
here the guy yelling down the hall some
details that man

118
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,890
okay and so %uh

119
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:48,490
and current users is going to be the
current logged in I user rights let's

120
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,680
meet their profile

121
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,700
their user hives although it in there a
lot of examples

122
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,490
make it easy and pull it out occurred
user Saunders doing myself

123
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:01,090
and the local machine you're gonna have
all the information public OS

124
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:07,830
software and also your security settings
and so these locations the good to know

125
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,670
where they are because if you ever take

126
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:13,510
like a disk image are you doing
forensics case you wanna know where

127
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,080
these are

128
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,510
and we can grab so if you're looking for
like 8 the local machine

129
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:22,120
bainbridge you guys are in there you'll
find software systems students at pyle

130
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,740
and system 32 perfect something you
might not know is that

131
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,930
in the same directory there's a Reg back
directory that actually contain the copy

132
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:34,900
I love those hives every 10 days sec be
pretty useful because if you've got

133
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,770
someone it's like

134
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,940
I know these guys the forensics
yourselves wake up my eyes

135
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:43,230
now so you might have a chance to pull
out some registry artifacts from the

136
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,640
backup to know their

137
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,380
up the other locations for like HQ user

138
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,070
on the user's home directory you're
going to have and to use it at that

139
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:56,270
that's gonna hold all those figuration
customization like for the users and

140
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,430
or there's also user class that

141
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:03,290
which may not be familiar with but on
Windows seven in South Carolina you

142
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,930
acker User Account Control

143
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:08,540
that was created as a part of it to deal
with a mysterious for example and I

144
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,110
don't want to use our process

145
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:13,590
editing somebody important system
registry stuff right

146
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:17,190
so instead of putting those sentences
configurations that would normally right

147
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,830
over in like a standard registry
election districts like music class

148
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,849
chat sir

149
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:28,169
on another poor thing that may have
never known is there's actually a class

150
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:28,990
right time

151
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:34,169
and the registering and so on the left
you see the folders these are the keys

152
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:39,240
another right still see the values and
so it's cools the folders in the last

153
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,519
actually get a last right time every
time that the keys in the right to use a

154
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,350
modified

155
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,490
so this can be pretty cool because

156
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,490
for example the right and our values to
see this as says

157
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:54,000
Mr you list and that big enough for
budding

158
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,670
that mr. Euless Rd lasater

159
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,260
most recently used and you'll see it
says CPA

160
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:06,000
and that you see that we have values
that are CTA and the CV in the first one

161
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,700
in there

162
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,860
so the last thing that Iran from this
run I'm

163
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,420
ornery and by the render that huh Nam
are you

164
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,350
is when you do like the windows are
cheer when does run tronic man

165
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,709
its own actually stores know it ever do
that like the windows Ron and you see

166
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:23,070
the history of all the previous man's
ear and neck

167
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:27,370
stored here up and particularly this
isn't someone

168
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:31,610
user I've so this specific to the user
but anyway so

169
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:35,019
from them are you list we can see that
the last man that Iran was seen whether

170
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:37,180
it's Ian it was like Iran just crazy

171
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:42,040
hike on the news last one and so I know

172
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,130
because I can look at the last write
time that last time I did that with

173
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,490
Ashley at 10:11

174
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,600
2014 answers are not an sky like a
general example

175
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,649
a bus right times also something
interesting may not know

176
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:58,130
is that registries are very similar to
file systems

177
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:02,110
they have al Qaeda and allocate space
and so if you delete

178
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,640
registry values are keys there's
actually the potential that they could

179
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,470
still be there

180
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,709
on now there's alotta free tools that do
this well

181
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:14,450
months 1 like 10 Jahre or get another
register utility

182
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:18,560
I think and this one as you can see here
that the axis

183
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,769
that's actually showing deleted registry
entries that were in there

184
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:25,600
so kind enough to get the help again if
you think your smile I cover

185
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,620
have my script to an end to leave the
keys at talk about

186
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,790
easy well you could always go back in
pensacola

187
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:35,089
al Qaeda what's so it can mask a crime

188
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:38,560
another troll is very popular

189
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,089
I read and pearl as Red River and so
this can be used to parse out

190
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:47,089
all the different artifacts out this
there's hundreds of plugins that people

191
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:48,110
in the community Britain

192
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:52,230
and the office that made and so you had
like two versions can do it from the

193
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,880
command line we can run specifically
just module that you're looking for in a

194
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,790
specific hi

195
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,209
that you're looking for and is also like
the girly we can basically an a-hole

196
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:01,250
hives parse

197
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,110
everything out to this awesome text file
that you cannot reading through and

198
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,019
compare this to you what you actually
tested

199
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:09,610
let speak I

200
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:14,139
and there's also powers and so on
PowerShell you XD summers

201
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:17,740
so internationally powersoft

202
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:22,390
possible at Skype icon but you know it's

203
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,000
better nice

204
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,360
I so what you can do in parshas you can
actually

205
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,380
traverse the directors talking to HT
services HD crime user

206
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,640
right as I can walk through this again
new software

207
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,440
window well doing Microsoft

208
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,760
when terms story

209
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,740
they don't they don't make this thing
short and registered Alto

210
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,470
so this that's okay really look at
someone's current user

211
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,270
exit near outer I'm and if I wanted to
look

212
00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:00,380
at the last right times there's actually
a module those written by

213
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:04,810
after buy microsoft that's on TechNet
and so I wrote a little at least you

214
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,360
that's why the lake house W

215
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,520
learners this analysis I wrote and by
partial pro

216
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:15,200
and actually parses out each one the
keys that are in my explorer

217
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,480
and this will happen like any
interactions that I have an explorer I

218
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,540
logged in

219
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,550
lot artifacts get a deal with like
remember my settings

220
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:27,380
a.m. particular we can look at up the
word

221
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,380
real clear and so this is what every do
like a

222
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:34,290
a search unlike where's my taco

223
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:38,050
right so if I do

224
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:43,040
lips click on things amazing they can
see that now I just

225
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,930
this right time for a key just got
updated right

226
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:53,339
so I actually going to work real and
then

227
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,760
the system apartment I do %uh twist

228
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,800
it item property

229
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:05,140
and distracting can see here that use
the MRT list they were kinda talking

230
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,040
about

231
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,330
and mr. eulises pointing towards what 6

232
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:16,330
sci-fi look at six I can see that

233
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:22,530
was but ako just got another

234
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,410
you can do

235
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:27,040
PowerShell got really write some ellis's
make your life easier around it

236
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,220
back

237
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,470
sup again so the stock is

238
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:39,610
and the introduction to registry and so
the talk in general is

239
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,110
when I start looking at a friends ex's
kind about how I could prove something

240
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,810
happen when I walked away from my
computer

241
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:49,560
again like at my work it if you do walk
away from the computer

242
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,069
you get awesome backgrounds like this
there's also something that wrote a

243
00:13:53,069 --> 00:13:53,790
program called

244
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:57,649
know it Ron which are randomly lock your
computer every X my time

245
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:03,000
up yeah at it on a network share such as
like network share an arch

246
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,480
good so it's it's all on the artifacts
and looking at urs

247
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,259
pertain to that I'm some kinda touching
the malware now says that you are likely

248
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:17,399
locations but most are scum like really
easy stuff so sexy time

249
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,750
but be left unlocked so attack look at

250
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,920
reportedly like know something was
plugged in but that USB Drive while

251
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,680
you're away

252
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:30,060
I'm weather app act execution was their
file modification and and then was

253
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:35,939
it's an open a command prompt kinda run
something so for use be friends ex

254
00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:39,480
these are just that are not like
complete list

255
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,860
and at all there's a researcher that
went on and

256
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,209
he is talking about how when you plug in
USB Drive to start doing the analysis

257
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:47,329
and their fax

258
00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:51,569
modified had over 70 artifacts that
happen use USB Drive

259
00:14:51,569 --> 00:14:56,699
so this is like 5 so the first 1i

260
00:14:56,699 --> 00:15:01,529
I love this log files so much in Windows
if as anyone here had like troubleshoot

261
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:02,660
hardware problems

262
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:08,329
with drivers and stuff this blog is
fantastic because it'll actually show

263
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:11,309
you the first time that a device is
detected by the operating system

264
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:14,790
to give you information about you know
where to look for drivers and what

265
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,309
drivers

266
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:19,399
selected and that it had heirs and stuff
like that but for USB stuff we can

267
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:20,879
actually use this value

268
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,819
to get up the first time that despite
all my cash

269
00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:28,850
dollar so it'll be the first time this
device ever appeared

270
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:29,710
in the %ah prince

271
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:32,820
them and we can also see like now to
make and model and more

272
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,440
out importantly will see this unique
serial which is important as well use

273
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,260
this to basic

274
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,630
lookin all the other artifacts to you
maximal up

275
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:46,760
make this of little diagram and so the
next place that we can look at

276
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,280
is going to be in HD local machine has
to be the US peace or

277
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,270
is also USB one I wish I like any USB
device is plugged in but

278
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:58,050
use the stores or gramm look at and the
first thing that will do

279
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:01,400
is will find it in here and we'll see
that

280
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,150
will have this unique serial another
location that we can't issue next year

281
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,290
on that topic

282
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:11,800
first time there's like 10 from lock
file so it also if you ever notice

283
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,310
I on their cereal at the second
character and sexy

284
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:18,300
the and symbol that actually what it
means that the %uh princess and didn't

285
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,010
find

286
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:22,320
x0 on the device and that the OS
generated

287
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,150
so next place we can look

288
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:30,040
is an the windows portable devices also
still on the local machine

289
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,060
on and from here we can actually get %uh
volume name

290
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,330
USB device that was there its own
particular songs called that mailers

291
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:43,190
trustworthy as we continue and we also
have mounted devices

292
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:48,710
these are all system like plug-and-play
typeof artifacts so mounted devices we

293
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,300
get

294
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,930
police get the drive letter it's like
the volume name in the drive letter

295
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:56,510
are pretty porn to find out is going to
artifactual see different references and

296
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,310
be like oh it

297
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,840
it came from this volume you know and
have this executed Lord

298
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,450
this drive letter is use for this path
to like okay it so how do I know

299
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:07,900
look at timestamps when you found it
hard facts and you look at the USB

300
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,580
devices that were plugged in at the time

301
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:13,860
leading cast are matching listings up
and then we also get this unique with

302
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,610
this created

303
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:18,310
and this squid can actually be used to
trace it back to using

304
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:22,620
so within a user's registry hive you'll
have this mount points to

305
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,530
which keeps track of all the

306
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:28,950
advice that the user mountain ansel see
that within their which we can use

307
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,530
to find the last time that now for
example the device is plugged in

308
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:36,300
and we also know what users so we can
prove they know first time we ever saw

309
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,460
was device was

310
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:41,790
yesterday the last time that user used
it was this morning when he executed

311
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:45,300
is a malware that screwed all our
systems up to skate aside the company

312
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:45,770
crash

313
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:49,250
part you know

314
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:53,340
out is also some free tools out there
that are really nice nurse of

315
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,350
if you've ever heard owners of eased up
a check their site out

316
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:59,410
have a lot of really quick Windows tools
that you can use

317
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:03,950
especially friends ex USB ID viewers 1
I'll

318
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:08,370
and it's pretty nice tits gives a really
fast when its lexical all USB devices

319
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,660
and so we're looking at this and we can
see that the DataTraveler that I have

320
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,160
here

321
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,050
I'll one thing tonight second left
plugin day in the serial number

322
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:19,510
what I did notice was last test in the
san Juan is a

323
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:23,650
and another one to seven straight day
column is completely off

324
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,490
so no matter what tools you use them in
their emails that you should always know

325
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,030
how these things work in general

326
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,770
so that you know is validate when you
get back from school this is a great

327
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,620
example that

328
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,930
per side completely trusted like this
possibly a minute

329
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:39,820
is also a command-line versions out
there

330
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,270
USB history is one on we could use that

331
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,930
to parse out and you'll see it's alleged
racial serial

332
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:50,890
whitewater river ducky innovation I ever
ducky

333
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:54,420
for those of you that our leftover
duckies

334
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,990
there basically when you plug them in
they get to tech today is

335
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,560
US there as a keyboard right and so we
all know I'll

336
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,780
has anyone here had actually installed
drivers for generic USB Creek Court

337
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:10,280
now has always accepted and because of
that

338
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,030
this device text banja that so once you
plug it's detected wait a little bit and

339
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,670
I'll actually run keyboard commands

340
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:19,670
so pick up anything to do with a
keyboard you could just do with this

341
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:24,850
so people it then amazing like they had
made her purse shells they have done

342
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:27,090
exploits run PowerShell code

343
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,840
it's all over the place

344
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,500
on ok rapper and door

345
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,090
Delhi I'll I was gonna do a quick demo
here

346
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:39,130
and i seven years the rubber ducky here
and what it does is

347
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:43,180
it uses Windows run command and when I
plug it in

348
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,730
it's going to execute on my favorite you
too videos

349
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:50,310
never again you every it now that site
gets there

350
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:53,970
one hit wonder aspect

351
00:19:53,970 --> 00:20:00,970
see a

352
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,860
way here to

353
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:09,880
or ok there goes the runs push
fullscreen unable to check their door

354
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,170
but that's actually you to play and you
guys can sit

355
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:17,320
I and so if someone did this to you know
some ways a cat attacked at this

356
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,300
activity happens again like in that

357
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:25,110
the idea that you walked away from
computer and came back we could look at

358
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:28,640
thing back

359
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,630
yes so here's a USB deal now

360
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:38,140
pure trash this so right here we can see
the times that

361
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:43,020
this device was there and particularly
class plugin days but we actually trust

362
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,360
because

363
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,660
communications I get the serial number
and we can see that it comes up as

364
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:52,150
human interface device so a keyboard so
if you're

365
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,040
clearly walkway from the computer and
come back and think something's weird

366
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,960
and check out to see a keyboard is
plugged into computer

367
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:04,960
that's a little weird cell

368
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,300
so it's a go at like two something
happens like Apple key application

369
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,220
execution

370
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:15,380
a second in a Drama a couple

371
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,560
up how fast will look after that so

372
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,010
users this is really need up because
this is used for

373
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:25,990
to populate users start menu with like
most recently executed things

374
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:30,190
on the nose on the right its super easy
read

375
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:33,270
I mean it's roofer yes carried that

376
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,700
so all the entries on the right all the
values said

377
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,289
actually in Korean rocket 13 it actually
is pretty easy and it's a really fun

378
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:42,140
test impartial

379
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,710
much higher partial schools out you
obviously decode that

380
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,970
and you get a lot of good information
get like the name the application are

381
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,720
like a link file that was executed

382
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,480
it last run times and the number of
times it was executed as a cue track

383
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,919
that so that it knows that this is your
most frequently used at on their sup

384
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:04,690
as another tool I called user sis you
don't want to show you this have

385
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,340
information so you can see here like

386
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,929
band prop that Iran I ran it three times
so far

387
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:14,770
and last time that I ran it you can see
PowerShell actually on the slick

388
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:20,020
session season the spies prefetch

389
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:24,659
at a lot of exam is is for a while but
with SSD's

390
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:28,210
windows 7 usually disable that by
default doesn't need anymore

391
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:31,539
the idea prefetch was that they would
store your

392
00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:36,140
most commonly nom startup programs in
like applications run to try and start

393
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,220
my pastor Korea

394
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:40,230
and so the files that were generated
like in this directory

395
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:43,240
you can see like Nelson is running this
awesome day

396
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:48,450
txt call hack the heck study and so you
could actually get information on that

397
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,169
file

398
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:52,360
it was an SSD for execution time name

399
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,370
excision executed one's path however

400
00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:00,429
building up these different locations
that we can validate Crossway

401
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:04,179
more cash is pretty interesting because
it then uses directory and it's actually

402
00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:06,559
in that user class at that we talked
about

403
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,760
and so its it's part of the Windows
language like translation P so

404
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,470
for user as they're running anything
you'll see the

405
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:19,770
execute willful path and you'll see on
the right like the title of the window

406
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,840
what's needed a lot of malware Center

407
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,510
and people who was words here so

408
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,370
a lot a malware will sometimes get
caught in here because it's in the music

409
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:30,120
last updated:

410
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:36,390
might not be modified this is probably

411
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:39,919
one that shocked me a little bit just
because my background in like

412
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:40,740
applications

413
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:44,940
was the application compatibility cash
and so this isn't

414
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:49,410
system are in a skillet machine system
so anytime that you run an application

415
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,670
in Windows

416
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:54,740
its gonna check to see if the scandal
legacy issues you met to try to run like

417
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,860
an old XP

418
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,100
application and some other easy things
that I L

419
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,210
except dollars money known that all
legacy axis to do in previous versions

420
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:07,600
them I had automatic remedies are she
have shame City options traded to take

421
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,780
care of some other applications
credibility issues

422
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,990
so the operative systems going to keep a
copy

423
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:16,250
the excusal name log last time use it

424
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:20,660
so those caches awesome because it'll
catch almost and execute well you're on

425
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,270
the system

426
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:24,300
so another great place look for malware
or

427
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,560
you know somebody opened up word or
something else other things

428
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,680
so let's look at file manipulation

429
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:35,730
a couple for that important one year's

430
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:39,130
like with recent docs up

431
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:42,220
as a recent accident occurred directory
route at

432
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:47,360
artefacts and HT current user and so

433
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,410
within this director in these is key
values

434
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:55,180
you'll see all these file extension the
latter for example you'll C dot socks

435
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:55,950
here

436
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:59,140
and so underneath each one of these keys

437
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:03,190
the values on the right still have all
last up to the last 30

438
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:08,200
docs acts that you ran and the fun part
is you can use this

439
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,470
to find out when was the last time the
rand document I can mix up document or

440
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,750
last time you open up

441
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:18,890
a text file so now we could you see text
files that were in there

442
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:22,700
you can also see up well

443
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,860
any text files they may have added by
this user but you can also see

444
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,890
class right time last one from and you
lists on this example we're looking here

445
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:31,650
too

446
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:36,040
and the two values see as looking at a
picture cap space such a pic

447
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:43,040
love cats by the way

448
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:44,809
up

449
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:49,700
and then its key another eight speaker
and user artifact look at it as candy LG

450
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:54,860
or the common dialogue livor and so this
library

451
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:59,249
is kinda shared through any application
user runs and so it's kinda and

452
00:25:59,249 --> 00:26:03,100
similar to like recent docs when general
keep track a

453
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:07,899
the last like the last visited that we
have here will show all the last execute

454
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:08,460
ables

455
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:12,519
that user and so if you're dead see an
application that can be like

456
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:16,259
actually better example would be with 0
insipid sponsor

457
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:21,809
so they open sated also keep track of
any other recent documents yet

458
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:25,190
that's the idea behind this is that if
you open up notepad

459
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:28,549
right and you go to like open some
things you go to type

460
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:31,799
you see that you know most recent years
old in a drop-down box

461
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:36,739
it'll pull out after hearing the same
for like documents HTML J

462
00:26:36,739 --> 00:26:39,899
and you can get last excusable

463
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:43,190
class open save files and less retention

464
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:46,190
and

465
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:49,869
there's another nurse after all that you
can actually look at that

466
00:26:49,869 --> 00:26:54,570
so the open say files to you and we can
see that I was opening a lot of cat

467
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,549
pictures at the time

468
00:26:55,549 --> 00:27:01,860
an addict and so we also

469
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:05,990
have temporary internet files so this is
one that kinda surprised me

470
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:09,929
his last thing I expected that explore
was keeping track

471
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:13,900
love files that I opened so I know to
keep track

472
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,549
a internet browser my browsing habits to
retain do

473
00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:21,299
I didn't think that they would do that
so you actually use this artifact to see

474
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:21,780
if

475
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:25,049
USB Drive was opened up to see the
service

476
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:30,980
she could be like in a drive letter so
then

477
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,700
what about something happen like you
free lunch today command prompt or

478
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,080
command was executed so how can we look
at that I mean

479
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,620
the the easiest way to do it

480
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,679
I resist but we can take a copy of
memory

481
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:47,799
and so on to get a a copy an every-down

482
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:51,429
we could an analyzer tool called
volatility to are many people from the

483
00:27:51,429 --> 00:27:52,160
ball tilting

484
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,980
go

485
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:02,980
artillery is very nifty 0

486
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,120
summer like to know Red River its it's
really community-driven

487
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,309
it's written in Python so it's portable
to in systems

488
00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:13,910
and as you can see here like the modules
that are currently loaded

489
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:17,380
I can look at users this information
that stored

490
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:21,000
so any at like the registries that are
currently loaded memory

491
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,160
I could open those up and basically this

492
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,270
someone wrote a nice I module two
parcels out

493
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:30,540
and a pick up here more

494
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:36,990
smiles

495
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:41,539
touchy

496
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:43,919
and ones that will do right now is like
we have command line

497
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:49,610
will show any command-line I our
curtains and another one is councils

498
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:52,830
which will actually display all the
council information

499
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:56,169
and expand proctor partially arms so

500
00:28:56,169 --> 00:29:03,169
we ran this real quick 0

501
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:24,700
a prisoner are treatments great night
second too little slow at times

502
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:32,049
salesperson %uh

503
00:29:32,049 --> 00:29:35,590
go yes

504
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:40,259
oh yes i'd so had a time accused taking
a a memory image dependent

505
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:44,259
with machines that size them out of
memory that machines have nowadays

506
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:48,970
can be anywhere from you know Fort
extended 1632 X

507
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:52,379
so it's kind of interesting is if you
wanna do like her low

508
00:29:52,379 --> 00:29:55,639
acquisition memoranda sheen and you have
a distributed network

509
00:29:55,639 --> 00:29:59,029
and some others links may only have like
t1 or something

510
00:29:59,029 --> 00:30:03,309
it's pretty difficult to take a remote
image without taking down the sites

511
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:03,899
network

512
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:07,929
I mean that's when he may have a staging
area that's it.

513
00:30:07,929 --> 00:30:11,070
move the image or to you so this
particular iight

514
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:14,559
created at the end only handle one
gigabyte one Gator Graham

515
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:21,559
and so we can see from this the first
thing we see that this is expand prop

516
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:26,850
that was open

517
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:30,700
lol look at the commands

518
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:34,559
well it commands ever on while I was
away from my computer we can see that

519
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:35,519
someone ran

520
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:38,919
and created evil dude sweet password bro

521
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:43,249
added then to my system they then
proceed to add them to the

522
00:30:43,249 --> 00:30:44,230
Administrators group

523
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,650
they seed in the tabs

524
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:50,460
look in the directory and there and dump
it to take copy it

525
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:56,850
memory years so are missing out at those

526
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:00,050
you know what what about the information
that was displayed in the council

527
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:03,080
witness so it's all the commands at work
or on so that's what

528
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:10,080
councils can do for us crap

529
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:15,300
sites which you for being there

530
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:19,020
this next

531
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,330
the first time speaking at skid captains
way

532
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:29,330
i doing the looking do is dead

533
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,890
kinda make this sexier and sexier than
when I learned so that's they'll be like

534
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,330
it succumbs to accept

535
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:41,739
like flying colors ago across a cat's
everywhere

536
00:31:41,739 --> 00:31:45,999
go but the gas starts up

537
00:31:45,999 --> 00:31:50,960
that I do that its that's a hard one to
beat next time if Africa

538
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,220
talking at all at a gala sure of running

539
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:58,759
back that's true

540
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:02,960
ops even better act like I've done

541
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,809
we take a look here we actually see what
happens

542
00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:12,059
and am proud so typed in how sweet

543
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:15,859
pastor brown how and that is funny
because it actually get prompted

544
00:32:15,859 --> 00:32:21,820
pastor Dennis fire 14 characters might
not work in Windows 2010 to

545
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:25,419
and then that they actually went through
in a you know they had yes

546
00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:28,970
at and a course that

547
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:33,580
man was successful right when added to
the ministry's group a successful

548
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:40,129
so analysts

549
00:32:40,129 --> 00:32:43,700
this CD into the temp directory on they
did their

550
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,769
they got all these wonderful things dump
it in there Aki

551
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:50,009
hack and sexy kept

552
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:56,169
Texas my secret file Ricky Ponting pics
and then of course there and up

553
00:32:56,169 --> 00:33:01,739
which to go down we can sit there and at

554
00:33:01,739 --> 00:33:05,359
issue I continue they did slight yes

555
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:12,359
process crisis kinda need to write

556
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:16,859
and Islam are you do it there's is I'll
tell you that

557
00:33:16,859 --> 00:33:21,759
very powerful tool who so I mean what we
know now i mean

558
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:24,999
if we did leave your key relaxing were
suspicious that somebody might mess with

559
00:33:24,999 --> 00:33:25,409
their

560
00:33:25,409 --> 00:33:30,090
done something we know any USB device is
a maven plugin the time that we could

561
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,269
see the timestamps

562
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:35,109
from when it was first plugged and to
you when it was last especially in there

563
00:33:35,109 --> 00:33:36,039
with the Eagles tight

564
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:39,900
user which if you're still logged in you

565
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,010
we can see what applications that person
man ran at the time

566
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:46,780
I what files may have been modified or
saves while we're gone

567
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:50,720
and then what commands manner as well
Kalika

568
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,110
very fast crunchers artifacts so he some
references tools

569
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:59,390
ass on

570
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:03,059
but couple announced as a slip in here
that I'll everybody around like a

571
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:06,150
Jackson Michigan yes

572
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:10,750
so starting in January gentleman that
Matt Johnson

573
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:15,250
is right there I'm there myself we
starting up on my sex action

574
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:19,740
so be a security kar I'll be having
another talk

575
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:24,359
that %uh pipers that I think I'll be
doing automation with PowerShell

576
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:27,409
and McAfee PL so how did people run
McAfee

577
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:30,639
there have to deal with it chain

578
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:36,399
venues like the way that guy subpoena
for

579
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:41,129
you can automate likely early all other
things up

580
00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:44,780
so if your interest in that deflate it
up we've got an email address and put my

581
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,750
sector art

582
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:49,359
so if you're interested or if you wanna
presented let us know

583
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,359
we're very open community we just wanna
have fun basically learn

584
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:56,230
also apostate

585
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:59,400
I'm difficulty with Pashto

586
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,540
I'll ha sector is a

587
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:06,080
was straight to fill the gap between
native tools and commercial tools

588
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,270
for to enable system administrators and
impressions

589
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:13,869
stars level up this qtr windows: it's
also where like any the tools that

590
00:35:13,869 --> 00:35:17,980
I'm gonna be writing for forensics like
kinda parsing out some others

591
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:21,780
artifacts from the registry and file
system I wanna have those be native

592
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,480
tools that you just drop ago

593
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,980
itself having and an executed or
something else so I think like I made

594
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,090
about the Mexican at

595
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:31,750
donate over to the past like me and
there's a lot more to do so if you've

596
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:34,180
been pitching to get into a project

597
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:38,230
parsec is a great one to jump into so
definitely give a shoutout

598
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:42,000
that's also Matt Johnson and Ben 10
contaminants that

599
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,420
and that's all I got

600
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,150
35 minutes
