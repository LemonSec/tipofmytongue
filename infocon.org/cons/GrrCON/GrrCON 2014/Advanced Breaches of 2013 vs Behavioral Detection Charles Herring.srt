1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,270
think alright let's do this thing

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,430
so my names Charles hearing we're gonna
talk about eye-catching breaches

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,849
n dad does anyone have any idea and dad
is anyone ever heard the term in bad

4
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:14,280
think it's an old Michael Jackson song
when

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,400
get so I'm little bit about me and how I

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,560
I got here I spent in years on active
duty in the Navy

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,699
my last gig was as a network security
officer for the Naval Postgraduate

8
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:25,710
School

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,869
in at those view that may have studied
intrusion detection system history

10
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:34,170
which is you know three people in the
world %uh

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,660
there was a paper penned by doctor
dorothy denning in 1983 called

12
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,190
intrusion detection expert systems so 83

13
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,550
the whole idea behind catching reaches I
was first

14
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,020
I and then it and that doctor deming

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,500
as a professor at the Naval Postgraduate
School she was there

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,800
I when I showed up up for duty in 2000
and

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,629
well one of the things we found inside a
military installation that had a class B

18
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:04,239
if I P space without matter firewalls

19
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,869
was very easy to rob us and become

20
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:10,869
became much easier when we started
taking exchange students

21
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:14,119
from other countries who were
essentially spice

22
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:18,670
made it very easy bring them on campus
they just couldn't access it's directly

23
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:23,189
from the internet so I never be a row
now a detection

24
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:27,759
is a school of thought on how you catch
things that are currently I'm catchable

25
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,329
I'm answering to go through the adage
that the area n bad

26
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:34,909
I'll how can you do in bad and really I

27
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:38,689
the book with the talk today is over
some breaches that I've been a part of

28
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:39,020
both

29
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:44,079
a the last a year and a half that
anomaly detection or behavioral

30
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,350
I detection has allowed us to catch
something really how we caught those

31
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,810
so our full disclaimer I work for a
company called Lanco portrays basically

32
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,920
is the only copy in a world that
actually does and bad

33
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,490
but I promise not to pitch you on that
nonsense

34
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:03,140
so will do this and definition so you
know what words mean that i'm talking

35
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,860
about. we'll talk about that
specifically how in bad goes around I

36
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,830
goes about the texting breaches

37
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,360
and I will talk about the actual
breaches so

38
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,849
what is in bad weather NetFlow and water
detection schools

39
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:19,840
so are dimensions network behavior on
our way detection

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,510
is in bad I generally speaking and
monitored and batted side the data

41
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,670
sources net flow

42
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:29,380
at the reason that came about as when we
first started doing research

43
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,890
and in bad around 2,000 there are
basically two major hubs at the time

44
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,090
there was a bush graduate school working
on a project called terminator

45
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,330
and a at Georgia Tech doctor copeland
was running a project called

46
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:45,950
a stealth watch which is the became a
product that I pedal

47
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:48,790
um by I those two

48
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,750
those are the two and now appear on on
detection schools but those days it was

49
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:58,790
a probe centric meaning we put a a probe
of a spanner put it in line it look for

50
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:59,550
traffic

51
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:04,180
there was anomalous or or abet not bad
behavior and alert on that

52
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,880
around 2004 I we discovered at

53
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,040
sense and that is a really looking
inside the package is looking at the

54
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,610
distribution of packets

55
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,890
on how many bytes generally moving
between email servers and clients how

56
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:18,380
many

57
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:23,310
send packets are only in that nixon so
it's really a metric based game

58
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,380
and it didn't really matter what's in
the payload so NetFlow became a great

59
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,840
source for that because it's meta data
on what is happening

60
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,080
on and it made it much easier to deploy

61
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,209
set up putting probes everywhere you
basing sped up NetFlow pointed out of

62
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:38,620
things to a processing

63
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,550
in able to do in bad very quickly and
that also allowed us to look very deep

64
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,430
into the network

65
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,720
I'm access so workstation a workstation
workstation a server server to server

66
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,360
instead of limiting visibility for
detection at

67
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,970
egress and ingress points already
mentioned quality metrics

68
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,170
I sometimes because NetFlow is the main

69
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:04,830
I data source anything that it that
parses NetFlow

70
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:09,180
gets group 10 with in batter NBA or
something something like that

71
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,630
but up processing NetFlow doesn't make
you and Dad

72
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,140
I machine anymore then you know a human
being as in

73
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,620
air processor writers more to experience
just the dating process

74
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,930
I miss you want to start out doing this
on a roll there's a great set a tools

75
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,020
I'm from Carnegie Mellon concertina

76
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,770
called silk and so you can go out the
cert dot

77
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,360
racer decor yep seniority that or

78
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,750
and uphold out so & Assoc has a set a
library scope ice ok which are the

79
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,750
Python libraries Associated

80
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,310
I with parsing silken I what's ok is
that allows you send that flow into the

81
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:47,870
engine

82
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,080
it out parses it stores it allows you to
query it

83
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,070
against a different type 2 checks or
talk about the day

84
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,760
and Python up I sell kisses settle
libraries it makes it much

85
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,180
easier had to get into that dow stack so

86
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,610
check that out um there's really no in
bad

87
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,400
I am Magic Quadrant if anybody here
cares about that

88
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,840
I'm but there was an NDA

89
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,390
or network behavioral a network behavior
analysis

90
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:21,270
a a market breaching 9712 from I'll

91
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,470
Gartner and these are the folks listed

92
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:30,430
on a on that so and we'll talk about
their for MBA and bad here in a in a

93
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,490
moment so

94
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:37,450
when I talk about NetFlow net flows both
a specific thing and a category

95
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:41,020
I grew up in lower Alabama LA that's
what that

96
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,640
LAX means i sorry or let's go all right

97
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,000
all right let's also say roll tide about
to lose it but I so

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,850
I'll in Michigan who would've thought
they could actually have a

99
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,550
no but so when i sat down for supper the
waitress last

100
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,860
on what what do you wanna drink and I'll
say I would like a coke. and she would

101
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,330
say what I cocco can also have a doctor
pepper

102
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,160
because I and I in the southeastern
Alabama

103
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,280
so coke is both all soft drinks

104
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,850
and it is the deck soft drinks and that
flows same way there's a specific thing

105
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:16,960
called NetFlow NetFlow b5 b7 b9 came
into production

106
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,640
it was a standard created by style Cisco

107
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:26,690
and they issued information are a season
that will be nine hits and at RC listed

108
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:31,880
ipv6 is largely the open source version
of NetFlow

109
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,140
I've never be nine is actually a little
bit better than that so denying

110
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:39,480
a couple regards but that's our see
attached that and so when I talk about

111
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,500
NetFlow in this conversation by my
meta-data

112
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,610
going across the interface so is traffic
routes across a router or switch or

113
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,870
firewall is aware that conversation

114
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,510
it's gonna create a blog entry about
that in Alameda data format

115
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:58,390
I'm them a call floor NetFlow juniper
has J flow which

116
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:02,390
if you do a pee cap on it looks exactly
like NetFlow person 5

117
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:06,350
except Juniper's would die before they
gave

118
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:11,690
Citrix are such Citrix Cisco any money
on that so it is J Flo is not NetFlow

119
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:16,310
I see flow that strain anything meta
data about a conversation is we're

120
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,190
talking about here

121
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:20,060
and see what you think noticed the
bottom

122
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,150
I'll really the basic NetFlow records

123
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:28,350
this IP talking to this IP on this port
from this court for this many bites

124
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:31,690
at this time across its entire face
that's what we're talking about the raw

125
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:32,300
data

126
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:37,610
so that's not flow in a nutshell we can
talk about that more some other time

127
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,090
when I haven't had for those things but
the I

128
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,229
there's three ways to catch anything in
information security

129
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:49,449
the first one in the most general wanna
signature-based detection

130
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:53,010
and so it for looking at this from a
physical security around

131
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:57,960
this is really inspecting the object
before it's ingested by the victim or

132
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,620
the target

133
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,770
so I rece

134
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:07,310
wonderful frosty beer and I look for
things like mold floating on it I'm

135
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:07,900
inspecting

136
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,180
object before I take it in see me a
second I'm sorry sir thing about the

137
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:11,570
beer

138
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:17,860
love Grand Rapids

139
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:22,280
um so you inspect the object before you
ingest looking for things that you know

140
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:22,940
or bad

141
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:27,320
chemicals composition things that you
know will hurt the target as ingest them

142
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,600
signature-based detection to an IPS you
looking for the packet there's something

143
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,370
about that packet you know it's bad it's
attached to exploit si vede XYZ

144
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:40,409
holiday and antivirus inspecting the
object in this case being

145
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:44,709
file that file has certain markers on it
we know its associated with specific

146
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:49,459
I i'm our area content filter same thing
going you're looking for a request to

147
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:50,810
view or else that are known

148
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,230
bad a behavioral detection

149
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:58,250
is looking for what happens after you
ingest it I'm

150
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,110
for instance you might not need to see
that beer on my

151
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:06,260
podium to know that I've been drinking a
beer I you can tell a little bit by my

152
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,130
behavior

153
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,820
right now the fact that I'm corning a
lot is one thing that apply what do it I

154
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,570
would have to bear

155
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:15,630
but what happens after the object is
ingested how does that impact

156
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,100
the behavior up the victim or the target
and

157
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,990
man-hours and boxing is a lot like the
old cut bear

158
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:27,080
I approach to to a cane right you have a
cup there he would drink it

159
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,300
the king would look at 'em if the guy
for the foaming at the mouth he said ya

160
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,180
pass on that

161
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,730
that's not something I really want to
get involved with right now let's bring

162
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,290
out a new cut area and who

163
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:40,690
unearthing a wine says bring our sandbox
and put it in a sandbox watch what

164
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,950
happens if the behavior is unknown bad
behavior

165
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:48,480
on then you can assume the object was
ingested is bad so

166
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,260
sandboxing I'm in bad as a good at this
stuff but you don't need to know what

167
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:53,780
that

168
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,790
in point ingested to know that it should
be scanning the network

169
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:00,970
on that he shouldn't be breaking policy
that he shouldn't be going on in routing

170
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,900
write those types of things are
behaviors that follow

171
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,920
the ingestion up about objects and

172
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,530
anomaly detection you're still watching
the behavior of the host but you're

173
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,990
watching it for deviation against known
good behavior

174
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,480
so if someone shows up to work every day
at 6 a.m. in the morning

175
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,540
and then one day to shop at 6:30 that's
a little

176
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:26,570
dat weird if they show up at noon
carrying an ak-47 wearing a meatloaf is

177
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:27,170
a hat

178
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,930
really weird right so you're talking
about degrees

179
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,670
deviation me check actually it
mathematically they just never works

180
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,890
I make you tryin to it does work I am

181
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:41,709
so when you break down how to these
detection mechanisms work

182
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:45,100
I'm II in concert

183
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,060
a signature-based detection is the best
for catching known exploits

184
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,970
so when I go to O'Hare I take my freakin
shoes off

185
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:56,650
and they look for a bomb in my shoes
they don't day but they know what to

186
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,329
look for

187
00:10:57,329 --> 00:11:00,640
if I put something else in there like a
popular

188
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,660
they don't know what to do about that
but they know to look for thanks to

189
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,589
Richard Reid

190
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:08,530
and i got really scared by the way at
they started doing that and then the

191
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:13,120
that underwear bomber showed up my home
in 20 hair kit I get any worse

192
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,820
than this whole thing I'm a shop in a
row at the whole thing

193
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,950
so but I know nyse: signature-based
detection is very good at detecting

194
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,430
known bad thanks

195
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,760
behavior detection has become very good
at zero day stuff because even though

196
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,970
you are using a new exploit you're doing
the same old thing

197
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:34,029
you're going to steal data you're gonna
try to propagate internally you're gonna

198
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:34,860
try to pay that

199
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,670
the behavior the bad behavior that you
do with the host what is compromised

200
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,540
it's the same

201
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:44,530
so a few don't know what the exploit is
you note the behavior is not follow

202
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:48,740
so I'm our sandboxing I never be a row I

203
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,130
detection on the network in helping NAT
so

204
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:55,520
through nearly 10 the exploits this is
the best I've

205
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:00,340
while the best place to catch that and
then anomaly detection is very good at

206
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,330
catching stops

207
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,490
I'm there really has no signature

208
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,810
when you're abusing credentials might be
up a little bit about this when I did

209
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,190
this

210
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:12,610
last a last month's about what his
credential abuse what I mean is someone

211
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,260
has

212
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:17,460
the ability to login issue or the person
logging in

213
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,820
is

214
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,440
be an a-hole right so I

215
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,340
you have a username and a password in
using those credentials in a way that

216
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,190
are inappropriate

217
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:31,810
so ever snowden is a great example this
he's an administrator he logged in the

218
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,400
machines he supposed to log into
machines

219
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,610
a Booz Allen paid him to log into
machines

220
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,050
they did not however want him to suck
down all the NSA's

221
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:45,450
data and walk away with it right and so
you can't alarm on

222
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:50,940
signature bullying detection assay when
I don't measure logs and trigger alarm

223
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,930
what you can alarm on and I an
administrator can only access is less

224
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,370
than a hundred max data

225
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:03,529
in a day if he it if he pulls down 10
terabytes the data

226
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:07,400
Tay's that dude and I'll let him out of
the building right that's a

227
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,440
a proper incident response and so

228
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,000
anomaly detection is watching for what
is normal and then when someone does

229
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
something abnormal

230
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,950
you're going to learn of so how does how
does approach is applied to I

231
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:25,510
in bad I Resort limited in and add for
using NetFlow as your data source

232
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:30,000
you don't have the benefit of having the
full packet to get in there and look for

233
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,350
sequel injection patterns and no such
things you could do if you're looking at

234
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,330
the Internet brings

235
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:38,960
I but there are some things you can do
and meta-data I'll

236
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,010
at about this event earlier I mean
earlier are going to an earlier

237
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:46,180
I went to a 10 minutes ago okay thank
you

238
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:50,940
up by Tom I got that in a bit no but I
segmentation

239
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,980
violation a vendors lie I'm a vendor

240
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,529
we actually have clubs we get together
we talk about how we're gonna lie to you

241
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:01,810
we actually have really great meetings
on that's not true

242
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,380
another like that I just sold as a
vendor I'm by I

243
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,940
I I did spend a period of my life
working for and for all magazine testing

244
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,140
network security stuff

245
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,279
and so the vendor it's a one thing we
test a busy on this end

246
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:17,860
not exactly what you said pro you know
what's that had geriatric

247
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,320
and inside oven at work the same is true

248
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,089
I am you have it's good to trust but you
need to validate it

249
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:29,209
and so we're going to make some examples
and yes but if we put segmentation in

250
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:30,570
place that a hoe that

251
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:34,430
um the guys at HR shouldn't be able to
access

252
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:37,920
I'm the protected trade secret data we
need to know what

253
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,650
if that ever happens right we need to be
alerted if something breaks down somehow

254
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:42,529
as and

255
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:46,089
in HR person doing that is crazy but
let's say they did it

256
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:49,209
we need to know possible violations

257
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:52,500
we don't allow onion routing that's a
good policy you know

258
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,200
a it's also possible here by the
government of Iran but whatever

259
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,320
you know this there's some things are
not OK people agree to an incoming in

260
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,000
the network

261
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,180
so if they do those things need to be
alerted to it and someone that's gonna

262
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,360
be available NetFlow

263
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,339
and I'm the meta-data inside an up-close
just meta-data

264
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:14,610
there's nothing magic about us you can
put anything inside and that so

265
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,839
jeanine right he fix it you want you

266
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:21,629
but the user name in there you can put
the URL requested in the NetFlow data

267
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:25,959
I'll you know you can but the horoscope
with that whatever you want can be put

268
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:27,220
inside at the meta-data

269
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,739
so one of the ways has been used in
several deployments

270
00:15:30,739 --> 00:15:35,600
I is grabbing euro information putting
an end to the meta-data and they're

271
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,569
looking for

272
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:40,369
I'll blacklist URL so that your else
associated with

273
00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:44,720
I'll Saran somewheres

274
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,970
um so there's an

275
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:51,740
one good thing about army one good thing
about

276
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,380
give me a second spot in my mind you
guys are actually cause right now

277
00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:00,140
I'll so bullying detection is a very
smart way

278
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,230
offloading a business process to a
computer

279
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:07,040
on when we first started doing signature
detection

280
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,090
there were just so many alarms coming
out these boxes

281
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:15,940
and so you does not know what have the
time to deal with it all seem like noise

282
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,040
and so one of the first things he
started to do is okay if there's a

283
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,050
sequel injection coming in

284
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:25,100
is that machine it hit that that it is
hitting is it even possible

285
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,550
as its not I'm gonna continue to have
another dark beer

286
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:32,390
and I do something else I don't care I
need to do anything so

287
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:36,490
that logic that really is I associate
with its a response plans

288
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:39,920
could be mapped into terming the
relevance

289
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,390
I i've detection so in this case

290
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:47,440
IDS signatures triggered is the machine
it the target vulnerable

291
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,600
um after it was hit did it start
disclosing data if so

292
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,690
trigger wake everybody up and ruin their
regional are

293
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,450
right and so it it's good for offloading
data

294
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,400
there there are some challenges though
one requires you to know what the bad

295
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,570
scenario looks like

296
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,620
what are the steps that need to be
triggered are

297
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,500
for Nick that and a hacker's if they
figure out what you think the at this

298
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,839
the the events are they can just change
it right was too little bit differently

299
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,240
I'm it also requires highly processed
data

300
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,450
intrusion detector Detection System
Center basing

301
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:24,010
system has to download signatures it has
to

302
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:28,380
parcels on the wire a cat has to not
drop packets is a lot of things that

303
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,040
have to happen for it output CPE

304
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:36,190
exploiting NCTE XYZ just happen so
that's another challenge

305
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:39,390
I'm you have to know what it is

306
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:44,040
right there are more exploits it is
sadly I saw a lot of my time working on

307
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,010
the department if that's their exploits
that we will not know about

308
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:50,760
for a long time I was on a panel
yesterday and people say you're patcher

309
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,540
machines and one antivirus

310
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,870
said that only catch is a really sucky
malware right

311
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,570
the good now where this really scary
that's not going

312
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:03,690
it's not gonna catch any hacked right
and so there are you have to know what

313
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,500
to look for in sight as I was pulling
detection mechanism

314
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,890
and I don't know exactly why put the
last load in there

315
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:13,650
so moving on to something that and that
is very good have

316
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:17,600
as behavioral analysis so this looking
for things and that this becomes

317
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,950
challenging when you try to do this
yourself because you now have an account

318
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:21,500
thanks

319
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,120
if your gonna count a machine is doing a
slow address can

320
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,930
yourself that's once in packet then
there's an arson packet

321
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:32,730
and so you're on every host now you have
to computational each count

322
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:37,320
and and and maintain counters on every
host as for doing those things

323
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,970
and you're gonna trigger that's an
address can TCP do something like that

324
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:45,990
but it is very good at catching scanning
if you are doing those counters is good

325
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:49,149
are looking for floods have data

326
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:53,690
associate with the DOS or something else
slack sequences like normal you don't

327
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,749
start a TCP conversation with

328
00:18:55,749 --> 00:18:59,989
you know Acree Sat is pretty weird the
way to start a conversation

329
00:18:59,989 --> 00:19:03,039
I'll the the pros at this

330
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,859
is you don't have to know the exploit
used us behavior comes after largely

331
00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:08,080
connect with rekon

332
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,320
I inside a vehicle detection it's almost
always gonna be some factory time

333
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:11,919
behavior

334
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,820
I'll and that of course a comic
convention is

335
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,280
computationally becomes complicated when
you have thousands of posts inside the

336
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,750
network that you have to have something
in every saying

337
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,860
0 send packets and once in Pakistan at
some point you have to learn about

338
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,620
anomaly detection the pros are

339
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,610
they can catch really hard impossible to
catch stuff

340
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:37,010
the cons are it's magic

341
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:42,080
and eyes so there is a lot of
computation has to happen not just

342
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,520
counting everything

343
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,530
but base lining everything grouping
everything

344
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:50,340
and putting them in proper context
because there's not one normal in any

345
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,260
network

346
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:56,130
on there is normal for the clients to
the email servers there's a whole other

347
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,929
set up normal that is the scanners to
the

348
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:03,179
I'll to the data center there are many
types as normal

349
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:07,920
so enclave ng Iran or close grouping
inside those eyes spaces are very

350
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,470
important

351
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:12,679
and its it and that changes to write
it's not one time to do that

352
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:16,010
there is a lot a date or talking about
now

353
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:19,630
we're talking about communications from
servers to servers clients to clients

354
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:20,160
clients

355
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,660
certain is every potentially every
communication inside the network needs

356
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,910
to be processed

357
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:29,270
I stored and analyzed a and then we also
have to do something

358
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,890
I caught out with my calculation here
but it's really a index-based

359
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:38,110
alarming and so what this means is you
know I mentioned guy shows up thirty

360
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,140
minutes late for work

361
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,730
does that mean call in the answer
response team free if you bought that

362
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:43,160
house

363
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:47,500
it stirred some things are more abnormal
than other things

364
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,510
and so how do you deal with that inside
a a system a computer system like

365
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,850
a like in that system and so

366
00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:00,410
wanna one approach that 1i advocate is
doing it

367
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:04,450
index based approach is something that's
a little bit anomalous for a little bit

368
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,370
suspicious

369
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,610
we recommend a counter a host countered
this host

370
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:12,880
just had a TCP reset imagine getting an
email every time the city should be

371
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,559
reset

372
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:18,179
but if you see a TCP reset and then you
also sir sings address scanning

373
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:22,590
or researching possible violation on top
of that the cumulative behavior

374
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:26,070
becomes increasingly concerning right so

375
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:29,070
to do that mathematically say that's a
little bit special

376
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:33,840
this a couple points to the index is
very suspicious tana points to the index

377
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,769
annual arm when the index exceeds
acceptable values

378
00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:41,080
and is accepted as a chain Trader some
things you don't care about

379
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,799
dudes on guess that means of his mind
little destroy yes net

380
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,100
um p.o.s machine losses

381
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:52,039
you know is that a little goofy wake
everybody up writers different levels of

382
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:53,470
tolerance based upon

383
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:56,509
how those indexes impact business

384
00:21:56,509 --> 00:21:59,759
so here are some other things either we
can look at

385
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,429
a look at some histograms and by the way
should make a disclaimer all these

386
00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:05,669
things had to go through legal so many
times or

387
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:10,090
this brief was almost computer thing
happened at the end so

388
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,739
I had to release their ally sisters no
company names left in it

389
00:22:13,739 --> 00:22:17,519
and I had to reproduce all apps the the
data graphs

390
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:20,720
as well a so that

391
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,369
I didn't say that very funny way certain
things that suck but this is

392
00:22:24,369 --> 00:22:28,700
this is where to the human eye right you
know might not so we know what this is

393
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:34,269
looking at it um but it just looks weird
and you're looking at this is a a

394
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,119
histogram

395
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,549
up the bytes per second are bits per
second I relationship

396
00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:43,509
and really the above that line is

397
00:22:43,509 --> 00:22:47,049
the traffic coming into a

398
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:50,279
in this case coming into a server a web
server

399
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:53,270
web server farm a group web servers

400
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:57,160
and I'll the line going down is the data
leaving

401
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,340
those web server so it looks like a
hammer ways

402
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,890
so with the knowledge a texan other Khan
is there's no CV

403
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:07,930
output its weird thing just happened
with the web servers and so you in this

404
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,900
case look at it it looks that is weird

405
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,510
II says it's weird but I don't really
know what it is

406
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:17,170
in this case is actually a sentence it's
a sense like de dos coming into the web

407
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:17,880
servers

408
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,360
with the data exfiltration connecting to
a sequence action

409
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,430
sucking the data out so from that's that

410
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:29,840
um enjoying his house is one nice thing
within bad with the knowledge a texan

411
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,790
particularly as the human eye is very
good at picking out these types

412
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,590
anomalies

413
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:37,250
if you have specific scopes so this one
here is

414
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:41,410
internet to web servers right so you're
looking at a very specific

415
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:45,160
a Sat data it looks funny

416
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,810
and so now you can zoom and also get the
records that led up to this so I can

417
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:49,910
make a determination

418
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:53,020
this is a change and

419
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:59,680
I service type: um particularly in like
PCI environments or hip environments

420
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,740
computers are pretty you're pretty
boring

421
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,990
like they will do PCI events all day
long the

422
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:09,130
credit card numbers don't get longer no
dude ever walked a lot there got a

423
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:09,930
credit card has

424
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:13,110
450 digits on it they're all like 16
digits

425
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:17,910
so its exact same transactions all day
long and no peace IPOs machinery says

426
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,100
you know i i think i wanna

427
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,610
check out YouTube today are heard shes
cool

428
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:26,720
let's do that let's see what it looks
like so it's very boring and the service

429
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,310
profile

430
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:30,890
have a tight tied up a nation so in this
case is I'll

431
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:34,140
I classified HPS which means I'll

432
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,750
a compartment net flows the ability to
do deep packet inspection

433
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:42,770
so with HTTPS if it if it is a steep yes
you're gonna see

434
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:46,440
I'm SSL exchanges um

435
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,200
but officials 443 TCP something else
going on you're not gonna see those

436
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,240
exchanges in a check classified as HTTPS
on this case

437
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,310
there's both the check there's both a
change in I volume

438
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:01,140
and also change in the traffic profile
and that there's something else running

439
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:01,530
I

440
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:04,870
net this is my favorite

441
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:08,240
I geographic traffic anomaly

442
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,010
if all of a sudden if you've never done
anything with the ukraine

443
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:16,870
and now a hundred Magyar traffic is gone
ukraine that's weird

444
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:22,040
right a and is really also one example
if you're a at your local government

445
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,080
that's really weird

446
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:28,220
on so looking at that time a day at all
your traffic happens

447
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,130
925 and then you start seeing ru major
transfer and transfers at different

448
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,220
times a day it's also a reason for
concern

449
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:38,770
maybe not as bad as ukraine and then
applying this to the user

450
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:45,650
I'm if the user is in atlanta 40-man and
log and 40 minutes before to log into a

451
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,250
machine and Boston

452
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:51,550
that's an obvious it's even worse if
you're in atlanta and in Beijing at the

453
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,290
same time

454
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:55,790
right so those are those are now is
actually

455
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:59,620
impossible this is a fun one I

456
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:03,510
hi this is a metric so we talk about
counters but what if you counted

457
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,920
every bite that a host

458
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:10,300
a collection the network every day I
will I come into work I collect maybe

459
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,650
10 bytes maybe a hundred minus take part
in bytes

460
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:17,390
maybe ten Magus maybe a hundred make
whatever it is what is a normal person

461
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,180
doing today

462
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:22,520
and then you see a guy like this who dis
as you know it's gonna take 11px today

463
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,670
and I'm I'm 11 get the data don't tell
me that I can have long its data

464
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:31,740
I was actually on site and in Chicago
and i just i three weeks ago

465
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,960
and i'm looking at this time explaining
to that folk and I don't have no idea

466
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,360
what they'll

467
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,410
but because it says I said no me when I
see this someone is quitting

468
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:45,130
I see that LinkedIn profile changed I
see them suck all the data the network

469
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:48,480
and then a letter of resignation cops
right there collecting all that stuff

470
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,630
they feel like it's theirs

471
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:53,450
and so in that case is actually the
chief information security officer

472
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:57,130
and he didn't leaves if anyone needs a
new CISO I know a guy

473
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:00,440
I'll can't recommend them but I know I'm

474
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:06,990
I N I data disclosure how much data is
leaving the networks are counting how

475
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,470
many bytes someone send out the
networking today

476
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:12,260
there's something that's normal there's
something is abnormal or something

477
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:12,630
that's

478
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:16,380
all crazy abnormal right so there are
different degrees here that we can't do

479
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,220
we can mathematically compute those

480
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:22,070
you that our fans standard deviation so

481
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:27,110
some with that said are there any
questions on any of that noise I'm

482
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:30,320
asking is because if I ask your
questions I can reach for the beer

483
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,130
while I wait for you to raise your hands
okay yep

484
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:42,130
it depends on the metric

485
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:47,530
so if you're a if you're doing bits per
second that's gnarly

486
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:51,710
you can do an ollie on that I something
more precise like I'll

487
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:56,360
a saturation as send packets that's
going to be tougher to calculate as you

488
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,480
can be you don't know if you missed this
setback or so it was a %uh

489
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,780
offices sample so but most a modern
stuff can do

490
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,279
line right now nesler

491
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:09,200
the good stuff can okay

492
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,700
Ruis so yet you have a whole other set
of problems

493
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,049
and I'll

494
00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:20,600
all yeah was you're right so

495
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,580
there are ways in doing that and and
NetFlow might not be the only data

496
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,999
source you need for %uh

497
00:28:25,999 --> 00:28:30,639
for doing aggregation and I at who had
that IP address at a given time and

498
00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:31,860
getting down to i

499
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:35,440
getting on those metrics are gonna help
as well but yeah

500
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,320
bitrate: stuff you can do but the
problem is you don't have all the I

501
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,029
if you don't have all the data you can't
visit cockpit set

502
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:46,559
the I'll

503
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,059
sec you can't give it to the app for
into GObject

504
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:53,489
there was concerning and that's actually
a really nice thing about NetFlow I'll

505
00:28:53,489 --> 00:28:56,399
is that you could potentially have
forensic records everything that

506
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,009
happened in the network for

507
00:28:58,009 --> 00:29:02,230
a year at a very low cost I compared
trying to do

508
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:05,830
you know 32 32 32 you were so happy chap

509
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:10,279
and so began a becomes much easier to
query but if you're doing sampling it's

510
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:11,480
like having a camera

511
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,399
that you know a video camera that takes
a picture every two minutes and you hope

512
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:16,019
thats

513
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:21,070
hokum be in rock band right add that the
guy comes in at that moment and doesn't

514
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:23,600
know about the sample rate but it is a
challenge sampling

515
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:30,600
it can it can help in the calculation
but it's just telling you how screwed

516
00:29:30,859 --> 00:29:31,330
you are

517
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:34,460
right i mean that's all it says is being
honest about how bad the

518
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:38,989
out that it is all right let's go
through some examples this is the fun

519
00:29:38,989 --> 00:29:39,499
part

520
00:29:39,499 --> 00:29:42,700
on notice I guy I can even mention

521
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,809
I can mention a customer I came really
mention the country

522
00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:50,039
I because they're scared of jail

523
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,990
I but anyway

524
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:56,390
so that's always fun for me I got a call
at 3:30 in the morning I'm

525
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:59,700
I sleeping in the suburbs that I
Minneapolis

526
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,880
and I'm they're screaming

527
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,900
E ENB as broken

528
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:11,050
ass okay a lot and by the way if you
ever call me at 3-3 in the morning and

529
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,650
me being sober it's a crapshoot

530
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:18,350
okay so good I mean it's what is its
1:30 in the afternoon now

531
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,840
yeah so the

532
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:26,060
a that's what was going on I E and so we
go back we start looking at what is

533
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,250
happening and they had

534
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:30,670
but they called mainframes roads bleed

535
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:34,930
Massa computers with Petra vines and
Petra bites where the patient data

536
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:39,740
and they had built very tight
segmentation

537
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,590
that meant only a couple segments
insider that now

538
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:46,610
I hope I'm here unfortunate wanna be ok
after dongles

539
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:49,730
have a yeah people hating a backup

540
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:52,850
1/2 the video capture devices

541
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:55,980
throws hope they're in the process so if
you look at me

542
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:59,740
whenever you of all

543
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:02,910
me anyway when my video devices growth
%uh

544
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:07,090
so we have to stop stop the video but
the audio actual top start back up very

545
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,169
very shortly

546
00:31:08,169 --> 00:31:15,169
thank you sorry for the inconvenience

547
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:24,679
he organized criminals who were
collecting also formation

548
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:27,960
I really wish I could tell you what
those profits the what think our core

549
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,380
stuff the store but you're at Wheeler
beer to

550
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:33,760
and the cameras collapse cost I'll

551
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,929
so but I so the

552
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:41,270
so the couple things here one I web
servers don't normally say

553
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:44,610
nor am I to do today when she starred on
FTP uploads

554
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:49,710
and if they do that they don't normally
say less to FTP uploads to

555
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:52,840
Eastern Europe right

556
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:57,090
especially when you're a small
municipality Shirish

557
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:00,130
who'll

558
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:05,820
large FTP Upload

559
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:10,740
going every thing about every eight
hours

560
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:15,990
your this most fun I really wish I could
say this but there are

561
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:20,920
this is a trade secret deal there are
some special foods that we all

562
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,250
eat that a country and in

563
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:29,120
and East Asia wanted to know how to make
peace

564
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,670
foodstuffs okay

565
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:37,260
and so the way they broke it was
actually pretty neat

566
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:41,400
they went and mister fisher really
stupid administrator

567
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,940
and so I think you're out rhythms now
for finding the stupidest administrator

568
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:49,750
IT guy inside the organization I think
there are forums I haven't seen them but

569
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,700
there has to be

570
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:54,330
because almost three out of four these
things are going to and I said I talked

571
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:54,980
the guy

572
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:58,140
he's like fourths cop except the way
less likable

573
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,770
right and so I'll

574
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:07,120
I'm a skill can play pingpong either but
um so they Spearfish demand it was for

575
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,390
it was little it was let this is ninety
guy

576
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:13,730
your password is expiring

577
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:18,059
change change your password and so he
clicks on the link that and he has and

578
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:21,370
he's a guy that actually changes
passwords and people forget passwords

579
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:26,240
and again I S may have ever do in as I
make my life easier and he clicks on it

580
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,010
and and ask you know what your old
password input is all password any but

581
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,320
the new password and

582
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,470
and the the site comes back and says
that's not complex enough

583
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:41,120
style school right there lay that the
hackers you like to try harder

584
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,030
of and so he puts in a

585
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:48,650
like more complex one the attackers get
it sunday I'm

586
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:54,169
they log in via VPN the changes password
to this new complex password to make it

587
00:33:54,169 --> 00:33:55,799
harder for the next set up attackers

588
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:01,280
I am and then through the VPN they take
control of the machine scanning the

589
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,840
network

590
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:07,270
so you you keep gmail if you ever have
ever been in said a responder and you

591
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:10,170
get alarm so much as a VIP some some
some

592
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:15,380
is you know me by a Reds the scanner
elsewhere is a scanner

593
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,910
are you even look at it you're so used
to telling people it's the scanners or

594
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:22,320
13 scares I think months entertainer
some numbers scanners

595
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,420
inside the inside the network all of
them

596
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:29,150
they were scanned the network like this
post to but they probably shouldn't have

597
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,510
been doing my secord ops across every
single

598
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:36,570
datastore inside the network and then
they probably should not have been

599
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:37,950
staging that data

600
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:41,770
for FTP retrieval to a comp to our
country

601
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:48,290
that makes great takeout wall

602
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:54,610
cool so every kind look something like
this: its address canning looking for

603
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:56,500
SMD file servers

604
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:02,180
I'm and then I she repentance I'm ready
sean is exact same graph so that's a

605
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:06,210
the day that leaving leaving the network
I am

606
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:10,090
this was a little cook your night this
one doesn't really make sense

607
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:13,110
because it may take all the hard about
this one but there is a

608
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:16,840
University they're doing

609
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,190
a.m.

610
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:22,130
ramallah say sensitive research

611
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:26,570
and the state-sponsored attackers

612
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:29,990
was apparent that came in Tehran the
road they are on this one I'm

613
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:34,090
they found the remote desktop

614
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:37,500
servers and in a distorted brute forcing
them until they get

615
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:43,110
I get into I'll get into the servers and
other thing about remote desktop use

616
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:45,930
that it's very start the bites coming
from

617
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:49,190
the server are very high compared to

618
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:53,650
the bites a client sense in a type and a
couple she's going you're typing

619
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:58,520
or the updated the position your mouse
so it's very small data going up to the

620
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,140
server

621
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:02,510
an early screening I'll what's on the
screen

622
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:06,250
I'm so 10 things we saw was a spike in

623
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:09,290
other traffic profile

624
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:12,710
or a deck that later I eso the traffic
profiles

625
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:16,010
a change to where the client part of the
conversation was very high

626
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:21,800
and I'm and is also an abnormal amount
of RTP traffic

627
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,790
and if any have you working University
you have all kinds of problems to deal

628
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,540
with I sympathize with you like

629
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:30,760
having a class B year to space that has
not napped

630
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,900
or firewalls and

631
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,910
the laws of nature dog played a tenured
professors

632
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:40,310
so its top securing Networks Inc than
their

633
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:44,210
so and this you gonna see this is
basically is the best I could do for

634
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,550
graphs to show this but

635
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:48,870
I there's everything going on everything
total

636
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:53,960
and then that blue blip %uh remote
desktop traffic in comparison to it so

637
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,800
is a very anomalous Amalco

638
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,850
data coming in on the inbound side so

639
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:06,850
order or more when

640
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:10,120
this is easy so okay there's a
manufacturer

641
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:14,460
not far from here East guess which one
it is

642
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,700
they pissed off some people

643
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,269
they said things they should said

644
00:37:21,269 --> 00:37:25,069
and so the activist for activist decided
that they were going to embarrass the

645
00:37:25,069 --> 00:37:26,009
manufacturer

646
00:37:26,009 --> 00:37:30,210
so they did a single injection against a
customer portal published all the

647
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,390
customer information

648
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:34,410
and paste them and

649
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:37,480
I was at attack but I was actually
pretty I was easy

650
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:41,430
actually attacked again address canning
I'll

651
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:45,490
is very hard to do an exploding as a
server as we know what it is

652
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:48,749
and so you have to find server space
surgery Connie fingerprint at

653
00:37:48,749 --> 00:37:53,079
is that Apache is that I asked what CMS
running at once you get all that done

654
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:54,390
it's very easy to exploit

655
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:57,539
what you have to do a good that every
time a set so that was easy enough

656
00:37:57,539 --> 00:38:01,099
in this craft is horrible seeing I'll

657
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:04,940
but on the left this is traffic cool

658
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:09,079
i leaving the web server going to the
Internet so it was very is almost

659
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:09,660
nothing

660
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:14,519
and then a lot quickly leaving at the
same time that date is quickly leaving

661
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:18,039
the backing onto the front and so its
data being sucked out the back in

662
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:20,690
through the front and that's what
sequence action looks like when you put

663
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:21,380
it together

664
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:24,579
or something some type a drive-by attack

665
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:29,029
so that was easy cash from the beginning
to the end and the friends records put

666
00:38:29,029 --> 00:38:32,000
that all together

667
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
are there any questions

668
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:44,000
quiet

669
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:51,930
and

670
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:58,509
go sure so yeah like to tell people that
I'm like a doctor that comes and

671
00:38:58,509 --> 00:38:59,430
explains

672
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:02,569
broader cancer is and I show you how bad
it is

673
00:39:02,569 --> 00:39:06,479
and then I go drink beer angle of rights
so

674
00:39:06,479 --> 00:39:11,200
somebody else's problem to fix all this
nonsense it is possible if you become

675
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,160
aware of I

676
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,279
if you become aware other debts you can
do

677
00:39:15,279 --> 00:39:19,779
there's a lot of things going on for our
systems communicate with each other you

678
00:39:19,779 --> 00:39:20,269
can send

679
00:39:20,269 --> 00:39:23,289
old school would be like in or out going
to something I

680
00:39:23,289 --> 00:39:27,099
or shot onto a firewall something along
those lines

681
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:30,900
you can't do anything in line when using
a distributed

682
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,609
sensors net flow coming in see can't
knock it off the wire like you would

683
00:39:34,609 --> 00:39:36,920
with the trade show I P S

684
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,650
those are one option other things come
up this island

685
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:42,950
integration with a course that
mechanisms like I'll

686
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:46,690
I back like a cisco has a dirty services
engine

687
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:52,070
so it gets permission to host figures
out how risky it is and says okay your

688
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,470
employees access

689
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:57,340
and so when you text him an abnormal
behavior going on you can come back and

690
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:00,810
say okay he's no longer employees
accessing is to be quarantined

691
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:04,990
or internet only accessed by a sending
out command over to

692
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:08,410
I S E I'll nor thing that

693
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:11,710
Cisco's been sponsoring SPX readme which
is that it's

694
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:15,010
you know it's it it's an open standard
open I

695
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:19,600
open standard on health for devices to
pass information between each other

696
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:24,680
%ah and deaths of right pedal
participates in that so he can pass

697
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,970
information but I it again its
visibility really and so

698
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:32,870
when you talk about the information
security compared to martial or physical

699
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:33,600
security

700
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,759
I'll surveillance is the first thing
that we do

701
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,990
right so you know when I'm knock over
the liquor store on Monroe

702
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:43,890
and after this talk it's not only lasers
and drop

703
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:47,590
floors that are gonna stop me its it's
going to be

704
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:51,350
I'm going to be recognized and they're
going to arrest me and put me in jail

705
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:54,960
right it's going to be the follow-up is
coming surveillance and deters my

706
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,650
behavior

707
00:40:55,650 --> 00:41:00,230
and so really I in bad as in that
surveillance space or should be

708
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:03,630
I'll and therefore sadistic and to
answer response

709
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:07,390
processes how to what do we do with me
well we detect something

710
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:10,730
and you know wait what

711
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:14,760
well you have to well this true I mean
but if I'm in Iraq law enforcement

712
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,980
doesn't stop any crime

713
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,390
right the cops grad they've never stop
me

714
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:24,020
I can tell you that aircraft its they
they've shown up afterwards

715
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:29,780
and they've had told me it was a bad
idea it but I'll

716
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:34,460
all me money to bail bondsman in Grand
Rapids I know couple

717
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,890
but I am the all and

718
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:39,309
I

719
00:41:39,309 --> 00:41:42,779
but there is a tie and though because
you know we move from his place were

720
00:41:42,779 --> 00:41:46,999
when I was working from for world we did
at the whole movement was that stop

721
00:41:46,999 --> 00:41:50,959
bad things before they happen let's put
in for some mechanisms and policies so

722
00:41:50,959 --> 00:41:52,630
that bad things can't happen

723
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:57,249
so but the thinking the on said
corollary to that is so we don't have to

724
00:41:57,249 --> 00:41:57,999
deal with all

725
00:41:57,999 --> 00:42:01,979
and so what happened in that I was
really stop monitoring

726
00:42:01,979 --> 00:42:06,199
we we had no way a validating are are we
being successful in stopping them

727
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:09,699
on it this morning I was working with a
a company that

728
00:42:09,699 --> 00:42:13,339
mostly make sheetrock and there were

729
00:42:13,339 --> 00:42:17,930
they were were routed they had no idea
for my rights

730
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:21,630
I without with attackers inside because
you're not breaking anything

731
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:24,839
I there are still in trade secret
information

732
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:28,690
and they're sending it out its sending
out the network and so you start really

733
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:31,190
looking for those things are never going
to find them

734
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:34,789
in the eye I was joking earlier that
your church bad now where and that's how

735
00:42:34,789 --> 00:42:35,509
it should be

736
00:42:35,509 --> 00:42:38,259
if you're any good at breaking into
something you shouldn't get caught

737
00:42:38,259 --> 00:42:39,609
that's

738
00:42:39,609 --> 00:42:43,369
that's the way to do it don't get into
crime if you're going to get caught that

739
00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:44,299
makes it much harder

740
00:42:44,299 --> 00:42:48,449
sexy right so I'm but surveillance is
important part

741
00:42:48,449 --> 00:42:52,769
surveillance enforcement and then
response and all the things are going to

742
00:42:52,769 --> 00:42:54,609
happen we're gonna have breaches were
gonna

743
00:42:54,609 --> 00:42:59,249
then how do you deal with them and an
add next year may go to a talk on

744
00:42:59,249 --> 00:43:04,529
how operationalize all this what do you
do when something happens cuz I was

745
00:43:04,529 --> 00:43:05,759
talking with a customer

746
00:43:05,759 --> 00:43:09,039
few see month ago

747
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:12,359
and I so what do you guys do when you
find out that there's a botnet infection

748
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:15,920
and they said well you know we going to
memory forensics leopold the network

749
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,469
research on

750
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:20,319
peach apple gets a into the dry eyes I
start going in a friend's ex

751
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:24,420
figure out the indicates compromise on
the published data microfiche

752
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:28,380
I know you guys who knows how to do
memory forensics here which many you

753
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,089
guys

754
00:43:29,089 --> 00:43:32,699
you guys really know how to start your
car's there's no one here they can do

755
00:43:32,699 --> 00:43:34,619
memory forensics and if you could

756
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:38,839
you do not have the cycles because I
know you have about a hundred thats

757
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,920
per month there's it is mathematically
impossible

758
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,529
okay we wipe the box as okay you wipe
the box at your process

759
00:43:45,529 --> 00:43:48,589
write it down so we can be mostly most
the time right

760
00:43:48,589 --> 00:43:51,619
might wipe the box so it so it really is

761
00:43:51,619 --> 00:43:55,690
the biggest prominent Pesek is process
connection when we detect something when

762
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:56,519
something fails

763
00:43:56,519 --> 00:43:59,619
what do you do in their sisters is fancy

764
00:43:59,619 --> 00:44:03,349
that goes on that were not realizing all
three parts are very important

765
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:07,619
surveillance response you have to do
something nearly enough to do before

766
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:11,829
thing comes up on as a retro eight other
people there

767
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:17,720
anyways have any questions yes

768
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:24,720
what attacks are we missing

769
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:31,510
what um

770
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:36,370
it so mosser analysis is very a bet
centric toroto centric

771
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:39,640
I almost half its attack focused meaning

772
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,610
I so I went to something I showed you
there's free time

773
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:47,260
right as a part of the cyber kill chain
we should believe the Sabre Hill change

774
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:48,070
the way that we

775
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:52,530
actually doing attack on but we're not
doing as correlating all those different

776
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:53,310
against

777
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:57,820
as a map to the kilt chained together
and we start doing that we find that

778
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:01,270
what's our seemly to spirit that's map
into

779
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:04,350
a bigger I'll incident right so

780
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:08,320
and what are those incidents as I think
what your question is is largely

781
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:12,140
it's a lot a trade secret trade secret
theft is a hard thing to catch

782
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:15,500
I'll and because you don't like to cart
because

783
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,820
geopolitical ramifications glass or
being caught

784
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:23,050
I'm I'll and the other thing is the
human factor

785
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:27,180
I think when we talk about cybercrime we
like to think about a dichotomy between

786
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,310
cybercrime

787
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:32,190
and everything else criminal there's
nothing keeping

788
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:38,350
a cybercriminal for you from using
traditional I O

789
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:40,390
attacks on me like extortion

790
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:44,470
or a bribery

791
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:49,500
right why spend 50 weeks trying to break
into a network administrator will accept

792
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,530
a fifty thousand dollar bribe and so

793
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:56,570
if the administrator is the guy who has
access he can easily also cover-up

794
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:59,970
the audit trail and most most scenarios
so

795
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:03,080
the layer 8 is the easiest thing to
exploit

796
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:06,980
being a human being is easiest exploits
the hardest audit

797
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:11,160
I'm but is it is mostly trade secrets
the credit card stuff we eventually

798
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:11,940
catch

799
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:15,100
there's a way to catch that because
business process at the telly and shows

800
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:15,650
us

801
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:19,590
you know charles is popular helicopter
right he's probably hitting bottom

802
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:21,530
helicopters is monthly price should

803
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:25,350
can select card and so

804
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:29,450
but trade secrets as much blurry or miss
longer line but to someone do with the

805
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:32,680
trade secret think figure out how to
make toritos or whatever it is right

806
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:35,970
what does that mean how do we catch that
how do we know that I was actually

807
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:40,060
trade secret test and china doll back is
much more complicated

808
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:44,800
I'll so secrets I think secrets are gone

809
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:51,800
and that's a problem I from a business
perspective as well as a personal on

810
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,869
yet wall

811
00:46:54,869 --> 00:47:00,050
so I A

812
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:03,280
and the first thing ever did

813
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,990
we need to do is have a process period
and I think I so flowcharts heard your

814
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:10,720
best friend any answer response plan

815
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,970
and dads gonna fit into that into that

816
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:17,970
France's on detection in that as a texan
is gonna catch

817
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:22,140
I'm those insider threats almost this
from your best cat

818
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:26,250
your best case for catching those guys
inside decided they're moving on or

819
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:30,210
it they did accept a bribe or other
family is in a basement somewhere until

820
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:31,940
they provide the data right there

821
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:37,490
I those things can happen so for
catching and cider and almost rats

822
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:41,099
it's important to do it but its only you
have a way to respond to it

823
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:45,210
I'm bringing it to land in bad tool and
turning it on doesn't solve

824
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:49,070
any problems it has to be connected to
what are we doing it or come to this

825
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:49,590
thing

826
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:53,359
and I'll I'll it shrink became

827
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:56,650
can shrink see at the time there and
know nothing about him back he noticed

828
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:56,970
these

829
00:47:56,970 --> 00:48:00,260
we're not stopping anything or check the
exploits already happened a

830
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:04,170
is that you already have a compromise
machine you're catching at waco

831
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:08,310
later in the show psych an actual change
right and so on but we still need to

832
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:11,330
catch it and it's much better to catch
it later than that to catch it at all

833
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:14,790
and it does dusted in there

834
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:18,940
and it also helps validate enforcement
and I'm when you go back in time you

835
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:22,410
look at this French records why didn't
this attack work

836
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:26,089
like with the the case up the l2tp
tunnels how did that actually what can

837
00:48:26,089 --> 00:48:28,869
we do to change things in that case that
organization

838
00:48:28,869 --> 00:48:32,650
they want to talk and iced I'm
authentication is one

839
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:35,930
wait to prevent that from happening
again and so looking at those

840
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:39,470
that's because you're able to catch a
min actually have a frenzy trailer what

841
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:41,280
actually occurred leading to breach

842
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:45,700
but you can Aliza failure into you have
the data the evidence do that

843
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:49,980
that's a good question

844
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:52,460
really quiet in here was quite my short

845
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:56,780
what my time at a time I think it going
what do you do if I keep going

846
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:00,400
what is your hook early smiling I'm
early scare to view

847
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,520
I can just keep on York my head

848
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,710
I'll thanks guys I appreciate it a
that's me up there
