1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,510
morning girl Kanhaiya done man

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:12,170
okay Guyo the sniffles got allergies

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,670
it's like one of the seasons change and

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:17,789
going to three different cities in one

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:20,400
week last we did not help at all but I'm

6
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,529
here and we're gonna get started this is

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,759
my legal disclaimer I always like to

8
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:25,320
start off with that I'm not a lawyer but

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,250
I played one on the internet before

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,109
successfully so whenever I do it often

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,030
to talk and most people say my talks are

12
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:34,350
offensive but I always have the

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,730
disclaimer in there so if I talk about

14
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,719
like I did something bad or I'm doing

15
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,148
something bad

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,010
just remember the kittens I'm adorable I

17
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,390
won't try to steal from you kill your

18
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,760
ruin you financially unless you pay me

19
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,440
first so when I get to those parts it's

20
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,780
like they're there's also another

21
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,140
disclaimer because I actually one that

22
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,270
contacted last week was four at the

23
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,180
guest of homeland security and I had to

24
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,489
explain yes I pick on the government a

25
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,230
lot in this talk okay it's not because I

26
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:02,760
don't like the government or the feds

27
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,539
it's just they're really good at giving

28
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,580
bad examples of security so why not so I

29
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,439
mean I'm paying taxes it's like I should

30
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,140
get something out of it right because

31
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,820
you know so there we go so just you get

32
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,350
that so if there's any feds in here and

33
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,449
I'm sure there are it's like just don't

34
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,798
you know well I'm on I'm on the English

35
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,189
you could put me on anyway let's be

36
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:26,659
honest okay it's like so yellow

37
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:29,389
there's a ton of talk I Pony I Pony not

38
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:33,119
quite frankly what that basically is is

39
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:35,850
going to be the top three things I love

40
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,490
to do or I love my victims I mean it's

41
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,860
our clients to do when I'm robbing them

42
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,119
the three things I'd love for them to do

43
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,060
because it's like it makes it easier to

44
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:47,430
rob them and then also the top three

45
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,920
things I hate for them to do because

46
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,320
that makes it harder for me to rob them

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,759
and then after we get that it's just

48
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,258
some funny stories it's like then we're

49
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,090
gonna get into like the vegetable stuff

50
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,189
of it it's like the mean vegetables

51
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,360
where it's like we talked about some of

52
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:02,158
the things you can take back to your

53
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,880
workplace and questions I want you to

54
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,890
ask your company so a little bit about

55
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,840
me you know it's like if you see the

56
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,310
lower upper left-hand corner

57
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,840
that's me robbing a bank in Beirut

58
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,380
Lebanon for the National Geographic

59
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,410
special breakthrough season 2 episode 2

60
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:21,450
which with an amazing cameo by Ted

61
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,489
Kennedy in it so that was awesome it's

62
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,319
like and then on the right side you'll

63
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:27,950
see me in the news not as much as other

64
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:30,268
people but in the lower left-hand corner

65
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:32,970
are my favorite pictures because those

66
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:35,580
are being actually robbing people that's

67
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:39,569
the breaking the very lower one that

68
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:43,110
corridor is in a 5-star French hotel and

69
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:44,790
the Riviera I was robbing them barefoot

70
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,549
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle pajama

71
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,170
bottoms and a t-shirt and I'd pull

72
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:50,730
access to the server the Carib I ended

73
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,030
up that engagement just from that

74
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,380
elevator ride going back up with the

75
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,390
master keys for the hotel and an

76
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,790
unlocked workstation and there they're

77
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,470
back employee office area it was a

78
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,989
five-star hotel that provided everything

79
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,640
so that was good in the upper left hand

80
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:07,019
you see the little red circle that's me

81
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,599
getting an employee to get out of their

82
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:12,540
desk their headquarters of a bank branch

83
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,910
and as I installed Bauer on his computer

84
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,130
it's like so that was nice but my

85
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:19,320
favorite one is that's a computer that I

86
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:23,070
literally just walked behind a bank

87
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:25,049
teller line and stole I unplugged it

88
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,578
while the teller next to me was working

89
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:28,109
and I'm sort of rude because I didn't

90
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:30,900
even say hello or anything it's like I

91
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:35,100
felt bad about it sort of but I was so

92
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,780
mean on the bank branch before where I

93
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,370
told this bank manager all these

94
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,630
wonderful things I just like crushed him

95
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,730
like a little puppy and it was like it

96
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,230
was horrible so on this month like well

97
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,238
I'm not gonna talk to anybody I just I

98
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,130
just feeling too bad so I just walked in

99
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,739
and didn't say a word and then just

100
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:53,760
robbed them that way so that's what I do

101
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:55,560
I brought people to help them so and

102
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,149
also give talks and try to do security

103
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,400
awareness because my whole thing is I

104
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,840
don't do social I don't do like social

105
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,489
engineering engagements I don't do red

106
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,560
teaming it's like I'm not that cool it's

107
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:07,829
like I do security awareness engagements

108
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,010
I'm trying to educate not as much as I'm

109
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:12,450
trying to poem and one of these I want

110
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,600
to talk about is like in our industry

111
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,269
attack well we have this

112
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:19,120
have these categories we've got the leap

113
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:21,310
red team ninjas that go in two companies

114
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,080
it's like an a they talk about that it's

115
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,670
like I mean you see all the stuff that

116
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,530
you saw before and I'm like oh my god

117
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:28,210
that's like I'm never gonna be able to

118
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,580
get that cool to be able to do those

119
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,500
kind of tools but it's like but those

120
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:35,039
also are sometimes it's like if you

121
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,060
don't properly frame it to your clients

122
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,060
you're giving them a false sense of

123
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,410
security it's like I mean perfect I mean

124
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,630
it's like that's one of the key things

125
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:47,080
we have to worry about it's like we give

126
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:48,820
these clients and we tell them it's like

127
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,830
oh yeah we came in here we went through

128
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,900
the skylight Severino it's like these

129
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:54,789
are our Red Team magic and put on our

130
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,440
robes and wizard hats and it's like and

131
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,060
we totally you know punch people on

132
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,670
faces and they lost their plans and we

133
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:03,040
like totally compromised everybody and

134
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:05,530
how much did that give a value to them

135
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,900
it's like how much think cuz then your

136
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:10,239
clients are going like we're safe now

137
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:13,060
no we just showed you how we destroyed

138
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,430
everything so yeah but you guys are like

139
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,650
ninjas like of course we failed against

140
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,300
you so that means that the typical

141
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,500
people the people that we really have to

142
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,750
worry about we're gonna be fine with

143
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,290
them we'll catch them you guys were

144
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,170
amazing

145
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:27,490
no you need to explain to them it's more

146
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:29,380
like the lower-right headquarter that's

147
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,540
90 percent of the attacks that go out

148
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:34,060
there it's like you got to show them

149
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,800
sometimes it's just basic it's like I

150
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:39,940
tell people I don't believe in advanced

151
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,560
persistent threats okay apt is what the

152
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,420
sea levels tell the public and the

153
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,950
shareholders so they can figure out that

154
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,420
it's like you know that got pwned so

155
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,950
easily that's that's all that is the

156
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:50,500
terminology just marketing terminology

157
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:53,260
now at this point apt for me stands for

158
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,930
adequate fishing technique that's apt

159
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:59,320
it's like and I don't do any kind of abt

160
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:01,390
I just do bad basic adorable destruction

161
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,010
that's it I just try it I just try to be

162
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:05,020
bad it's like the most basic we just

163
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,400
walking in so it's like so I mean you

164
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,049
got to understand you got to build that

165
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,270
and it's like and it's very important

166
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,710
and it's a big call for a lot of Red

167
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,060
Team Cummings's like one of these is

168
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:16,419
like I mean there are companies out

169
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:18,160
there that do I mean dead kid does a

170
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:19,600
class on purple teaming it's like he

171
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,330
actually tries to involve the blue team

172
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,400
and the red team assessment tried

173
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:25,500
educate them as they go and that's

174
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,870
important and vital you can't just show

175
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,210
them how magically you appeared and

176
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,780
destroyed something and then disappear

177
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,909
you know

178
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,469
then just smoke gone it's like you've

179
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:35,729
got to be able to be there to talk to

180
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:38,189
them and as you can't explain to them

181
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:40,620
why the risk are and why it's important

182
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:42,389
that they fix it and what are the other

183
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,550
problems that we're facing let's be

184
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:46,289
honest is you look at the left and

185
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,750
that's what that's what that's what your

186
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:51,300
executives are expecting right your

187
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,189
executives expect that you need to build

188
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,960
the walls you need you know bigger

189
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:56,719
firewalls you know make them bigger it's

190
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,810
like you will have the apt pay for it

191
00:06:56,719 --> 00:07:02,520
and does that work out very well it's

192
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:05,759
like because you know why you go with

193
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:10,008
that you believe yes let's do that let's

194
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:12,180
get that going we'll leave this hold on

195
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:15,500
you got the budget for the stuff on the

196
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:17,669
right okay we want what's on the left

197
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,060
but we're gonna give you enough to build

198
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:22,229
out what's on the right and you're like

199
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,900
Kylie's put a guy with some binoculars

200
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:28,139
on the top there cuz you give me

201
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:30,900
something throw me a bone here right so

202
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:32,250
it's a constant day so one of these I

203
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,568
will talk about and some of the things

204
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,940
I'm talking about are things that are

205
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:38,099
not going to cost too much money it's

206
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,330
like some of the night but it's like

207
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:40,680
just things that you're gonna have to

208
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,508
have certain things did we deal with

209
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,360
because it's like I don't do

210
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:47,789
sophistication it's like this does this

211
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,349
ever give you the the appearance that I

212
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:51,779
might be sophisticated in any way shape

213
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:53,219
or form no it's like so let's talk about

214
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:56,009
that let's talk about some of the things

215
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:59,699
that we can do one of the things that I

216
00:07:56,009 --> 00:08:01,379
love I love my clients to do is to have

217
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:04,349
employees that are not empowered or

218
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:07,529
educated to question the unusual I love

219
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:11,878
that that is amazing because you know

220
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:13,620
why 99% of the companies the employees

221
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:17,370
don't understand that they're part of

222
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,389
your security team they don't figure out

223
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:21,419
that that's part of their job

224
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:24,449
description that's not their fault

225
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:26,339
that's yours it's like they're not

226
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:29,159
educated and empowered to actually make

227
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:31,139
that change I did an engagement at the

228
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:32,380
beginning of this year in Boston for a

229
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:35,260
company was in downtown

230
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:37,240
it was a very secured facility until I

231
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,909
got there and it's like if I'm in there

232
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:43,270
and I've got a jacket on and it's like

233
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:44,410
and I have a USB ninja cable it's like

234
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:48,250
you know that looks like an iphone

235
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:49,689
charging cable and I went around and I

236
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,670
was like trying to get caught at this

237
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:53,170
point it's like I'd already the day

238
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,719
before I'd already like totally pwned

239
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:57,819
him I like I stole everything so this

240
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,560
one I was trying to give would I do a

241
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,210
security awareness engagement there's

242
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,089
actually a point where I tried to get

243
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:06,970
caught so this part I was trying to be

244
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:10,660
very obvious so I literally went up with

245
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:13,810
just the cable it was not attached to a

246
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:16,270
device it wasn't attached to a phone I

247
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:17,920
went with the cable went up to someone's

248
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,850
desk like hey I'm with the IT it's like

249
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,069
we're trying to make sure that the

250
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:23,290
you're not charging your devices on our

251
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:25,030
computer because of the GPL policies

252
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,829
make sure the USB stuffy nose disabled

253
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:28,839
for that kind of transfer because the

254
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:30,790
message within that blue stack on the

255
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,780
network inside the tcp/ip site conflicts

256
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,829
so it's I'm going to make sure that

257
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,569
happens you suppose to be using the

258
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:35,500
charger on the power outlet and step in

259
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:38,800
it because therefore it doesn't have

260
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:42,100
done in apparent magnetic fields so so I

261
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:46,150
do that and I plug the cable into their

262
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:48,640
computer and then I reach in my jacket

263
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:49,870
and I pull out a detonator it's not

264
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,520
really dead neighborhood sounds cooler

265
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:53,770
if I call it detonator it's like this

266
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,250
little square little box with Lauren

267
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,860
tanner

268
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:59,320
it's got two buttons on it and I pushed

269
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,820
a button it doesn't really go Boop but

270
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,960
that really sounds cool right they

271
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,000
should actually put that in there okay

272
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,370
I'm still I'm sorry I digress okay it's

273
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,470
morning I'm rambling so it's like so and

274
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:13,300
I execute all of a sudden on their

275
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:16,600
computer no pad pops up automatically

276
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,790
types test completes successfully thank

277
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:23,410

278
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:25,030
smiley emoji I'm like cool thank you

279
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:29,560

280
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:31,839

281
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,880
cool okay good good yeah awesome no I'm

282
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:39,390
good

283
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:43,330
no one said anything I plug the cable in

284
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:44,620
no pad pops up and starts typing like

285
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:47,980
your computers but then

286
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:54,310
my poltergeist and you're like seems

287
00:10:47,980 --> 00:11:00,190
legit there's a disconnect there is a

288
00:10:54,310 --> 00:11:07,329
disconnect eight machines one after the

289
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:09,130
other I did that afterwards I went to

290
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:10,900
them because it's like what I do is once

291
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:12,490
I've destroyed you it's like I come back

292
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,260
afterwards it's like after about two

293
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:16,420
minutes after I show I see since we got

294
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,280
away and then I try to educate each

295
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,920
single person and I say hey remember

296
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,829
what I did that really sketchy thing

297
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:26,380
that was bad I was a bad guy I was doing

298
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:28,240
bad things don't when you see that again

299
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:30,970
don't let that happen what you just did

300
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,820
because that was bad did I mention the

301
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:35,620
bad part okay good it's like no I mean

302
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:38,590
bad but you know I'm saying okay good

303
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:40,530
okay so so we go there and I went up to

304
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:46,150
them and I told them to explain to them

305
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:48,670
this is like why did you weren't you

306
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:50,949
curious how that happened and they're

307
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:52,660
like yeah but it's like I did I didn't

308
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:54,700
feel like a comfortable it's like I

309
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:57,219
didn't want to like you know speak out

310
00:11:54,700 --> 00:12:01,510
it's like I did they weren't empowered

311
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:03,700
they knew something was wrong but they

312
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:05,069
weren't empowered to say something about

313
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:10,780
it

314
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:12,310
December 7th 1941 Pearl Harbor one of

315
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,890
the first places that had a radar

316
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:17,709
station in the world

317
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:18,970
the world was at war not the US but you

318
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:20,800
know the rest of the world you know

319
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:24,730
there's other places around okay good so

320
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:27,640
that place was at war and you know what

321
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:30,600
happened a guy manning the radar station

322
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:34,689
saw planes coming from an unknown vector

323
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:37,000
he's like dude where these planes coming

324
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:39,490
from there happens to be here talks to

325
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,110
the supervisors to hey there's the

326
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,570
planes it's like they're not supposed to

327
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:45,370
be coming from this direction

328
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:48,730
supervisors immediate response yeah

329
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:52,000
probably our training planes that should

330
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:56,290
be fine spoiler alert it was not fine

331
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,139
it's like but that's what happens we

332
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,449
don't and

333
00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:01,249
our employees to think it's like we need

334
00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:04,508
to speak up we need to do something we

335
00:13:01,249 --> 00:13:06,350
need to actually say this is not right

336
00:13:04,509 --> 00:13:09,109
we need to make sure that they're

337
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,799
empowered to do that kind of stuff it's

338
00:13:09,109 --> 00:13:11,899
like you need to make sure your

339
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:14,179
employees are powered and educated I've

340
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:16,489
robbed so many places and it's like I'm

341
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:18,259
come across to people and I'm like oh

342
00:13:16,489 --> 00:13:20,029
you're gonna catch me look how sketch

343
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:21,859
the AFI look right now it's like you're

344
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:24,619
definitely and they walk by and I'm like

345
00:13:21,859 --> 00:13:27,649
really really that's that's your

346
00:13:24,619 --> 00:13:30,679
response it's like I mean it's like I'm

347
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:32,449
rooting for them to catch me I robbed

348
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:34,488
robbed a bank in Amman Jordan where it's

349
00:13:32,449 --> 00:13:36,108
like the lady I really compromised five

350
00:13:34,489 --> 00:13:41,509
machines why she was telling me not to

351
00:13:36,109 --> 00:13:44,449
do it and I was agreeing with her and I

352
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:46,009
still did it because she wasn't it power

353
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,479
she to know who to contact she didn't

354
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:49,519
know what to do with that kind of

355
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,829
situation we need to get our employees

356
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,540
better trained and not just better

357
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:55,819
trained but better empowered to be able

358
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,329
to make decisions to say I need to call

359
00:13:55,819 --> 00:13:57,919
someone

360
00:13:56,329 --> 00:13:59,628
do they have an extension number they

361
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:01,489
know who to call do they have an email

362
00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:02,600
they know who to forward that to you

363
00:14:01,489 --> 00:14:04,819
need to make sure your employees have

364
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,350
that information they're your best line

365
00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:08,988
of the Finch you're they're your biggest

366
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:12,439
asset and security and we just keep

367
00:14:08,989 --> 00:14:14,899
looking out on the liability we fail one

368
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:18,019
of the things I hate not to see I don't

369
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:19,009
worry it's like but the well I tell

370
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:20,600
people's I don't know if this is the

371
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:26,150
lobby to see is this Lobby the CIA

372
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:29,150
headquarters okay there's the Fed now

373
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:30,650
so I tell people the only way I'm going

374
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,910
into the CIA headquarters let's be

375
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:34,220
honest is with the bag over my head

376
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,300
going through the back door okay so it's

377
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,640
like so I don't see I don't see myself

378
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,819
going there any time soon to verified

379
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:43,520
this is the picture but I hate lobbies

380
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:46,310
that are highly monitored and are not

381
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:48,980
made to loiter in because I'm a loiterer

382
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:50,300
I like the loiter not litter that's

383
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:53,570
horrible don't do that stuff that's bad

384
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:55,339
okay but I love Deloitte er it's like

385
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:57,710
I'll just hang around see where the

386
00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:59,830
traffic patterns are so with the guards

387
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:03,200
you're doing so the cameras are

388
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:04,820
Starbucks and in lobbies yes please it's

389
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,410
like you know I mean I'm not drinking

390
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,120
the cafe look of marketing whatever

391
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:09,410
those things are called but it's I got

392
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,029
some hot chocolate and just you know

393
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,800
with my Wi-Fi pineapple running and

394
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:16,279
seeing what I can grab it's like that's

395
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,569
all so I I really hate lobbies that are

396
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:19,520
very well monitored and that reminds me

397
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:21,260
of another story which is what also

398
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,819
probably put me on the list and put a

399
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,339
bag over my head but I was in Moscow

400
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:28,670
last year it's like I was going to a

401
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:30,260
conference there as one does and some

402
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:32,209
friends of mine that were there say hey

403
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:34,790
it's like while you're in town why don't

404
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:36,949
you go and head over to the Kaspersky

405
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:38,329
office and say hello it's like well I'm

406
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:40,040
actually friends with Eugene Kaspersky

407
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,300
it's like he's a cool guy I met him in

408
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,370
Germany once it's like which is the

409
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:46,310
reason why I'm on another list and I

410
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,990
said sure so I decided to go hang out to

411
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,310
the office so I walked up to I had to

412
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,540
take the subway and it's like because I

413
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:53,000
like going the subway Caesar and the

414
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:55,699
Moscow subway is amazingly beautiful

415
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,320
it's like a freaking museum they have

416
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,779
changed leaders they have frescoes they

417
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,250
have tile works I each station I spent

418
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:03,830
in one day just going through their

419
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:07,370
subway without even leaving the outside

420
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:08,870
of that subway station so I went there

421
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:10,970
that had to do with the story I've just

422
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:14,420
just I did that but it's like so I went

423
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:16,970
I went to the lobby and their Lobby was

424
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:21,319
well open it's like there was like some

425
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:22,400
guard over here by their employee

426
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,770
entrance and then there was another

427
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,939
guard on the other side by the

428
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:28,010
receptionist desk and there was this

429
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:31,339
nice leather couch and this really

430
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:32,750
unusual stealth long-legged elephant

431
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:35,150
statue that was really cool-looking

432
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,460
it's like and so I was like I went there

433
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:39,550
it's like so and

434
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:41,080
not trying to rob Kaspersky okay I'm not

435
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:43,750
trying to like figure out how I'm going

436
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,770
to break in well I am trying to figure

437
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,990
out how I break it but that's not

438
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,430
because I was going to break in it's

439
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:50,050
just how my brain works it's like

440
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:52,209
whenever I go someplace new I'm like

441
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:55,209
this is a really nice place how would I

442
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:56,740
rob them you know this is one of those

443
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:58,660
things I do come on we all have that

444
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:01,300
right that's like just being okay weird

445
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:03,160
okay so so I go and do that so it's like

446
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,530
I go and I'm like looking around and

447
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,800
it's like I'm just so I'm gonna go sit

448
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,359
down

449
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,399
it's wrecked you see what the pattern is

450
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,199
wait cuz my I was like you know 15-20

451
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,970
minutes early so I don't know I just

452
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,620
look them up watch their butts like butt

453
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:19,120
so I wouldn't did that wouldn't sat down

454
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:21,540
before my butt touched leather one of

455
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,540

480
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:20,770
Lobby shouldn't be there for more than

481
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,480
five minutes they should not be there

482
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:23,710
it's not supposed to be a comfortable

483
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,850
place it's supposed to be a meeting

484
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:27,610
place it's supposed to be a place for

485
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:30,580
you to get and verify it's like it's a

486
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:33,850
point of ingress or egress not a place

487
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:35,800
to be comfortable it should not be a

488
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:39,100
place for people to be able to hang out

489
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:41,409
in because if you do that you create

490
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,929
that public space then you have people

491
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:45,110
like me that are going

492
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:47,760
be in there doing the various things

493
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:49,620
it's like so you have to watch that make

494
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:53,490
sure you have a web money and make sure

495
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:56,459
your security is educated on what to

496
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:58,110
look for so many times it's like I've

497
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:01,380
gone into buildings it's like in

498
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:03,270
security they don't have a clue they're

499
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,980
not interested in figuring out who's

500
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:06,840
loitering wasn't I mean if you look like

501
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,900
if you looks like you're supposed to

502
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,250
believe be there it's like they're

503
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,250
really not gonna be too much of a hard

504
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:15,660
time it's like I hardly ever look like

505
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,550
I'm supposed to be where I'm at it's

506
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,440
like and they still really don't give me

507
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:21,120
that much of a hard time because

508
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,530
actually you need to understand that you

509
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,110
need to make sure that your security

510
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:27,600
knows that there's someone is in their

511
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:30,209
Lobby for more than five minutes that

512
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,219
should call suspicion they should call

513
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:34,170
someone they should go and talk to the

514
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,760
person and see what they're doing and

515
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,650
what they need and what assistance they

516
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,950
are but we're not because it's building

517
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:42,120
security it's not really our concern

518
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:44,370
guess what it is

519
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,080
you need to let your building security

520
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:50,879
know that even if it's a different

521
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,419
company now there's no TSA employees in

522
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,070
here are there

523
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,770
I'm joking this is a security conference

524
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:57,689
there's no TSA in here it's like but one

525
00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:01,740
of the one of the things that I really

526
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:03,780
really love okay is no egress filtering

527
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,450
or internal monitoring inside your city

528
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,860
inside your company it's like what TSA

529
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:11,310
it's inside the city security here at

530
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:14,100
its finest but still this is one of the

531
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:15,720
problems that we have besides the TSA

532
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:18,810
not the picture but one of the problems

533
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:21,060
we have is no egress filtering how many

534
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:24,149
people make sure that their network is

535
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:26,730
blocked off and firewalled and secured

536
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:31,740
from the outside Internet there that's

537
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:35,400
bad how many people are watching what

538
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:38,700
goes out of your company onto the

539
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,950
network I mean I'm sorry I'm not trying

540
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:44,390
to I'm not you know try not I'm not

541
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:47,970
trying to kick anybody whether down Sony

542
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:51,720
seriously they lost one point eight

543
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:56,010
terabytes of data out of their network

544
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:58,260
and no one disputed that come on guys

545
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:59,520
one point eight networking should've at

546
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,350
least called Satan do you need me

547
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,680
increase the bandwidth some want you to

548
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:06,330
notice something someone should have

549
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,220
said something we knows that you're

550
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:11,270
transferring over a terabyte of data to

551
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:15,030
Paraguay can I help you with that

552
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:19,260
something should have been said but no

553
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:22,800
one did I have a payload on my vast

554
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:26,580
bunny it is very simple opens up the

555
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:28,310
command prompt telnet to tau dot blinky

556
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:31,260
lights dot NL

557
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:32,429
it's an amazing payload could remember I

558
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:35,010
can do it security awareness I'm not

559
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:37,020
trying to upon you so that payload what

560
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:39,840
it opens up is that command prompt it

561
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,980
opens up ASCII Star Wars you should

562
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,870
really try it out it's really cool it's

563
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:45,660
it just runs ASCII Star Wars and your

564
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:49,199
command browser my important question is

565
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:53,250
why is Bob and accounting able to tell

566
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,420
that to the Netherlands no offense TV

567
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:58,860
Bob's are accounting people but

568
00:21:54,420 --> 00:22:02,010
seriously why are they able to open up

569
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:05,250
that port and communicate out and no one

570
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:07,980
say anything no one no this is that

571
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:09,900
that's an issue they should - what team

572
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,190
we may not swatching this little

573
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,770
overkill but it's like you know there

574
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:16,140
should have been somebody that would

575
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:19,800
have gone and said hey it's like what do

576
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:22,830
you do it do someone should have noticed

577
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,930
that it's like I mean that's what we

578
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:27,240
need we need them to respond and look at

579
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:28,500
things it's like I have never seen a

580
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,690
company where it's like they had

581
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,460
role-based like that it's like dave was

582
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:33,870
very lucky or unlucky it's like good but

583
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:36,120
it was like it was a good example of

584
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:37,669
catching those people that actually had

585
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,139
put their people in different groups

586
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:42,600
because Bob accounting should not be

587
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,520
able to tell that it's like so you have

588
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,610
to monitor those things don't just

589
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:50,250
monitor what's coming at you monitor

590
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:51,840
what's leaving your network how many of

591
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,600
those attacks when it's doing the

592
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,939
payload

593
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:59,709
and then it's trying to commit call back

594
00:22:54,940 --> 00:23:02,380
out could be detected could be seen the

595
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:05,230
sketchy if you're monitoring those kind

596
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:07,779
of outbound connections and it could

597
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:08,769
stop the attacker before they even got

598
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:11,250
download their command-and-control

599
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:15,130
before they download their actual

600
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:16,960
malicious files start looking for those

601
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:19,000
things make sure you have and it's

602
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,130
very--it's firewall rules it's sending

603
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,230
up monitoring it's setting up every

604
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:26,259
firewall rules should go back to a

605
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:30,370
policy and the very last rule should be

606
00:23:26,259 --> 00:23:32,889
what any-anything did not yeah deny all

607
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:34,959
exactly it's like so everything should

608
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:38,168
be cataloged you should have something

609
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,809
that blocks just willy-nilly outbound

610
00:23:38,169 --> 00:23:43,299
traffic I just said willy-nilly in the

611
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:45,519
conference that's also I have used that

612
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:50,559
in one while one of the things that I

613
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:54,100
hate dual factor mother enterprise-wide

614
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:55,629
authorization I hate that nothing ruins

615
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,399
my day more than someone actually

616
00:23:55,629 --> 00:24:03,309
decided to actually implement this

617
00:23:57,399 --> 00:24:07,000
properly properly okay how many banks

618
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:08,379
have gone to that I have seen the upper

619
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,940
executives because I've gotten into

620
00:24:08,379 --> 00:24:12,129
their offices because of course I've

621
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:14,950
gotten into their offices it's like with

622
00:24:12,129 --> 00:24:17,649
their token you know because you know

623
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:18,970
the executives they're very big banks

624
00:24:17,649 --> 00:24:21,850
are very big about multi-factor

625
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:23,259
authentication to do a wire transfer for

626
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:27,009
a hundred thousand or a million dollars

627
00:24:23,259 --> 00:24:29,110
you need a USB hard ware token to do

628
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:34,960
that transfer guess where that token

629
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:38,678
usually is in the laptop no it's in the

630
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:41,470
laptop and if it's not there don't worry

631
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:43,600
top-drawer a my job I go through a lot

632
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:46,269
of drawers in this industry okay it's

633
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,699
like and it's always trust me that token

634
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:51,539
if it is not in the laptop it's going to

635
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:53,440
be in the drawer it's like that's not

636
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:57,100
multi-factor authentication

637
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,720
that's PCI compliance it's like you know

638
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,189
and everybody's PCI compliant ill

639
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,080
they're not right it's like you know

640
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:04,750
that's just something you say

641
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:07,418
make people feel better it's like don't

642
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:08,260
get me started on that so so that's one

643
00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:11,529
of the things you have to worry about

644
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:14,080
also I also love dual factor out there

645
00:25:11,529 --> 00:25:16,980
authentication or segmentation of

646
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:20,289
networks in the doors in the buildings

647
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:23,019
it's like I really love it when a client

648
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:27,390
is actually putting RFID badges and

649
00:25:23,019 --> 00:25:32,289
keypads because that messes me them up

650
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:35,980
you know that's like oh it's like

651
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:38,529
because I could clone an RFID badge but

652
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:41,529
it's harder to get that pin code it's

653
00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:43,899
like so it's like that slows me down and

654
00:25:41,529 --> 00:25:45,820
the whole thing is the defenses are not

655
00:25:43,899 --> 00:25:48,969
just about deterrence it's not just

656
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:51,460
about detection it is about slowing the

657
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:54,700
attacker down so it becomes more obvious

658
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:56,409
for them to be detected it's like that's

659
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:59,679
one of the things that we want to do and

660
00:25:56,409 --> 00:26:01,950
that is a very big slowdown factor it's

661
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:05,139
like having that kind of segmentation

662
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:08,769
one of the things I love is not

663
00:26:05,139 --> 00:26:10,240
following established procedures because

664
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:12,580
that's what people always refer back to

665
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,320
right what we had in our policy that

666
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,580
they shouldn't have done it but we have

667
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,809
it in this they shouldn't have done it

668
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:20,168
well that's just great

669
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:21,340
did they do it yeah they did it but it

670
00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:21,730
was in our policy that they shouldn't

671
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,428
have done it

672
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:27,789
yeah that helps right this is a great

673
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:29,950
example sorry Air Force to civilians

674
00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:31,809
somehow breached an Air Force Base and

675
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:34,409
were found only when one of them told

676
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:37,840
the air that she had been kidnapped

677
00:26:34,409 --> 00:26:40,720
legit people actually all go in

678
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,129
hysterics about running into area 51 you

679
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,110
could have drove it in there with a

680
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:48,669
captain and no one would have stopped

681
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:50,889
you so I screw this whole Narada running

682
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:55,389
thing it's like you just drive up with a

683
00:26:50,889 --> 00:26:59,830
kidnap victim the guy literally drove a

684
00:26:55,389 --> 00:27:02,439
bunch of the base the guard I don't know

685
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:03,850
what they were doing but the obviously

686
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,590
weren't looking at the guy driving the

687
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:09,969
Civic a Honda Civic and the woman going

688
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:12,860
like and the passenger seat so I seen

689
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:14,690
self rescued ourselves she managed a

690
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:16,189
and I get up to the guardsmen they find

691
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:17,870
one the guardsmen well this guy was

692
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:21,169
trying to figure out how to get out of

693
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:22,879
the Air Force Base I could just imagine

694
00:27:21,169 --> 00:27:24,620
that conversations like help me I've

695
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,960
been kidnapped to the gardens right look

696
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:28,219
first of all how did you get here

697
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,440
it took are you authorized to be on this

698
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:33,710
base does it look like I'm authorized to

699
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:37,159
be on this base and that's not the first

700
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:40,120
occurrence oh my gosh another great one

701
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:43,820
is during the height of the Cold War a

702
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:47,959
Soviet spy walked into an Air Force Base

703
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:51,980
in Germany he would he drove okay the

704
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:56,090
being we walked up to the plane a jet

705
00:27:51,980 --> 00:28:00,980
fighter he detached a missile from the

706
00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:02,389
wing he put it in a wheelbarrow and I

707
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,620
don't know if he stole the Wilbur but I

708
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,908
really hope he did cuz it makes it even

709
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:06,320
cooler than just like bringing his own

710
00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:08,360
wheelbarrow because it's like ii you

711
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,860
know i mean that was show that he was

712
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,658
prepared i mean the guy knew what he was

713
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:13,340
doing but it's like i hope he just stole

714
00:28:11,659 --> 00:28:16,610
the wilbur why he was there it's like

715
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:18,649
put the missile in a wheel barrow welded

716
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:21,559
to his car was a mercedes-benz I mean

717
00:28:18,649 --> 00:28:24,408
Germany it's like put it in his bins put

718
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:28,010
it in the backseat the missile stuck out

719
00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:30,019
the back window so he put a red flag on

720
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:32,720
it cuz German laws are German laws you

721
00:28:30,019 --> 00:28:37,279
don't eff with us okay it's like put the

722
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:40,610
red flag on the missile tip drove it

723
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:43,159
back to his apartment disassembled it

724
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:46,490
and piece by piece meld it back to the

725
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:48,080
motherland I mean it was German postal

726
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:51,620
service it was very efficient all pieces

727
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:53,418
getting made it back it's like can we

728
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:56,899
all agree maybe some policies weren't

729
00:28:53,419 --> 00:29:00,500
followed on that one maybe sometimes you

730
00:28:56,899 --> 00:29:03,768
feel like your security is so tight that

731
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:05,779
that's the problem it's like you're

732
00:29:03,769 --> 00:29:07,639
asking yourselves like hey who's even

733
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:10,669
tried to go into this who would even try

734
00:29:07,639 --> 00:29:13,279
to come into our art facility it's like

735
00:29:10,669 --> 00:29:15,740
some guy with the wheelbarrow maybe it's

736
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:17,929
like that might be a problem you need to

737
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:19,250
figure those things out you need to be

738
00:29:17,929 --> 00:29:20,539
able to make sure that you're putting

739
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:23,020
those things into account people are

740
00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:25,040
actually taking the security seriously

741
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:27,510
now

742
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:31,399
the other thing is to watch the point of

743
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:34,620
this the point of those funny stories

744
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,610
was honestly to get you to be here it's

745
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,320
like it's like ice trying to entertain

746
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:38,790
you it's like you're like all in here

747
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,620
make sure it's like you know everybody's

748
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:42,960
gonna be here so we start asking some

749
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:44,310
serious questions it's I want you to

750
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,070
start asking these questions when you

751
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:48,659
get back it's like to your company to

752
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:51,389
your enterprise and so I want you to

753
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:52,830
start asking some questions about to

754
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,990
your executives or to your regular

755
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:56,699
security team things you can do to make

756
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:59,400
security better in your environment

757
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:01,590
right now one of the questions that you

758
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:04,740
have to ask is inside of threats which

759
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:06,360
one fits the bill it's like you got

760
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:08,820
Robert Hansen over here it's like you

761
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,530
know an FBI favorite or you know four

762
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:13,740
bad guys I guess but still you got

763
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:16,800
that's a malicious actor right that was

764
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:18,150
a malicious guy he was the bad guy he

765
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,070
was trying to do bad things they were

766
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:22,520
ready for those guys right they know how

767
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:24,720
their protocols from malicious guys

768
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:27,389
because you're always worried about we

769
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:31,410
always assume an insider threat is

770
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:32,910
malicious but really because sometimes

771
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:35,360
the insider threat can just be stupid

772
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:39,390
once again thank you TSA for an example

773
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:41,399
this is right here a TSA apartment

774
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:43,860
homeland security guy thinking it was

775
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:46,230
totally legit to put inside the

776
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:50,010
Washington Post the picture

777
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:54,000
close up of all the keys for the TSA

778
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:57,120
locks and yes spoiler alert you can now

779
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,430
download all of those keys and 3d print

780
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:02,189
them yourself and have a set of keys for

781
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:04,290
the TSA locks the same government I

782
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:07,530
remind you that wants to have keys

783
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:10,080
digital keys to your mobile devices yeah

784
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:11,910
I trust him with those it's like because

785
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:16,080
when told and questioned about this

786
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:17,670
Homeland Security was like it's okay

787
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,199
it's like I mean it's not whatever they

788
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:20,670
have security protocol it's like you

789
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,170
know we're just it was more convenient

790
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:25,320
staying and say yeah we shouldn't have

791
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:27,930
done it but you know oops our bad no

792
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:32,189
problem it's like and they're never

793
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:33,720
going to fix that so enjoy your next

794
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:35,560
trip it's like with your check luggage

795
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:40,180
and then

796
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:42,490
but that was not malicious that person

797
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:45,580
wasn't trying to be malicious that

798
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:49,180
person made a mistake did engagement

799
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:52,419
once where I got in before I got into

800
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:56,050
the building because someone had put in

801
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:57,610
a Linksys router and why did I know it

802
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:59,770
was the Linksys router I'm glad you

803
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:06,790
asked the question it's like it said

804
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:08,290
Linksys on it unencrypted wide open well

805
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:10,149
me being me

806
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:11,350
it's like eventually I'm gonna be in

807
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:13,270
this meeting and get permission to do

808
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:15,580
all this I start looking at it in the

809
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:20,590
parking lot and like lo and behold it's

810
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:23,110
their internal network I'm like well the

811
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:26,679
bad news is I can't get Netflix the good

812
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:28,780
news is I've got their dns maybe it's

813
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:32,440
like I've got everything else so that's

814
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:36,670
ok it's like you know what happened was

815
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:39,750
it the malicious insider no an executive

816
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:42,400
wanted to be more productive an

817
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:45,430
executive was part of having to go into

818
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:47,110
the conference room with his laptop and

819
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:50,170
not being able to connect to the

820
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:53,260
corporate network and check his email

821
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:55,360
and respond quickly enough because he

822
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:58,240
was wasting so many hours inside the

823
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:00,070
meeting rooms that he decided I'm going

824
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,480
to be a productive and helpful employee

825
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:03,429
an Employee of the Year

826
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,710
I'll put in this router connect the

827
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:08,850
network to the interpet internet jack as

828
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:12,970
I get now I'll be able to get my email

829
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:14,379
he was very productive so was everybody

830
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:17,200
else who decided to drive by you know

831
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:19,630
take a copy of all their databases it's

832
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,760
like so that's a problem he was not a

833
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:24,100
malicious insider stopped just looking

834
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,320
for malicious insiders sometimes the

835
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:29,290
insider threat you're gonna face is just

836
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:31,510
someone eager to help someone who's just

837
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:33,670
doing the wrong thing someone who just

838
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:38,440
makes a mistake they can be your insider

839
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:40,840
threat as well oh and it hits keep

840
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:43,650
coming sorry feds it's like here's

841
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:47,250
another one it's like this was by a

842
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:52,559
contractor hired by the border control

843
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:56,400
they said that the contractor downloaded

844
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:59,270
against policy procedures over 300 gigs

845
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:02,490
of photos and data from the border

846
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:05,639
checkpoints onto their contractor

847
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:07,289
network which was then popped this is my

848
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,270
surprised face by the way in case you're

849
00:34:07,289 --> 00:34:11,009
wondering it's like that was popped and

850
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:14,219
then downloaded by an attacker a

851
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:16,169
criminal and then but one of the other

852
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:17,609
things you have to understand and one of

853
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:19,830
the things that get us is the most is

854
00:34:17,609 --> 00:34:24,359
also how does your incident response

855
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:28,710
handle it because Homeland Security make

856
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:31,139
their incident response worse first

857
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:33,168
thing that happened bad was it becoming

858
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:37,129
public that they got popped like that

859
00:34:33,168 --> 00:34:40,830
the second thing that made it even worse

860
00:34:37,129 --> 00:34:42,960
was how they responded to it they went

861
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:45,359
out to the public and said don't worry

862
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:49,050
citizens it's like this was the

863
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:51,119
infraction we've contained it we scoured

864
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:54,179
the dark web that's how I supposed to

865
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:58,200
say it the dark web it's like and we did

866
00:34:54,179 --> 00:35:02,790
not find any traces of those photos or

867
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:04,500
that data out there you're safe we're

868
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:07,950
the government it's like we're here to

869
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:10,140
help so yeah so that was great for a

870
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:13,680
whole three or four hours until Joseph

871
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:16,650
Cox it's like who did a reporter who

872
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:19,020
wouldn't he know what he did he searched

873
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:21,270
the dark web must have been a different

874
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,470
dark web you know dark web adjacent to

875
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:25,740
the dark web that they wouldn't searched

876
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:28,470
okay well I know is that he searched the

877
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:30,959
dark web and he was able to come up with

878
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:33,359
30 minutes all 300 gigs of those photos

879
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,240
and those pictures and that data giving

880
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:41,670
out for free to ever want to download

881
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:44,609
them now how willing am I going to

882
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:46,230
believe border control or how my

883
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:48,180
security when they come up with the next

884
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:52,170
incident and say they've got it handled

885
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:54,930
and they've got it taken care of when

886
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:57,150
you get popped it's important to sit and

887
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:57,770
trust me come on let's face it we're all

888
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:02,660
getting

889
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:06,460
at some point how you respond to it how

890
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:09,140
early you detected are the key factors

891
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:10,700
so how do you respond to the public how

892
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:13,879
do you assure them it's by your

893
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:16,640
discretion but also by your transparency

894
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:20,000
and admitting and acknowledging what

895
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:23,270
occurred that's important too that keeps

896
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,250
trust that keeps clients happy so it's

897
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:26,780
like well I mean we're still the clients

898
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:28,280
here but you know we're just system so

899
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:31,220
whatever but still that's one of the

900
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:33,920
things you have to worry about now also

901
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:39,709
another one it's like who do you ask for

902
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:41,510
identification in your building you're

903
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:45,890
right very good very good response

904
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:49,460
everyone everyone everyone of these

905
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:52,759
people you ask for ID it's like I was at

906
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:54,320
a conference and Ben Tenn trusted tech

907
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,390
it's like he's given me a lot of good

908
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,260
actual feedback and stuff you know I'm

909
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:59,810
talking about security awareness

910
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:01,790
engagements and how he does gamification

911
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:03,710
and how what he's come across on his

912
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:06,320
clients and one of the things he's

913
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:09,350
brought up was that one of his clients

914
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:13,280
they have a game that they play inside

915
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:18,140
the company and every quarter someone

916
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:20,660
different has their badge altered the

917
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:25,819
only thing altered on it is instead of

918
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:29,020
the employees face it's waldo so the

919
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:32,780
whole company plays Where's Waldo and

920
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:37,220
the first person to detect and see who's

921
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:40,160
got the Waldo badge wins a prize like

922
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:43,930
you know $5 Starbucks card or something

923
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:46,700
did they win the price I imagine that

924
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:49,640
it's like how is that in created because

925
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:51,939
now all people are paying attention to

926
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:54,379
who's got an actual employee badge

927
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:57,080
people are paying attention who's

928
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:59,900
supposed to be in their area do they are

929
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:01,220
they familiar you know they still don't

930
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:03,140
care about your security exploit or

931
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,089
alert okay but now there's something in

932
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:06,620
it for them

933
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:09,470
now there's something for them to be

934
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:11,558
attentive and be security aware that's

935
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:13,180
how you do it it's like you

936
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:18,009
give that gamification you make it

937
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:20,680
interesting for them what does your

938
00:38:18,009 --> 00:38:24,819
social media profile really say about

939
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:27,279
you you're not allowed to go and say hey

940
00:38:24,819 --> 00:38:29,140
you can't have this on your your deck

941
00:38:27,279 --> 00:38:31,180
it's like on your social media it's like

942
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:33,969
a lot of companies I'm not trying to get

943
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:35,979
to that point okay cuz trust me I got

944
00:38:33,969 --> 00:38:37,239
some really sketchy stuff for my Twitter

945
00:38:35,979 --> 00:38:40,448
feed and stuff you know every once in a

946
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:41,979
while on Facebook my worst one when I

947
00:38:40,449 --> 00:38:44,319
was working for the bank that used to

948
00:38:41,979 --> 00:38:46,479
work for a bank and the CIO came to me

949
00:38:44,319 --> 00:38:48,880
after DEFCON and there was a little

950
00:38:46,479 --> 00:38:50,410
problem with it because it turns out

951
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,150
that one year was like three or four

952
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:54,129
years ago Dave Kennedy tried to steal

953
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:55,869
the awkward hug movement okay that

954
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:58,089
Malheur I always tell people I give

955
00:38:55,869 --> 00:39:00,249
credit where credit soon Dave started to

956
00:38:58,089 --> 00:39:01,900
hug move and I just made it awkward it's

957
00:39:00,249 --> 00:39:04,749
like but he's trying to turn to the

958
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:08,170
awkward hug thing and our big victim of

959
00:39:04,749 --> 00:39:09,879
choice was pasta Dorian so it's like

960
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:11,199
he's turned off with one awkward hug and

961
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,180
then it's like with Paul's and I had to

962
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:15,009
give another awkward hug with Paul and

963
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:16,739
all of a sudden this mother had to up

964
00:39:15,009 --> 00:39:19,029
the game with doing a topless photo

965
00:39:16,739 --> 00:39:22,029
between him and Paul both being topless

966
00:39:19,029 --> 00:39:24,729
getting awkward hugs and I'm like you

967
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:28,539
know being me I'm like challenge accept

968
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:30,368
it okay so the very next Def Con it's

969
00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:31,989
like there is a picture now on the

970
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:34,689
internet it's still there it's like I'm

971
00:39:31,989 --> 00:39:37,150
sorry it's like but we moved the banner

972
00:39:34,689 --> 00:39:39,729
down this is hack naked ironically

973
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:42,160
enough this way over our midsections

974
00:39:39,729 --> 00:39:43,479
I took my pants off in the middle of Def

975
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,029
Con in the vendor area

976
00:39:43,479 --> 00:39:47,678
it's like Paul thinking ahead he was

977
00:39:46,029 --> 00:39:50,140
already wearing shorts and then we took

978
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:52,719
our shirts off and then we proceeded to

979
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:57,729
give a very nice warm awkward hug and

980
00:39:52,719 --> 00:40:01,439
brace behind the banner the Tuesday I

981
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:05,618
get back to work first thing you see is

982
00:40:01,439 --> 00:40:07,749
on you know I don't really say much

983
00:40:05,619 --> 00:40:10,329
about your your profiles or anything but

984
00:40:07,749 --> 00:40:14,229
it's like you got a picture that you

985
00:40:10,329 --> 00:40:17,650
took from Def Con is it really why I

986
00:40:14,229 --> 00:40:19,029
mean I'm in Oklahoma okay this is

987
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:23,859
causing issues for a lot of people I'm

988
00:40:19,029 --> 00:40:25,689
sure it's like and they're like didn't

989
00:40:23,859 --> 00:40:26,769
rates the right kind of message or

990
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:28,390
something are you trying to like you

991
00:40:26,769 --> 00:40:31,019
know that is that presenting in your

992
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:34,900
best possible like and like look dude

993
00:40:31,019 --> 00:40:36,339
seriously it's like I tweet what I want

994
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,349
to tweet it's like I don't put where I

995
00:40:36,339 --> 00:40:39,969
work and stuff ever in my Twitter

996
00:40:38,349 --> 00:40:41,349
profile and stuff you know and I've got

997
00:40:39,969 --> 00:40:43,209
more followers than this Bing dust I

998
00:40:41,349 --> 00:40:43,660
don't really care it's like sorry not

999
00:40:43,209 --> 00:40:45,879
sorry

1000
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:47,229
that's just the way it goes it's like

1001
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,150
any couldn't say anything about that

1002
00:40:47,229 --> 00:40:50,709
because that is it's like that sometimes

1003
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:53,259
the way it is you don't want to get to

1004
00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:55,359
the point where you start scheduling or

1005
00:40:53,259 --> 00:40:58,359
you start talking to your employees than

1006
00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:03,098
what they can or can't do but you do

1007
00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:06,670
educate them on the ramifications about

1008
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:08,859
it it's like I had one I was robbing

1009
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:11,469
this one Bank it's like the ones that

1010
00:41:08,859 --> 00:41:14,109
business managers from the bank on her

1011
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:16,929
facebook profile had it totally

1012
00:41:14,109 --> 00:41:19,569
misconfigured with the public settings

1013
00:41:16,929 --> 00:41:23,140
and I was able to see her cell phone and

1014
00:41:19,569 --> 00:41:24,400
her home address and trust me we weren't

1015
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,719
friends and trust me after the

1016
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,459
presentation I gave on this and said

1017
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:29,289
we're never going to be friends but it's

1018
00:41:27,459 --> 00:41:31,868
like that information was there

1019
00:41:29,289 --> 00:41:35,410
the very next picture in the slide was a

1020
00:41:31,869 --> 00:41:36,939
picture of her house guys remember the

1021
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,499
kitten it's okay I got it from Google

1022
00:41:36,939 --> 00:41:40,719
Streetview gosh y'all give me some

1023
00:41:38,499 --> 00:41:41,709
creepy vibes no it's like I took it from

1024
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:44,559
Google Streetview

1025
00:41:41,709 --> 00:41:46,209
with a picture of her house we have to

1026
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:49,329
make sure that we're educating employees

1027
00:41:46,209 --> 00:41:51,308
that yes you can post what you want but

1028
00:41:49,329 --> 00:41:53,529
sometimes a criminal or an attacker is

1029
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:55,900
going to go after you because of the

1030
00:41:53,529 --> 00:41:57,729
information that you give you have to

1031
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:00,160
let them be aware of that so they can

1032
00:41:57,729 --> 00:42:03,279
start seeing that show them how to log

1033
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:06,428
out of their accounts and then look on

1034
00:42:03,279 --> 00:42:08,979
the web anonymously at their profiles

1035
00:42:06,429 --> 00:42:10,809
and see what they can see to see if that

1036
00:42:08,979 --> 00:42:14,140
information could be used against them

1037
00:42:10,809 --> 00:42:15,699
personally or against the company it's

1038
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:17,049
like you have to educate them on that

1039
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:19,119
it's not they're not doing it

1040
00:42:17,049 --> 00:42:21,719
maliciously they may be doing it because

1041
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:23,680
they just don't understand

1042
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:25,029
phishing

1043
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,589
it's one of the leading cause of

1044
00:42:25,029 --> 00:42:30,760
compromise but your employees really

1045
00:42:26,589 --> 00:42:34,349
take it seriously target lost over 300

1046
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:42,970
million dollars and the kicker to it is

1047
00:42:34,349 --> 00:42:48,250
what it was one email one click from one

1048
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:51,848
employee from their HVAC company it

1049
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:54,010
wasn't even a target employee it was

1050
00:42:51,849 --> 00:42:57,190
their HVAC company who've led to the

1051
00:42:54,010 --> 00:43:00,430
compromise you need to let your

1052
00:42:57,190 --> 00:43:02,170
employees know being suspicious how to

1053
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:04,089
be suspicious on these emails how to

1054
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:06,369
take those things seriously how to

1055
00:43:04,089 --> 00:43:08,288
action look and verify when the

1056
00:43:06,369 --> 00:43:10,289
suspicious email comes in because

1057
00:43:08,289 --> 00:43:13,690
sometimes there are sophisticated

1058
00:43:10,289 --> 00:43:19,029
sometimes they are specialized its I am

1059
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:20,950
makes made to be more believable also do

1060
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:22,390
you really see I do you bet your

1061
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:24,339
security systems to make sure that they

1062
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:26,020
are operating is attended I love this

1063
00:43:24,339 --> 00:43:27,038
one from the NSA I had to put one into

1064
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,839
the NSA so that way I could like you

1065
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:29,650
know piss off all the agencies and stuff

1066
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:30,849
you know I didn't want like you know

1067
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:33,099
looks like I was playing favorites or

1068
00:43:30,849 --> 00:43:35,260
anything so it's like so there's one

1069
00:43:33,099 --> 00:43:38,410
that said the newest they say improperly

1070
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:40,990
over collected called detail records for

1071
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:42,910
for a year or two have you ever noticed

1072
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:44,859
that just like the facebook penis thing

1073
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:46,839
never goes like oh we under collected

1074
00:43:44,859 --> 00:43:48,430
this year sorry our bad viewer knows

1075
00:43:46,839 --> 00:43:50,859
that Facebook has never gone and said oh

1076
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:52,390
I'm sorry guys it's like we accidentally

1077
00:43:50,859 --> 00:43:54,160
did a reset on your settings and made

1078
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:56,740
everything more private it's like that

1079
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,210
never happens right how many people are

1080
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:02,558
putting the IDs system into their

1081
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:05,589
network and just going snort installed

1082
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:09,240
default signatures in and running we're

1083
00:44:05,589 --> 00:44:13,210
good you're gonna have a bad day right

1084
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:16,629
you've got a fine tune but also how many

1085
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:19,930
people run malware on their internal

1086
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:23,470
network probably a lot more than you

1087
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:25,808
think but no but to test it how many

1088
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:28,689
people segment their own network segment

1089
00:44:25,809 --> 00:44:30,350
test area off that has the same

1090
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:33,380
endpoints the same

1091
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:37,759
network controls but it's more shut down

1092
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:40,880
and then runs executables runs malware

1093
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:43,580
tries to go and call back tries to

1094
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:47,030
actually test all those nice fancy

1095
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:48,730
blinky boxes that they bought and tested

1096
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:50,690
and verify that they actually work

1097
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:52,550
because I don't care how good your

1098
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:55,190
endpoint protection is if you didn't set

1099
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:59,330
it up properly and that malware is able

1100
00:44:55,190 --> 00:45:02,660
to get back out so test it every year if

1101
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:05,569
not every quarter test your internal

1102
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:08,899
network to make sure that all those cool

1103
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:10,910
devices that you bought it's like

1104
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:13,070
actually do what they're told because

1105
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:14,629
that sells engineer was a great guy took

1106
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:15,890
you out to dinner to get the lunch it

1107
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:17,900
was like really great and stuff you know

1108
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:19,460
the noob the blinky box now has blue

1109
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:21,800
lights instead of red so therefore it's

1110
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:23,570
genetics you know you know machine

1111
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,070
learning and AI and everything it's I

1112
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:28,280
can tell by the blue lights it's like so

1113
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:29,840
it's got all that going for you but

1114
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:34,130
check to make sure it's actually working

1115
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:38,420
like you're supposed to also give

1116
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:40,940
metrics constantly record numbers for

1117
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:43,730
your executives it's like so them

1118
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:45,950
actionable information that you have

1119
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:47,600
over the year so when you ask for that

1120
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:49,790
more money the next year so nothing

1121
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:52,430
happens in their network again you have

1122
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:55,610
something to back it up so make sure

1123
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:57,560
you're doing that and one of the things

1124
00:45:55,610 --> 00:46:01,370
I want to leave it on a confession this

1125
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:03,290
is my confession year it's like you

1126
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:08,839
should have noticed within the last

1127
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:10,940
decade that man that Jason talked he's

1128
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:13,490
almost saying the same thing is there my

1129
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:16,070
whole career is based on saying the same

1130
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:20,359
thing in different ways for you to pay

1131
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:23,360
attention to it start educating and

1132

1136
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,950
treat them like a liability because you

1137
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:38,480
treat them like you're just something

1138
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:41,210
that you need to protect the technology

1145
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:55,999
environment it's like and also you still

1146
00:46:54,739 --> 00:46:57,049

sponsor for this it's like no blinky

1149
00:46:59,539 --> 00:47:03,499
boxes are important but if you don't

1150
00:47:01,849 --> 00:47:06,019

acting responsibly for it and responding

1152
00:47:06,019 --> 00:47:11,209
