silence please I wore boots today just

22
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,280
in case I don't want to have to use them

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,100
but if I hear your cell phone we might

24
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:04,830
alright so we are gonna talk all about

25
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,950
this craziness that we call security and

26
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,179
what in the heck are we doing our next

27
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,700
speaker is gonna give you some great

28
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,460
perspectives on how we can do things

29
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:24,509
think about things a little differently

30
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:26,610
so with that everybody Jeff man this one

31

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,369
corresponding with them on social media

37
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:46,110
and old-fashioned things like email feel

38
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:49,170
free to reach out if you have questions

39
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:51,240
you want to seek guidance I try to

40
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,579
mentor as much as possible I'm an

41
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,380
old-timer I can't do much these days I

42
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,850
wondered who that was I thought that was

43
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:05,490
mine I thought it was a gift for me

44
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:06,850
nobody's noticing you is this mine she's

45
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:12,430
not paying attention

46
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:16,170
anyway a little bit about me just to

47
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:19,270
start off I've had a very long career

48
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,309
kicking around this may not work but

49
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:26,489
I'll try it anyway raise your hand if

50
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:26,489
you were born say after the year 1982

51
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:35,370
okay I've been doing this stuff longer

52
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:39,130
than you guys have been alive minute

53
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:41,769
when I talk in terms of hacker jobs I go

54
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:43,380
back to about 1982 I had a I had a

55
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:46,510
part-time job in college

56
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:49,239
helping a state agency try to help

57
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:51,160
people prevent defaulting on their

58
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:54,819
student loans so I'd I learned something

59
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:56,350
called loans skip-tracing and looking

60
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:58,238
back on it I realized that I was

61
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,190
learning social engineering skills but

62
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,080
you had certain parameters that you were

63
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,910
allowed to work with but you were

64
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,430
basically coming up with creative ways

65
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,680
of lying to people on the telephone to

66
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:12,130
try to get them to put the delinquent

67
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:15,670
person on the line so in terms of paying

68
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:17,590
jobs it's been since about 1984 was with

69
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,570
the government for 13 years I've been

70
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:22,000
out in the private sector for about 23

71
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:24,880
years currently I work for a company

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,980
called online business systems we're a

73
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:30,670
consulting practice we've been testing

74
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:32,649
we do manage security services we do

75
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:35,200
some other stuff the other side of the

76
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,150
house is digital transformation one of

77
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,320
my co-workers is here so close plug your

78
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:42,130
ears a minute I don't know what digital

79
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:44,980
transformation really means IT services

80
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,750
primarily and they let me have a t-shirt

81
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,970
that actually had the name of my talk on

82
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,470
it so I think that's kind of cool so

83
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,849
give my company hand they let me come

84
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:58,099
out here and do this kind of stuff

85
00:03:52,849 --> 00:04:00,108
thank you a quick confession even though

86
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:01,909
I've been in the business all this time

87
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:03,260
I really have always learned from other

88
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,879
people and that's one of the reasons why

89
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,920
I come out here and speak is because I'm

90
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,358
now trying to pay it forward and teach

91
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,659
some of the things that I've learned

92
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:13,750
over the years to the next generation or

93
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:17,839
peers or whatever you want to call it

94
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:19,820
I've been trying to work in a little bit

95
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,409
with mental health hackers not so much

96
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:26,360
in this talk but I've done other talks

97
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:28,910
where I basically try to infuse you no

98
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,830
matter how passionate you are in this

99
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:33,650
stuff that we do don't forget to have a

100
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:36,979
life take some time off if you were in

101
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:39,138
here earlier before my slides we're

102
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:40,940
projecting you might have seen a picture

103
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:43,340
of a fireplace and a rocking chair

104
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,830
that's a cabin I built in my backyard so

105
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:48,289
when I want to get away I really go out

106
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:50,659
and unplug and of course nowadays with

107
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:53,860
smart phones I can take it with me but I

108
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:56,690
like to get time to relax

109
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:59,090
this summer I managed managed to marry

110
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:01,490
off the last of my four children so my

111
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:04,758
wife and I are sort of empty nesters

112
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:06,650
long story but this is my entire family

113
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:11,270
four children all married I have three

114
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:12,888
grandchildren so I'm a grandpa and you

115
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,389
know I lived a life I was raising a

116
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:17,509
family while I was doing all this stuff

117
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:19,940
in the industry over all these years and

118
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:24,220
also you know just to try to be a little

119
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:24,219
bit open you know I have issues too

120
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:32,320
anybody else with me all right cool

121
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:37,969
very briefly I give entire toss in fact

122
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,739
gurken the last couple years is where

123
00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:41,750
I've given talks one was called the

124
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,969
tales of the Crypt analyst which is

125
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,159
where I'll talk more in depth about what

126
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:48,770
I did in terms of cryptography back at

127
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:52,099
NSA and then the sequel was more Tales

128
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:53,570
from the Crypt analyst which was the the

129
00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:56,360
the story of the beginning of pen

130
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:58,099
testing at NSA but I did some cool stuff

131
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,780
in the beginning at NSA

132
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,090
and what I believe to be the first

133
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,679
software based encryption system that

134
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:06,409
NSA produced what I called a

135
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:10,100
semi-automated one-time pad taking the

136
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:12,710
most secure communication method which

137
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,360
is a one-time pad unbreakable and

138
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,010
learning how to do it with a computer

139
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,560
which I wouldn't recommend doing today

140
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,849
but back then it was a standalone

141
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,520
Windows didn't exist it was a DOS

142
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:24,680
machine somebody remembers I don't even

143
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:29,750
think it had a hard drive back in those

144
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:31,880
days imagine that I did some work with

145
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,950
special forces I invented this little

146
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,440
Cryptologic aid that I called the

147
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:40,159
Visionnaire cipher wheel they called it

148
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:42,230
the whizz wheel they used it for quite a

149
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,850
long time there's stories about that but

150
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:46,100
that's a different talk while I was at

151
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,750
NSA I was involved in sort of the

152
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,840
operations side of the house what most

153
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:53,300
people know of NSA in terms of

154
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,310
intercepting communications of our

155
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,990
adversaries I happened to be there

156
00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:00,050
during Desert shield/desert storm where

157
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:02,720
it was like a real world mission so that

158
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:05,300
was kind of cool and then I mentioned

159
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,820
earlier Moore Tales from the Crypt where

160
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,980
are you into detail I was part of what

161
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:12,349
effectively was the first penetration

162
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:15,460
testing a red team at NSA so one of the

163
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:17,990
founders pioneers of doing that at NSA

164
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:21,109
and I have the scars on my back to prove

165
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:24,470
it another story

166
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:27,290
so that was my government career came

167
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:30,710
out into the private sector and if

168
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:32,930
anybody's ready for it I did PCI in fact

169
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:37,609
I'm still doing PCI I've been doing that

170
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:40,250
for about 15 years and just to emphasize

171
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,630
that I'm not your typical qsa I think

172
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,700
this is most of them but these are the

173
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:46,250
types of customers that I've done qsa

174
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,469
work for as a PCI anybody PCI and

175
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:52,700
anybody want to own up to it or have to

176
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:54,680
do it yeah quite a few more hands yeah

177
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,539
so I've worked with payment processors

178
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,450
I've worked with the major brands big

179
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:01,910
retailers and I have their permission to

180
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:05,830
say this by the way but like the TJX

181
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:08,390
companies they were breached back in

182
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:10,639
2007-2008 and after that they hired my

183
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:14,300
company and I and

184
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,530
being there qsa for about six years you

185
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,840
know you might recognize some of the

186
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:19,609
other names up there Heartland Payment

187
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,068
Systems the first major payment

188
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:25,610
processor that was breached same hackers

189
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:28,069
as TJX so I've been very fortunate to

190
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,330
have a lot of really cool experiences in

191
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:31,969
the government and also out in the

192
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:34,939
private sector but going back to the

193
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:37,969
very sorry about that scratch my nose

194
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:39,829
and not talk who went back to my very

195
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:42,620
first experience in security I mentioned

196
00:08:39,828 --> 00:08:45,410
I started my first paying job in 1984 I

197
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:47,510
had a summer internship at a naval

198
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,769
research organization in back in

199
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:52,029
Maryland which is where I'm from

200
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:55,399
called the Naval Surface weapons center

201
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:58,399
my job for this summer was I was working

202
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:02,480
for a physicist that worked in the field

203
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:04,910
of anti-submarine warfare and he was a

204
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,899
research scientist very smart gentleman

205
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:11,360
way smarter than me and over his career

206
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:14,959
he had amassed a whole lot of collection

207
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,459
of data books reports research papers

208
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,550
and things like that and he had him

209
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:20,719
stored in a four or five drawer I think

210
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,910
that his was actually might have been a

211
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,680
five Lord if you're into lock-picking

212
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:28,219
you probably know exactly what locks on

213
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,930
there and stuff like that but my job was

214
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,120
he had gotten some money and was able to

215
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,439
go out and get one of these newfangled

216
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,089
desktop computers and I'm pretty sure

217
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,970
that's I found a picture of the the

218
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:41,029
actual computer the that he had gotten

219
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:43,880
his hands on and we had a he had bought

220
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:46,519
a database programming package called

221
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:49,310
debase - I'm gonna remember debase - and

222
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:51,140
my job was to catalogue everything that

223
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:53,260
was in this safe for the entire summer

224
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:55,730
and create some sort of rudimentary

225
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,860
certainty learn how to use debase and

226
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:59,750
create a database searching tool so he

227
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:02,060
had some sort of catalog and some sort

228
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:05,360
of idea of all this information that he

229
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:07,250
had in this safe one of the most

230
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,279
disturbing things about that experience

231
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:12,079
was I was pulling stuff out of that safe

232
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:16,100
that he had checked out of like the

233
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:20,029
research library of this facility before

234
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:21,920
I was born so it was weird well I'm

235
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:22,430
holding a book that's been in here my

236
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,370
entire

237
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:27,949
life anyway so my first experience was

238
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:31,460
I'll sort of let you guys read this I

239
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:33,440
don't like to read slides but the long

240
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:37,370
and short of it was I left the safe

241
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,260
unlocked one night and I being a young

242
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,310
college student sort of you know

243
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,510
remember when you were young and you

244
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:43,219
knew all the answers and you were

245
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,870
smarter than everybody else I was kind

246
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,640
of one of those kind I thought what's

247
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:51,020
the big deal I just you know I left the

248
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:53,689
safe unlocked and in discussing this

249
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:56,360
with my my boss and with the security

250
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:58,490
people I I raised the question you know

251
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,800
you know we're in a facility that's got

252
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:02,360
fences with barbed wire around it you

253
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,579
know so we have this secure perimeter

254
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,709
and the building itself you have to go

255
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,959
through a security checkpoint to get in

256
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:12,229
and even the office that we were in was

257
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,839
locked you know so not anybody could get

258
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:17,000
into a the campus be the building see

259
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:19,339
the actual office yet alone get to the

260
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,560
safe and they even had guards that would

261
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:23,149
walk the halls and in fact they were

262
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,949
very bored at night and they would go

263
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:27,260
into each of these locked offices to see

264
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:29,300
who had left the safes open and get him

265
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:31,550
in a lot of trouble I didn't think was a

266
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,349
big deal my boss thought it was a huge

267
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,329
deal because I had blemished his

268
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:40,010
immaculate record that he had had over

269
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:42,050
25 30 years so I I didn't learn the

270
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:46,730
lesson then I've learned it much more

271
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:49,579
later in life that security at least

272
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:51,740
it's in its earliest forms or the way we

273
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:56,630
used to think of it was primarily about

274
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:59,120
securing data is the first point and B

275
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:02,029
it sort of necessarily involves many

276
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,820
many layers or many many different

277
00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:08,089
practices or processes all working

278
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:10,339
together and part of the design is if

279
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:12,770
anyone fails hopefully that's not a

280
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:14,900
complete fail over of course that's been

281
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:16,640
completely solved in our industry today

282
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:20,779
and there are no single points of

283
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:22,339
failure anywhere in the world but over

284
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:24,980
the years and especially the last couple

285
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:27,050
years that I've been more active sort of

286
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,910
in the hacker security community going

287
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:31,079
out to lots of conferences hearing lots

288
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:35,670
of people talk

289
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:37,349
I it's been nagging at me that we

290
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:39,810
collectively don't seem to be doing much

291
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:41,910
better than we were doing back in the

292
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:45,119
beginning and some some ways maybe we're

293
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:46,259
doing worse so to sum that up I say I

294
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,529
think we have a problem

295
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:50,759
I think we have several problems but

296
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:55,139
we're gonna we're going to focus we only

297
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:56,939
have so much time here I think one of

298
00:12:55,139 --> 00:13:01,319
the problem is you know with all the

299
00:12:56,939 --> 00:13:04,560
technology that we have where we have

300
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:07,529
sort of unfair expectations we think

301
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,279
things are because they are so fast and

302
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:12,600
so cool Hickam

303
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:14,790
of course he technically he wasn't here

304
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,300
to get the warning so I guess that's and

305
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:20,610
I know him it's okay you know we've

306
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,199
we've created this this whole new

307
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,269
society in this whole new way of

308
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:26,069
communicating this whole way a new way

309
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:29,550
of interacting using all this whiz-bang

310
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:32,699
technology and and yet we're not solving

311
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:35,130
or we've forgotten or failed to or never

312
00:13:32,699 --> 00:13:39,359
have solved this fundamental data

313
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:45,930
security problem this is also part of

314
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:50,700
the problem which

315
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:54,479
up is some of you are slower readers

316
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:57,720
than other everybody got it now

317
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,149
and there's layers to this even than

318
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,649
this you know this funny little I don't

319
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:05,279
know what you call that I guess we can

320
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:08,540
call it a mean but there's there's egos

321
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:11,930
at play and there's let's say

322
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:14,480
expectations in play that are not

323
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:19,109
universally agreed upon by all all

324
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:23,130
participants let's put it that way there

325
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:25,740
seems to be no end to Valle 'nor

326
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:32,760
abilities that are introduced discovered

327
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:34,950
exposed some some worse than others if

328
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,899
you keep up with them at all you know

329
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:38,870
that there's a lot of vulnerabilities

330
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:42,450
out there that's kind of what we're all

331
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:44,339
in immersed in in this community which

332
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:47,130
is what I'm getting to is what I want to

333
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:49,770
talk more in depth about but for me the

334
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:52,490
bottom line is you know for all the

335
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:54,930
stuff that we're doing there's

336
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,880
continuing to be these tremendous

337
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:59,099
failures and as somebody that's been in

338
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,990
the business a long time and now is in a

339
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,959
position where I'm trying to educate and

340
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:06,830
teach and try to you know expand how we

341
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:09,779
do security a better understanding of it

342
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:11,940
this frustrates me it almost embarrasses

343
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:16,230
me it depresses me

344
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:18,660
that things are as bad as they are it

345
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:21,380
also depresses me that I have a really

346
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:24,240
hard time keeping this slide current

347
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:26,100
because I updated this just in the last

348
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,330
couple days and and these are people

349
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,310
that either have been in the news

350
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,870
because they've been breached or they're

351
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:32,699
getting their settlements done but this

352
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:35,100
is all basically from the last month or

353
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:40,200
so and look at the names that are up

354
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:44,220
there I find it disturbing another part

355
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:46,680
of the problem is in our our rush to be

356
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:49,079
advanced and be tech not technologically

357
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:52,829
savvy we've tried to explain everything

358
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:54,609
in minut detail I apologize if you can't

359
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:56,349
read this but what

360
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:59,949
actually this is better resolution than

361
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:02,230
I usually see thanks Adrian you know

362
00:15:59,949 --> 00:16:04,299
this is somebody's attempt to sort of

363
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:06,489
carve up everything that ass is Oh has

364
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:08,379
to worry about and I've only recently

365
00:16:06,489 --> 00:16:10,629
learned to pronounce is o because Bruce

366
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:12,309
Potter corrected me last weekend I was

367
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:16,329
at a another conference where he was

368
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:19,059
keynoting but you know these are I don't

369
00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:20,979
know 12 13 14 different major topic

370
00:16:19,059 --> 00:16:22,329
areas and under each one it divides and

371
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,790
conquers and it's it's a fairly

372
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:27,160
comprehensive and decent list of all the

373
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:28,839
things that we have to worry about it's

374
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,329
Izzo's or I would submit to you as

375
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:32,709
security professionals but I look at

376
00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:35,410
this and I'm like gosh I've been in this

377
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:37,569
business for 30-some odd years and while

378
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:39,579
I understand what all these things are

379
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:42,549
or than the vast majority of what these

380
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:45,248
things are I would never begin to claim

381
00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:47,350
that I'm an expert on all of this and if

382
00:16:45,249 --> 00:16:50,079
I can't stare at this thing and say I

383
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:51,759
got all this I don't know how and this

384
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,008
is not an this is not supposed to be

385
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,929
propping me up but just because I'm old

386
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:57,399
and I've been doing this a long time for

387
00:16:55,929 --> 00:17:00,519
those that are younger and haven't been

388
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:04,409
in this business as long as I have how

389
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:07,839
does anybody keep up with all this so

390
00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:10,120
what I want to propose and really this

391
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,099
the this talk is intended to be a

392
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:14,198
discussion starter I want you guys to

393
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:16,658
talk amongst yourselves talk to me if

394
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:20,709
you have the opportunity talk to

395
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:22,389
yourself you know ask questions can we

396
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:25,419
think about is there something that we

397
00:17:22,388 --> 00:17:29,080
can do differently or are we thinking

398
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:31,630
about this problem correctly so that's

399
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,629
sort of the goal as I sort of expand on

400
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:39,519
what I want to talk about today and

401
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:41,889
disregard this pay attention just as a

402
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:45,460
little lesson in history when I first

403
00:17:41,889 --> 00:17:46,629
started at NSA I learned a story and now

404
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,630
that we have Google I could actually

405
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:51,909
look up the source but back when the the

406
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:54,399
the United States was thinking about

407
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:57,429
putting together an organization such

408
00:17:54,399 --> 00:18:00,699
that NSA is today which I think was back

409
00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:02,649
more like around World War one there was

410
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,610
political controversy there was a lot of

411
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:06,768
people that didn't think that and

412
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,689
that the our country needed to do

413
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:11,450
something like have an organization that

414
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:13,789
was all involved in spying and stealing

415
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:15,769
secrets and stuff because this gentleman

416
00:18:13,789 --> 00:18:18,379
was quoted he's some sort of politician

417
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:20,480
gentlemen don't read each other's mail

418
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,399
and that was something that was like on

419
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,179
a plaque in some office that I first

420
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:28,610
started in in NSA but that's sort of you

421
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:30,519
know a historical perspective on the

422
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:33,260
mentality of how things were back then

423
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:35,120
so here's what I want to submit to you

424
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:37,730
accept it or not feel free to disagree

425
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,459
with me that's fine but the way I

426
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:42,919
learned it back when I was in the DoD

427
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:45,830
working for NSA is we're really at the

428
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:49,570
end of the day mostly concerned about

429
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:52,070
what used to be called data security

430
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:54,439
there are new things now that we worry

431
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:56,840
about because we have new technology

432
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,090
that creates more problems but mostly

433
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:02,539
what we're still talking about is the

434
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:04,610
protection of data and classically how

435
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:08,139
we look at data protection or data

436
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:10,668
security is divided into three aspects

437
00:19:08,139 --> 00:19:12,979
hopefully most of you guys if not all

438
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:16,190
are familiar with the they call the the

439
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:18,470
data triad confidentiality integrity and

440
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:20,000
availability those are sort of the three

441
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:21,740
things that we worry about when it

442
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,710
become when it when it comes to data

443
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,970
keeping secrets keeping the stuff that

444
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:27,649
we want to keep secret away from the

445
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:30,169
people that we don't want to know about

446
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:31,699
it or protecting the integrity of the

447
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,679
data making sure the data hasn't been

448
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,840
altered in any way modified in any way

449
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,389
making sure it's real and making sure

450
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:42,529
it's available to us again you can argue

451
00:19:38,389 --> 00:19:44,389
and I'm happy to concede that the use of

452
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:46,700
technology and the internet and all this

453
00:19:44,389 --> 00:19:48,469
stuff that we do now has perhaps

454
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,990
introduced some different ways of

455
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:52,820
viewing data but from a classical

456
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:55,419
perspective most of what we care about

457
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,418
is this

458
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:06,200
so the problems I might know what movie

459
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:08,600
that from makers you know part of the

460
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,940
problem is now it's not so much that

461
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,070
well it is the problem that we have so

462
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:15,860
much information and because we want to

463
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:17,720
share it freely and stream it and make

464
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:20,439
it available immediately no matter what

465
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,760
device we have no matter where we are

466
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:26,270
we've got this problem where there's

467
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:28,700
just a proliferation of data all over

468
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:30,830
the place and and no longer is it locked

469
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,050
in a four or five drawer safe in a

470
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:37,280
locked office and a locked building on a

471
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:40,100
locked fence campus and you know the

472
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,580
movie sneakers which came out in 1992 do

473
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:46,699
the math that's what 27 years ago

474
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:49,909
anybody not seen it in the room alright

475
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:52,400
so semi spoiler alert

476
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:55,220
the you know the subject of the movie is

477
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,900
there's these two guys that in college

478
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,910
were hackers and they were breaking into

479
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:01,490
things mostly for fun and a little bit

480
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:02,930
for profit and at one point you know

481
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:05,360
sort of the preamble to the movie they

482
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:07,850
get caught one goes to prison the other

483
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,919
gifts away Robert Redford gets away and

484
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:11,480
he starts a company that does a lot of

485
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,250
the companies that are vendors here

486
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,020
today they do penetration testing do

487
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:17,660
they do physical penetration testing

488
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:20,000
trying to test the security of companies

489
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:21,590
banks and things like that to see how

490
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,960
well they hold up see how well their

491
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:25,909
security is so there's a scene where the

492
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,710
two finally meet their sort of

493
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:30,320
adversaries but they used to be best

494
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:33,190
friends and the bad guy ben kingsley

495
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:36,230
says to the good guy and i will quote

496
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:39,110
there's a war out there old friend a

497
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:42,050
world war and it's not about who's got

498
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:45,530
the most bullets it's about who controls

499
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:49,250
the information what we see in here how

500
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:54,950
we work what we think it's all about the

501
00:21:49,250 --> 00:22:00,920
information 1992 i would submit that's

502
00:21:54,950 --> 00:22:02,030
pretty much still it today agreed so by

503
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,400
the way that thing that they were

504
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:06,680
sitting on which was a mock-up happened

505
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,350
to be a model of what was used to be a

506
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:13,200
supercomputer called the cray this is a

507
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:14,909
a picture of one and it's actually one

508
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,950
of the supercomputers that I used to

509
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:19,440
work on at the National Security Agency

510
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:22,020
which now you can find at the National

511
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,990
Cryptologic Museum outside of Fort Meade

512
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,340
Maryland so yes it's very comforting to

513
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:28,800
know that the things that I worked on

514
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:30,870
are in museums and somebody at a talk I

515
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:33,300
gave a while back said you ought to be

516
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:38,489
in the museum and I can't disagree with

517
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:41,430
that here's my opinion technology alone

518
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:42,470
and I qualify the alone will never solve

519
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:45,540
the problem

520
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:46,880
technology is the problem in my mind I'm

521
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:50,790
an old-timer I don't like technology

522
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,840
true confession one of my early lessons

523
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:53,790
at NSA

524
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,649
around the time when I was trying to

525
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:57,409
come up with this software base crypto

526
00:22:55,650 --> 00:23:00,420
system because the NSA had never done

527
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:02,160
software before in fact I had people say

528
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,880
well there's really it was the same guy

529
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,670
Ashley

530
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,710
he said there's really no such thing as

531
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:10,050
software because all we do is hardware

532
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:12,540
how we do is firmware NSA in those days

533
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:14,040
built little black boxes and engineers

534
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:16,440
and computer scientists and

535
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,210
mathematicians put all sorts of really

536
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,440
cool stuff inside of them and I can't

537
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:22,920
tell you what's inside of them because

538
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,810
that's the point and the idea of doing

539
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:29,700
something in software was just foreign

540
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:32,280
so but one of the early lessons was and

541
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,230
one of the reasons why their NSA was

542
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:37,080
reticent to sort of move into this

543
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:39,750
digital age was the more you relied on

544
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:42,210
and in the early days it was machines

545
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:45,720
and boxes anything beyond the one-time

546
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:49,770
pad anything that beacon can be created

547
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:51,930
by man can be broken by man and I think

548
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:55,590
you most would agree that that's pretty

549
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:57,750
much still the case you know any any no

550
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:59,040
matter what cryptographic algorithms

551
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:01,200
we're talking about and I'm not a

552
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,870
mathematician mathematician and if you

553
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,450
are you can disagree with me that's fine

554
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:08,489
but anything that you're doing with any

555
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:11,310
kind of cryptography digital

556
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:14,430
computer-based there's always a solution

557
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:16,500
it may take you ten billion years to get

558
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:19,080
it but theoretically there's always a

559
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,460
solution and also theoretically is a

560
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,290
cryptologist there's always the

561
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,190
possibility that somebody figures out a

562
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:27,460
way to do a shortcut or

563
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:29,649
tacit or for crying out loud what just

564
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:32,230
happened in Nord VPN somebody just

565
00:24:29,649 --> 00:24:32,889
steals the key there's always a way

566
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:35,049
around it

567
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:37,479
but I guess for me at the end of the day

568
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:40,600
and this is an attitude I've had since

569
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:42,730
NSA days no matter what you do to secure

570
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,459
or protect or encode or encrypt your

571
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:48,039
data primarily for transmission in those

572
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:50,019
days sooner or later somebody's going to

573
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:51,039
want to decrypt it and read it so

574
00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:53,289
there's always this point of

575
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,929
vulnerability where the stuff that we

576
00:24:53,289 --> 00:24:58,990
used to call plaintext the data is is is

577
00:24:55,929 --> 00:25:01,360
available and so who cares about the

578
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:04,840
security of the pipe focus on the

579
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:07,000
endpoints I'm oversimplifying but you

580
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,220
know he flipped back to that slide about

581
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:14,049
all the breaches this continues to be a

582
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:15,519
problem so in my travels the last couple

583
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:17,470
years going to lots of conference

584
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:19,269
especially those bigger conferences that

585
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:25,620
are more vendor based that everybody

586
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:28,659
here likes to hate on me to sorta but

587
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:30,879
you hear these words all the time we

588
00:25:28,659 --> 00:25:32,409
throw this language that's vernacular

589
00:25:30,879 --> 00:25:37,120
around and this thing that we call

590
00:25:32,409 --> 00:25:39,580
security and we hear words like risk and

591
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,070
we heard words like threats and of

592
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:46,509
course vulnerabilities the word security

593
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:47,860
itself I get frustrated very often

594
00:25:46,509 --> 00:25:49,750
because I'll walk through the vendor

595
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:54,100
areas and I'll hear the pitches being

596
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:55,720
given and people will use these words in

597
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,908
ways that I think wow they don't really

598
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:00,700
understand what the word means and I'll

599
00:25:57,909 --> 00:26:02,139
have conversations with people and try

600
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:04,299
to get them to like what did you mean

601
00:26:02,139 --> 00:26:07,178
when you say that or what did this word

602
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:08,918
mean in your context and of course you

603
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:10,419
know forgive the marketing people and

604
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:12,990
the people that they hire for the booths

605
00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:15,429
they're not always the practitioners but

606
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:18,070
it doesn't matter what the circumstance

607
00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:19,450
is I find when you'd actually pin people

608
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:21,759
down to actually define their terms

609
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:24,279
whatever they are very often they

610
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:26,919
struggle which means that a lot of this

611
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:29,409
terminology is being bounced around and

612
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:32,559
being talked about by people that I

613
00:26:29,409 --> 00:26:33,700
think we think everybody knows what we

614
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,289
think is the meaning of all the

615
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,310
different terms whether we ask them or

616
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:37,980
not

617
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:40,810
and I think that in some ways

618
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:43,150
contributes to the problem the way I

619
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:45,310
learned these terms in a classic

620
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:47,320
approach is what was called the risk

621
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:49,090
equation and there are many risk

622
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,370
equations out there if you google it you

623
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:52,840
can find all sorts of formulas again I'm

624
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:55,149
not a mathematician so I don't really

625
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,730
care about the math as much as sort of

626
00:26:55,150 --> 00:27:01,060
the concepts so breaking it down as

627
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:02,530
simply as I'm able to you know this is a

628
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:05,919
depiction of what I call the classic

629
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:09,690
basic risk equation where risk is a

630
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:14,730
function of vulnerabilities and threats

631
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:16,990
and countermeasures and you'll notice

632
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:19,600
security the word isn't even in the

633
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:22,510
equation and what it means essentially

634
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,610
is you know whatever your whatever

635
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:28,060
you're caring about happening or not

636
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:29,709
happening you have some idea of a value

637
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:32,800
of risk what is the risk of doing

638
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:34,420
business what is the risk of you know

639
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,450
getting out of bed in the morning you

640
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:39,340
can apply it anywhere and you try to

641
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:41,140
quantify well what are all the

642
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:43,360
vulnerabilities that could impact

643
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:44,650
whatever it is what we're worried about

644
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,139
that we're trying to figure out what our

645
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:52,210
risk level is and then what are the

646
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:55,930
threats and so on and so forth quite

647
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:58,540
simply you know I try to make it a math

648
00:27:55,930 --> 00:28:01,150
problem just edition but vulnerabilities

649
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:03,399
you have some value plus threats some

650
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:04,960
other value you subtract off whatever

651
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,120
you're doing in terms of countermeasure

652
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,510
or mitigation or for the sake of

653
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,070
argument let's say security you subtract

654
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:14,170
that down and therefore the risk

655
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:16,600
whatever the number is is lower and

656
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:18,040
again I'm not so concerned with coming

657
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,409
up with real values but just

658
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:23,500
conceptually we all know that we want

659
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:26,260
the risk a number to be lower how low

660
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:28,420
who knows what's the threshold who knows

661
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:30,400
we just know it needs to be lower and I

662
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:32,470
think in our industry and I could be

663
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,690
again oversimplifying this and feel free

664
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:37,450
to disagree but as I look at this

665
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:41,310
equation I think a lot of people think

666
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:43,990
the easiest way to reduce risk is to

667
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:46,000
reduce vulnerabilities it's like the one

668
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:48,970
variable that's like the easiest one to

669
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,870
control or manipulate that's that's my

670
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:52,630
theory

671
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:55,239
if you have other ideas that's great we

672
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:57,040
can talk about it but I think and if you

673
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,110
think about our industry we seem to be

674
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:01,629
fixated on vulnerabilities that seems to

675
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:03,990
be the emphasis of most of this industry

676
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:06,340
whether we're the security Reacher

677
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:08,890
researchers the hackers the pen testers

678
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:11,230
the vendors the products whatever we all

679
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:13,060
seem to be fixated on you know driving

680
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:18,280
down the vulnerabilities to a lesser

681
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:24,970
degree the threats vulnerabilities the

682
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:31,050
way I learned it is basically that's

683
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:33,790
acceptable I am a family man after all

684
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:35,740
vulnerability is the way I learned was

685
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:38,370
simply a weakness and the weakness could

686
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:41,530
be in a in a product in a an application

687
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:44,290
in a process it's just simply a weakness

688
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:46,570
in its most basic form some examples

689
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:48,460
threats and this is an interesting one

690
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:51,220
and it may just be me but the way I

691
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:52,690
originally learned what threats were the

692
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:55,060
threats are the people the threats are

693
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:56,350
the bad guys are the actual enemies that

694
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,940
are trying to defeat you on the

695
00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:00,370
battlefield that are trying to steal

696
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:02,140
your secrets and so on and so forth so I

697
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:03,790
have a really hard time when I hear

698
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:06,340
people talking about threat in the

699
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:09,730
context of what I used to call a tax

700
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:11,080
it's just me but bear with me because

701
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:13,390
I'm trying to pull this all together

702
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:15,639
eventually countermeasures then is

703
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:17,950
mitigations it's what you can do to

704
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,990
protect against or to minimize the

705
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:21,520
impact of the fact that there's

706
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:23,890
vulnerabilities or threats and

707
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:28,300
vulnerabilities in your environment or

708
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:30,460
threats to your environment okay the

709
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:33,010
source for this and this is something

710
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:36,910
that you can find on the internet it's

711
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:38,710
it's going through several updates over

712
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:40,510
the years to update the terminology to

713
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:43,390
fit with all the new stuff that we do

714
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:45,220
but and I think even this is not the the

715
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:49,030
version that I learned cuz this one that

716
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:50,770
I found is dated 2000 the one that I had

717
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:52,690
I think I think it was originally

718
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:54,970
published back in the 80s and it was

719
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:59,410
originally called the national

720
00:30:54,970 --> 00:31:01,300
information systems security COMSEC we

721
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:02,899
used to call it communication security

722
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:05,690
before we called it information

723
00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:08,089
dirty but you know this was sort of my

724
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:09,889
Bible with you know reference manual

725
00:31:08,089 --> 00:31:11,869
when I was at NSA this is where I went

726
00:31:09,889 --> 00:31:14,570
for the authoritative answers and

727
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:17,029
definitions of things so in this and I'm

728
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:21,678
using the somewhat updated version but

729
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:23,029
in this document the source as far as

730
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,759
I'm concerned at least from a DoD

731
00:31:23,029 --> 00:31:27,769
perspective risk is defined as follows I

732
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:33,200
won't read it to you unless anybody

733
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:35,749
wants me to read it to you ok and this

734
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,399
is the definition of threat which begins

735
00:31:35,749 --> 00:31:39,529
to take into account it's not just

736
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:41,508
people but it's stuff that people do to

737
00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:44,119
you especially because a lot of attacks

738
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:45,950
these days don't require an actual

739
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:48,349
attacker and you know breaking into your

740
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:51,669
computer breaking into your network they

741
00:31:48,349 --> 00:31:54,049
can just launch stuff kind of randomly

742
00:31:51,669 --> 00:31:56,179
but here's an interesting thing this is

743
00:31:54,049 --> 00:31:58,009
a slide that I pulled from a deck you

744
00:31:56,179 --> 00:32:00,049
know I've been doing consulting for many

745
00:31:58,009 --> 00:32:03,139
years and this goes back a little over

746
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:04,609
20 years where back in those days we

747
00:32:03,139 --> 00:32:06,109
were trying to talk to companies about

748
00:32:04,609 --> 00:32:08,089
how they needed to build security

749
00:32:06,109 --> 00:32:10,189
programs and why and trying to explain

750
00:32:08,089 --> 00:32:12,259
how it all worked and so we pulled

751
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:14,269
together this slide about what the

752
00:32:12,259 --> 00:32:16,719
threats are to companies to

753
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:21,460
organizations and why they do the things

754
00:32:16,719 --> 00:32:24,710
I look at this today and I kind of think

755
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:27,379
yeah it's just are we missing anything

756
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:29,359
this is still pretty much the case which

757
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:32,589
again we've been doing this for a long

758
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:35,299
time and nothing seems to change

759
00:32:32,589 --> 00:32:36,979
vulnerability then the definition again

760
00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:38,839
at the end of the day that's a weakness

761
00:32:36,979 --> 00:32:40,849
but you know weakness in anything

762
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:45,950
associated with what it is that you're

763
00:32:40,849 --> 00:32:47,718
doing but I keep coming back to the

764
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:49,309
vulnerabilities were fixated on the

765
00:32:47,719 --> 00:32:51,499
vulnerabilities and you know this was a

766
00:32:49,309 --> 00:32:53,928
couple years old slide but these were

767
00:32:51,499 --> 00:32:55,879
kind of big deal vulnerabilities because

768
00:32:53,929 --> 00:32:58,969
they got their own logos you know that's

769
00:32:55,879 --> 00:33:00,468
that's a clear sign but to me more

770
00:32:58,969 --> 00:33:01,759
importantly several of these

771
00:33:00,469 --> 00:33:05,119
vulnerabilities when they were

772
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:07,580
discovered were existing in the things

773
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:09,830
that they were running in for 10 15 20

774
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:11,749
years and that kind of bothers me

775
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:14,539
because you know at any given moment

776
00:33:11,749 --> 00:33:15,830
anything that we use in trust some smart

777
00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:19,310
person somewhere

778
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:20,960
can have this epiphany and discover some

779
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:23,450
new vulnerability that's been there

780
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:26,750
forever the good news is they're not

781
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:30,100
very often exploited that very often

782
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:32,780
they are so it continues to be a problem

783
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:35,780
in case you don't believe me I actually

784
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:38,600
have some empirical evidence here I

785
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:42,680
happen to find an article a month or so

786
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:46,939
ago it came out several months ago I saw

787
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:49,370
it more recently but some study was done

788
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:51,050
where they they tried to catalogue all

789
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:53,899
the vulnerabilities that are known like

790
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:56,690
in the CVE database and actually count

791
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:58,760
them up based on actual attacks there

792
00:33:56,690 --> 00:34:01,610
you know scenarios breaches that we've

793
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:03,680
known about and they discovered you know

794
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:05,179
take their word for it but those are

795
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:07,190
kind of the numbers that came up where

796
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:09,050
all these vulnerabilities that were

797
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:10,460
dealing with all the time actually very

798
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:13,070
few of them are actually used in

799
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:16,330
exploits why because people still use

800
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:21,070
default passwords and so on and so forth

801
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:24,230
anyway the last element countermeasure

802
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:28,880
again maybe we could substitute the word

803
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:33,130
security but you know it's the things

804
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:36,230
you do to minimize to mitigate to offset

805
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:37,610
not the existence of vulnerabilities of

806
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:39,590
threats but the fact that they're

807
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:47,300
present that you can't really drive it

808
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:49,250
down so my question then and you know

809
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,900
that's the question but let me put the

810
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:53,270
slide back up again and this is a

811
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:54,740
different slightly different version of

812
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:57,280
the risk equation because I tried to

813
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:59,299
make this more of a commercial model

814
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:02,090
whereas where I learned the risk

815
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:04,490
equation in the DoD what was at risk was

816
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:06,050
essentially human life whether it was

817
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:07,669
soldiers on the battlefield

818
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:09,800
you know our troops are our citizens

819
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:12,260
abroad or State Department's are

820
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:14,780
diplomats and things like that you know

821
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:16,970
everything we do within this this

822
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:19,910
umbrella of national security ostensibly

823
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:22,669
is to protect human life at one level or

824
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:24,740
another whereas in a business context in

825
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:28,900
the commercial world it really boils

826
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:30,368
down to some sort of value I mean we're

827
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:32,470
we're in this business and we like to

828
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:33,849
think about you know perfect security

829
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:37,029
whatever that is we'll get back to that

830
00:35:33,849 --> 00:35:38,980
in a minute but if everything comes at a

831
00:35:37,029 --> 00:35:41,799
cost there's a there's there's a cost

832
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:44,770
associated with everything we do driving

833
00:35:41,799 --> 00:35:47,470
down this perceived risk which I would

834
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:49,180
submit to you in a business sense we

835
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:51,339
really only care about at the end of the

836
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:53,558
day one of two risks the ability to make

837
00:35:51,339 --> 00:35:56,859
money and how much is it gonna cost us

838
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:58,599
to run our business you know there can

839
00:35:56,859 --> 00:36:00,490
be variations again I'm not I'm not

840
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:03,369
setting this in stone I'm just trying to

841
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:07,089
you know broadly describe this but

842
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:09,220
here's my question and I've asked this

843
00:36:07,089 --> 00:36:10,900
to a lot of people two years ago I was

844
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:12,220
hung up on vulnerabilities and I went

845
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,299
around and asked people that I would

846
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:15,250
meet at conference so what is a

847
00:36:13,299 --> 00:36:17,140
vulnerability and watch them struggle to

848
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:18,430
define it and then for a while I was

849
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,920
going around and doing the same thing

850
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:23,910
with threat and so on and so forth but

851
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:27,099
here's my supposition this time around

852
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:30,129
and again I'm not a mathematician so if

853
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:31,180
you are feel free to correct me but bear

854
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:33,819
with me for a minute

855
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:36,069
if you have a math function where you

856
00:36:33,819 --> 00:36:39,069
have elements or what we call variables

857
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:40,960
in an in an equation generally those

858
00:36:39,069 --> 00:36:42,819
variables are expressed as separate

859
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:47,410
variables because they're different

860
00:36:42,819 --> 00:36:49,839
you with me so far so if in this

861
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:51,970
equation if we assume that

862
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,319
countermeasure is more more or less what

863
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:57,730
we're talking about when we talk about

864
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:59,920
security because it's a separate element

865
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:01,960
because it's a separate variable and

866
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,240
there's other variables that are called

867
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:07,510
vulnerabilities and there's other

868
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,950
variables that are called threats in my

869
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:11,440
mind that kind of means that

870
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:17,589
vulnerabilities and threats aren't

871
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:19,690
security so my question to you is if all

872
00:37:17,589 --> 00:37:22,630
this stuff that we do in our industry

873
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:24,579
that associates or fixates or has

874
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:26,829
something to do with vulnerabilities if

875
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:30,039
by definition if you go back to this

876
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:32,799
risk equation isn't anything to do with

877
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:36,460
security then what is it that we're

878
00:37:32,799 --> 00:37:39,670
doing here title of the top same

879
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:42,400
question asking about threats if all

880
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:44,049
that we're doing in this industry of

881
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,930
evolving around threats however we

882
00:37:44,049 --> 00:37:49,059
define them are by definition not

883
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:52,390
security related because security is a

884
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:59,500
separate variable then what is it that

885
00:37:52,390 --> 00:38:02,020
we're doing my question is if it's not

886
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,460
security maybe it's just our job because

887
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:05,410
I'm not saying the stuff that we're

888
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:08,680
doing isn't important I'm just

889
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:10,569
suggesting maybe it's not security so

890
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:14,279
the question then becomes what is

891
00:38:10,569 --> 00:38:16,240
security what is security if it's not

892
00:38:14,279 --> 00:38:18,010
running around trying to discover

893
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,629
vulnerabilities and eliminate them in

894
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:21,400
and your bots in your environment drive

895
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:23,760
them down controlled and patch and fix

896
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:26,529
them what if all the patching and

897
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,839
circuit secure configurations and

898
00:38:26,529 --> 00:38:30,599
monitoring your users what if all that

899
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:38,680
is just the way you run your business

900
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:41,529
what then is security and if all this

901
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:43,868
stuff we're doing is not technically

902
00:38:41,529 --> 00:38:45,849
security

903
00:38:43,869 --> 00:38:48,059
I apologize Dave I forgot to start with

904
00:38:45,849 --> 00:38:49,960
your thing but we'll get to it

905
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:54,299
commercial moment because I just

906
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:55,930
remembered it sorry Dave

907
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:57,609
gentlemen the front row Dave

908
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:59,259
Schwartzberg runs an organization called

909
00:38:57,609 --> 00:39:00,970
hack for kids it's a charitable

910
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:03,250
organization that tries to teach young

911
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:05,919
people hacking skills so we can keep

912
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:08,740
this thing going they put out a card

913
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,319
game about two years ago now called

914
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:13,299
Freaker life which is an educational

915
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:16,750
interactive fantasy card collecting game

916
00:39:13,299 --> 00:39:18,520
stuff that I don't do I'm too old but

917
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:19,960
it's it's designed to teach you the

918
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,730
history of hacking and freaking

919
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,549
throughout the years from the 70s and

920
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:26,859
80s and 90s so there's lots of

921
00:39:23,549 --> 00:39:28,630
historical information in it also in the

922
00:39:26,859 --> 00:39:30,819
in the deck there are a couple face

923
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:33,490
cards that have special values wild

924
00:39:30,819 --> 00:39:36,099
cards in the deck and I was fortunate

925
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:38,799
enough to be selected to be one of the

926
00:39:36,099 --> 00:39:41,380
original what they call in hacker anism

927
00:39:38,799 --> 00:39:42,700
so they have a booth here today go by

928
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,950
and buy the whole decks but we're

929
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:46,509
actually altered we're gonna I'm gonna

930
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:49,598
let Dave do it when I'm done talking

931
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:53,819
auction off and where do the proceeds of

932
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:56,150
the auction go to benefit hack for kids

933
00:39:53,819 --> 00:39:58,040
so we're going to auction this off

934
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:59,960
at the conclusion my talk if anybody is

935
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:02,690
interested in an autographed copy of my

936
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:04,070
Ann Hackman ISM car it's up here we'll

937
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:07,280
get back to that so that's our

938
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:09,200
commercial interruption so what are we

939
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,810
doing here if all the stuff that we're

940
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:14,410
doing at some level isn't really

941
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:16,970
security that at all

942
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:18,529
and I'm asking us to think about it and

943
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:20,209
question this and I'm not saying that

944
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:21,860
there's a right answer I'm not

945
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:24,350
suggesting that I have the right answer

946
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:26,570
but I'm asking that we think about it

947
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:28,790
what is this what are we doing here if

948
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:31,970
it's if it's something to do with

949
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:33,259
security but it's not or maybe security

950
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:37,160
is something else that we haven't tried

951
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:41,510
with all for the purpose of and my

952
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:46,490
belief is all the new stuff that we try

953
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:48,170
to do doesn't really work ultimately or

954
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:50,839
isn't working or we don't have a good

955
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:52,850
track record of it and maybe just maybe

956
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:54,530
there's still something to be learned

957
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:57,620
from the ancient history of how data

958
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:59,600
security used to be done and maybe

959
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:01,670
there's something still there to extend

960
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,920
into this new environment this new

961
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:08,300
technological world that we live that we

962
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:10,010
live in I I don't have the answer the

963
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:12,680
older I get the more questions I have

964
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:15,280
but I continue to be unsettled at

965
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:17,870
companies continue to be breached and

966
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,490
the more and more people I talk to or a

967
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:22,040
hear speaker conferences

968
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:24,200
throw these terms around and and very

969
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,970
clearly at least to me don't seem to

970
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,589
have a fundamental understanding of what

971
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:29,959
they are especially when they use one

972
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:31,970
variable term to define what another

973
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:34,580
variable term is it doesn't work that

974
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:38,230
way they all are just different and

975
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:42,549
distinct although they are all related

976
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:43,790
so my my charge to you is to think

977
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:45,440
question

978
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:48,770
keep talking had the conversation

979
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:52,940
amongst yourselves have it with me but

980
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:55,070
do something if you're at all interested

981
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:57,380
or intrigued about what I'm saying want

982
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:59,570
to learn more I just try to teach and

983
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:01,580
share information experiences many of

984
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:03,470
you probably know this already I'm one

985
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:05,150
of the co-hosts and Paul security weekly

986
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:07,250
been doing that for the last five years

987
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:08,340
or so I'm not on it every week in fact

988
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:09,810
we're recording and

989
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:11,730
two hours and I'm not going to be on it

990
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:13,950
today sorry

991
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:15,990
but I'm still not convinced whether I'm

992
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:17,460
being punished and put it in a corner or

993
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:19,740
whether I'm being rewarded because if

994
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:22,140
any of you listen or watch the show I

995
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:24,620
very often bring up PCI because I've

996
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:27,390
been doing it for so long but they've

997
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:29,220
decided to spin up a new show so we've

998
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:30,660
started recording just in the last month

999
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:32,660
a new show called security and

1000
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:35,580
compliance weekly where we're exploring

1001
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:38,359
amongst other things how to bridge the

1002
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:41,880
gap between these worlds of within our

1003
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:44,460
security industry that do security and

1004
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,840
do compliance and thing there think

1005
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:47,420
there are two separate different things

1006
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:50,880
that don't play well together

1007
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:53,910
I've lived in both worlds and I think we

1008
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,010
both do the same thing and we just don't

1009
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:59,450
know it so we're trying to foster a

1010
00:42:56,010 --> 00:43:02,220
conversation in this podcast to try to

1011
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:04,710
at the end make sure our companies and

1012
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:06,089
our customers are more secure and doing

1013
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:08,190
it by figuring out how to work together

1014
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:10,710
and play well together and ultimately

1015
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:15,060
sit and hold hands and sing Kumbaya as

1016
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:17,550
my wife would like to say there's a

1017
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:19,950
company called cyber area oh they do a

1018
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:22,170
lot of free education videos I recorded

1019
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:23,669
a training course on there a couple

1020
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:26,670
years ago called the art of the Jedi

1021
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:29,340
mind-trick it's a two maybe a two hour

1022
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:30,840
course at the end of the day just going

1023
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:33,300
over some of the lessons I learned in my

1024
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:35,460
years of consulting of how to foster

1025
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:37,320
communication how to how to speak to

1026
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:39,570
your audience which is obviously what

1027
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,770
I'm doing now but anytime you're talking

1028
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:43,320
to somebody you're speaking to an

1029
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:44,910
audience in our context very often we're

1030
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,590
selling something whether we're trying

1031
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:48,450
to sell a product or trying to sell

1032
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:50,760
trying to convince our management our

1033
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:52,680
bosses or customers to spend money or

1034
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,690
trying to convince people to change

1035
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:56,580
their behaviors do something different

1036
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:59,640
we're selling something so you know

1037
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:01,290
we're trying to compel people to take an

1038
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:03,600
action which is a particular type of

1039
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:06,720
speech you can learn about in my course

1040
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:08,400
I was very privileged earlier earlier in

1041
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,230
the year to be part of a book that came

1042
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:13,920
out called tribe of hackers anybody hear

1043
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:15,810
of tribe of hackers excellent a second

1044
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,730
edition came out red team they also let

1045
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:20,130
me be in that one as well since you know

1046
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:22,140
I used to do pen testing at NSA that's

1047
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:27,450
where the

1048
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:29,219
it gets me places I guess those books if

1049
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:30,718
you're not familiar with them they talk

1050
00:44:29,219 --> 00:44:32,130
to a bunch of different people and asked

1051
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:34,289
them all the same question so we

1052
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:36,209
basically filled out a survey in the

1053
00:44:34,289 --> 00:44:38,190
original book it's like you know what's

1054
00:44:36,209 --> 00:44:39,779
the best thing about the business what's

1055
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:41,759
the worst thing about the business

1056
00:44:39,779 --> 00:44:42,989
what's your favorite hacker movie what

1057
00:44:41,759 --> 00:44:45,180
would you change if you could change

1058
00:44:42,989 --> 00:44:46,799
anything you know what what are the

1059
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:48,959
lessons learned that you want to impart

1060
00:44:46,799 --> 00:44:51,749
to people it's a it's a really

1061
00:44:48,959 --> 00:44:53,459
fascinating read because it especially

1062
00:44:51,749 --> 00:44:55,769
in the first book it's a very diverse

1063
00:44:53,459 --> 00:44:57,299
set of people that I didn't know most of

1064
00:44:55,769 --> 00:44:58,709
the people in the book honestly but

1065
00:44:57,299 --> 00:45:01,410
they're all people that have made a name

1066
00:44:58,709 --> 00:45:03,149
for themselves in one of the many silos

1067
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:03,868
that create this whole cybersecurity

1068
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:06,509
industry

1069
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:09,380
I said cyber I try to get through the

1070
00:45:06,509 --> 00:45:12,089
whole talk without using that word drink

1071
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:13,529
but it's a very interesting read to at

1072
00:45:12,089 --> 00:45:15,180
least to me it was because there's a lot

1073
00:45:13,529 --> 00:45:16,380
of diversity people coming at it from

1074
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:18,089
the different place and very often

1075
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:20,640
coming to the same conclusion because I

1076
00:45:18,089 --> 00:45:23,160
think there is a way to approach this

1077
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,479
that more of us need to know if you want

1078
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,209
to know what that is go read the book

1079
00:45:24,479 --> 00:45:30,209
and see if you can figure out what it is

1080
00:45:26,209 --> 00:45:32,339
I have time for a few questions or

1081
00:45:30,209 --> 00:45:37,229
comments anybody want to stay Jeff

1082
00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:37,890
you're crazy go away how much time total

1083
00:45:37,229 --> 00:45:39,749
do we have left

1084
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:42,719
okay perfect any questions comments

1085
00:45:39,749 --> 00:45:44,519
anyone otherwise get your wallets out

1086
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:53,239
I'm sorry oh right over there

1087
00:45:44,519 --> 00:45:53,238
sorry yes

1088
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:13,200
um I know the person that gave the talk

1089
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:15,419
I wouldn't necessarily disagree with

1090
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,549
that I've asked the question of many

1091
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:19,380
people especially speakers and people

1092
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:22,500
that are well-known sans instructors

1093
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:24,690
what is security and even people that

1094
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:26,970
are sort of the upper echelon struggle

1095
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:30,450
with defining it I have typically

1096
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:32,520
defined security as an illusion I was

1097
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:34,319
talking to someone in the summer and I

1098
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:40,230
liked their response they defined

1099
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:41,880
security as a feeling so I you know how

1100
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:44,010
many people are more comfortable because

1101
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:45,720
they have to take their shoes off when

1102
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:47,220
they go through security at the airport

1103
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:50,100
I mean how many people feel like they're

1104
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:52,230
more safe on the airplane you know a lot

1105
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:55,980
of security yeah is it is kind of

1106
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:57,960
selling a peace of mind if you will not

1107
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:00,120
necessarily doing anything and yet

1108
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:02,220
there's a lot of stuff that we do that

1109
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:04,920
do actually do a lot of good things and

1110
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:07,020
very often you know we don't see it

1111
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:10,730
because nothing bad has happened it's

1112
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:12,900
one of the paradoxes of this industry is

1113
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:14,370
lots of companies out there are doing

1114
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,830
great things and they're not getting

1115
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:19,589
breached or at least not famously and

1116
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:21,540
they get by and we and so everything's

1117
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:23,850
good but you know one little bad thing

1118
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:26,250
happens and you know it's exposed to how

1119
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:28,080
bad things are and that's what we dwell

1120
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:29,700
on at the end of the day all these

1121
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:35,610
companies that are breached or victims

1122
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:37,230
of crime and to be frank the only other

1123
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:39,750
thing that I think is a parallel in

1124
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:43,200
terms of how we treat victims of data

1125
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:46,020
breaches is victim of sex crimes where

1126
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:48,120
we so often sort of you know focus on

1127
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:51,180
the victim and demonize the victim and

1128
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:53,430
you know there's equivalencies there you

1129
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:55,830
know why wasn't the company doing this

1130
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:57,690
why was that person in that place what's

1131
00:47:55,830 --> 00:48:00,180
their past behaviors what's their past

1132
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:03,510
behaviors so yeah

1133
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:05,370
sadi yeah I do sort of agree but not

1134
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:06,150
completely because I think there's more

1135
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:09,290
to it than that

1136
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:09,290
any other questions

1137
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:26,950
yes I'll put it to you this way it used

1138
00:48:24,279 --> 00:48:28,900
to be said that necessity was the mother

1139
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:31,058
is the mother of invention that's a

1140
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:34,089
that's a saying that my parents who grew

1141
00:48:31,059 --> 00:48:35,950
up in the depression taught me and I

1142
00:48:34,089 --> 00:48:38,259
think most of us would agree that

1143
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:42,038
somewhere along the line technology sort

1144
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:44,500
