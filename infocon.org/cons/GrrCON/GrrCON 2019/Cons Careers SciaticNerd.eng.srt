19
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:55,929
to you I'm sciatic nerd

20
00:02:54,100 --> 00:03:02,320
and I want to talk to you today a little

21
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:03,520
bit about cons and careers but first we

22
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,220
have to talk about the elephant in the

23
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:09,790
room always they're kind of a pain in

24
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,440
the tush that's right I said push kind

25
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,769
of a weird sound to it but the reality

26
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,630
is impostor syndrome is this monster

27
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:19,209
kind of like unicorn slippers or

28
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,739
something even better if you didn't see

29
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:22,330
it

30
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:25,720
weren't here in the room please check

31
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:28,600
out soulcrusher 86 is talk because she

32
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,950
talked about some of the same things but

33
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,959
from a different perspective that of a

34
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:34,268
manager I'm here to talk to you about

35
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:38,800
this creature that gets inside our heads

36
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:43,120
and messes with us relentlessly see I

37
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:45,580
started out I don't know how you grew up

38
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,540
it in my life my brother had this stereo

39
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,890
system okay

40
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:53,350
that meant I listened it to whatever he

41
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:56,290
wanted us to hear and that meant yes is

42
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:58,600
not on one to five a ridiculously

43
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:01,000
successful album that I hated with a

44
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,070
passion because I had to hear it so

45
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,100
often I heard that guitar riff starting

46
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:08,230
I just ah this is awful why do I have to

47
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,480
wear something for me and I found a band

48
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:12,910
called The Art of Noise that I thought

49
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,440
was kind of more my thing it sounded

50
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,750
different

51
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,140
it had nothing to do with this pop

52
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:22,470
monstrosity that he adored so much but I

53
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:24,599
gotta tell you that it kind of took a

54
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,610
strange turn for me as years later we're

55
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,520
talking 20-plus years later I was

56
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,470
getting one of those music services

57
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:35,099
right everybody now who owns an actual

58
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,750
disc or a cassette or a record Oh more

59
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,390
people than I expected that's kind of

60
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,040
cool but the reality is we have access

61
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:43,860
to a giant library that you can pay for

62
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,960
month-to-month and so doing that I found

63
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,570
nine oh one two five all over again and

64
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,640
I took a new listen and I have to say

65
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,870
the production quality alone impressed

66
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,860
the heck out of me I'm like this is

67
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:58,290
crazy but the thing was I was forced to

68
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,580
listen to his tunes and his sounds and I

69
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,380
suddenly began to grow a new

70
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,560
appreciation for it and I had to wonder

71
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:10,409
why see it turns out that the art of

72
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:13,260
noise only existed because the music

73
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,540
programmer who was working with yes to

74
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:18,650
make nine oh one two five was working on

75
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,910
some drum tracks with Alan White and

76
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:23,310
suddenly figured out hey this would make

77
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:24,750
a neat idea which became the biggest hit

78
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:28,290
one of the biggest hits for the out of

79
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:31,230
noise at all so without my brother's

80
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:33,480
band I would never have learned about

81
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:35,910
this band it wouldn't have existed so

82
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,250
it's kind of a weird thing which is not

83
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:40,890
unlike figuring out your career you

84
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:43,590
don't know that the the lever you pulled

85
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:45,900
today might become the giant shift in

86
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,340
your career tomorrow but what am I

87
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,919
really talking about because you got to

88
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:54,419
be able to make mistakes learn from them

89
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:57,510
move on deal with all of the shizzle

90
00:05:54,419 --> 00:06:02,190
that comes your way because you're going

91
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:04,289
to discover we have to learn how to add

92
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:06,510
value to other people not just ourselves

93
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:09,360
but how do we do that for everybody all

94
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:11,190
tied together and the thing is to make

95
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,169
it most beneficial you have to see the

96
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,669
connections between them right and if

97
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:16,530
you're sitting in this room this morning

98
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:18,719
you obviously are willing to see what if

99
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:20,640
someone else's perspective might take

100
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,640
because I didn't start in this place you

101
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:26,130
did we all come from somewhere else I

102
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,099
don't know that everybody grew up and

103
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,750
said

104
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,460
you know I remember hearing them what do

105
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,800
you want to be when you grow up little

106
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:35,680
kid and they people would say a fireman

107
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,900
or police officer rocket scientist

108
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,080
astronomer they didn't say I want to

109
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,789
play with computers and get paid be kind

110
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,380
of nice that they did but you know all I

111
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:46,540
want to now it's I want to make games

112
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:49,630
how many people have heard from a

113
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:52,000
younger person in their sphere I'm gonna

114
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:53,980
grow up and be a streamer right a

115
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,620
streamer you're going to put your

116
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:59,440
personality out there online well that's

117
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,510
what this is this is streaming to a much

118
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,100
smaller audience actually it's probably

119
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:07,530
a little bigger to be honest and the

120
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:11,800
times I've been on Twitch three views

121
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:14,080
anyway so this is the place where

122
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,910
conferences really come into play see

123
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,400
this is your open audience if you've

124
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:21,040
made the time come out of your shell far

125
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,080
enough to get here you have taken the

126
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,120
first step and there are probably a half

127
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:28,330
a dozen of your friends who did not come

128
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,770
out to gur connor somewhere else because

129
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,120
they're not sure this is the right

130
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,340
environment for them what are they going

131
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,710
to get out of it last week on Twitter

132
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,570
yeah that should be an actual shirt last

133
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:40,599
weekend well yet five seconds ago on

134
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:42,909
Twitter so was saying that information

135
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,320
security conferences are a waste they're

136
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:46,510
all the same thing

137
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,460
they are nothing but information

138
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:50,530
security professionals talking to

139
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:54,430
themselves about things they already

140
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:57,429
know so really what's the point and I

141
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:59,139
put it to you you aren't alone and this

142
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,850
person made me feel alone and they made

143
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:04,300
me feel like I'm talking to a roomful of

144
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:06,160
the same exact like you're all me now I

145
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,950
wouldn't recommend that you all wear the

146
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,840
unicorn onesie I had on last night

147
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:13,030
number one I spilled some dressing on it

148
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,919
at dinner so it's probably soiled in the

149
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,690
way and you shouldn't mess with that but

150
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:18,700
that's a separate story I want to talk

151
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:20,650
to you instead about we need to figure

152
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,389
out ways to add value to other people

153
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,710
and grow and that's one of the ways is

154
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:25,570
through maturity which is why I have a

155
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,950
picture of lint I'll up here because he

156
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:30,490
is the picture of maturity in this

157
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:32,650
industry the reality is is that we don't

158
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:35,830
understand the impact we have on other

159
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:37,419
people so much or maybe we do and we

160
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,300
aren't leveraging it to the best of our

161
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:42,260
abilities

162
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:44,270
see as we grow and we spend time in this

163
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,040
industry we tend to forget and that's

164
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:48,230
not actually just this industry it's

165
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,589
everybody what was it like to be a six

166
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:54,470
year old and unwrapping a present

167
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:59,210
where's that where is that sense of joy

168
00:08:54,470 --> 00:09:01,610
wonder and interest in each of you some

169
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:05,480
people it's in a tiny duck in other

170
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:08,380
people it was forgotten long ago we'll

171
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:14,420
cover these ideas in the concept of

172
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:16,970
story arcs in an epic a tale yours see

173
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,860
if you haven't thought about story arcs

174
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:20,810
generally it's that part of a story that

175
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,300
helps to build it to some kind of

176
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:25,670
crescendo and then leads us on into the

177
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:28,790
sunset of that tale but the thing is

178
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:33,290
only you know where you are in your

179
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:37,040
current arc there are many I kind of see

180
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:39,050
them in a specific way but you have to

181
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,180
before we get really rolling be aware of

182
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:43,729
a couple of dangerous things disclaimer

183
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:46,069
time you have to leave the comfort of

184
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:48,050
the herd you've got to get out of your

185
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:50,060
comfort zone maybe a little more than

186
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:52,969
just coming to jerk on or going to your

187
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:54,770
local b-sides see there's a mission here

188
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:58,700
if you ever play an online game where

189
00:09:54,770 --> 00:10:03,560
there's a quest giver I'm gonna try to

190
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:06,100
do my impression of that now see my

191
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,719
theory is that everybody needs somebody

192
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:11,060
even people who don't like other people

193
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,930
have someone else to go tell that to and

194
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:18,500
not just shouting openly in social media

195
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:21,530
but where are you in that you're gonna

196
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:24,230
meet jerks you're gonna meet people who

197
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:25,310
frustrate you who challenge you you

198
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:28,850
don't know they're challenging you

199
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:31,040
because it sounds like why do you do the

200
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:32,750
things you do why are you like this why

201
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,420
aren't you just like everybody else why

202
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:37,400
can't you just fit inside a box if

203
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:40,189
you're in this room you don't fit inside

204
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,319
that box that's why it's a small pool

205
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:44,900
that's what information security has

206
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,510
become because only the people who are

207
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,399
curious enough and had the mind for the

208
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,569
channel

209
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,089
are the ones who usually get the

210
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:55,370
opportunity to spend time out here see

211
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:57,529
everyone else they're like where's my

212
00:10:55,370 --> 00:11:01,010
device can you help me with this I don't

213
00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:03,620
I don't computer I need you to fix it

214
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:04,910
printer not working I have a friend who

215
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,230
texted me the other day who said they're

216
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:10,310
going to take the printer outside and

217
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:12,770
shoot it so what what why it just won't

218
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:16,849
work with the Wi-Fi I can't make it work

219
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:19,189
you're my computer friend make it go if

220
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:21,830
you were that person for somebody else

221
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:24,350
thank you for being here this talk is

222
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:27,260
for you but realize that persistence is

223
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,339
what pays you're going to discover time

224
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,839
and again whether you're at the

225
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:32,390
beginning of this thing or the end

226
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:35,180
that every time there's going to be some

227
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:38,959
kind of bump but the thing is the trick

228
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:41,390
is the real deal the frustrating reality

229
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,270
is that we have to push through anyway

230
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:45,860
so in the original way I have this

231
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:49,579
listed two ways depending on how you

232
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:52,100
want to see it we start with a

233
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:54,860
discussion of conferences in general but

234
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,260
we move towards the story arc concept

235
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:59,450
saying are you are you just learning

236
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:02,750
about this I kind of put it in a gaming

237
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:05,000
role-playing game facet but then it came

238
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:08,750
clearer in the triangle graphic going

239
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,690
from the broad to the narrow are you

240
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:16,160
drinking from the fire hose or are you

241
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:17,180
now becoming the GM I want you to think

242
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,399
about that for a minute

243
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:21,739
because I can't tell you this only you

244
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:24,230
can tell you this you have to look in

245
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,899
the mirror or your selfie camera if you

246
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:29,779
prefer maybe you stare into your dream

247
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:33,110
journal whatever you do make sure you

248
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:34,550
know where you are because only you can

249
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:37,100
know where the next step is going to

250
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:40,520
come from and that's okay because you're

251
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:44,060
not alone see there's a split there

252
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:46,520
that's really important knowing yourself

253
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:49,969
and knowing how you interact with others

254
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:52,010
okay so I'm not saying that you have to

255
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:55,130
do this alone yeah there's part of it

256
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:56,930
you do there is the introspection

257
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:58,400
unlike the show fringe there really is

258
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:00,650
no way that I'm aware of that we can

259
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,060
just see into people's heads with or

260
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:04,579
without drills and I don't want to know

261
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:06,530
about that the point is you should be

262
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:10,760
able to identify where you are going and

263
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:13,250
you want to do it because there are many

264
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,380
kinds of events and whether you're

265
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,450
trying to just fill out in your local

266
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:21,800
town or you're trying to take over the

267
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:23,600
world by storm or by onesy the only way

268
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,010
to do that is to start somewhere and I

269
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,740
kind of see that as drinking from the

270
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:29,000
fire hose when you're drinking from that

271
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:32,480
fire hose you're gonna say to yourself

272
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,620
but I don't understand who's paying for

273
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:38,210
all this in many ways you are your

274
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,950
company may eventually back you or you

275
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:42,800
may find a team that supports you or

276
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:45,200
maybe your lifestyle allows for it but

277
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,890
if you are here and moving forward there

278
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,930
are tons of ways to get started start at

279
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:54,500
home it always starts at home

280
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:56,359
I spent goodness probably three four

281
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:00,710
years before I understood what I was

282
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:02,780
doing I went to the local meetups I went

283
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:03,830
and hung out at a Thai restaurant with

284
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,540
some friends who said we're getting

285
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:11,180
together to talk about exploits want to

286
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:15,020
come I said huh what exploits the flap

287
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:18,439
is that I worked with technologies that

288
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:20,260
digital lock changer PKI yeah but you

289
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:23,410
like this stuff I know you do come here

290
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:26,000
okay we ate Thai food

291
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:27,680
we hung out there was a projector it was

292
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,350
literally the side room in a restaurant

293
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:34,670
and there were like six of us but I

294
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:37,400
gotta tell ya that's a start in most

295
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:39,589
cities you'd be hard-pressed not to find

296
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,420
some bastion of people going help I

297
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:44,060
don't want to be alone in this thing

298
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:47,180
that I love please come spend time with

299
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:49,579
me share your love about this share your

300
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:51,650
passion share your ideas why because if

301
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:53,240
you look for these groups like

302
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:55,640
derbycon is making a big announcement

303
00:14:53,240 --> 00:15:00,590
Derby con groups Dave Kennedy mentioned

304
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:02,900
it yesterday big deal coming up it's

305
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:04,850
gonna launch today keep an eye on that

306
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:07,130
Twitter feed because there's gonna be

307
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:09,560
yet another way to help and connect and

308
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:12,260
grow because if we help other people

309
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,869
find their path they'll help us move

310
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:17,270
forward or we'll help them move forward

311
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,590
either way there's motion and that's one

312
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:20,390
of the big goals here is that you

313
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,980
actually get a chance to not just

314
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:23,600
continue drinking from the fire hose

315
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:27,950
unless you like that and that's your

316
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:30,020
business but by gum there are besides

317
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:32,120
conferences and meetups galore that you

318
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:34,340
can dig into and when you want instead

319
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,350
to travel and come to gherkin I'm from

320
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:38,780
San Antonio Texas for the last 30 years

321
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:41,210
by the way so this is not a hop skip and

322
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:43,760
the jump it is an easy plane ride or two

323
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:45,380
and that's okay too we all come from

324
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:49,760
somewhere how many people are from the

325
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:51,530
Grand Rapids area ish that's pretty good

326
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,660
so that means the rest of you how many

327
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:56,660
are coming from at least one plane hop

328
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:59,270
away let's say two plane hops dude okay

329
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:00,829
there are far fewer one plane hop man he

330
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:05,510
has a better hub airports I need to talk

331
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:08,390
to someone about this okay anyway the

332
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:11,120
reason you come to this thing or get out

333
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:13,819
of your own box realize there are other

334
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:17,240
cultures to learn whether it's pop or

335
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:20,060
it's soda whether it's a simple sandwich

336
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:23,420
or the way that people discuss ideas

337
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:26,479
that's what conferences are for that's

338
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:29,479
the big takeaway no surprise right

339
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,570
that's why you're here but is it a

340
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:35,180
one-off deal why come to more than one

341
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:37,790
conference a year I learned I did it I

342
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:40,219
got out of the box I I went somewhere I

343
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:44,750
ate hot chicken or I I went and tried to

344
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:47,270
local something but no this is far far

345
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:49,400
more when you look at certain kinds of

346
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:53,329
conferences Cedar Khan is a nice broad

347
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:58,189
cross-section right but what about recon

348
00:16:53,330 --> 00:17:01,520
or other technical specific events maybe

349
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:03,020
you want to go to an IETF conference you

350
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,400
want to talk about some serious

351
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:07,530
technical discussions that's a place

352
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,089
do it right but you come here for a

353
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:11,760
different kind of thing and maybe that's

354
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:13,470
what you have to find in your area is

355
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,060
find the conference that speaks to you

356
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,589
about whatever it is that you love and

357
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,849
that's all I'm going to say on that

358
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:18,929
because there are so many it's

359
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:20,969
ridiculous

360
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:25,530
if you look online there are things like

361
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:28,110
CTF time or CFP time these sites kind of

362
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:29,850
aggregate all of the current goings on

363
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:31,679
as best as they can tell and they'll

364
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:34,350
give you a listing for all of the

365
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,870
different events when the calls for

366
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:38,730
presentation are around the world if you

367
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:40,350
want to remind to melt at the number of

368
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,540
deadlines you can put on yourself go

369
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:44,909
look at these it's amazing but anyway

370
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:46,260
there are other giant conferences I

371
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,490
think we're aware of some of them you

372
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,080
know whether you want to go to RSA

373
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:51,180
Conference you want to go to blackhat

374
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,740
big corporate events and are you really

375
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,090
working for the weekend at that point

376
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,500
cuz you got to dig in and you got to

377
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,510
walk up and shake the hand and see what

378
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,950
the big presentations about and then go

379
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,420
back to your place and then go and write

380
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:02,130
up a thing and here's my trip report and

381
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,660
this is what I learned and oh by the way

382
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:06,090
there are these great new offerings

383
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:09,930
coming from our vendors which is has its

384
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:12,449
place too because it takes all kinds it

385
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:15,870
takes all kinds whether you're wearing

386
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:18,660
your black dragon onesie or you're

387
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:20,070
wearing a suit and tie and maybe that's

388
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,180
in ties they rip away and you have a

389
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:23,280
secret life and that's your business

390
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,660
again but the point is is that you have

391
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,760
these opportunities and you should take

392
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:29,760
advantage of all of them that you can

393
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:32,640
make yourself do because if you can do

394
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,350
this you can build a path where are you

395
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,540
how many people here think they're still

396
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:38,129
drinking from the fire hose huh the fire

397
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,870
hose you don't know what you want to do

398
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:41,850
yet you are literally sitting you're

399
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,290
going I'm trying to figure it out good

400
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:47,270
how long have you been doing it raise

401
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:55,080
your hand if it's been a year two years

402
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:56,670
four years ten years okay if you are

403
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,370
still drinking from the fire hose at ten

404
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:01,980
years you probably have a lot of ideas

405
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:04,590
but maybe after that you start to narrow

406
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:08,430
because you've decided I really dig this

407
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:09,840
piece okay when you dig that piece there

408
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:11,220
are all these crazy things you can do

409
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,080
when you come to conferences right all

410
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,610
these activities and explore them

411
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,559
sometimes the best thing to do

412
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:19,250
is get up leave my talk and go and see

413
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:22,500
an activity go outside go play with the

414
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:25,080
Battletech box go and take part in the

415
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,490
CTF even if you've never done it because

416
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,678
this is the way you're going to learn

417
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,909
and if you aren't learning something new

418
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:31,860
what are you doing

419
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:33,179
are you biding your time because you

420
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:36,779
feel like you could coast through this

421
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:38,309
to retirement or are you just saying I'm

422
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:40,200
not sure or I'm dealing with something

423
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:42,269
else right now that's one of the big

424
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,679
problems so if you've made it to the end

425
00:19:42,269 --> 00:19:48,029
then you're like okay I'm in a tavern

426
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:50,159
I'm having a brew the support job do not

427
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:52,590
ignore the importance of said support

428
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:55,110
job this is a ridiculous thing but it's

429
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:57,149
true that job opens all the doors and

430
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:59,879
yes it's one of the hardest because it's

431
00:19:57,149 --> 00:20:03,989
onerous and it just drags and it's full

432
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,880
of people saying help me and you have to

433
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:07,799
talk to all of them but that could be a

434
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,029
great lesson in understanding how not to

435
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:10,740
tick somebody off

436
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:11,970
or maybe you learn that that's something

437
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:15,480
you're really good at and maybe that's

438
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:17,399
something to focus on the point is you

439
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,500
will meet the other pirates on the ship

440
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:21,539
with you and you should take this

441
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,080
opportunity to have them help you learn

442
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:23,580
the ropes

443
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,830
I'm not saying take advantage of them

444
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:28,139
yes I'm saying they're the ones who are

445
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:31,949
gonna help you get the start and beyond

446
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:34,408
that if you're here I hate to say it it

447
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:36,990
can be a dirty thing a frustrating thing

448
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:38,730
please get on social media create some

449
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:40,260
kind of handle for yourself it doesn't

450
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:42,419
have to be your actual name make it a

451
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,799
sock monkey that's up to you the point

452
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:45,419
is this is your connection to the

453
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,960
outside world when you need to ask for

454
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:48,120
help

455
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,919
because sometimes the pirates on your

456
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,080
ship do not have the answers and

457
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,809
sometimes you can learn an amazing

458
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,029
amount just with some basic observation

459
00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:59,340
about what's going on in your world and

460
00:20:57,029 --> 00:21:03,299
your world is the world of InfoSec or

461
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:05,879
hacking or computer security or nerds on

462
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:08,010
the run whatever it happens to be this

463
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:11,279
is an outlet because it turns out that

464
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:13,860
meetup is sort of a social media site

465
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:16,620
but it actually look in your city for

466
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:22,019
not just hacking look in your city and

467
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:24,000
please look up twenty six hundred of

468
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:26,190
course my brain would empty while I'm

469
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,350
standing in front of you but look up

470
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:29,690
things

471
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:37,699
look up hacking look up a cyber wait I

472
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:41,120
have to drink I said it out loud the

473
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:43,940
point is look up multiple terms several

474
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,399
times save them and then go to them

475
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,080
several of them especially the ones that

476
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,850
are new because you might meet new

477
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,350
people and that opens and widens our

478
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:54,139
circle and you don't know who you're

479
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:55,909
gonna get to talk to and this is the

480
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,410
problem you have to leave the comfort of

481
00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:00,230
the herd that's what we were talking

482
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:02,450
about before you must learn to force

483
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:04,490
yourself to say hi I was at an event

484
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:06,290
recently where a person walked up out of

485
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:08,510
the blue and reached their hand out and

486
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:11,800
said hello and they said their name and

487
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:14,990
they shook my hand and then they stopped

488
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:17,180
they had worked up enough gumption to

489
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:18,770
break out of their shell walk over and

490
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:21,260
say hi and the person I was having a

491
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:22,520
conversation with looked at them blinked

492
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:24,890
a couple of times the other person

493
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:29,840
looked at me smiled it turned and walked

494
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:32,180
off I'm like what just oh maybe this was

495
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,189
their moment they feel they're doing the

496
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,900
thing and maybe that's what it takes do

497
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:37,580
that a few times be the person who

498
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,590
awkwardly turns and walks off if that's

499
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:42,470
what it takes to get you moving because

500
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:44,360
when you connect on discord and Reddit

501
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:46,520
and Twitter and Meetup and you never

502
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,020
sleep again because there's a lot to do

503
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:52,220
if you actually connect to all of those

504
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:54,650
things you can find out what's going on

505
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:57,310
in your community around you if you can

506
00:22:54,650 --> 00:23:02,020
tune out the noise and there's a lot of

507
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:07,780
noise by the way what's the new hotness

508
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:12,560
because Twitter is old what is it

509
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:16,190
peewee me we me we what else anything

510
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:18,440
else what about Master Don is that

511
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:23,360
getting any ground what about pure list

512
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:24,830
no nothing all right so maybe you're

513
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,199
just chance to be on the show and you

514
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:29,240
know your your conference experience or

515
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,250
XP is gonna be learning the lay of the

516
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,810
land and figuring out how something was

517
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:35,090
done because you should go sit in talks

518
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:37,000
that you would not normally sit in like

519
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:39,439
this one thanks so much for being here

520
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,510
the reality is is that we all

521
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,430
need to expose well wait a minute let me

522
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:44,990
let me roll back how I was going to say

523
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:47,840
that we need to get the exposure of

524
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:49,310
multiple types of learning and one of

525
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,250
the greatest accidents that happened to

526
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:53,899
me was sitting in besides Las Vegas a

527
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:55,460
friend the same friend called me up and

528
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,680
said you need to come check this out I

529
00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:00,770
show up we move boxes and then I wind up

530
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:03,110
on a navy team and I sit in the room all

531
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:05,930
day it was actually a wedding chapel but

532
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:08,990
I said the room all day thanks iron geek

533
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:10,940
for the break and as I'm watching

534
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:13,930
presentations I would not have selected

535
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:16,520
for myself there were ridiculously i

536
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:19,520
opening I don't even know some of this

537
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:22,040
stuff could be done I've been working in

538
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:26,750
information security as a career field

539
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:29,120
for eight years I had never even

540
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:31,520
considered some of these things database

541
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,260
hacks and why would you use a cell phone

542
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,560
to trigger things remotely because it's

543
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:39,530
cool because you can because why would

544
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:41,030
you set that up harder detection okay

545
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:42,770
but these are things you need to be

546
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:45,020
thinking about and what kind of signals

547
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:47,450
are you looking for cool I didn't know

548
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,830
what that stuff was for but listen for

549
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:51,350
the punchlines and then go talk to

550
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:52,429
people I saw a talk where it turns out

551
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:55,100
they could take over the Teredo

552
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:57,530
interface of Windows and it didn't take

553
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,879
an actual physical connection that was

554
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,260
pretty cool I could get a network

555
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,930
connection on another person's box

556
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:05,060
without her I walked up and shook the

557
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:06,290
person's head that's amazing I don't

558
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,490
know if it's actually something true I

559
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:10,879
don't know if I can do the proof of

560
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:12,920
concept myself but it's cool to know

561
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,260
that it's possible but then how does

562
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:18,050
this help your career it helps build a

563
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:21,170
pattern for you that can repeat itself

564
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:24,379
time and again this can build you up

565
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:28,520
your team up your work life it can

566
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:33,080
enhance your abilities what I'm trying

567
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:35,450
to get at is get exposure figure out

568
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:37,399
who's here figure out how to bridge the

569
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,260
gap between the companies and the

570
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,750
community see if you only do this at

571
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:43,580
work well maybe that's not going to grow

572
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:46,430
your career see one of the things in the

573
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:49,070
previous presentation soulcrusher 86

574
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:51,230
mentioned that sometimes you get stuck

575
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:52,269
because your manager isn't pushing you

576
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:54,380
to grow

577
00:25:52,269 --> 00:25:56,539
but I learned from another company

578
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:59,990
experience that sometimes if they don't

579
00:25:56,539 --> 00:26:01,760
have the program in place you have to

580
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:03,860
make your own and that's why I'm telling

581
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,190
you this because you're going to develop

582
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:08,840
your own self crafted way ahead because

583
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:12,529
that's what you can crack yourself out

584
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:14,360
of the shell to do and to do that this

585
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:16,549
is going to demonstrate an interest in

586
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,320
learning that could be seen as valuable

587
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:20,480
at your current job because you're going

588
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,610
and breaking out of your own shell to

589
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,500
work on it you're taking the time to

590
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:26,149
attend things maybe take some notes meet

591
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:29,240
a new a few new people from other

592
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:30,830
companies in your city or area and bring

593
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,870
back a technique if you're on a

594
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:34,699
detection scheme maybe you get a script

595
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:36,559
or collaborate on a script outside with

596
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:38,630
someone and that helps open the door

597
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:41,570
that way at least keep your ears open

598
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:43,190
for other job opportunities or their

599
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:45,049
specific training that might be coming

600
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:47,299
because maybe you don't get the

601
00:26:45,049 --> 00:26:50,210
community calendar at your work but all

602
00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:51,350
of these things then spill out and over

603
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:53,299
hopefully so that you can bring

604
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:56,029
something and share with your co-workers

605
00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:58,129
but overall sorry that was too fast but

606
00:26:56,029 --> 00:27:00,940
overall it's about that growth

607
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:03,380
personally we have to be able to

608
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:05,389
recognize that we have to take the steps

609
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:08,360
in our own journey because no one else

610
00:27:05,389 --> 00:27:11,260
is gonna do it for us and when I left

611
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,879
school I said this is it I'm done I

612
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:16,549
don't want to do this again I left high

613
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,870
school and I'm like I'm done now it

614
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:20,779
turns out I wound up going to college

615
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:23,059
and then I said I am really done I'm so

616
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:25,010
tired of this this structured after

617
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:27,678
someone else's learning and then I

618
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:29,450
realized kind of Awesome it was to have

619
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,490
someone else tell me that there were

620
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:33,380
kind of breakdowns in time and that

621
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:36,679
that's where the beginning and endings

622
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:38,210
were see the book didn't write itself

623
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:40,039
afterwards I found that there have to be

624
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:42,230
chapter markers but I didn't know how to

625
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:46,190
make them and as I've done this over the

626
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:48,860
lasts 18 years I've discovered that you

627
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:51,500
can push and in that pushing offer to

628
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:53,629
work on something else with someone that

629
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,039
you don't know how to do offer to take

630
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,779
time and spend time with someone who

631
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,850
maybe feels they're out of an island and

632
00:27:56,779 --> 00:28:00,360
you could just offer some time and

633
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:03,059
attention and that can help

634
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:05,040
view things because things like that'll

635
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:07,500
help you skills is where I'm trying to

636
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:09,299
go because your intelligence alone won't

637
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,799
save you being the smartest person in

638
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:13,889
the room is no good if no one wants to

639
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:15,629
talk to you or maybe you lack the

640
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:19,500
ability to translate it into something

641
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:20,700
they get being smart is awesome being

642
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:27,540
able to communicate with other people

643
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:30,090
and relate that helps cool story bro you

644
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:32,040
don't know me because you know I'm

645
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:35,010
dealing with this whole thing right here

646
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:37,490
the elephant right there imposter

647
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:39,750
syndrome that's like a level boss okay

648
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:41,280
imposter syndrome is your level boss and

649
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:43,350
you have to defeat it it's like looking

650
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:45,149
in the mirror and realizing you may not

651
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:47,370
be a movie star but you are the rock

652
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:49,290
star in your story and you have to find

653
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:51,709
a way to make that work because today

654
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:53,970
maybe it's the ability to get out of bed

655
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:55,500
maybe tomorrow it's the ability to go

656
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:58,049
through that level interview you have to

657
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:00,630
deal with but if you do it you can find

658
00:28:58,049 --> 00:29:01,740
a new chapter in your story unless

659
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:05,160
you're really cool with the one you're

660
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:07,190
in and that's again something you have

661
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,390
to fight and discover for yourself

662
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:11,250
because now we're up to the second dark

663
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:13,230
specialization now is the time when

664
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,540
you're like okay I think I see this

665
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:17,730
thing I think I see where I want to go

666
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,918
and as I'm dealing with this I'm gonna

667
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:23,910
find a way to push through and only

668
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:26,640
focus on X or X and y and what is the

669
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:28,620
value there because now as you've worked

670
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,120
your way through and by the way it may

671
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,949
have taken you a couple of years we just

672
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:34,439
went over hey couple years four years

673
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:37,470
maybe 10 years as you move forward in

674
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,540
that you have to decide when you realize

675
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:41,370
you've turned to the page and now what

676
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:42,899
you're doing is you choose now you can

677
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:45,840
start to really select and work on these

678
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:48,419
things and you know there are free

679
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:52,470
resources out there but it's kind of a

680
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:53,730
thing that you have to fight for see now

681
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:55,530
you're on a mission and when you go to

682
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:56,760
an event now you're gonna start

683
00:29:55,530 --> 00:30:00,270
realizing you only want to talk to

684
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:01,890
specific people which is good take that

685
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:04,110
time go talk to the presenters who

686
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:06,780
interest you sure that's why you're here

687
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:08,820
that's what you've done but it's a

688
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:11,740
natural progression to want to build

689
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:13,780
these interests and at larger

690
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,309
more nationally driven conferences

691
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:18,730
you'll find a broader cross-section

692
00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:21,190
bigger names not necessarily just people

693
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:23,620
who are more experienced go talk to them

694
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:25,000
see what I'm saying is go to your local

695
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:27,729
meetups and use that as your practice

696
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,350
ground okay and you start to build your

697
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:31,720
understanding of yourself and of the

698
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:33,610
community around you but then force

699
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:37,540
yourself to go to another event further

700
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:39,340
away just to see how they say it just to

701
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:41,020
see if there's another way to do the

702
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:43,178
same thing that you maybe didn't think

703
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:44,800
about and that might open the door to

704
00:30:43,179 --> 00:30:47,679
something else and as you're working

705
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:50,260
through this go back and tell your

706
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,090
people what you learned a friend of mine

707
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:54,730
a mentor of mine encouraged me to make a

708
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:57,220
contra fort for myself I'm not giving

709
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:58,900
this to anybody else I take notes I sit

710
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:01,150
in talks I write these things down

711
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:03,550
because they are their spur ideas that I

712
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:05,470
might be able to get to later because

713
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:07,350
you don't know where it could come in

714
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:10,750
handy

715
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:17,290
what's the port for tell man anybody

716
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:21,640
what goes there we go the point is that

717
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:24,428
boom frustrating as it is we just okay

718
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:26,260
cool now we know part of that because we

719
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:31,679
weren't thinking about it before what's

720
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:34,629
the port for SMTP okay this is the point

721
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,460
just to force us to say okay did I did I

722
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,750
have a chance to go over something I

723
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:40,990
thought I knew and maybe I learned

724
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:43,179
something extra this is the time to find

725
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:47,140
your tribe whether your tribe dresses up

726
00:31:43,179 --> 00:31:49,360
dresses down or just wears dresses the

727
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:51,100
point is to take an opportunity to

728
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,050
figure out who your people are spend

729
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,699
time with them and go to a conference

730
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:56,800
with a buddy start out with a buddy if

731
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,630
you can a buddy system is awesome

732
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,490
whether that's your spouse your

733
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:03,970
significant other your buddy from the

734
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:05,559
Reading Club drag them with because it's

735
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:06,820
just hard to deal with this sometimes

736
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:07,928
completely alone because you'll find

737
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,639
you're sitting in your room the whole

738
00:32:07,929 --> 00:32:11,170
time and if you're at a conference that

739
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,390
does it that may mean just watching

740
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:16,320
presentations on television which you

741
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:18,490
can do at home now why be here live

742
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,668
because you have the benefit of seeing

743
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:25,850
all of these other awesome people and

744
00:32:21,669 --> 00:32:30,480
that's what this is for network

745
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:32,730
nobody seems excited by that I have

746
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,700
gotten to meet some amazing people

747
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:37,650
sometimes in a cab ride or rideshare

748
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,060
from the airport sometimes it's on the

749
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:40,260
shuttle next to it I ran into a

750
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:43,200
gentleman in the airport and now I

751
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:46,620
apologize now I misread the times and I

752
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,750
came late and I missed you sir we were

753
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:50,520
standing in the airport the connecting

754
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,980
airport and I recognized him and he

755
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:56,730
recognized me from our shirts that we

756
00:32:52,980 --> 00:33:00,690
were both nerds nerds proud nerd nerd

757
00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:03,000
forward but as you're living this life

758
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:04,320
and figuring out your career you have to

759
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,480
find people you can connect with and

760
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,189
make that work with so that's why it's

761
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,140
so important to find your tribe so that

762
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:11,910
when you go to a con and you go with a

763
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,370
buddy you start to learn the lay of the

764
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:16,800
land so you can build up from there and

765
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:18,179
now you bring these ideas back with you

766
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,490
and they can help you in your current

767
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:22,350
career you can use it to help build a

768
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:25,410
bridge to your management to other

769
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:27,149
people and when you're talking to your

770
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:30,690
co-workers after this now that you've

771
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:32,760
spoken and or rather selected things to

772
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:34,560
bring back it can actually open other

773
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,390
doors because now other teams will want

774
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:38,850
to talk to you and if they don't you

775
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:40,230
have to go find them you have to keep

776
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,419
going out you have to keep pushing

777
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:45,390
beyond the boundaries of your own walls

778
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:48,210
because you can get to a point where

779
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:50,070
this comes back to you see the more

780
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:52,080
connected you stay and the more you read

781
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:54,210
about you're going to grow how you

782
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,830
connect to other people because you'll

783
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:57,810
start to find that they connect back

784
00:33:55,830 --> 00:34:00,300
with you and now you start building a

785
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:02,280
community online which is being in a

786
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:04,020
group of people larger than yourself

787
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,310
larger than your local friend group I

788
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:09,540
have found that I have a tribe that

789
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:13,320
extends across multiple cities in this

790
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:15,120
entire InfoSec space I can go to almost

791
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,560
any city I can think of off the top of

792
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,850
my head right now which isn't a lot

793
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,949
because I haven't had that much caffeine

794
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:21,929
and I could probably call someone or at

795
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:25,109
least DM them and have someone meet me

796
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:27,060
for lunch if they're available it's kind

797
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:29,520
of awesome because there are a lot of

798
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:32,668
really good people yes I know we're

799
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,739
thinking about lunch however the end

800
00:34:32,668 --> 00:34:36,540
does not always come quickly it may not

801
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,219
be a single year or two years this may

802
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,929
take

803
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:41,178
longer you have to take that time to

804
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:43,730
look in the mirror and discover who you

805
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:46,639
are and what part of the story you're in

806
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:47,690
but we come back to you that's nice it's

807
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,970
great that you're telling me this is

808
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:51,260
something I can do for myself but you

809
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:52,250
don't know me you don't know what I've

810
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:54,590
been through you don't know what I'm

811
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:56,840
dealing with because I'm dealing with my

812
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:58,990
own impostor syndrome right so how do

813
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:03,020
you level up past that and the answer is

814
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:05,240
you have to sometimes plateau and deal

815
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:06,950
with it and push and when you don't know

816
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:10,310
how to push ask someone else to help you

817
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:11,540
it's okay to do that right to ask for

818
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:14,299
help isn't that one of the hardest

819
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:15,890
things actually oh my gosh I have

820
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:18,080
learned over the years I've tried to be

821
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:21,109
very very self sufficient so sometimes

822
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:25,160
it sucks endlessly to have to reach out

823
00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:25,940
to someone and tell them I'm stuck could

824
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,250
you help me please

825
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:29,869
and you don't know what the form that

826
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:34,190
takes necessarily but you're gonna work

827
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:35,119
on it and you'll fail a lot and that's

828
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:37,970
okay too

829
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:41,390
because guess what as long as things go

830
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:43,060
the right way and I'll say it then God

831
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:46,279
willing and the river don't rise

832
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:48,770
tomorrow is another day and you get to

833
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:51,859
try again and maybe you shouldn't have

834
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:54,530
had that pizza at 11:30 at night and you

835
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:56,930
know that's your business but we move on

836
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:58,670
now you're up to the prestige class

837
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:01,040
maybe you've gone the distance and you

838
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:02,510
have got enough of that fire hose and

839
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,490
you've gone to enough talks and you've

840
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:06,200
listened to enough people you've read

841
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:07,879
enough books you've done enough personal

842
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:12,319
work you are now the one giving the

843
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:14,599
talks this is the level this is the

844
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,400
level where you turn the tide where

845
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:18,650
you're no longer just drinking but

846
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,200
you're pouring out and as you start to

847
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:23,599
pour out you have a whole new challenge

848
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:26,359
that you weren't may be thinking about

849
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:31,040
at the time now it's time to consider

850
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:33,440
doing this public speaking and everybody

851
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,089
slinks into their chairs because who

852
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,300
wants to stand in front of a bunch of

853
00:36:35,089 --> 00:36:40,130
people and spill your guts but I got to

854
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,869
tell you grab your hairbrush and get in

855
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:45,440
front of the mirror and pretend you're

856
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:49,810
Larry the Cucumber or whatever you have

857
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,810
to do because this is a valuable skill

858
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:57,520
being able to do this can change

859
00:36:51,670 --> 00:37:00,960
everything right did oh sorry I

860
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:03,700
shortened this more time on this slide

861
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,500
when preparing the public to speak in

862
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:08,230
front of people it's a great idea to

863
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,730
practice to take the hairbrush stand in

864
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:12,339
front of the mirror and go through it if

865
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:14,829
you have the wherewithal record yourself

866
00:37:12,339 --> 00:37:16,599
and then watch it

867
00:37:14,829 --> 00:37:19,030
you ever recorded yourself and then

868
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:21,099
watched it back you see all the dancing

869
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:23,140
you do you learn that you cut it you

870
00:37:21,099 --> 00:37:25,750
know get your steps in while you're

871
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:27,578
presenting it can be dangerous because

872
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:30,730
you have to learning to watch your body

873
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:33,220
language learn to do things that or

874
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:35,349
learn not to do the things that you tend

875
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:38,348
to do so that you can convey a message

876
00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:41,190
more clearly maybe you have to practice

877
00:37:38,349 --> 00:37:43,329
your s's and your R's and your T's maybe

878
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:47,079
you need to tease your hair less

879
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:50,290
whatever the reason spend the time to

880
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:52,450
plan for being live doing a demo who

881
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:56,800
here saw Dave Kennedy's keynote

882
00:37:52,450 --> 00:38:00,939
yesterday okay what did he do one live

883
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:02,859
demo one recorded demo the one he knew

884
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:05,500
he could succeed at live in front of

885
00:38:02,859 --> 00:38:07,089
people is the one he did the other one

886
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,980
that was a little more complex he was

887
00:38:07,089 --> 00:38:11,140
wise he recorded and he only played it

888
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:13,060
back and you may need to rely on those

889
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:14,618
recordings make backup recordings and

890
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:16,569
bring them with you bring it on a thumb

891
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:18,849
drive have the whole thing ready to go

892
00:38:16,569 --> 00:38:21,160
and remember to bring your adapter I

893
00:38:18,849 --> 00:38:23,380
work on AV teams please remember to

894
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:26,020
bring your adapter have I said it enough

895
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:28,270
this thing it's a dongle please don't

896
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:30,009
forget to bring it because you can't be

897
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:33,930
guaranteed that the team where you're

898
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:37,270
going is gonna have whatever system 76

899
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:38,680
1976 machine that you bought so make

900
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:41,650
sure you have your stuff with you even

901
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:44,049
in a backed-up PDF file but you know

902
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:47,470
that's just my little set of mishegoss

903
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:51,190
right there and it's important to get

904
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:53,709
out there because when you go for it

905
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:56,619
when you get your talk accepted outside

906
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:58,930
of your parents house or your friend's

907
00:38:56,619 --> 00:39:00,180
home or your meet up it's the greatest

908
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:02,640
and most terrifying

909
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:05,098
in the world because now I have to

910
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,140
actually do the thing I have to build

911
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:08,579
the slides I have to stand up here in

912
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:10,828
front of all of you and ask you to

913
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:12,839
believe that I need this that I'm

914
00:39:10,829 --> 00:39:15,300
speaking with passion because I honestly

915
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:17,819
believe this is the reason my career has

916
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:21,089
moved forward the ability to go to

917
00:39:17,819 --> 00:39:24,829
meetups learn to talk to people hey

918
00:39:21,089 --> 00:39:27,828
how's it going hi you having a good day

919
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:31,200
awesome thank you so much for being here

920
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:33,420
this is an extraordinarily difficult

921
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:37,049
thing to do without shaking wetting

922
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:41,220
myself well not actually whatever the

923
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:45,270
point is it's not easy but you can do it

924
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:47,549
if I can do this you can do this this is

925
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:49,710
something you must learn to do to move

926
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:52,710
past the level to get to the level of

927
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:54,030
pouring out no you can actually do that

928
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:55,680
without standing up and presenting to

929
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:57,329
people but guess what it makes it a heck

930
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,240
of a lot easier and opens more doors

931
00:39:57,329 --> 00:40:02,550
because the ability to present well and

932
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:05,339
is this is an essential part of this

933
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:07,710
nutritious breakfast we have to realize

934
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:10,020
that communication is key that's why

935
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:12,750
there are literally thousands will that

936
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:14,549
an iron geek in the team of Av people

937
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:17,880
and other cons who share their videos

938
00:40:14,549 --> 00:40:19,170
routinely online because we realize the

939
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,549
importance of sharing and growing

940
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:26,400
together okay

941
00:40:20,549 --> 00:40:32,009
now how does this provide value to your

942
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:33,299
management endlessly your management

943
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:34,920
will adore you they will give you new

944
00:40:33,299 --> 00:40:36,900
opportunities they will find literally

945
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:39,510
any excuse to put you up in front of

946
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:41,760
other people because now they don't have

947
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:43,349
to do it and it also demonstrates that

948
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,569
they have people on their team who have

949
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:45,960
skills because if you know what you're

950
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:47,609
saying

951
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,559
they want to share that because it looks

952
00:40:47,609 --> 00:40:52,410
good for them looks good for the team

953
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:54,180
it's valuable not only that they might

954
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:56,040
send you out to a conference and now you

955
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:58,379
get to go on someone else has done and

956
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:00,450
enjoy that but it's not just that

957
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:02,160
because when you go and you network you

958
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:04,259
get to build connections with other

959
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,589
people bring that back and grow further

960
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:08,440
and not just

961
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:11,140
for them but for yourself see it's

962
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:13,630
terrific to be fronted by a company I've

963
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:15,970
seen several people in the last couple

964
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:18,370
of days who have at the bottom of their

965
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:19,750
slide deck they have a discrete logo and

966
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:21,910
maybe they're sponsoring and that's

967
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:24,730
awesome because those companies are

968
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:26,560
willing to help provide a way for us to

969
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:30,070
come out and do this to share with each

970
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:32,380
other to grow but when you're doing this

971
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:34,410
thing and trying to speak in public it

972
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:36,850
will help with your own self confidence

973
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:39,339
because once you've stood up in front of

974
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:41,799
people and tried to strut a little bit

975
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:44,650
and do a thing and I look terrible doing

976
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:49,000
that we have to understand that that's

977
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:52,800
part of growth and giving back and

978
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:56,770
giving back comes in many forms right

979
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:59,050
presenting in the conference now levels

980
00:41:56,770 --> 00:42:01,509
you up in a different way you are now

981
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:04,990
mixing with other presenters other

982
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:07,060
people who have made it this far what do

983
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:10,720
they have that you don't have not a

984
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:12,520
thing except the experience of standing

985
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,529
on a stage and giving the presentations

986
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:16,450
knowing what it takes to gather together

987
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:18,400
see you're going to be able to catch all

988
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,839
the mistakes that I've made and you'll

989
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,880
be able to tell them to me if you so

990
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:23,920
desire or you'll post about it on

991
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:26,940
Twitter saying that guy didn't talk

992
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:31,480
about this or he doesn't understand that

993
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:33,970
okay stand up here and do that corrected

994
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:37,000
you better come up here and do better

995
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:38,919
come here and tell everybody what it

996
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,680
takes to do better and that's perfectly

997
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:44,740
fine because you should because it's

998
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:46,540
better for you so cool story bro you

999
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:48,490
don't know what I'm going through this

1000
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:49,960
is a different thing you're asking all

1001
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:51,399
this stuff and you don't know a thing

1002
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,290
about what I've had to deal with to get

1003
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,530
here I am loaded with impostor syndrome

1004
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:59,710
like a pustule ready to burst and so is

1005
00:42:56,530 --> 00:43:01,510
everyone else well okay I don't know

1006
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:04,960
about the bursting part that'd be kind

1007
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:08,770
of gross but sometimes that's funny too

1008
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:12,820
even if it should be for Thark your turn

1009
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:14,740
as GM now you've turned around and you

1010
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:16,170
said I'm going to move beyond just

1011
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:17,729
presenting

1012
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:20,549
I'm going to try to give back by either

1013
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:22,589
starting a meet-up or I'm going to put

1014
00:43:20,549 --> 00:43:25,079
on an event or I'm going to coordinate

1015
00:43:22,589 --> 00:43:27,630
something at work how am I gonna do that

1016
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:32,160
oh my gosh what's going to happen to me

1017
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:34,500
inside from a lot of stress now you're

1018
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:37,980
trying to put on a new mission I want

1019
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:39,569
other people to help each other because

1020
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:42,359
maybe I don't have the skillset you have

1021
00:43:39,569 --> 00:43:45,650
and I know I don't I'm not an incident

1022
00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:48,450
responder I am NOT a red teamer I

1023
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:49,920
couldn't well the only box I broke was

1024
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:52,500
the one that got shipped to me from a

1025
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,809
major retailer and that took a box

1026
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:57,089
cutter so you know not really a more

1027
00:43:54,809 --> 00:43:59,579
than brute force not something I'm gonna

1028
00:43:57,089 --> 00:44:01,890
brag about so what can I share with you

1029
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:04,220
I can share with you that if I can build

1030
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:07,680
an event if you build it they will come

1031
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:11,700
maybe I helped coordinate a local

1032
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:14,669
'besides in San Antonio and this is now

1033
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:15,750
my 5th year going into it doing it and I

1034
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:17,819
have to say it's one of the most

1035
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:20,369
rewarding things I have been able to do

1036
00:44:17,819 --> 00:44:22,950
in this industry because seeing other

1037
00:44:20,369 --> 00:44:24,750
people mingling having an awesome time

1038
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:27,359
learning from each other sharing what

1039
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:30,390
they know and networking but not like

1040
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:31,770
traditional hello and they getting they

1041
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:33,868
just start talking to each other and

1042
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:36,930
they get to break bread together and see

1043
00:44:33,869 --> 00:44:42,299
people connect oh my gosh it's like a

1044
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:43,618
drug and it's worth it because it helps

1045
00:44:42,299 --> 00:44:46,380
other people get where they're going

1046
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:49,230
because even if I can't finish my story

1047
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:52,859
even if I can't find a way to get to

1048
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:55,109
that I'm pouring out I'm sharing all the

1049
00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:57,960
cool technical things I have an

1050
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:59,670
opportunity and I'm taking it someone

1051
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,010
walked up to me and said you've been

1052
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:04,380
helping me with you've been helping me

1053
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:10,140
with this for three years it's your turn

1054
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:11,700
are you gonna do it man I froze have you

1055
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:14,220
ever had someone walk up and offer you

1056
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:17,419
something and like here here notice take

1057
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:22,169
it take it and you knew that it would be

1058
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:23,910
really scary what goes into all that be

1059
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:25,740
thankful for willing partners who are

1060
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:27,600
like we see you sinking him we don't

1061
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:29,560
want you to drown

1062
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:32,710
because that's what happened because I

1063
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:35,290
ran into some tough tough challenges and

1064
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:37,180
it all goes into another story but I'm

1065
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:39,370
going to tell you that it's ridiculous

1066
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:41,290
to realize that all these new challenges

1067
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:43,089
will make you realize that you never

1068
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:47,020
knew that table coverings were expensive

1069
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:49,840
and what the heck is oxygen free butter

1070
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:51,730
anyway I have no idea but it's one of

1071
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:54,040
those weird things you find out all new

1072
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:56,110
challenges and that's fine you're going

1073
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:58,000
to learn the details of whatever it is

1074
00:45:56,110 --> 00:46:03,790
you're chasing and when you're trying to

1075
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:06,010
do this you're gonna need help lots of

1076
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:08,350
help so if you're going to go out there

1077
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:09,700
and put on your own events you're going

1078
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:11,710
to go on and just try to help other

1079
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:14,140
people find each other realize that

1080
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:16,000
you're not alone a-- even then because

1081
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:19,420
you put yourself into another pool of

1082
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,670
people to mix you're now seeing what

1083
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:23,710
they've gone through you get an inkling

1084
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:27,610
of what it's like to run a dirt con or a

1085
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:30,340
derby con or a shmoocon there are these

1086
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:32,650
huge events all over the world you can

1087
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:35,830
be part of Def Con China and go

1088
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:39,070
volunteer in fact I recommend rampant

1089
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:42,400
volunteerism rampant volunteerism

1090
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:44,620
volunteer for everything as long as your

1091
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,690
timeline supports it and you can afford

1092
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:48,430
the hotel stay or whatever it is you're

1093
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:50,230
doing and you can see some amazing

1094
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:52,960
conferences because conferences cost a

1095
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:54,640
lot of money sometimes a conference like

1096
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:58,470
the VIP level is ridiculously expensive

1097
00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:01,060
but if you volunteer put in your time in

1098
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:03,549
your local space in your local area

1099
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:05,140
volunteer at the local meetup go

1100
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:06,700
volunteer at the 'besides there's

1101
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:10,750
probably one in your city or one year

1102
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:14,169
buy drive to it get a buddy go there the

1103
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:17,590
b-sides is going to be free so maybe

1104
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:20,170
fifty bucks pretty affordable right well

1105
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:22,540
what about gas what about food what

1106
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:26,680
about great do that instead of trying to

1107
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:30,640
go to giant Kahn that costs 300 bucks

1108
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:32,890
Plus driving plus sandwiches or whatever

1109
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,720
top ramen noodle thing you have to live

1110
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:37,450
on in order to afford to go to giant

1111
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,470
Kahn so there are cons that are a little

1112
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:42,080
closer that maybe offer a DC

1113
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:43,520
value as well but from those you can

1114
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:45,500
find other people crazy enough to

1115
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,820
support you in your vision if you're at

1116
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:50,830
this level and you want to put something

1117
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:53,359
else on see it happen all the time now

1118
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:55,819
because I was crazy enough to step

1119
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:57,680
forward and accept the challenge that

1120
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:59,900
was offered to me really oh cool you're

1121
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:02,500
handing me this what do I do it hello

1122
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:04,900
wait where are you going you're moving

1123
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:10,840
what am I supposed to do now

1124
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:10,840
panic get help that's funny

1125
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:29,789
you're talking like we all just wake up

1126
00:48:28,019 --> 00:48:31,499
in the morning and go do this thing

1127
00:48:29,789 --> 00:48:33,749
because you don't know I'm trying to

1128
00:48:31,499 --> 00:48:35,160
feed a family and I'm trying to figure

1129
00:48:33,749 --> 00:48:37,379
out my education and I've got

1130
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:41,788
debilitating fill-in-the-blank and it

1131
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:43,489
sucks yes it does and thank you for

1132
00:48:41,789 --> 00:48:46,549
being willing to listen to that because

1133
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:51,150
we are all filled with impostor syndrome

1134
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:52,799
we're all stuck but beware the beast of

1135
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:56,400
burnout because once you push that hard

1136
00:48:52,799 --> 00:49:00,390
you're kind of in trouble you're so done

1137
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:03,299
you're so tired of n plus one and things

1138
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:06,420
such well fine go back to the beginning

1139
00:49:03,299 --> 00:49:09,779
and take a break but look for the reboot

1140
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:11,190
look for the thing that helps you what

1141
00:49:09,779 --> 00:49:12,839
did you like about it in the first place

1142
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:15,450
if it was incident response did you

1143
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:18,058
really enjoy digging into the logs and

1144
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:19,799
discovering what had happened maybe if

1145
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:21,900
you're a red teamer you just like

1146
00:49:19,799 --> 00:49:24,450
breaking things in half like pretzels

1147
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:26,220
who knows the point is to go back to

1148
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:28,799
your own beginning and figure out what

1149
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:30,029
it is because the beasts of burnout will

1150
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,890
tear you apart

1151
00:49:30,029 --> 00:49:33,930
and leave you feeling dejected not

1152
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:35,940
wanting to do anything like there's no

1153
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:37,589
forward momentum at all and you have to

1154
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:39,539
defeat it you have to find someone else

1155
00:49:37,589 --> 00:49:41,219
who's going to reinvigorate you or

1156
00:49:39,539 --> 00:49:44,549
you're going to have to just take a

1157
00:49:41,219 --> 00:49:48,269
break or change career or direction

1158
00:49:44,549 --> 00:49:49,680
entirely but you may be surprised at the

1159
00:49:48,269 --> 00:49:51,238
support you find when you reach out and

1160
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,440
say this sucks and I'm going through

1161
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:54,390
something and I need some help and

1162
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:56,999
that's the hardest thing is to ask for

1163
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:58,319
that help please realize there are tons

1164
00:49:56,999 --> 00:50:00,808
of people on Twitter and social media

1165
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:03,630
who are going through it too and a lot

1166
00:50:00,809 --> 00:50:08,039
of folks will come surprisingly well out

1167
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:10,049
of the woodwork if you just ask so now

1168
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:12,150
that if the adventure continues you go

1169
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:13,950
on to the chapter that's uncharted sea

1170
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:16,680
there isn't just at the end of that

1171
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:19,468
little graph from earlier there isn't

1172
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:22,259
just a sunset to ride off into that's

1173
00:50:19,469 --> 00:50:25,259
called the next chapter and I don't know

1174
00:50:22,259 --> 00:50:28,109
what it is and you should be excited to

1175
00:50:25,259 --> 00:50:29,729
find it because once you're there all

1176
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:31,529
new things can happen like right now

1177
00:50:29,729 --> 00:50:33,569
I've been offered an opportunity through

1178
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:35,640
my work they've invited me to join a

1179
00:50:33,569 --> 00:50:39,259
hack the box team I have never done

1180
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:41,660
anything like this I've never done a CT

1181
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:43,040
and I'm excited to figure out what it

1182
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:46,399
takes to do one and sit in the room with

1183
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,690
blinky lights and moons music actually

1184
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,940
doing something I've always walked by

1185
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:51,740
and seen people intensely dig into their

1186
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:53,869
screens and keyboards not knowing what

1187
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:56,540
it is they're actually up to so for the

1188
00:50:53,869 --> 00:50:59,720
very first time ever I actually have

1189
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:02,000
enumerated a box with nmap and it's the

1190
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:04,069
most exciting thing and it's brand new

1191
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,050
to me and I'm gonna go down that road

1192
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:08,330
and see where it takes me because that's

1193
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:11,000
the next adventure because we need each

1194
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:13,009
other you have to find someone willing

1195
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,119
to listen I have a couple of good

1196
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:15,800
friends who have been willing to listen

1197
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:19,880
to my ideas and I've listened to theirs

1198
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:21,740
and we have exchanged ideas and concepts

1199
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:23,480
about talks and the ways to build those

1200
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:25,700
talks and the directions to take them in

1201
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:27,980
just because we share ideas with each

1202
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:30,169
other doesn't mean that either person is

1203
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:31,400
going to accept all of the advice but

1204
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:33,380
it's really really cool that have a

1205
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:35,240
sounding board it's amazing to have

1206
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:38,090
someone to share this with who isn't

1207
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:40,069
just your show yourself because honest

1208
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:41,690
feedback really will make things better

1209
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:44,630
so be willing to listen when they like

1210
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:45,380
me don't say it's that way don't even

1211
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:48,590
talk about that

1212
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:49,850
that's okay which is easy for me to say

1213
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:52,010
right because I'm standing up here in

1214
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:54,020
front of all of you but I tell you the

1215
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:57,320
truth that if the underperforming kid

1216
00:51:54,020 --> 00:52:00,680
who hid in the a/v room back in seventh

1217
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:02,660
grade can stand up here and do this and

1218
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:05,960
find their way out of their shell it is

1219
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:08,899
possible it is so possible and so

1220
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:11,150
worthwhile to take the steps to move

1221
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:13,490
beyond it we put on a heck of a 'besides

1222
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:16,310
in San Antonio we have now reached over

1223
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:19,459
620 people at our little event then

1224
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:23,270
we're on track this year 2020 that is

1225
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:27,730
for us to get around 800 or so which to

1226
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:30,580
me is amazing because we started it 200

1227
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:34,850
125 I don't know

1228
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:37,540
definitely isn't as big as this and you

1229
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:42,560
know what it's awesome to see growth

1230
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:45,130
cool story bro you don't know me but we

1231
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:48,230
could maybe we should chat afterwards

1232
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:49,740
happy to talk you've seen that for the

1233
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:52,900
last hour

1234
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:55,299
but this imposter syndrome we each have

1235
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:58,030
to fight it in our own way don't be

1236
00:52:55,299 --> 00:53:02,440
afraid of it as much as be aware of it

1237
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:06,490
and when it rears its head ask yourself

1238
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:09,789
ask for help write it down what is it

1239
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:12,459
that is in particular biting you in the

1240
00:53:09,789 --> 00:53:14,380
tail today put it on paper in front of

1241
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:16,270
you so you can see it because once you

1242
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:20,289
can see it maybe you can write up a plan

1243
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:23,140
to defeat it you write up a note with a

1244
00:53:20,289 --> 00:53:26,410
goal and sorry write up a note put a

1245
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:29,078
date on it that becomes a goal you look

1246
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:31,180
at a goal you break it down you now have

1247
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:35,829
a plan or the sketch to defeat it and

1248
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:39,118
you can work on your own level boss we

1249
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:39,119
are building a community together
