1
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:19,680
all right are we ready okay well welcome

2
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:21,330
to the last talk before the last talk so

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,369
today I just want to talk a little bit

4
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:28,740
about aviation security in particular

5
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:30,240
wanted to talk about how some of the

6
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,879
different attacks that people have

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:38,550
talked about as it comes to aircraft

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:44,010
affect you know the big planes airliners

9
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:46,589
heads etc differently from how they

10
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,610
might affect little airplanes little

11
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:52,579
Cessna and such so I'm dr. Phil Palestra

12
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:58,219
from Bloomsburg University of

13
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:58,219
Pennsylvania anyone else from Bloomsburg

14
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:05,040
so you know why this talk in the last

15
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:07,350
few years has been a lot of bold claims

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,409
people have made about you know all I

17
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:13,350
can have you know I'm gonna hack your

18
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:15,180
triple 7 with my smartphone or maybe my

19
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:19,140
Arduino or something you know it's

20
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:23,880
something crazy so of course all those

21
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:25,860
bold claims get lots of press and you

22
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,560
know that's that's one reason another

23
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,509
reason if you look at general aviation

24
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,360
aircraft you know your little Cessna

25
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:35,579
sandpipers and such things are very

26
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,759
different from the world of airliners

27
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:40,860
and a lot of people don't really talk

28
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:45,270
about you know the difference is between

29
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:48,930
these two sets of aircraft so some of

30
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,880
you might know me you might know me as

31
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:55,710
kind of a hardware hacking guy maybe

32
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,670
author forensics guy also a little bit

33
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,309
of an aviator

34
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,770
I have 17 aviation ratings all of them

35
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:05,250
are current you know I'm a commercial

36
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:07,488
pilot flight instructor airplane

37
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,560
mechanic I have an inspection

38
00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:14,099
authorization for aircraft I'm an

39
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:18,569
avionics tech I'm a licensed skydiver

40
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:21,298
got em in coach I have a few thousand

41
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:25,099
hours of flight time I've built aircraft

42
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:27,840
before and I've actually worked on the

43
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:30,480
development of some of the avionics that

44
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,980
are sort of pertinent to the airliner

45
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,750
discussions as well so what are we going

46
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,640
to talk about today gonna talk a little

47
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,370
bit about some of the common aircraft

48
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,578
systems and how do they work you might

49
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:46,349
have heard people talk about ATSB they

50
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:48,629
don't talk about it so much

51
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:52,679
but something that's also relevant it's

52
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:56,069
called a TS a I hear people talk about

53
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,620
things like a cars and transponders and

54
00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:00,298
collision avoidance and course GPS you

55
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,480
probably know about GPS because you got

56
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:04,680
on your phone now auto pilots and things

57
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:10,470
like that you know how does all this

58
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:13,620
stuff connected together alright so what

59
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:17,150
are some commonly discussed attacks out

60
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:22,290
there of course you know the one that's

61
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:24,930
fit for your average movie is I'm gonna

62
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:27,388
get through the you know in-flight

63
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,609
entertainment system and I'm gonna

64
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:32,130
completely take over this aircraft and

65
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:35,609
things like that other people talked

66
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:37,680
about things like hacking a dsb you know

67
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:41,669
sending out false signals in that system

68
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,950
or maybe even hacking engine systems and

69
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:48,209
eight cars alright so we're gonna talk a

70
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:50,339
little bit about some of these also I

71
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:50,880
recently discovered attack myself last

72
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,959
month

73
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:58,709
and I've dubbed this the spear smashing

74
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:02,669
attack so last month I actually went to

75
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:07,010
a conference in Iowa and you know I got

76
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:11,310
to the baggage claim and this was my bag

77
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:15,660
I'm like wow but I feel like it was

78
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:17,459
targeted by the airlines and yeah they

79
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:20,940
just matched the living crap out of my

80
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:25,530
bag and it was lots of fun dealing with

81
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:27,100
that okay so I said I want to talk a

82
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:31,419
little bit about different kind

83
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:35,260
of aircraft so here is a old general

84
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:40,300
aviation aircraft this I want to say is

85
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:45,099
like a 1956 era cessna here

86
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:52,180
now how do you think you could hack this

87
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:54,940
airplane good luck all right I am in a

88
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,760
flying club and we have a couple of

89
00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:01,060
airplanes and our trainer airplane is

90
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:05,340
actually 1960 1960s us that's very

91
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:08,830
similar to the sky and it's all analog

92
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:11,140
electronics there there's no digital

93
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:14,800
electronics there's no GPS

94
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:16,360
there's no autopilot all the radios are

95
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,800
kind of like the radios in this picture

96
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:22,710
they're mechanically tuned so the

97
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,260
ability to hack that airplane is

98
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:28,150
significantly reduced you might see

99
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:35,110
something like this can anyone identify

100
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:38,530
this aircraft let's see well this is a

101
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:40,900
Cirrus sr22 yeah yes you just didn't

102
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,299
want to speak up but you knew you knew

103
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:46,060
what it was

104
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:48,730
so this is a serious aircraft I just

105
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:51,610
picked this one there are other aircraft

106
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:54,250
have very similar avionics systems what

107
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:57,010
we call glass cockpit airplane this is

108
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:59,920
the g1000 system from Garmin right

109
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:01,900
really nice stuff what do you think is

110
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:07,720
the attack surface a little bit larger

111
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:09,429
on this aircraft yeah yeah there's a

112
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,000
little bit more electronics a little bit

113
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:16,720
more software going on here okay and

114
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,090
what about this anyone identify this

115
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:34,840
cockpit you didn't know this is gonna be

116
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:39,549
cockpit trivia you're closer this is an

117
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:42,310
Embraer 145 regional jet but

118
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:44,860
some of the regional jets I mean this is

119
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:47,410
stopped not as true as it used to be but

120
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,900
you know sometimes you look like say 10

121
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:52,990
years ago at a regional jet cockpit and

122
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,378
they look nicer than the big jet cockpit

123
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:57,550
right because they were still sort of

124
00:06:55,379 --> 00:07:08,020
transitioning from that analog phase

125
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:10,870
into the glass phase all right so just a

126
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:13,359
couple of things you can't override

127
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,960
pilots they're kind of the last line of

128
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,479
defense

129
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,330
you can social engineering but you know

130
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,030
that's another story

131
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:25,180
also even the glass cockpit aircraft

132
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:29,198
they do have unhackable mechanical

133
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:32,370
backup instruments now you know I was

134
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,509
talking to some folks earlier this week

135
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:37,090
here and we were talking about different

136
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:38,560
kinds of airplanes and one of the things

137
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:42,280
we were talking about with the Cirrus

138
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,610
the Cirrus pilots get a bad rap and it's

139
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:48,008
probably justified honestly but there's

140
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:50,500
so much automate automation in some of

141
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:52,870
the planes like the Cirrus that if the

142
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,610
automation goes wrong people are like I

143
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,889
don't know what to do all right I don't

144
00:07:54,610 --> 00:08:02,469
know how to fly this plane and it's kind

145
00:07:56,889 --> 00:08:04,810
of bad so you can't make people look at

146
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:08,529
those mechanical instruments but they're

147
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:12,430
pretty hard to hack right in some cases

148
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:15,550
you can affect the autopilot operation

149
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:18,699
however if a pilot notices they will

150
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:21,490
disconnect the autopilot also all auto

151
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:24,279
pilots have to be able to be overridden

152
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:27,419
physically all right so if you're having

153
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:31,419
an airliner and you have a 90 pound

154
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:35,380
supermodel and you know her night job is

155
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:39,370
flying a big Boeing she has to be able

156
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:41,409
to override the control forces on that

157
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:44,100
aircraft and that's that's the rule

158
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:48,069
otherwise you can't get it certified

159
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:51,370
okay so talking a little bit about some

160
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,930
of the bigger airplane some of the big

161
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:56,050
airplanes they have really

162
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:59,260
ticketed systems for the avionics to

163
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:01,540
talk to each other and the older planes

164
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:06,399
the big ones use something called ARINC

165
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:10,120
429 and that's just a standard for

166
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:13,600
talking between different components now

167
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:17,020
newer aircraft tend to use a modified

168
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:23,620
version of Ethernet that is called ARINC

169
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:25,209
664 or AF DX right so ARINC is just a

170
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,279
set of standards you know kinda like you

171
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:29,380
have ISO standards and I Triple E

172
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:34,050
standards well this is for avionics

173
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:37,990
people and you know why did they do that

174
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:40,420
basically they wanted to use cots common

175
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:43,330
off-the-shelf components they're like

176
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:46,630
hey this is really hurting us it's hard

177
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:49,330
to get all this proprietary stuff

178
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:52,839
together and to try to test these things

179
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:56,110
so let's let's use Ethernet people

180
00:09:52,839 --> 00:10:00,370
understand Ethernet now one thing you

181
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:01,540
have to understand about this erring 64

182
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:05,320
or FDX

183
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:09,550
is it's not the same Ethernet that you

184
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:11,500
use right it's like saying I have a

185
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:14,079
video cassette tape and I know some of

186
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:16,089
you are like what's that you know okay

187
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,750
it's this thing we used to have before

188
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:21,640
everyone had DVDs which is you know what

189
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,470
we had before we everybody had blu-ray

190
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:27,370
which is what we had before everyone had

191
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:30,100
4k blu-ray but anyway you know if you go

192
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:33,279
back a long ways some people actually

193
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:36,400
use this thing called Betamax so it was

194
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:39,579
a video tape but it wasn't a VHS tape so

195
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,920
it wasn't exactly the same thing other

196
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:45,040
things to know about this protocol it's

197
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,860
never Wireless there are reasons why

198
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,680
they will run miles and miles of wire

199
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:53,920
and a big airplane it's because it's

200
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:56,589
reliable and there is some security in

201
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,709
place it's not directly connected to

202
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:05,170
things like entertainment systems an

203
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:06,369
in-flight Wi-Fi so this was originally

204
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:11,800
developed

205
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:15,339
in the triple7 and as i said let you use

206
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:19,870
common off-the-shelf stuff not the same

207
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:22,839
as your father's Ethernet it uses

208
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:26,319
redundant channels and it assigns tie

209
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:28,540
slices to make things deterministic now

210
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:31,449
if you learn anything in aviation you'll

211
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:33,819
learn that aviation is all about

212
00:11:31,449 --> 00:11:37,269
redundancy and safety you know people

213
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:40,139
are like hey why are you using 1930s

214
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:43,600
technology in the engine in your Cessna

215
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:47,350
even your cirrus same thing and the

216
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,749
answer is because it works right that's

217
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:53,439
that's why we use it we prioritize that

218
00:11:49,749 --> 00:11:56,139
over efficiency any day it's like yeah

219
00:11:53,439 --> 00:11:58,540
this would be more efficient and all

220
00:11:56,139 --> 00:12:01,149
this but this works reliably

221
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:03,189
so we're gonna go with what works and

222
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:06,490
works all the time and so we have

223
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:09,370
redundant channels the other thing that

224
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:12,040
we have to do is Ethernet it's not

225
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:14,199
deterministic I can't set out of the

226
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:18,790
pocket and then know when I'll get a

227
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:22,508
response so instead what we do with this

228
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:25,240
protocol is we time slice things so you

229
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:26,620
get your time slice you know that your

230
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,720
packet gets out there won't be a

231
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,699
collision and you know that you'll get a

232
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,999
response within a certain amount of time

233
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:35,469
so it's a deterministic system and the

234
00:12:33,999 --> 00:12:39,160
way that it works is that it uses

235
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:41,980
virtual ways so a virtual link is just a

236
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:44,620
virtual pipe that connects two processes

237
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:47,290
and there's one and only one sender and

238
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:50,800
there can be one or more receivers in

239
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:54,399
the system and we use something called a

240
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:58,779
bag a bandwidth allocation gap and that

241
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:00,970
determines the time slice size and then

242
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:03,999
we have jitter right and it's related

243
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:08,589
you know what's the maximum latency that

244
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:10,959
you can have when we look at it

245
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:14,610
physically again there's two lengths

246
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:17,439
there's an A Channel and a B Channel and

247
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:19,720
the way that it works they both send out

248
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:24,160
packets whoever packet

249
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:25,629
arrived first they win right so one

250
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,269
thing if you were trying to hack into

251
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:31,300
the system and you're like oh well I'll

252
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:34,569
just you know connect a garden-variety

253
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:36,878
Ethernet adapter to this system somehow

254
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:40,180
and send out packets if you're only

255
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:42,160
connected to one channel it might work

256
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:44,199
for a little while but it's gonna alert

257
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,219
right it's gonna alert in the cockpit

258
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:47,050
because they're gonna be like hey

259
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,060
there's a wire broken you need to send

260
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,709
this sucker to maintenance right and

261
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:55,719
you're gonna know that something's going

262
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:57,699
on this is just a little part of a

263
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,730
schematic showing you how some of these

264
00:13:57,699 --> 00:14:03,370
things are connected if you see the FMS

265
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:05,970
box that's the big box over on the right

266
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:09,790
that's the flight management system or

267
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:11,350
autopilot if you will and here's

268
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:14,649
different things that it's connected to

269
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:19,870
you know like the joystick to guide the

270
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:23,620
aircraft and various other things when

271
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:26,800
you look at these schematics in more

272
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:28,870
detail you'll see you know there's

273
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,229
there's some paths they're a little bit

274
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:36,089
more important than others now one thing

275
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:40,300
I should say is this is a schematic

276
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:43,149
right as a schematic it's not going to

277
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:46,839
show you certain components and one of

278
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:49,420
those components is a networking switch

279
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:53,050
right so if you look at Amy onyx

280
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:55,059
switches avionics which is every single

281
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:58,508
connection in there has to be programmed

282
00:14:55,059 --> 00:15:01,089
right so I have a connection from port

283
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:04,540
one that maybe has some sort of a sensor

284
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:07,170
on it and port two that let's say it's

285
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:10,930
connected to my flight computer right

286
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:14,500
that connection is program so that port

287
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:18,309
2 can only receive from a certain number

288
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:20,620
of ports and port 2 can only transmit to

289
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:23,740
another set of ports all right so you

290
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:28,300
have a lot of restrictions so every

291
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:31,269
single connection in that switch has to

292
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:33,949
be explicitly programmed right it's not

293
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:36,200
like oh I can just start sending

294
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:39,680
fake packets around this avionics

295
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,120
Network and things will happen well it's

296
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,689
it's a lot more complicated than that

297
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:47,390
okay okay real quick entertainment

298
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:50,480
systems so you got an entertainment

299
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:52,720
system and what's that's common

300
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,430
component in these entertainment systems

301
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,990
you want the little screens like here's

302
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,579
the map of your flight here's where

303
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:00,170
you're at here's long that's gonna take

304
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:02,480
here's how fast you're going all that

305
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:04,699
other stuff right so we're you're gonna

306
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,370
get that well there's a couple places

307
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:11,620
you can get that information one of them

308
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:14,270
is directly from the GPS or the FMS and

309
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:16,400
if you're getting that information that

310
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:19,990
way it's connected through something

311
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:22,850
called a net a network extension device

312
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:25,970
important to realize this stuff is never

313
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:29,420
like connected into that ARINC bus or

314
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:32,600
anything like that right also never

315
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:36,949
wireless not your father's tcp/ip all

316
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:39,620
right so you know here's just one

317
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:42,980
diagram for a system I won't tell you

318
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:45,350
which aircraft this is but just showing

319
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:47,450
some of the interconnections weave

320
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:52,160
between the in-flight entertainment and

321
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:54,170
some other systems all right we were

322
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,180
briefly there was some confusion a lot

323
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:59,510
of people out there were confused with

324
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:02,959
triple7 because of something that the

325
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:05,209
FAA said Boeing asked them for special

326
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,770
condition to allow the passenger

327
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:10,070
information network to be connected to

328
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:12,920
other networks and they granted them

329
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:18,109
this condition as long as they used a

330
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:20,949
net right so you know one of the things

331
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:24,198
they said is that there had to be

332
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:26,839
isolation from or airplane electronics

333
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:29,120
systems security protections against bad

334
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:35,060
things all right I'm not gonna read the

335
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:38,060
whole slide but so what is this Ned

336
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:40,010
alright they're like I've never knew a

337
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:45,379
guy named that alright well now you did

338
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:47,750
okay it's basically a gateway now

339
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:51,140
remember a gateway

340
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:54,710
is often a translator right it goes from

341
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:59,330
this protocol to another protocol in the

342
00:17:54,710 --> 00:18:03,710
case of a ned on your airliner it's

343
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:06,379
going to go between the airing protocol

344
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:09,080
whatever it is your garden-variety

345
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:12,590
tcp/ip that the in-flight entertainment

346
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:14,149
system is going to use so they're not

347
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:19,070
talking the same language it's a

348
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:22,760
translator and like most gateways every

349
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:25,700
pas has to be programmed right I can't

350
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:28,190
just say hey there's a connection right

351
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:31,400
in you know in security we have this

352
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:33,830
kind of general rule if a wire connects

353
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,230
two things there's always the potential

354
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:39,169
for the hacking right would you guys

355
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:41,330
remember that if you're connected to

356
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,990
something there's a potential that you

357
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,820
could hack it

358
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:46,780
I'm not going to say it's impossible

359
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:50,240
here I'm just saying that in this case

360
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:53,600
you're talking different languages so

361
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:57,050
it's a much higher barrier in order to

362
00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:00,590
try to do some sort of attack and here's

363
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:02,840
the other issue all right so the Gateway

364
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:05,600
has to be programmed so the Gateway is

365
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:10,220
not normally gonna receive any inputs at

366
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:15,770
all from the cabin right it just outputs

367
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:17,240
to the cabin and the switches those

368
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:19,910
avionics switches I was talking about

369
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:22,580
they're not programmed to receive inputs

370
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:25,870
either for those ports that connect out

371
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:28,250
to the NED so there's multiple barriers

372
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:29,840
that you're gonna have to overcome if

373
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:35,030
you're somehow gonna try to go from

374
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:38,090
there into the cockpit here's a picture

375
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:40,730
of one net I just stole it off of the

376
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:42,470
manufacturer site you know manufacturers

377
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,760
are great right they'll tell you all

378
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:47,300
about their products because they want

379
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,710
you to buy them earlier there was a talk

380
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,720
and they were talking about you know

381
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:52,160
these different venues and how do you

382
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,780
get all the information of the venue's

383
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,010
you go to their their website and

384
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:56,780
they're like hey here's all of our

385
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:58,760
security and all of our wonderful things

386
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:01,870
that we do we're trying to make your

387
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,870
life easy by yourself

388
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:09,340
all right another thing I wanted to talk

389
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:12,400
about briefly few years back it's about

390
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:15,959
five years ago now there was this

391
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:19,690
Malaysian flight 370 who remembers this

392
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:21,789
right so this plane disappears alright

393
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:24,789
and what did a couple people come out

394
00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:29,908
and say immediately it was cyber

395
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:33,100
hijacked must have been that really

396
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:35,549
that's kind of a leap it's not the is it

397
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:39,428
the first aircraft that ever disappeared

398
00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:41,620
no right but a lot of people went right

399
00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:43,659
to that and then of course there's the

400
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,969
big conspiracy theories you guys always

401
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:48,460
have conspiracy theories right what

402
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:54,549
would the world be without them you know

403
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:56,440
but and one of the things that a lot of

404
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:58,780
the conspiracy theory types actually

405
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:01,870
talked about they said hey you know

406
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:03,730
there was these signals that came you

407
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:08,260
know after it went off radar I'll talk

408
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:11,260
about that and a little bit okay but so

409
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:13,960
again if if you're thinking that

410
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,730
somebody in the aircraft may be hacked

411
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,799
in through the in-flight wireless and

412
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:20,020
did all these other things and somehow

413
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:23,668
it disappeared hmm I'm not saying

414
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:26,500
impossible I'm just saying pretty hard

415
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:28,000
hello and welcome to how to hack into

416
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:31,120
and take control of a commercial

417
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,159
airplane step one when trying to get

418
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,260
access to the planes navigation system

419
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:38,309
we try to utilize the planes in flight

420
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,309
entertainment system

421
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:53,919
this is near to impossible both with

422
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:58,090
enough typing and hacker buzz words such

423
00:21:53,919 --> 00:22:00,220
as and three routed the network

424
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:05,168
interface also I've got into the router

425
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:06,490
girder yeah you can make it seem like

426
00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:08,380
the in-flight entertainment and

427
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:10,090
navigation systems are connected and

428
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:16,330
thus frightened and air marshal enough

429
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:17,949
to incapacitate you with enough hacking

430
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:22,210
one could be able to sign on to the

431
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:24,010
planes y5 every alright anyway that was

432
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:28,380
just a fun little video a friend of mine

433
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:30,429
made we've got some more fun videos but

434
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:32,860
you know talking about in-flight

435
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:35,530
wireless again this in-flight wireless

436
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:37,418
entertainment to be typically not gonna

437
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:40,450
be connected to anything really

438
00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:42,880
important I will say this though there

439
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:47,530
are some GA planes out there typically

440
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:53,110
business jets they do offer in-flight

441
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:57,428
Wi-Fi now those may not be so separated

442
00:22:53,110 --> 00:23:02,139
right so you know if you're looking at a

443
00:22:57,429 --> 00:23:05,169
little pissed yet then yeah there's a

444
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:07,299
lot more possibility that you could

445
00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:08,429
actually attach to something it kind of

446
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:12,340
important

447
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:17,500
of course my question is this you have

448
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:19,600
to be in that airplane right how can the

449
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,900
airplane they are in doesn't sound

450
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,668
terribly smart and you know you're it's

451
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:27,820
a little busy yet it doesn't have a

452
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:29,470
fortified door blocking you from the

453
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:32,470
cockpit or anything it might not even

454
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:35,799
have a little curtain you know depending

455
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:42,010
on what it is there are easier ways to

456
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:44,559
attack that aircraft okay a little bit

457
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:49,210
about ATSB how many of you have ever

458
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:56,639
heard of this ABS beep alright so it was

459
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:58,960
created initially in Alaska right so

460
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,330
ATSB you

461
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,090
is this idea it's something where

462
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:05,559
complains talk to each other right they

463
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:08,830
send out signals it's meant to

464
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:11,350
supplement radar in value coverage areas

465
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:16,770
like Alaska a lot of you might not

466
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:19,629
realize this Alaska is huge right and

467
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:21,309
they have more planes than cars in

468
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:27,730
Alaska what's one of the biggest

469
00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:31,049
problems in Alaska plane crashes well

470
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:33,580
it's related to that drinking and flying

471
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:35,620
all right they got more planes than cars

472
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:37,120
kind of make sense you know a lot of

473
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:39,610
people get drunk and they they fly

474
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,549
anyway but anyway it's this is part of

475
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:44,770
this system called free flight that you

476
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:46,750
know maybe someday we'll actually get it

477
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:48,158
the whole idea is planes talk to each

478
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,720
other and they kind of work out their

479
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,149
differences they're like hey you were

480
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,309
kind of collect let's let's not do that

481
00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:58,299
right now

482
00:24:54,309 --> 00:25:00,039
PSB can also if you receive these

483
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:04,690
signals you can get traffic and weather

484
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:07,419
and things like that right now that's a

485
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:09,429
lot of people have heard of a DSB this

486
00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:11,140
is not what airliners use idiot

487
00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:15,820
airliners actually use something called

488
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:17,799
ABS a which is addressable right it's

489
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:21,070
related to something called a cars a

490
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:25,840
cars is a messaging system and it's like

491
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:29,620
this a DSP is your cable ready TV ABS a

492
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:31,600
is your cable box right so you can get

493
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:34,149
pay-per-view and things like that but

494
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,908
ATS a if you will because it can know

495
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:40,719
who you are where as a DSP it's just

496
00:25:36,909 --> 00:25:43,690
like this is me this is me right and

497
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:47,320
there's like good things there's this

498
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:50,830
rule out there that says by January 1st

499
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:54,250
if you find in certain airspace you have

500
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:56,408
to have a transmitter for a DSB right

501
00:25:54,250 --> 00:26:01,779
and we'll talk more about that here a

502
00:25:56,409 --> 00:26:04,330
little bit related to a DSP in we have

503
00:26:01,779 --> 00:26:08,320
this system called tis B traffic

504
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:11,918
information service B that's based on a

505
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,760
DSP and this is provided by air traffic

506
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,550
and

507
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:18,730
and if you have an equipped aircraft

508
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:21,340
I can look possibly at my GPS or other

509
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:23,680
screen and I'll see other airplanes

510
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:27,070
around me and sort of a poor man's

511
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:29,200
collision avoidance I don't get every

512
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:31,780
airplane I only get the planes that are

513
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,820
under radar coverage that air traffic

514
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:36,879
control knows about and their ground

515
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:39,100
station relays back to me and they don't

516
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,670
have to relate every craft back to me

517
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:44,860
either

518
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:47,740
right other collision avoidance systems

519
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:50,530
that you might see little airplanes have

520
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:52,420
something sometimes called tea CAD it's

521
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:54,639
called tea CAD because it sounds a lot

522
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:57,550
like tea casts but it's nothing like

523
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:01,120
that it's you know something you buy for

524
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:03,190
cheap and basically it it's not

525
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,629
authoritative it just kind of says I

526
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:08,350
think there's an airplane over there

527
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:11,920
right and then we have tea casts tea

528
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:15,490
casts is what the big guys use this

529
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:18,100
Jetson up now on a tea cast system

530
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:20,230
sometimes they'll say the fishfinder

531
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:22,000
you know if you look at this I just

532
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:24,429
realized that my slide is somewhat

533
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,480
truncated I apologize for that but it

534
00:27:24,429 --> 00:27:30,190
looks great on my screen by the way but

535
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:33,400
so it looks kind of like a fish finder

536
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:35,770
that's what they call it that and when I

537
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:38,170
was in Iowa we had a professor in our

538
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:40,870
aviation program there he'd always say

539
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:42,970
things like they call traffic I have

540
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:45,459
them on the fishfinder like you don't

541
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:48,100
have a fish finder you got one of those

542
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:52,000
you know cheap little GA things but

543
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:55,149
anyway so what are the t caste systems

544
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,880
do here's the most important part about

545
00:27:55,150 --> 00:28:03,610
this t caste systems don't use a DSP

546
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:07,030
signals very you're not gonna get an

547
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:10,090
alert and your big airliner or your busy

548
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:13,678
ette because I spoofed a DSP signals how

549
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:13,678
hard is it to spoof a DSP

550
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:20,290
software-defined radio ever heard of it

551
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:23,220
I mean it's super super easy like I can

552
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:26,230
make fake a DSP signals all day long

553
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:29,049
it's probably not very ethical

554
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:31,630
but you know I could do it okay the

555
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:33,760
technology is very simple but these guys

556
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:35,230
don't use it instead what they use is a

557
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,120
transponder signal

558
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:39,669
so transponder if you don't know what

559
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,040
that is it's basically a little box in

560
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:45,100
your airplane when radar hits it it goes

561
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:47,460
hey someone's looking at me I'm over

562
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:50,409
here alright and I have a little number

563
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:54,549
so you look at the bottom screen you see

564
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:57,850
1200 is on the display that's the I

565
00:28:54,549 --> 00:29:01,740
don't have a code code right and it also

566
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:06,549
sends things to your altitude all right

567
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:09,540
by the way this is like the only real

568
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:14,309
world current application of octal

569
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:20,379
this is called a 4096 transponder

570
00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:22,299
because it has four octal digits you

571
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:24,160
know some of the other professors at my

572
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:26,710
university are really big on making

573
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:28,630
people learn octal and I'm like if this

574
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:31,650
is the only place like I've ever seen

575
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:34,030
people using octal as transponders right

576
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:37,179
now the airliners have at least two of

577
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:39,250
these guys and here's what the T caste

578
00:29:37,179 --> 00:29:43,390
system does it uses a directional

579
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:45,160
antenna so that is it as it flies

580
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:47,919
through the air it just sends out

581
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,450
signals and it says hey if you're out

582
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,990
there with the transponder please

583
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:52,600
respond

584
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:55,450
and then it uses the directional antenna

585
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:57,340
and the delay and it says oh I see

586
00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:00,340
you're over there and here's your

587
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:02,649
distance right so it's pretty hard to

588
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:05,590
spoof that you know I can't be signal

589
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:08,710
sending signals over here and thinking

590
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:10,299
that that is somehow going to be

591
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:14,559
interpreted as signals from the other

592
00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:17,440
side of my aircraft it's a pretty hard

593
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:19,629
thing to spoof force the plane to

594
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,700
reroute one another location or at least

595
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:23,830
harass the flight previous simply have

596
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,809
your pilot friends by multiple planes in

597
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:27,939
front behind and around the plane you

598
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:30,010
would like have said planes send

599
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:31,419
transponder signals to the hijacked

600
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:33,879
plane and force it to react to

601
00:30:31,419 --> 00:30:37,679
resolution advisories the crew may

602
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,679
possibly reroute to another location

603
00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:42,029
this is real fight

604
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:04,300
seems like a lot of work why don't we

605
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:04,300
just borrow that one

606
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:13,360
in actuality here's what would happen

607
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:37,908
okay so again you know when it comes to

608
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:39,770
like the little planes

609
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:43,429
maybe things a little bit different all

610
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:46,908
right sue if you have a smaller airplane

611
00:31:43,429 --> 00:31:49,220
like even my 1960s Cessna in my flying

612
00:31:46,909 --> 00:31:50,080
club okay thing has got no GPS or

613
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,850
anything like that

614
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:55,520
so sometimes I bring my own right I'll

615
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:57,230
bring a tablet and I might hook it up to

616
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,789
unit kind of like this guy little guy in

617
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:01,640
the corner a slow down in the corners

618
00:31:58,789 --> 00:32:03,919
called a strap tucks not to be confused

619
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:07,120
with the Stratis what's the difference

620
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:09,409
between a struck talks and a Stratis

621
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,080
several hundred dollars that's the

622
00:32:09,409 --> 00:32:14,830
difference and strat talks

623
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:19,309
it sounds very what Linux see

624
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:21,889
open-source eat cheap you can buy these

625
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:22,928
units or you can build your own a less

626
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:25,429
than two hundred bucks

627
00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:29,169
so what does it got inside it's got a

628
00:32:25,429 --> 00:32:32,570
Raspberry Pi and it's got a dual channel

629
00:32:29,169 --> 00:32:36,730
receiver so there's actually two

630
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:40,789
channels that a dsb is transmitted on

631
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:43,250
and it has something called an a whore's

632
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:47,299
unit which tells you which way is up so

633
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:49,460
it's essentially electronic gyros less

634
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:51,770
than two hundred bucks and it integrates

635
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:53,720
with my tablet I you know it's got

636
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:55,340
synthetic vision it's really cool you

637
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,830
know I can feel like I spend a half

638
00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:00,379
million dollars on a Cirrus and I spent

639
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:06,590
like five hundred bucks tall very I got

640
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:09,140
the exact same effect so these guys yeah

641
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:13,490
if you start sending out all false

642
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:16,279
signals to this kind of a system I'm

643
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:18,500
gonna pick it up and I'm not gonna know

644
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:22,130
that that's a fake system right now it's

645
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:22,610
not connected into my avionics it's not

646
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,980
like it's

647
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:26,780
going to reroute me because it's not

648
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:28,670
connecting my autopilot or anything back

649
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:31,280
but you can certainly mess with me

650
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:33,799
alright and that's kind of true in

651
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:37,160
general you can really mess with the GA

652
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:41,240
pilots it's a little bit harder to mess

653
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:43,309
with the big guys right but they

654
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:47,059
certainly can do this in fact the other

655
00:33:43,309 --> 00:33:48,770
day I was flying into a Lancaster

656
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:53,980
Airport and air traffic control is like

657
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:56,960
yeah I see some traffic in front of you

658
00:33:53,980 --> 00:34:01,880
do you have him in sight and I looked

659
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:04,520
and like yeah yeah I think I see him

660
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:07,250
he's my two o'clock and said could you

661
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:10,070
estimate his altitude and I looked at my

662
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:13,399
tablet and I said I would say his

663
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:16,450
altitude is about 2,500 feet and his

664
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:20,000
tail number is n33

665
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:22,219
because it actually had it on my display

666
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,320
because I was receiving a signal from

667
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:28,939
him and you might say well then how come

668
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:31,100
the tower didn't know who he was he was

669
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:34,850
not within range of a ground station

670
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:37,190
where they can receive his a dsb signal

671
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:40,310
and they only they didn't give his

672
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:43,668
transponder for some reason right so

673
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:46,790
things like that happen right alright so

674
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:50,810
here's some new attacks I mentioned that

675
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:53,359
we have this new mandate and this

676
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:56,810
mandate says come January 1st if you

677
00:34:53,359 --> 00:35:01,640
find in certain kinds of airspace you

678
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:03,890
need to have a DSP out so my flying Club

679
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:06,049
you know we have this older sis now we

680
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:08,118
bought earlier this year we're using it

681
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:10,369
as a trainer it's great I love it my

682
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:12,890
kids love it because the windows are

683
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:15,650
bigger than the new Cessna and you set

684
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:19,060
up a lot higher you know it's just pure

685
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:22,010
flying it's not adulterated byte

686
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:26,750
electronics and screens to look at you

687
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:29,570
actually look outside you know even the

688
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:32,960
gyro is in it the gyros normally their

689
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:35,760
vacuum driven and you have a pump on the

690
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,520
engine that you create suction what

691
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,350
spins these things nope no we don't need

692
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:43,380
anything like that we have these venturi

693
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:44,880
tubes on the side so it works great but

694
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,190
only after you've been flying for like

695
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,650
ten minutes it's not only you know if

696
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:51,630
then if the weather is kind of low it's

697
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:53,490
like you better go taxi up and down the

698
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:55,020
runway a little bit get those things

699
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:57,390
spin in before you get up at the clouds

700
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:58,680
and be like I'm not sure which ways up

701
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:02,490
but anyway

702
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:04,290
so our club decided all right initially

703
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:06,839
we were gonna say forget you and we

704
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:08,670
weren't going to comply with this ATS be

705
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:11,570
out thing we just wouldn't fly down to

706
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:13,320
Philadelphia and things like that and

707
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:14,760
they change their mind

708
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,730
they're like okay we're gonna comply

709
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:21,750
with us so there's this company you

710
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:25,290
avionics and they make a lot of products

711
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:29,550
and they have made their company based

712
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:33,750
on this product pictured and something

713
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:37,020
else that's very similar that works on a

714
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:39,450
wing light and here's what their company

715
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:42,570
does they make these little things where

716
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:45,210
you take off one of your navigation or

717
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:49,170
position lights off of normally your

718
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:52,830
wing tip and you put their special light

719
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:58,400
in its place right that special light

720
00:36:52,830 --> 00:37:01,319
has a GPS receiver a high precision GPS

721
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,640
so that it can send out your position

722
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:07,380
over ATSB

723
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:11,670
an ATS B transmitter a altitude sensor

724
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:14,670
and some other smarts it actually uses

725
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:18,980
the power wires they can go into this

726
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:22,110
unit as an antenna to receive the

727
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:24,420
transponder transmissions to go oh your

728
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:27,030
transponder just fired and here's the

729
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:29,460
code that it just sent so let me take

730
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:32,460
that information and put it together and

731
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:35,040
I'm gonna transmit the appropriate ATSB

732
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:40,100
signal that goes with that transponder

733
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:42,900
reply right which is kind of cool now

734
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:48,150
why do people buy these things because

735
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:49,619
they're only $2,000 right you're like

736
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,960
all that's like seems

737
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:53,819
like a lot well when the effe first came

738
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,579
out with this rule I think they gave us

739
00:37:53,819 --> 00:37:58,859
like ten years of notice and everyone's

740
00:37:56,579 --> 00:38:00,839
like FAA never does anything on time

741
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:03,808
they'll push it back they'll push it

742
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:06,480
back and initially it was at least five

743
00:38:03,809 --> 00:38:10,440
to six thousand dollars to comply with

744
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:13,559
this rule and again if you do a DSP out

745
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:16,410
you get absolutely nothing as a pilot

746
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:19,109
it's no benefit to you at all right you

747
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:21,868
have to do the receiving in order to get

748
00:38:19,109 --> 00:38:24,839
a benefit to get the weather and traffic

749
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:26,400
and stuff like that so a lot of people

750
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:28,740
were like no I don't know

751
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,599
and then you avionics comes out with

752
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:32,308
this thing you're like just replace your

753
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:35,970
wingtip and it's gonna be super easy

754
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:38,999
right I actually installed this guy this

755
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:41,999
guy goes in the tail light it's slightly

756
00:38:38,999 --> 00:38:46,200
easier I think than the wingtip lights

757
00:38:41,999 --> 00:38:48,930
and I installed it a couple hours

758
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:53,180
configured it and it was super easy

759
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:56,940
right so these things are really popular

760
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:59,700
how do they work well you have a

761
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:03,029
smartphone app again they may be easy

762
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:07,038
for people you know you just pull out

763
00:39:03,029 --> 00:39:09,630
the old light pop in this new thing and

764
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:12,749
get out your smartphone you turn the

765
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:15,779
thing on and for the first five minutes

766
00:39:12,749 --> 00:39:19,859
or until you leave the ground it says

767
00:39:15,779 --> 00:39:21,420
hey let me set up a Wi-Fi hotspot and if

768
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:23,190
you connect to it using your little

769
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:28,109
smartphone app you can configure this

770
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:32,309
thing guess what the security is you

771
00:39:28,109 --> 00:39:33,509
know the network password that's it if

772
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:37,049
you can guess the network password

773
00:39:33,509 --> 00:39:39,839
you're good you can you can reconfigure

774
00:39:37,049 --> 00:39:45,630
this I mean I can take my little 1960

775
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:48,299
Cessna and turn it into a Boeing 787 for

776
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:52,559
a United Airlines IHOP I mean it's super

777
00:39:48,299 --> 00:39:54,329
easy to just change it all right or you

778
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:57,390
know maybe there's something called

779
00:39:54,329 --> 00:39:59,309
anonymous mode I can set this unit to be

780
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:01,109
an anonymous mode so I'm not telling the

781
00:39:59,309 --> 00:40:03,490
whole world my tail number as I fly

782
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:05,710
around this guy okay you can

783
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:07,930
at that I mean there's all these things

784
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:18,460
you could do so what do you guys think

785
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:24,160
security fail to configure it

786
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:26,020
that's part of them yeah you just in

787
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,810
fact you can go to their website and

788
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:32,940
I'll show you a video tutorial I think

789
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:35,560
my total time to install this unit

790
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:39,310
configure it and do all the paperwork

791
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:41,380
was about three hours and to be fair the

792
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:43,240
biggest part of that well first of all

793
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:45,070
it started raining so I was working on

794
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,430
the ramp and the rain which kind of

795
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:49,270
sucked

796
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:51,759
but this particular airplane someone

797
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:55,619
upgraded it so that these little lights

798
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:59,530
flash so I had to find this stupid

799
00:40:55,619 --> 00:41:01,990
flasher unit and then disable it which

800
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:04,420
you know I ended up like removing seeds

801
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:06,520
crawling up under the dash and you know

802
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:08,740
that was like the biggest pain in the

803
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:11,290
butt of this thing so you know if I

804
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:14,500
hadn't had to do that you're looking at

805
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:17,920
probably hour and a half or so

806
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:20,010
so it's like super easy to do you save

807
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:24,010
on job time and you know people like

808
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:31,920
like that but you know I'd say it's kind

809
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:31,920
of problematic all right okay question

810
00:41:37,020 --> 00:42:02,320
well otherwise how would you configure

811
00:41:39,609 --> 00:42:04,240
it well it's gonna it's gonna transmit

812
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:06,910
that you have an aircraft and actually

813
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,899
the anonymous mode still sends your

814
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:09,960
identification

815
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:13,050
it just doesn't send it in the same way

816
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:17,290
so that the average person can see it

817
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:20,320
air traffic control can see it but not

818
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:22,529
everybody else but I don't have time to

819
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:27,370
get into that and how that works but

820
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:28,660
okay real quick a couple other things as

821
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:33,100
some people have talked about things

822
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:36,700
like attacking engine systems a lot of

823
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:38,890
engine systems have monitors and some of

824
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:42,939
the information can be set out on

825
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:46,660
something called a cars I'll talk a

826
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:50,290
little bit more about that right now

827
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:52,379
so a cars is a system that is used to

828
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:55,990
send messages to and from the ground

829
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:59,320
this is used all the time it's used for

830
00:42:55,990 --> 00:43:03,100
things like weather flight delays flight

831
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:06,460
plan updates maintenance stuff the lab

832
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:10,150
is broken sometimes it's used for

833
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:13,720
passenger manifests a lot of different

834
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:16,420
reasons that it might be is many of the

835
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:19,649
components on a big airliner will

836
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:23,140
actually send out these messages okay

837
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:24,820
the engines send information and you're

838
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,710
like why would they do that for

839
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:29,400
maintenance

840
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:32,950
you know Royals Royce tracks the engines

841
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:35,050
the airlines track the engines what are

842
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:37,839
the parameters what's going on I want to

843
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:40,510
know that alright I want to know hey is

844
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:43,180
there something that's not right and I

845
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:44,920
need to address that next time the plane

846
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:46,600
goes in is there something that the

847
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,210
manufacturer of that engine wants to

848
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:53,650
know right so they send these messages

849
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:56,110
all the time right so could you attack a

850
00:43:53,650 --> 00:44:01,290
cars yep it's not encrypted or anything

851
00:43:56,110 --> 00:44:01,290
you could send up bogus messages

852
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:06,640
probably not a practical way to take

853
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,080
over to their from the ground one maybe

854
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,540
you could take control of the flight

855
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:13,980
state cars message where a crew receives

856
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:13,980
flight plan modifications

857
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:10,130
okay so again by the way thanks to a

858
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:12,950
friend of mine Polly

859
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:18,860
Adolphe over in Dubuque she made those

860
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:23,330
funny videos but so yeah it's use that

861
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:25,580
you're gonna run into with that there's

862
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:28,190
protocols right there's protocols and

863
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:30,980
procedures in place so and for example

864
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:33,380
if you say hey you're gonna reroute the

865
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:36,590
immediate action from the pilots will be

866
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:38,270
to contact the airline and ask they're

867
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:42,670
gonna verify that and they're gonna say

868
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:46,130
no we didn't tell you to do that now

869
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:49,190
again is there possibility like can you

870
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:51,110
send bogus ACARS messages oh yeah yeah

871
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:54,230
you definitely can you could like hack

872
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:55,700
into a ground a car's unit and send out

873
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:59,000
messages all day long there's no

874
00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:02,810
encryption or validation or anything

875
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:06,560
like that so there certainly is

876
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:09,590
potential there and what is gonna

877
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:13,070
prevent attacks it's gonna be people who

878
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:15,920
actually follow procedures and verify

879
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:17,720
things you know you might have better

880
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,610
luck with something a little bit less

881
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:24,740
tragic state then hey you're going to

882
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:25,870
Cuba that Fargo but anyway so just a

883
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:29,029
couple closing thoughts

884
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:32,480
nearly every protocol using aviation is

885
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:35,780
not secured it's not encrypted you know

886
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:38,260
even the radio I remember one day I was

887
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:41,020
flying around Atlanta and

888
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:43,000
some kids were on the radio going maybe

889
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:45,880
maybe maybe you know they like making

890
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,830
Mayday calls and then the controllers

891
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:49,990
are like just having to verify that

892
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:52,120
did anyone declare an emergency and

893
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:59,220
everyone's like no it's some idiot kids

894
00:46:52,120 --> 00:47:02,140
right now increasing automation without

895
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:03,700
securing those protocols could be

896
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:05,799
problematic I mean it doesn't sound like

897
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:07,899
a great idea

898
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:10,750
you know and I would say that airliner

899
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:14,770
is pretty safe you know I wouldn't be

900
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:17,500
worrying about people hacking in these

901
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:20,230
systems there's there's so many other

902
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:24,220
easier ways that people could be

903
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:26,380
attacking those systems in general but

904
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:28,870
you know if you really just don't like

905
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:30,910
general aviation pilots you can just

906
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:33,220
annoy the crap out of them honestly

907
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:38,350
especially if they got the cheaper stuff

908
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:43,060
so that's pretty much it and maybe have

909
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:49,620
time for one question it looks like but

910
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:49,620
don't feel any pressure to ask yeah

911
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,290
[Music]

912
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:04,009
[Music]

913
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:15,450
it makes a good movie doesn't it yeah

914
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:18,240
and again if you're talking about an

915
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:22,200
airliner so an airliner is gonna have

916
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:23,819
some sophisticated stuff where you know

917
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,830
if you're close to the ground they

918
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:29,040
usually have we called radar altimeters

919
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:30,720
which literally reflect radar signals

920
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,670
off the ground

921
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:36,270
so when you're low you would know that

922
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:39,600
and that's gonna be tied into that tt

923
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:41,250
cast system and you're gonna get alerts

924
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:44,549
and they're gonna tell you you know pull

925
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:47,460
up you know you're you're low so you

926
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:50,190
know hopefully you would notice it there

927
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:51,960
have been crashes not related to that or

928
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:54,270
any kind of hacking but there was

929
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:57,600
actually an airplane that crashed many

930
00:48:54,270 --> 00:49:01,680
years ago because a light bulb was

931
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:03,360
burned out and the crew were so

932
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,700
distracted by that they even sent

933
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:08,760
somebody down into the bowels of this

934
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:11,279
airplane to like verify that things were

935
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:13,860
working correctly and they disengaged

936
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:18,630
the autopilot and they didn't notice in

937
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:22,790
this plane crashed but yeah okay let's

938
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:22,790
see quick question

939
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:30,940
[Applause]

940
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:46,330
okay that's a good question and the

941
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:49,570
answer is no for a couple reasons number

942
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:53,549
one if I send in a new flight plan using

943
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:57,460
a car's it has to be reviewed and

944
00:49:53,550 --> 00:50:00,310
manually accepted by the pilot so the

945
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:02,290
pilot has to approve the change it's not

946
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:05,950
like oh here's your new flight plan and

947
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:09,670
then you know off it goes and and again

948
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:12,609
if you somehow could not disengage an

949
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:15,790
autopilot you can't always override it

950
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:17,680
not that you're gonna enjoy that you

951
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:20,080
know that you're gonna enjoy you know

952
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,609
muscley you're playing around this guy

953
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:24,069
for a little bit but you're always gonna

954
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:27,340
have that so all right well I'm out of

955
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:30,090
time so thanks for listening and enjoy

956
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:30,090
your next talk
