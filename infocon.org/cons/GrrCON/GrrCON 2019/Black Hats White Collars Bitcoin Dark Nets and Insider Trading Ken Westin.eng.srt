1
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,410
test test test

2
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:42,300
should I get started alright hello my

3
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,070
name is Ken Weston this is actually a

4
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,209
second time I've presented a gherkin I

5
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:52,170
presented in 2016 I think this time I'm

6
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,370
actually a lot more hungover a lot of

7
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,710
fun last night

8
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,360
so I'm going to be talking about some

9
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,090
really interesting things that I found I

10
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,190
was doing a lot of research I used to

11
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,199
work at a company called Blanc where I

12
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,210
was doing a lot of data analytics now I

13
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,580
work at elastic but I'm really

14
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,919
interested in how data is used for

15
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,539
conducting investigations and I'm I'm

16
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,220
finding that a lot of times the

17
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,170
investigations aren't always just going

18
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,360
to be limited to cyber so a lot of like

19
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,100
the same types of use cases you know

20
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,900
basic correlation alerts firewalls

21
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,339
things like that you know that's one

22
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,479
side of it but as you start to actually

23
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,189
look at some of these criminal

24
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,060
investigations there's a lot of other

25
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:31,320
data sources that need to be utilized

26
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,420
when I was actually doing research I was

27
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,579
actually digging into a lot of like dark

28
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,920
web sites looking at a lot of the the

29
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:39,509
market places at that time I was doing a

30
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,799
lot of research around the stolen credit

31
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,200
cards and things like that that were

32
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,970
happening in retail but I started

33
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,820
noticing something in these forums was

34
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:51,270
that there was this sort of rise of

35
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,979
Bitcoin and cryptocurrency and it was

36
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,869
really interesting is that financial

37
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,548
folks became really interested in

38
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,380
cryptocurrency so it wasn't just

39
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,960
something that you know the techies were

40
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,158
using and I also started seeing that

41
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,329
there were conversations that were

42
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,070
actually happening in some of these

43
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:07,320
forums where people were actually

44
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:10,598
looking for insider information so

45
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,790
things like earnings reports that the

46
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:15,250
so someone who's a trader they could

47
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:17,230
actually use that information to to make

48
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,239
a profit and I started thinking about

49
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:22,540
this like that's really a smart way to

50
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:24,609
make a lot of money so there's maybe two

51
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,129
takeaways from this talk so if you're on

52
00:02:24,609 --> 00:02:29,769
the criminal side you're gonna learn

53
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:31,450
techniques and how not to get caught if

54
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:33,879
you are on the defensive side you're

55
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:35,170
going to learn hopefully about the the

56
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:38,099
value of some of this data and how you

57
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:42,638
may want to go about protecting it right

58
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:45,578
so yeah a little bit about me I've been

59
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,620
doing sex security for a while

60
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:49,659
2016 I presented around some things that

61
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,209
I was doing I actually had a startup

62
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:54,000
where I was actually tracking criminals

63
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:56,799
stolen laptops phones things like that

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,689
ended up unveiling organized crime rings

65
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:03,069
help solve a carjacking ended up also

66
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:04,810
building a tool that would actually mine

67
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:06,970
EXIF data out of images that you could

68
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,700
search so it's finding stolen cameras

69
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:11,500
all sorts of other things like that I'm

70
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,988
really interested in insider threat

71
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:19,030
threat hunting again more on the data

72
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:20,769
analytics side so why this topic I just

73
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,629
think it's really interesting there's

74
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:25,329
it's a lot of it has the criminal

75
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:28,510
hacking element to it there's also like

76
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:30,519
fraud you start getting into dark nets

77
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:33,940
you look at some of the crypto currency

78
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:35,409
that's being used for some of the the

79
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,669
train this after they happened happening

80
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:38,739
between the hackers and the criminals

81
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:40,120
and I think this is actually a

82
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:42,010
significant threat to the economy I'm

83
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,720
gonna walk through a number of these

84
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,239
cases where these folks have actually

85
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,319
been caught I was actually able to go

86
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,629
through some of the criminal criminal

87
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:51,069
complaints and sort of does identify how

88
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:53,709
they went about and actually did their

89
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:56,379
actions but I believe that this is

90
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:58,180
actually happening a lot more people are

91
00:03:56,379 --> 00:04:00,099
a lot smarter you'll find that a lot of

92
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,079
times when people do get caught doing

93
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:04,238
this it's because they do something

94
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:06,489
stupid I think I have a slide around

95
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,569
this but it's it's around usually the

96
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:09,729
criminals they are they're become

97
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:11,108
arrogant or greedy or combination of the

98
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:12,909
two and that's what usually gets them

99
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:14,590
caught you'll find that some of these

100
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:17,289
criminals were actually doing this work

101
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,668
for five years and they wouldn't have

102
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:20,108
gotten caught except for maybe one of

103
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:21,579
the hackers got greedy and they try to

104
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:22,419
do something else then they got busted

105
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:25,120
for another crime

106
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:27,669
and then it unveiled a number of their

107
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,499
other illicit activities let's get that

108
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:31,120
one so I'm looking at some of these

109
00:04:29,499 --> 00:04:32,439
darkness that was really interesting

110
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,759
there was like this sort of insider

111
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,229
trading social network

112
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,449
do you have non-public information

113
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:39,128
publicly traded companies apply now and

114
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:41,139
monetize your insight information

115
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:44,439
there's a number of these forums where

116
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:46,900
they will ask you for insider data in

117
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:48,669
order to actually get inside of that

118
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,198
forum and be part of that group so you

119
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:51,248
actually have to commit a crime to

120
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:55,300
actually be part of this particular

121
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:57,009
group they'll have information they have

122
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,750
to be publicly traded like on the Nasdaq

123
00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:01,330
some of these folks they'll give you a

124
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:03,370
percentage of whatever the trader

125
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:04,900
actually makes off of that and they'll

126
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,529
usually give that at you to you in the

127
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,529
form of cryptocurrency

128
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,349
so what I found really interesting too

129
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:20,680
is that in these forums those people

130
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:22,029
that were not just you know like you

131
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,069
know selling hacking services things

132
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:26,589
like that but these folks really knew

133
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:28,750
finance they really understood this

134
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:31,539
quite a bit you know some of these folks

135
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:33,430
you'll even see that in one case it was

136
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:36,009
actually a former VP of Morgan Stanley

137
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,479
was involved in some of these so it's

138
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:39,310
just a really interesting thing where

139
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:40,899
you have people that have sort of the

140
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,639
white-collar crime element and then you

141
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:44,169
also have people that are have the

142
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,029
hacking element and when you start to

143
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:52,688
merge those two in these sort of forums

144
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:53,919
it gets pretty dangerous this is one

145
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:56,289
that I've actually found to on the

146
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,969
darknet it was one of the groups you

147
00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:00,159
have to commit a crime to actually to

148
00:05:57,969 --> 00:06:03,240
get access to it I have a feeling

149
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:06,339
actually that this is actually the FBI

150
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,779
actually it's a honeypot just just the

151
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:10,389
way things were worth it's almost too

152
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:12,009
professional a little too polished but

153
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:14,889
there was a number of these we look on

154
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:16,659
you know in on tour and darknets and

155
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:18,699
things like that you'll find a number of

156
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:20,830
these different forms and there also may

157
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:22,899
be a section like in some of the

158
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,859
traditional hacking forums you'll go in

159
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:26,830
there and you'll find that there is a

160
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,240
section for insider trading as well so

161
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:31,029
it is interesting is that you know

162
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,190
finance folks they really got into the

163
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:35,100
trading cryptocurrency themselves I'm

164
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:37,140
not only a 3 in stocks but you know

165
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:40,170
Bitcoin people can make a fast buck off

166
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:42,990
of it right so they're they're aware of

167
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:45,120
it they have they have Bitcoin so they

168
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:47,880
know how to provide you know give

169
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,320
Bitcoin to someone else as well it's

170
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,120
unnecessarily something my parents could

171
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:54,900
do right but some of the finance guys

172
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,970
they figured it out pretty easily so the

173
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,620
definition of insider trading you know

174
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,210
it with the illegal practice of trading

175
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,710
on stock exchange to ones advantage

176
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:07,530
through having access to confidential

177
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:09,419
information what's interesting is that

178
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:13,020
when you actually look at the SEC this

179
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:14,910
was the original definition of insider

180
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,099
trading what's really interesting is

181
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:18,930
that in order to actually be tried for

182
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:22,010
insider trading you have to actually

183
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:24,180
have a fiduciary duty to that company

184
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:26,159
there's a hacker who actually goes out

185
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:30,450
and steals information from you do they

186
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,980
have a fiduciary duty no right so that's

187
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,300
actually what happened with a particular

188
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:38,300
case that actually changed the

189
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:40,260
definition there was a guy named zoko

190
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,060
ukranian you'll see a lot of the stuff

191
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:46,320
these these guys actually operate out of

192
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:50,370
Ukraine probably not surprised but this

193
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:52,020
guy he he figured this out he didn't go

194
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,660
to someone else to trade for him he did

195
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:57,510
the trade himself but he he wasn't very

196
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:59,850
smart about how he did it he ended up

197
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:01,920
taking about forty two thousand dollars

198
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:04,140
to invest in the stock market

199
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,660
he's never invested in stock in his

200
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,969
entire life and all of a sudden he goes

201
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:11,880
out and this is basically a one year's

202
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:13,830
salary so he goes and he puts one year's

203
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,250
salary directly into the into the stock

204
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:20,340
market

205
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:21,720
he puts it on one particular stock he

206
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:24,570
was able to net almost three hundred

207
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,160
thousand dollars as a result of that he

208
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,050
didn't get that money though because

209
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,460
when this actually happened that's that

210
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,280
through of all sorts of red flags with

211
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,689
the the the trading company he was using

212
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,419
and they reported that directly to the

213
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:39,180
SEC he never actually showed up in court

214
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:41,309
but the the FBI basically just took the

215
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:43,650
money from his account so we never

216
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:44,790
actually got it what he was actually

217
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:46,160
doing was he actually found a

218
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,740
vulnerability in

219
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,480
Thompson financial server where another

220
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,790
company that they upload their earnings

221
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,170
reports to this particular server so he

222
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,280
found the vulnerability and it was well

223
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,800
he was waiting for the presentation

224
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,780
material to appear and as soon as it did

225
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,699
he had insider information he knew what

226
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:04,370
their earnings were gonna be and it was

227
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:06,110
his company IMS health incorporated and

228
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,780
that's the single stock that he actually

229
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:11,300
traded on so as a result of this and

230
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:13,160
then some other cases like this the the

231
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:16,640
SEC actually they changed the definition

232
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:21,170
of insider trading oh they also had his

233
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:23,540
IP address as well so he had a summary

234
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,949
judgment he had to pay back the money as

235
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,890
well as interest they just took it

236
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:29,630
directly from his account so he did not

237
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:32,120
owe a fiduciary duty to the source of

238
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:35,210
the information so he actually didn't

239
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,530
get tried for for insider trading right

240
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:39,620
so we wouldn't have to get any jail time

241
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:42,199
just had to forfeit the currency they

242
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,240
redefined that and actually included

243
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,650
this type of an attack as insider

244
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,620
training that they kind of refer to this

245
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:52,160
as outsider trading not very creative I

246
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:53,650
guess but but you know as a result of

247
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,230
that they did modify some of those rules

248
00:09:53,650 --> 00:10:00,020
so this is a really interesting case it

249
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:03,470
actually involved a number of hackers as

250
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:06,020
well as a lot of traders there was this

251
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,700
guy buddy Vadim herma which I'm gonna

252
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,900
totally brutalize all these names I

253
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,820
apologize

254
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:13,819
and also another guy named Aleksandr

255
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,740
Eremenko Aleksandr he's he's famous for

256
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:18,440
another reason and I'll talk about that

257
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,900
when we get through this case he got

258
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,390
really greedy yeah they started with

259
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:25,550
targeting PR firms they wanted to go

260
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:28,160
after these systems they figured they

261
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:30,349
could you know harvest the the press

262
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,900
releases for earnings reports and then

263
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:35,450
they could share that with traders and

264
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:38,030
there was around 35 different entities

265
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:40,970
in this on the trading side that they

266
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:43,220
got busted 35 and so a lot of these were

267
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,810
shell companies that were created are a

268
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,120
number of other investors and you'll

269
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:49,489
find that these investors were actually

270
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,250
very smart one of them was actually a

271
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:54,290
former VP at Morgan Stanley so he knew

272
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:56,630
how to stay under the radar for the SEC

273
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,670
he started doing smaller transactions

274
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,950
and he had

275
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:02,560
different accounts maybe you know 35,000

276
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:04,870
here 35,000 there so that was actually

277
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,599
allowed them to avoid detection by the

278
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:10,420
SEC and they would have gotten away with

279
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,540
it too if it wasn't for one of the

280
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:15,069
hackers he got greedy and he started

281
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:18,699
getting involved in some stolen credit

282
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:20,440
cards and the Ukrainian police actually

283
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:23,230
went to his house they grabbed his

284
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,550
laptop and that's when they found all of

285
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:27,460
the evidence of what they were actually

286
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,719
doing on that particular laptop so again

287
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,770
if they wouldn't they would not have

288
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,110
gotten caught this was going on for

289
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:33,850
almost four five years right but because

290
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:36,700
of that that one mistake that the hacker

291
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:39,580
made the criminal after they got in

292
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:41,860
trouble so what they did was the first

293
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:44,200
thing they targeted was market wired

294
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:46,120
they did a sequel ejection they got

295
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:49,360
reversed shell and they accessed

296
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:52,210
internal login credentials this one was

297
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,100
really easy for them to do there was

298
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,420
also a challenge here as when the FBI

299
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,690
was actually conducting the

300
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,800
investigation they didn't have any logs

301
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:02,290
so that was a bit of a challenge for

302
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,969
them and what it was actually the the

303
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,530
data they actually got from the laptop

304
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,440
that actually served to incriminate the

305
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:09,910
the criminal hackers versus any sort of

306
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,890
logs that this particular company

307
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,530
provided they had no idea that they were

308
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:16,330
compromised

309
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:18,010
they stole around a hundred thousand

310
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:20,530
press releases so that's almost

311
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:22,000
frustrates me so someone got into this

312
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,890
server and they were downloading over

313
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,170
100,000 press releases and you had no

314
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:31,120
way to detect that so what they would do

315
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:34,150
is they they uploaded these they

316
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,280
actually created a hidden service on

317
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:38,860
through tor and they actually started

318
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,300
advertising this service to traders if

319
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,830
you get access to these press releases

320
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,800
it only costs you ten thousand dollars

321
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:45,790
in Bitcoin that's pretty good deal

322
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,199
especially when you can make millions

323
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:53,349
off these types of transactions and they

324
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,180
ended up getting into a couple of

325
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:57,640
traders and they decided to do business

326
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:59,709
with them they then went after some

327
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,130
other and these wires they laughter PR

328
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,890
Newswire

329
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:05,410
this one they actually went in multiple

330
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:06,860
times and they they got detected they

331
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,930
got booted out

332
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,940
and then finally they actually went out

333
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:13,280
and they bought a bunch of passwords

334
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:15,440
from compromised social media network

335
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:18,290
they that basically did a brute-force

336
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,460
I'm looking at employees right because

337
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,260
employees never you have the same

338
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:23,830
password for Facebook and their admin

339
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,730
credentials on the enterprise right

340
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:28,190
that's how they were able to get in

341
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:29,390
again and they stayed there this that

342
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:31,490
time they didn't have to use any malware

343
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,990
they did install some our initially and

344
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:35,300
that got detected and then they got

345
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:37,730
booted out then they went after another

346
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,829
one that with a business wire they

347
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:42,400
started actually getting kind of famous

348
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:45,500
in some of these underground forums and

349
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:48,079
one guy actually said hey I actually

350
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,340
have access to this PR Newswire how

351
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,780
about I just I don't want to get

352
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,400
involved in this training stuff how

353
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:54,199
about if I just sell you the access so

354
00:13:52,400 --> 00:14:00,319
they actually get bought access to this

355
00:13:54,200 --> 00:14:02,270
other PR network the traders were smart

356
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,650
they actually created several brokerage

357
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:09,800
accounts they also set up certain like

358
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:11,660
shadow businesses and other entities and

359
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,620
so they had a lot of these different

360
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:15,740
accounts where they were actually doing

361
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:17,590
the trading they ended up making in

362
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:21,230
total over a hundred million dollars

363
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:22,850
right I mean forget all the other types

364
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:24,860
of cybercrime this is where the money is

365
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,630
at right just imagine how much money and

366
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,340
that they are able to make off of this

367
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:30,439
and again they would not have gotten

368
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,370
caught if one of the hackers didn't get

369
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,940
involved in some other criminal

370
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,940
enterprises

371
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:38,300
they also found when they click the

372
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:40,610
investigation when they were looking at

373
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,589
all the logs they actually found that

374
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:45,890
some of the hackers actually were given

375
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:47,570
direct trading accounts as well so the

376
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:49,819
the traders actually created accounts

377
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:51,620
for them so that they could actually as

378
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,850
payment right so you actually log into

379
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,710
this account here's the current

380
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,570
information and then you can transfer it

381
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:58,010
to your bank and they actually found

382
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,180
that some of the IP addresses actually

383
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,290
match where the hackers were logging

384
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:03,109
into PR Newswire

385
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:04,610
that also matched does the IP address of

386
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:10,900
when they were logging into some of the

387
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:10,900
brokerage accounts as well use a proxy

388
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,139
so here's an example so the XP to over

389
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,998
800 trades and it was based on earnings

390
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:19,620
so just to give me an example on

391
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:22,769
Caterpillar you'll see that they're

392
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:25,470
their trades were fairly small so that's

393
00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:28,319
one great way of actually avoiding the

394
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:29,670
getting flagged by the SEC and you know

395
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:32,939
again they did this over a long period

396
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:35,370
of time but the one group that actually

397
00:15:32,939 --> 00:15:38,998
made just off caterpillar alone over 700

398
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:40,709
thousand dollars right one of the guys

399
00:15:38,999 --> 00:15:44,790
that was actually organized this was

400
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:47,849
this guy Vitaly Kor Chesky he actually

401
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:51,689
said he was innocent he's also a pastor

402
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:54,089
at a church he was the former VP as a VP

403
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:55,620
at Morgan Stanley as well so he's he's

404
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:57,329
really the mastermind behind a lot of

405
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:00,540
the trading aspects of it again

406
00:15:57,329 --> 00:16:02,569
you know avoiding the SEC and he said he

407
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:05,849
was innocent he was just recently

408
00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:07,800
sentenced to five years in prison they

409
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:09,569
were going to give him it more like

410
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,189
eight or nine years but because he was a

411
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:13,529
pastor and he does good things for the

412
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:16,259
community they gave him a more lenient

413
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:17,579
sentence and he also had to forfeit all

414
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:20,399
the money that he actually made around

415
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:22,319
seventeen and a half million dollars in

416
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,439
there was a lot of people who actually

417
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:26,849
came to his defense they a lot of people

418
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:28,860
from his congregation actually came to

419
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,750
his trial so if you're gonna commit a

420
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,069
crime but you're white-collar crime and

421
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:37,709
you want to get a lenient sentence

422
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:40,170
become a pastor so the data sources here

423
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:41,699
like it's online brokerage you know web

424
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:43,469
server accounts like Gideon application

425
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:45,000
logs so I just think this is really

426
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,860
interesting where a lot of times when

427
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,870
you're collecting logs from your

428
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,339
infrastructure it may not be for

429
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,559
investigation you're doing internally

430
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:54,990
could be something a year or two down

431
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:56,850
the road where you know the FBI comes

432
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:58,679
knocking on your door and do you guys

433
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:00,899
have logs from like two years ago we get

434
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:02,220
access to that especially if you're

435
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:04,589
dealing with financial services and

436
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:06,419
things like that they had access to bank

437
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:09,569
records a lot of the business registry

438
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:11,880
data the the newswire authentication VPN

439
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:14,579
logs and the course of forensic images

440
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,260
of religious computer it was which was

441
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:18,629
provided by law enforcement in the

442
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:20,329
Ukraine what was really funny too is

443
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:23,269
that they actually did find like a

444
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:25,250
toriel video on his laptop as well

445
00:17:23,269 --> 00:17:27,919
showing the traders how to download the

446
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,990
legal information so if you are gonna

447
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,390
commit a crime like this again don't

448
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:38,990
leave a video of how you actually commit

449
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:40,279
the crime on your laptop some of the

450
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,380
tools next place that were compromised

451
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:43,519
credentials there were some challenges

452
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,929
with this I mean if you have the

453
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:46,669
multi-factor authentication that would

454
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:47,890
have blocked it but these were you know

455
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:50,149
this is probably five six years ago

456
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:52,639
there was some malware a lot of sequel

457
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:56,779
and injection and the course using

458
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:57,769
torrent proxies there was actually one

459
00:17:56,779 --> 00:18:01,220
of the hackers too

460
00:17:57,769 --> 00:18:03,169
his name was oleksander Eremenko he was

461
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:07,159
one of the he's part of the PR scheme as

462
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:09,350
well he got a little greedy and he

463
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:11,630
decided you know who has access to a lot

464
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:18,289
of this insider information as well the

465
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:21,500
sec so he he actually sent out phishing

466
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:26,149
emails it was it was malware ridden PDF

467
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:28,130
documents to SCC employees and he was

468
00:18:26,149 --> 00:18:31,789
able to compromise he got access to it

469
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:34,279
was a test database where called Edgar

470
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:35,889
the Edgar database where companies

471
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:39,049
actually upload information to the SEC

472
00:18:35,889 --> 00:18:41,840
around you know acquisitions and things

473
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:43,940
like that and then you know he ended up

474
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:47,299
sharing that information with another

475
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:48,799
group of traders a separate group and he

476
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:53,029
got fifty percent of the profits as a

477
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:55,519
result of that this was actually from

478
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:57,320
the FBI just kind of showing how it all

479
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,299
kind of flowed Eremenko provided the

480
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,980
data to one particular person and then

481
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:02,690
from there they they spread it out what

482
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:07,909
amongst a lot of other traders and some

483
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:09,500
other training groups so this is what

484
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:11,299
their some of their transactions look

485
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,100
like what they actually looked at you

486
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:15,649
know what each one of these individuals

487
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,750
or these groups you know how much did

488
00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:19,820
they usually win and all of a sudden

489
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:22,370
when they did started doing this essay

490
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:25,189
the SEC data you know what was their

491
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:26,750
window loss ratio as well so again this

492
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:28,549
is something that would raise a red flag

493
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,639
if all of a sudden you're making a bunch

494
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:31,769
of money you know

495
00:19:29,639 --> 00:19:34,168
you weren't doing that before um it's

496
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:35,999
gonna raise some red flags their total

497
00:19:34,169 --> 00:19:37,739
profit mom these guys these guys are

498
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:41,820
small time compared to the the pr group

499
00:19:37,739 --> 00:19:43,109
i only made four million right but yeah

500
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,599
there was a number of different traders

501
00:19:43,109 --> 00:19:49,549
that were part of this and they yeah

502
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:49,549
they got some of them are in jail

503
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:55,408
another target is going to be legal

504
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:56,998
firms so there was a case where there

505
00:19:55,409 --> 00:19:59,729
was a guy named being hong but with

506
00:19:56,999 --> 00:20:03,719
boozang & hongcun they are Chinese folks

507
00:19:59,729 --> 00:20:05,549
they actually they actually had a

508
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:06,599
PowerPoint presentation where they

509
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:07,799
actually walk through their entire

510
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:09,958
business plan of how they're going to be

511
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:12,329
conducting this particular business that

512
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:13,679
when they got their other their computer

513
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:15,779
seized it was still on there

514
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,609
so again if you're going to be

515
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:21,839
committing crimes don't make a business

516
00:20:17,609 --> 00:20:24,718
plan they actually had a PowerPoint they

517
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:26,539
also had a number of emails so first

518
00:20:24,719 --> 00:20:28,529
thing they targeted was it was one

519
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:31,739
organization they were using primarily

520
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:33,749
phishing emails kind of related to the

521
00:20:31,739 --> 00:20:35,309
the last two talks and then they were

522
00:20:33,749 --> 00:20:36,869
able to get some information around it

523
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:40,229
that what they were actually looking for

524
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:41,820
was acquisition information so if they

525
00:20:40,229 --> 00:20:43,229
if you know that one cup is gonna buy

526
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,239
another one yum you can trade on that

527
00:20:43,229 --> 00:20:48,989
information and you can make quite a bit

528
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:51,479
of money obviously then they target

529
00:20:48,989 --> 00:20:53,099
another law firm what's interesting is

530
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:54,599
the law firm that they they were out of

531
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:56,399
the kept their names out of the criminal

532
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:57,839
complaints so that was good

533
00:20:56,399 --> 00:21:00,658
if you're a law firm I guess you we can

534
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:02,700
do that in May 15th they there was one

535
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,690
the Pitney Bowes acquisition of a coming

536
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,029
a book called BorderFree

537
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:08,190
they had traded on that information they

538
00:21:06,029 --> 00:21:10,440
made around 3 million dollars doing this

539
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:12,059
right so again these guys are small-time

540
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,119
they're not like 100 million dollar ones

541
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:18,928
right only 3 million this is how much

542
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:19,889
they made in their trades so the they

543
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:21,899
made around you know five hundred

544
00:21:19,889 --> 00:21:23,668
thousand dollars each they they also

545
00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:25,589
charge them on interest and the penalty

546
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:27,929
and then they gave him a total and

547
00:21:25,589 --> 00:21:30,329
you'll see here there's this one lady su

548
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:33,269
Qing lie that she didn't actually get

549
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:36,269
any interest she had to give the money

550
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:38,729
back she's actually the mother of one of

551
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:41,090
the criminals she thought her son was

552
00:21:38,729 --> 00:21:43,490
just really smart trader right the

553
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:45,800
and you know he gave her all this money

554
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:53,030
as a result of all this and then she had

555
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:56,149
to give it back so sorry mom another one

556
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:58,700
like financial services a financial

557
00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:00,110
there was a group called since 4 there

558
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:03,200
were about a hundred companies targeted

559
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:05,330
they were actually looking for pharma

560
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,420
companies so they were looking for

561
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:09,560
companies that maybe have drugs things

562
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:13,400
like that that are actually gonna go to

563
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:15,320
market and at the SEC actually requested

564
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,520
logs and in data from eight different

565
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,389
companies they didn't even know they

566
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,330
were compromised

567
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:21,950
right so this was a really good

568
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,780
investigation actually fire I did it

569
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:26,930
there's a bunch of research and some

570
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:29,149
white papers on it and that we were

571
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:33,050
talked about so one thing to is a

572
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:34,070
monitoring of traders I found that when

573
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,330
they're trading they do a lot of

574
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:37,189
monitoring they'll monitor everything

575
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:39,080
from Skype there's logs every one that

576
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,340
they're talking to some of them are

577
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,350
allowed to use their cell phones during

578
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:44,540
trading hours things like that but what

579
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:46,820
happens when they go home right there's

580
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:49,850
no there's no way to really you know

581
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:52,250
track them at all to all times there was

582
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:54,889
actually one group that that this is

583
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:57,140
another interesting case a guy named

584
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,620
Daniel Rivas he worked for Bank of

585
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,520
America

586
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:04,219
he worked in IT he had access to a

587
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,760
database and had this database had

588
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:08,720
information around pending acquisitions

589
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:11,360
he didn't want to trade on this

590
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,750
information himself but his girlfriend

591
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,909
her father was a trader so what he would

592
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:18,200
do is he would send he would write the

593
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:20,660
sort of love letters they looked like

594
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,240
love letters handwritten he would given

595
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:25,730
to his girlfriend and then it had

596
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:28,070
basically it was a code had dates that

597
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:30,050
had the stock when to buy it and then

598
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:31,909
she would give that to her father so

599
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:33,830
pretty smart and so that's one way not

600
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:36,050
to get caught right there's no no no

601
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:39,590
digital trail probably would have gotten

602
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:41,210
away with it except that trader James

603
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:42,560
Moody he started sharing some of the

604
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:45,010
information with another one of his

605
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:47,060
friends who was also trading and then

606
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:48,620
Daniel rebus had a buddy that was

607
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,750
actually getting into some financial

608
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,290
difficulties so he decided to help him

609
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,820
out

610
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:55,280
and then another friend also want to

611
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:59,659
help out get access to this information

612
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:01,190
as well then they use a time bomb type

613
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:04,580
of application they thought it was

614
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:06,860
secure but the problem is is if you

615
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:08,090
delete you delete it but the other

616
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:11,000
person doesn't delete it you still have

617
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:12,500
that message and they they didn't delete

618
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,960
some of these messages and they were get

619
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:17,300
compromised as a result of that so these

620
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,500
guys I'm not sure if they actually did

621
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:22,550
dale time but they did have to pay

622
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:25,430
significant fines so what kind of

623
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:26,919
information is going to be targeted i if

624
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:30,200
you look at it it's gonna be things like

625
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:32,510
your earnings reports any sort of patent

626
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:35,690
information so think about i mean that

627
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:38,330
your legal services M&A activity your

628
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:39,650
fda status i even think of ulnar

629
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:43,280
abilities if you identify a

630
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:44,750
vulnerability maybe in like a some sort

631
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,330
of web application or a mobile

632
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:48,590
application of a major company and you

633
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:50,090
know it's gonna have an impact on the

634
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:52,129
stock you know that could be considered

635
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:53,449
insider information as well or even a

636
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:55,640
breach if you know that the particular

637
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,650
your company has been compromised and

638
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:01,310
it's gonna be in the press

639
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:02,870
Equifax right you can get into that some

640
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:05,450
the trouble with that there was a really

641
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:07,280
interesting case with Equifax where a

642
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:09,050
bunch of people called him the question

643
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,149
why why was the CEO and some of the

644
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:12,320
other executives selling stock you know

645
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:14,360
just before the announcement of the

646
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,129
breach and they didn't get in trouble

647
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,719
because it was scheduled right they do

648
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:19,460
something they already had in place

649
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,500
before was this sort of scheduled thing

650
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:23,600
where they sell it except one guy that

651
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,340
was actually like it was not disturb who

652
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,679
was directly the CTO but he worked in

653
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:29,000
the IT he found out about the breach and

654
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,580
he went and he sold all of his stock

655
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,460
right and he ended up getting busted as

656
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:36,139
a result of that right so there's some

657
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,240
ways to mitigate that if you are doing

658
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:40,220
this the schedule type of thing I would

659
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,680
say also an industrial IOT like looking

660
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,910
things like manufacturing yields if

661
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,520
you're getting into an intellectual

662
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:47,540
property or formulas you know different

663
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,639
types of organizations are gonna be

664
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,840
targeted a lot a lot of times it's not

665
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,850
going to be the company itself it's

666
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,409
gonna be your service provider so think

667
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,179
about where where do you put your

668
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:59,090
earnings reports when you're doing you

669
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:00,920
know your PR releases does your PR firm

670
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,540
actually secure that that data how do

671
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,040
they go about doing that

672
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,810
it's maybe time to start considering

673
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,659
doing assessments for those types of

674
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:10,190
companies law firms as well a lot of

675
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,740
times I've actually found the law firms

676
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:13,610
are not very good at data security as

677
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,340
much as they should be especially

678
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:19,520
smaller firms I could be even bit like a

679
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:21,139
real estate firm as well so yeah we'd

680
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,870
even look at things like investor

681
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:26,960
relations portals that are their party

682
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:28,540
services their factories I could even

683
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,070
think that you know in securities

684
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:32,960
security with it sorry within the

685
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:34,220
company and that organization would also

686
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:39,190
have access to some of this information

687
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:41,930
so it needs to be be handled sensitively

688
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:43,520
so thinking about - how do how do we

689
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:45,860
mitigate some of this so at least we

690
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:49,010
need to start logging things monitoring

691
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:51,439
our endpoints much more verbose logging

692
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:53,270
especially if we have applications so if

693
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,800
we have like you know it's like some of

694
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:56,900
these PR firms are using for their image

695
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,820
reports the presentation types of things

696
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,740
I'm having really verbose logging

697
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:03,710
especially around authentication it's

698
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:05,720
going to be critical for that a lot of

699
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:07,490
organizations don't have any sort of DLP

700
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,870
like your data loss prevention that's

701
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:11,210
going to be helpful especially for some

702
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:13,449
of the sensitive types of data you know

703
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:15,740
getting access to your proxy firewall

704
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:17,660
user behavior analytics is becoming much

705
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:20,840
more popular especially for monitoring

706
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:22,490
for insider threats we are not really

707
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,620
relying on a signature based detection

708
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:27,560
is you're looking more for anomalies you

709
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:29,479
know if all of a sudden Susan accesses

710
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,830
this one directory that she usually

711
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,600
doesn't go to or this one particular

712
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:33,530
server that would be an anomaly and

713
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:38,240
something that wouldn't want to be

714
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:40,190
alerted on so now you also think that's

715
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,540
yes time to do assessments of our

716
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:44,450
partners especially our legal and PR

717
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:48,649
firms you know doing exercises tabletop

718
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:50,450
exercises around some of this as well so

719
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:52,790
I I'll give you guys time to write all

720
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:54,590
these down know sure I'll share the

721
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:56,960
slides with you but it's just kind of

722
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:58,669
examples of some of the technical data

723
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,570
sources as well as non-technical data

724
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:02,690
sources that you want to consider

725
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:06,560
bringing in into your environment to

726
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:09,560
monitor for this type of behavior I do a

727
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,620
lot of workshops around an insider

728
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,480
threat

729
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:15,209
this was actually a device from the FBI

730
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,910
was actually he was the the CTO the FBI

731
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:20,010
at the time he ever talk at blackhat and

732
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:22,290
this is actually how they think about

733
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:25,379
doing insider investigations on their

734
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:27,270
own agents right so it's usually not

735
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:29,970
something that obviously you'll steal

736
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:32,460
this information it's usually there's

737
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:33,750
indicators before that I kind of refer

738
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,990
to them as human indicators of

739
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:39,510
compromise right so if someone is having

740
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:41,220
financial difficulties a lot of times if

741
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:43,379
someone's going through a divorce things

742
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,720
like that they're they're more likely to

743
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,950
commit these types of acts doesn't mean

744
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,270
that everyone that in your company is

745
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:50,160
getting divorce you got to like start

746
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:51,840
watching them no that's not the case but

747
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,510
you have to realize that it does

748
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,459
increase their the risk of that or at

749
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:57,929
least have confidential reporting like

750
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:00,570
if someone overhears someone having a

751
00:28:57,929 --> 00:29:02,610
conversation or if all of a sudden Jill

752
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:07,980
and I tea drives up in a Ferrari right

753
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:08,820
that might be an indicator as well so

754
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,650
that's on that kind of on the

755
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,909
non-technical indicator side and it's

756
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:13,050
usually when you start to look at luck

757
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:15,240
and detection that's when we start

758
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:18,030
leveraging technology to do that before

759
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:22,559
they actually cause damage or exil trade

760
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:24,420
data from an organization and I'm sorry

761
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,950
I went a little fast on this but if you

762
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:28,790
guys have any questions ideas or stock

763

tips here's my my contact information

764

00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:48,450
bunch of links to a bunch of the cases

769
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:50,010
as well some of the actual criminal

770
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:52,110
complaints they're really fun to read

771
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:54,170
actually I like going through those so

772
00:29:52,110 --> 00:30:00,629
I'll share that with you guys when I

773

00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:06,300
the questions alright so you guys are

775
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:10,160
gonna be doing this type of act don't

776
