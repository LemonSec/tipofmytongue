so kicking things off we are talking

38
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,469
about info security versus digital

39
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,990
security

40
00:01:56,469 --> 00:02:01,538
we are gonna dive in and look at how we

41
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:03,460
can help give people context for what it

42
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:04,509
is that we do in this crazy world and

43
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:07,160
the take it away

44
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:09,068

00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:18,430
obviously thank you for all coming I was

48
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:19,780
not expecting a full room or at least

49
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:23,379
pretty close to it so I appreciate I

50
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:25,689
guess I used the right title and so my

51
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:29,018
reference is actually to the movie war

52
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:31,650
game not jigsaw so though a viewer

53
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:35,500
wanted to expect the other one I'm sorry

54
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:37,629
so thank you all for showing up I will

55
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,909

realized that I was not the guy that's

61
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:52,480

loved security I loved those sort of

63
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,138

64
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,560
actually connecting people with other

65
00:02:56,139 --> 00:03:02,739

forward going things like this and

113
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,040
trying to figure everything else in all

114

117
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:05,460
need so as a salesperson I always go

118
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:08,640
into this whole thing of awesome they

119
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:10,739
say I only have so much budget and as a

120
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,500
security guy we need to get out of the

121
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:16,260
ideas of budget is the magic number

122
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,720
it is about aligning it to business it's

123
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:21,180
about business risk sort of like IT

124
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,430
infrastructure servers networks they all

125
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,640
have projects they have complete control

126
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:29,160
of everything they do every day there is

127
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,770
no like okay and we they can get four

128
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,090
nines by putting redundancy in all of

129
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,409
those systems they can get four nines

130
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,469
their life is pretty simple and they

131
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:39,960
have complete control over what they do

132
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:43,110
we do not we are only going to get maybe

133
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,659
to 80% we are planning on failing there

134
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:48,420
is no four nines in our ways at all and

135
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,010
they don't seem to understand that I've

136
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,020
got customers of all sudden like said

137
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,640
you know what I went in to see I needed

138
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,340
more headcount and an infrastructure

139
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,440
manager and the server manager says why

140
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,210
do you need somebody I have I'm not

141
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,070
getting anymore why does security need

142
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:06,210
to have more people it's like because my

143
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:08,390
job is not a project my project my job

144
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:10,560
is always changing always moving always

145
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:12,659
expanding the new stuff that they buy

146
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,620
affects me 10 times more than the

147
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:19,340
stuff you guys on the soy there so how

148
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:22,560
how do we do that

149
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:24,539
we have to find a way to talk to people

150
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,200
who are not in security who have never

151
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:30,840
sat in your shoes to experience the

152
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:34,140
change the flow everything that you guys

153
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:36,119
do every day and how many variables that

154
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:38,490
you have no control over

155
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,949
in your life that also and change and go

156
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:43,169
from there and screw up your day pull

157
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:47,790
you off your project and go to the next

158
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:51,330
phase we had to figure that out well too

159
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:52,860
early so the question is is how do we do

160
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:56,280
this and how did I come up with so I

161
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:59,100
created a dice game I started out this

162
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,659
about a year ago for gherkin and explain

163
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,449
cuz I was trying to figure out how can I

164
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,250
explain this to people not IT or how can

165
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:08,430
you all explain to what you really do

166
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:10,260
without getting technical in last year I

167
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,610
had some I went on Kickstarter which I

168
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,860
love Kickstarter my wife hates it

169
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:16,530
because I have I think 20 in the last

170
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,880
year that I've sponsored and they just

171
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:19,530
keep coming in it's like where'd you buy

172
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,590
this Oh a year ago don't worry about

173
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:25,440
honey it's already the checkbook it's a

174
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:26,909
long time ago so last year I got a

175
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,219
Kickstarter which was just three dice

176
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,389
you know and I brought like I 20 or 30

177
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,830
of them here and everybody loved them

178
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:33,180
right it's like oh this is fun this is

179
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,949
just a you know and then I took it in

180
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,660
front of Phil Keebler Meier he says I

181
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:38,310
love this sort of thing because it's

182
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,260
just a conversation starter it's

183
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,880
something that we can roll this dice and

184
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,979
we can say what happens and people can

185
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:47,490
see and mostly it was I use your

186
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:49,200
problems like ID 210 you know issues

187
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,789
between keyboard and chair

188
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,349
those sort of things roll into the

189
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:55,139
issues or even application security

190
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:57,330
concerns and it started me thinking like

191
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,979
okay if I can roll this into some sort

192
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,630
of dice game just to start a

193
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,770
conversation started just so that

194
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,900
someone can have a conversation

195
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:06,359
understand all the variables that you

196
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,888
guys work with then that's at least a

197
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,919
starting point and that's what I started

198
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:14,880
with in it's already gone through three

199
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:16,740
permutations so basically Ike went

200
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,380
through and created these three dice

201
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:22,050
variables broke them out to programs

202
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:24,780
variables and businesses so programs are

203
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:28,500
things like incident response identity

204
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:30,750
access vulnerability management you know

205
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,010
threat cloud those things are all

206
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,599
changing these are all different

207
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,789
verticals in the areas that you guys

208
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,250
have to deal with no matter what part of

209
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:39,718
IT your security you're in they all

210
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,490
affect you one way or another this is

211
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,320
also what all CEOs have to deal with you

212
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:45,150
have all these different programs or I

213
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,530
don't know if they're all programs but

214
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,569
they're you know they should be programs

215
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,939
or at least instances that go build and

216
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,040
go from there

217
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:54,649
the variables of course this changes

218
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,689
around is users because users always

219
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:58,640
screw up or they do some good jobs IT

220
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,529
admins someone makes a mistake not

221
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,240
necessarily security but someone in the

222
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:05,240
networking team leave something open

223
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,890
marketing goes and buys an AWS puts a

224
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:11,740
credit card down and opens things up and

225
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:14,330
data goes back through or even you know

226
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:16,730
threatened tell if you get bad threat

227
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:18,529
intelligence from there so in the last

228
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,940
one of course is the green one is what

229
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:21,770
sort of a C cell would be able to

230
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,029
control like your partners who you trust

231
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,439
are they really good or they just

232
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:26,630
probably buy a new products are they

233
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,700
gonna be there to help you out when

234
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:30,320
hits the fan because as we know

235
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,510
hits the fan somewhere somewhere down

236
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,640
our path sooner or later our job is

237
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:36,020
gonna be pain and the most important

238
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,500
thing is to have someone you can rely on

239
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:41,720
or not rely on at least you'll know that

240
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:43,190
also budget budget goes up and down in

241
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,350
IT security and that's the thing we have

242
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:47,149
to fight is that security should not be

243
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,709
fluctuated by the budget unless you're

244
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:49,820
going to increase it because of an

245
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:50,930
increase which you know we're all in the

246
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,450
same rooms were all in the same page of

247
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:55,520
that day you'll disagree with us

248
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:58,010
staffing I'm sure you all have open

249
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:00,260
spots in your groups that you work with

250
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:03,560
or even training or training gets cut

251
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:05,180
people leave new people come in new

252
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,010
things come into the picture so that

253
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:09,620
always is one more variable that a CSO

254
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:10,939
has to deal with there's also the

255
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,380
business risk because that's what we're

256
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,959
lining to so in other words if your

257
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:17,839
company is very risk tolerant they say

258
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,520
oh we just make widgets okay that's that

259
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,500
they don't have they don't think of that

260
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,699
as a risk issue for their customer it

261
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,440
goes from there they're gonna keep

262
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,089
moving forward but some companies are

263
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,800
very risk you know they need to make

264
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:29,180
sure it's everything's locked down and

265
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,709
go from there it's sort of like I don't

266
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,870
know if you all heard Matt Carpenter

267
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:33,979
speak I mean it's a crazy crazy world

268
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:37,370
and that's a risk that I don't think

269
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:42,200
anybody else understands and then let's

270
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:44,959
see that I think that's also you see two

271
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:48,399
other symbols on these dice one is the

272
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:51,739
Gherkin skull and then one is the binary

273
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,149
so binary code so when I was creating

274
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,680
these dice I had to come up these two

275
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:56,360
wild card solutions and I asked Chris

276
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,310
Payne all right here's your opportunity

277
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,720
to decide which way you want to go he

278
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:02,599
said I said do you want the Gherkin

279
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,379
skull to be bad or good he says good

280
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,869
okay

281
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:07,220
that's where we'll go for this and then

282
00:11:05,869 --> 00:11:10,970
the binaries of course is the bad

283
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:12,439
wildcard so here is assistance so also

284
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,799
here's the first permutation of the dice

285
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:14,089
game

286
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:15,889
so in other words the first set of dice

287
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:18,169
was just to roll it skin you know go

288
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:21,349
from there this came up is that each

289
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:24,679
category you have one detailed 12 dice

290
00:11:21,349 --> 00:11:25,759
to roll you roll the dice and each one

291
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:27,409
at the start of the game to figure

292
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:30,139
things out of how many points you have

293
00:11:27,409 --> 00:11:33,079
and there's the hole so the plus and

294
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:35,779
minus what's that's a great what's this

295
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:37,939
deal all as you roll these dice it also

296
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:39,769
changes your aspects of everything that

297
00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:41,029
goes on in your day every day so in

298
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:43,549
other words also and you roll the dice

299
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:44,959
you get them magically you get identity

300
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:46,639
access management also and you get a

301
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,709
negative it means somebody screwed up an

302
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,869
ID X mismanagement or someone forgot to

303
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:55,008
delete somebody or you roll a plus or

304
00:11:50,869 --> 00:11:56,720
minus is in the in users so there were

305
00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:58,729
some user clicked on mail where it opens

306
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,309
the door it changes your variables it

307
00:11:58,729 --> 00:12:04,220
goes from there so the first step of

308
00:12:01,309 --> 00:12:07,879
course is to roll the d12 right and that

309
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:11,059
will give you obviously 3d 12 equals 36

310
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:11,509
potential the goal of the game is to get

311
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:13,819
to 30

312
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:16,159
so that also throws it you don't have to

313
00:12:13,819 --> 00:12:18,108
be perfect and everything you just have

314
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:20,149
to get to a certain level to reduce your

315
00:12:18,109 --> 00:12:21,259
risk that's what we always do we know

316
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:24,679
that we're never going to be perfect

317
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:26,989
it's that whole perspective and then

318
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:28,309
also the links of how many rolls so in

319
00:12:26,989 --> 00:12:29,779
other words you can make this four

320
00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:31,939
rounds so in other words you can go four

321
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:34,369
quarters per year you can extend it out

322
00:12:31,939 --> 00:12:37,129
to six times a month so you know half or

323
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:38,929
you can do 12 times or three years so

324
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:40,970
just it's a variable time so that gives

325
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:42,619
you that perspective of a C so either

326
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,989
going through every quarter of the year

327
00:12:42,619 --> 00:12:46,309
every month of the year and that way

328
00:12:44,989 --> 00:12:48,139
you're starting to get this pattern of

329
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:51,439
these checkpoints you go from one point

330
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:53,779
the next and as you go through the next

331
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:56,089
step of course as you roll the dice two

332
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:58,129
sets of green two sets of black two sets

333
00:12:56,089 --> 00:13:00,259
of white so one is a category of what

334
00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:02,119
terror category it is the next is the

335
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:04,429
outcome from going from there and these

336
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:06,679
start to change your variables on the

337
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:09,409
side of the twelve sided dice you also

338
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:12,319
can either go play with yourself on this

339
00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:13,549
on your own story of having the seaso

340
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,019
dice and try to get better so you can

341
00:13:13,549 --> 00:13:17,300
have conversations or you can have

342
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:18,769
everybody has a set of dice and you can

343
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:21,199
go against here see who's the best t so

344
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:22,700
in the group to go from there there you

345
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,370
go it's always a competition right one

346
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:27,260
way or another so you roll those dice

347
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:29,269
and then you match up the colors and

348
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,860
then we go to this matrix that we've

349
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:32,810
created just to add plus and minus like

350
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:35,060
I said this is still rudimentary idea

351
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:37,310
game to get this so this is really not

352
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:38,359
for you to experience being an IT

353
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:40,250
security person but to have a

354
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,980
conversation with somebody to help them

355
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:45,529
understand what you do by playing a game

356
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,000
so these are just the matrix that we

357
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:48,829
created to sort of factor out so in

358
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,769
other words if also and you rolled I am

359
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:53,719
in category and you rolled you know the

360
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:54,860
lead score there's the binary code you

361
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,779
would have a minus three on that

362
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,880
category so if you had an eight you

363
00:13:56,779 --> 00:13:59,959
would also go down to a five on that one

364
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,950
and the other ones would match up

365
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:02,540
through the whole system

366
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:05,450
this conversation probably will not be

367
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:07,459
an hour just to let you know you do this

368
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,480
all the time and the you know so you

369
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:10,310
lured you set up how many times you're

370
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,440
gonna roll and then the first person to

371
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:15,079
thirty wins or at least the closest

372
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,490
person to 30 wins that game so as we've

373
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:18,019
been doing this through the tests it's

374
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,519
been very interesting also and someone

375
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:21,170
gets a twenty eight one round and then

376
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,640
they're down to fourteen the next round

377
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,810
so it's very interesting how it all

378
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,860
fluctuates and goes through certain

379
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,660
lower just because you're getting the

380
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,220
big number this eat today you're not

381
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,630
gonna be a winner tomorrow right the

382
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,250
next round you may go to the bottom of

383
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:33,430
the park someone may go up to the top

384
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:36,110
and go from there so it's definitely a

385
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,739
simulation of what IT security does

386
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,360
every day

387
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,190
in comparison to what other groups do

388
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,630
it's always that variable I think that's

389
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,850
giving that and everybody I've shown

390
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,290
this to we've done the demos has like

391
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,990
that this is exactly what we deal with

392
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:49,399
at a day to day basis of what the

393
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,870
craziness in our life is that we're

394
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:52,940
always winning or always losing it's

395
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:54,680
always it's never gonna be a keepo

396
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,670
continual ramp it's always a Jake Jack

397
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,149
going from there

398
00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:00,560
so so there we go so here's the next

399
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:02,600
permutation us as throw this out there

400
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,069
all sudden as I was talking some people

401
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,170
like okay well what happens about

402
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:08,300
hackers because it's not we don't live

403
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:10,849
in our own bubble we start throwing that

404
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,949
together this does it basically starts

405
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:14,540
to show you the influence of outside

406
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:16,219
influence that's going to attack us not

407
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,829
just your own little bubble this is that

408
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:21,320
next phase of that infrastructure

409
00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:22,519
servers and application people don't

410
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,029
have to worry about as they're building

411
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:27,170
their stuff so black and red so in other

412
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:28,610
words they have the same thing as

413
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,770
programs because they're trying to get

414
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,040
into your I am they're trying to ruin

415
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,180
your

416
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,529
vulnerability management programs

417
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,120
they're trying to do this so they have

418
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:36,920
the same things in the programs the

419
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,690
variables they also have the same attack

420
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:42,079
surface or your guys the protection of

421
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:44,570
admins users staffing those are things

422
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,540
but they also also when we go run it

423
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,959
like a business they have things like

424
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,889
vulnerabilities they find a

425
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:50,300
vulnerability they don't have

426
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:51,949
vulnerability they have blocks they've

427
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,479
been blocked and here and there so it's

428
00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:56,060
that whole another hacker dice it's

429
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,430
throwing that corruption side they also

430
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:01,518
start out as a business each of them and

431
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:03,258
their goal is to get to 30 and then you

432
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,389
they also have the plus and minus dices

433
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:07,600
with also those and they have their own

434
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:11,000
category dice but as you'll notice

435
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,100
they're binary is the positive the

436
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,899
Gherkin skull is the negative so in

437
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,190
other words it's that they also now

438
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:17,569
they're flipping on their side they're

439
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,639
running their own business versus the

440
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:22,699
anti right there the anti C cell the

441
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:23,449
corruption so and you repeat this over

442
00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:25,790
this whole time

443
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:28,040
the winner posts 30 wins after so many

444
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:30,019
times so if the hacker Coulson so now

445
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,579
you're competing not versus other C

446
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:33,110
cells but now you're competing against

447
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:34,060
someone who's trying to break in and

448
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:36,889
ruin your job

449
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:38,959
second permutation here we go so in

450
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:41,300
order playing this game all sudden you

451
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:44,359
come into the second role whoever is

452
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:46,880
below 10 also and switches out the C so

453
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,220
dice is the corruption dice at that

454
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,670
point you roll it two more times through

455
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:54,050
the system then all sudden if you or the

456
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,699
corruption dice is beating the other

457
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:58,399
people so words also in the corruption

458
00:16:55,699 --> 00:17:00,620
dice goes to 15 and someone is at 12

459
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,329
they also enroll over sort of that whole

460
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,309
thing of going through the things that

461
00:17:02,329 --> 00:17:06,198
one bad environment creates another bad

462
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:08,629
environment and you keep rolling to go

463
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:10,549
through those permutations it's just to

464
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:12,140
give you that perspective that is the

465
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:13,629
story of the game it's very short and

466
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,919
sweet but it's always growing always

467
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:18,199
always good

468
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,839
we already starting to talk about next

469
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:22,790
three turns to build this game up the

470
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:24,379
next idea is more advanced reputation so

471
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:26,599
the first part would be you'd roll the

472
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:28,010
dice to get budget every year so in

473
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:29,959
other words like we said we do the three

474
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:32,210
year window at the beginning of the day

475
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,040
you roll dice you get a budget to put in

476
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:35,630
certain categories to protect yourself

477
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,830
so many point the unit so in other words

478
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,780
if you roll the three you could put it

479
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:40,280
at I am some words if all sudden the

480
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,389
negative comes at I am you're protecting

481
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,908
yourself from there and it goes through

482
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,870
there every so often every four quarters

483
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:46,910
or whatever you

484
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:48,949
to roll the budget dice throw it back in

485
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:51,050
so now you're starting to play that next

486
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:53,540
permutation of what you guys really do

487
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:55,010
at that next level to get that

488
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,510
experience of this is now you're having

489
00:17:55,010 --> 00:18:00,200
control and not just a random variable

490
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:02,210
experience that is what we're doing

491
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,680
there's also the body of putting cards

492
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:06,530
to it so that you can buy and acquire

493
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:09,230
things and go from that and build that

494
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:10,970
game up more and more and this is an

495
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:12,800
actually testing feedback input this is

496
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:15,080
what we're gonna do so to be honest at

497
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,879
Optive booth that's cuz I work where

498
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,470
that's where we have a booth I have dice

499
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,240
so we can run through these if you want

500
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:21,950
to try it out I would appreciate it so I

501
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,090
can get your guys's feedback everything

502
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:25,370
the test groups that I've done already

503
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:27,649
we're getting a lot of feedback a lot of

504
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:29,600
permutations the idea at least is

505
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:31,640
initial phase is just to have

506
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,379
conversations the idea to expand this

507
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,840
game up even more and more so it's a

508
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:37,490
real game that you guys experience every

509
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,709
day in your life to explain to somebody

510
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:41,990
who does not have your experience does

511
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:43,760
not work in the system to understand all

512
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,440
the variables and also how to possibly

513
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,450
train somebody to do these things so it

514
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:52,429
could be incident response sort of a

515
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:56,150
module off to the side y gir content

516
00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:58,070
that's next year I think the dates are

517
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,840
current at the end of October and Y is

518
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:02,450
gear content we're gonna do a

519
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,590
Kickstarter for this in 2020 so we

520
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:05,510
should hopefully have a Kickstarter

521
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:07,490
kicking up we're gonna build this game

522
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:11,000
up it will be on Kickstarter to spin it

523
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:13,760
up to celebrate Gore content 2020 that's

524
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,300
the idea like I said we need to spin

525
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,860
this up

526
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,809
I've getting vendors already sponsoring

527
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,550
we're not it is not going to be a vendor

528
00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:21,139
sponsored game because they all get

529
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,909
bought all the time and move around so

530
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:25,429
we don't want to brand the game that way

531
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:27,280
but it is an opportunity for you guys in

532
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:29,870
us to explain what we do for a living

533
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,370
have it go forward and move forward so

534
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:34,520
that's it so if we can have your trust

535
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:36,350
in that so I am NOT imagine that a

536
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,850
Facebook or any so this is the only

537
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,809
social media I use is LinkedIn because

538
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,639
that's what I do

539
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:42,920
and it's really just to keep context so

540
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,690
I can reach out to people I we created

541
