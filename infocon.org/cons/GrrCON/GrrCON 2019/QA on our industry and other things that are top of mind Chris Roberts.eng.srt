7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,330

who's been messing around over the car

32
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,920
the car hacking village by the way is in

33
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,369
a big gun chance to go hang out over

34
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,220
there go hang out over there we've had

35
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:50,939
Robert Robert brought his own personal

36
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:52,890
Tesla in um we had a a lot of fun and B

37
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,289
it was an amazing collaborative thing

38
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,840
about two versus sat down poor Robert

39
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,479
was having a massage and we got into the

40
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,740
Tesla in under a minute while he was

41
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,329
having a massage because we set the

42
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,759
alarm off a couple of times that some of

43
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:07,500
you might hurt then we managed to figure

44
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,030
I had to actually Jack the damn Tesla

45
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,739
and then literally it's taken us like

46
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,989
three hours to get into the freakin

47
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,920
glove box of a damn thing but we're in

48
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:17,129
and we've got them

49
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,799
so we're in good shape all right

50
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:22,530
Kalin come sit down don't make a noise

51
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,349
by the door I promise is civilized

52
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,610
mostly alright so here's some of the

53
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:28,410
stuff we're gonna talk about I was gonna

54
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,849
have a co-host up here I've lost her

55
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,609
she's floating around somewhere I

56
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:37,260
pointed out if I can find her well she's

57
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:38,519
escaped so these are just some of the

58
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,569
things we're gonna go through and on

80
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,700
gonna have a moment if you don't mind

81
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,810
speaking of moments which one of you

82
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,078
bastards

83
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:49,230
hacked the dam my hotel at six o'clock

84
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:52,019
this morning and turn the fucking fire

85
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:54,268
alarm on turn the warning to the fire

86
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:55,200
alarm on first and then the stupid fire

87
00:03:54,269 --> 00:04:00,389
alarm came on

88
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:03,200
oh god this is good alright first

89
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:07,410
question first way of looking at this

90
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:10,530
why are we failing for which it all

91
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:13,579
comes down to a kettle this is not a

92
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:16,470
colonial English tea versus coffee thing

93
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:19,228
cast your minds back to when you were

94
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:21,539
all kids and your guardians or parents

95
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:24,690
one of the things they said to you was

96
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:26,520
it's a stove or it's a kettle don't

97
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:30,389
touch it it's hot

98
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:33,448
what did we all do touch a stupid thing

99
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:36,590
didn't we as we got a little older and

100
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:39,300
as we went through the school system as

101
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,770
you and your friends got together and

102
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,240
they're like hey this is a really cool

103
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,340
idea and in the back of your mind that

104
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,400
little voice with L no it's not

105
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,960
what do we do we chased off into the

106
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,560
distance oh my god our asses handed to

107
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:57,289
us so my thing on this whole part of the

108
00:04:52,560 --> 00:05:01,319
industry is back to the cattle example

109
00:04:57,289 --> 00:05:04,800
we as humans seem to have to need to

110
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:08,340
experience something before we actually

111
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,380
fix it one of the challenges we have in

112
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,270
this industry is we've been talking for

113
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,380
twenty thirty plus years now come on in

114
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:17,490
sit down don't make the place look

115
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:20,069
untidy grab a doc here people that have

116
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:23,699
just come in have a doc there you go it

117
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:24,470
has to be food bloody good cats frickin

118
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,759
awesome

119
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:33,090
yeah he's not getting the beer bugger

120
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:34,440
off so is us in the industry and Kathy

121
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,789
all have talked about this we've been on

122
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,990
the stage a number of time a couple of

123
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:41,990
us are talking about this but I think it

124
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:45,120
needs to be discussed more is how do we

125
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,630
communicate with people around us in the

126
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,370
industry

127
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,630
because if I simply come up to you and

128
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,940
go hey the kettle is hot and you're like

129
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,229
whatever if I go like look no let's

130
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,880
let's talk about physics let's talk

131
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:54,870
about chemistry let's think about all

132
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,190
this one of the things and how the

133
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,330
frickin metal is hot cuz the water's

134
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,469
bloody boiling and it cuz you're putting

135
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,568
electricity into the stupid thing you

136
00:05:58,469 --> 00:06:01,919
like hey I like that idea but if I get

137
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:04,259
hold of your hand like a fucking thing's

138
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,789
hot New York shit it is I'm not doing

139
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:08,550
that again

140
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:12,150
we translate that into our business

141
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:13,740
world and we see that so often in the

142
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,539
business world which is run like hey

143
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,949
your ass is going to get handed to you

144
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:19,680
you're gonna get breached unless you do

145
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:22,710
a B C and D now we're perfectly okay we

146
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:27,840
are invulnerable or we have cyber

147
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:29,310
liability insurance and then I sit down

148
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,068
and I have a conversation with you and I

149
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:33,990
go hey here are the statistics here is

150
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:36,089
the businesses here is the last two

151
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,440
months worth of breaches and you're like

152
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:38,639
well that's terrible it's a really bad

153
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,380
thing but I'm fine

154
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,060
I've got pal

155
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,820
I've got a firewall and I am in

156
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,350
vulnerable and I just sit there and I

157
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,690
wait for your ass to get handed to you

158
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:51,240
and you go well dammit why didn't you

159
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:54,270
tell me these things after you've been

160
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:59,490
breached so the challenge then becomes

161
00:06:54,270 --> 00:07:01,289
can we actually fix the humans well this

162
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:09,900
is probably the simplest way of looking

163
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:11,730
at it so for years we've all

164
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,349
flip-flopped backwards and forwards

165
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,360
there have been numerous times I've

166
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,670
stood on stages this one included and

167
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,700
simply said we need to exclude the

168
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:22,050
humans from all of these things and

169
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,159
eventually machines will take over and

170
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,050
well we'll be out of the picture

171
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,180
hopefully there is a possibility of that

172
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:29,310
one but there's also the thing which is

173
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,620
like look we can't give up on humans we

174
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,910
shouldn't give up on humans and the

175
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,330
question then becomes how do we

176
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:37,200
effectively communicate with everybody

177
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,359
around us

178
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,550
good show of hands how many of you are

179
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,940
aware of the whole all-day DevOps thing

180
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:48,570
that's going on November the 6th all

181
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:52,860
right the rest of you it's a really nice

182
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:55,620
all day 24-hour free conference 150 of

183
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:59,120
us online all around the globe talking

184
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:02,850
about collaboration between development

185
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:07,710
operations and security and how do we

186
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:08,940
work effectively together one of the

187
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:10,739
best ways we were looking at this the

188
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:13,260
other day is talking to somebody in a

189
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,520
leadership organization and we started

190
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,409
talking with somebody started talking

191
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,500
about networks and you could see this

192
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:22,680
CEO was like does not compute must go to

193
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,330
happy place and I'm like fucking this

194
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,680
guy's like I'll IP address and this and

195
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,330
this and it's beating shit out of you

196
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,150
and it's do you roll the blame dices

197
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:33,598
like I was Russia today and you're like

198
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:35,819
okay that's not sinking in when we talk

199
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:39,000
to humans let's talk about instead of an

200
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:43,020
IP address it's a house address it's the

201
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,570
same thing when we talk about ports we

202
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:48,689
all talk about port 80 or 23 or 21 or

203
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:51,750
3389 screw that talk about windows and

204
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:54,350
doors in the house and how when you

205
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:56,520
leave them open it's

206
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:58,410
bless you if he sneeze again you have

207
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:03,029
lucky and we take you outside and drown

208
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:05,279
you confluence the easiest way to deal

209
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:08,420
with it I'm sorry I haven't got my taser

210
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,890
with me that did get taken off me TSA

211
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,599
they let all the hacking shit through

212
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:17,370
that I can basically take off the planet

213
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:20,580
over with me took my taser bastards I'm

214
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:22,350
kind of torn it's like whiskey and yeah

215
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,470
this is good I'm on an aeroplane later

216
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:28,860
so it'll be fun so from that standpoint

217
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,660
we start going okay well how do we deal

218
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,770
with the humans how do we communicate

219
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,670
with the humans how do we have

220
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:37,500
conversations with them and it's simple

221
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:40,110
you in this room quick show of hands how

222
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:43,260
many of you are in our industry security

223
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:45,270
IT InfoSec development or whatever all

224
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,300
right I've said this Laster and I'll

225
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:50,220
said again this year next time you bring

226
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:53,370
somebody next time you come to one of

227
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:59,070
these conferences bring somebody with

228
00:09:53,370 --> 00:10:02,760
you who's not in this industry bribe

229
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:03,779
them with tea coffee buns scones I don't

230
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,010
know if you have to blood you just like

231
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:07,410
knock them over the head for half an

232
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:09,089
hour while you drag them here but bring

233
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:11,670
somebody along who's outside of this

234
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:16,470
industry help them understand what we

235
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:17,969
are about and conversely go to other

236
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:22,589
conferences and meetings that have

237
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:24,270
nothing to do with this start helping

238
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:26,370
and bringing everybody else into this

239
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,870
realm and also start going out to these

240
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,880
runs and having conversations with

241
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:34,740
people and again it's their language not

242
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:37,140
ours so obviously we're in a technology

243
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,190
world there's a lot of vendors out there

244
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,380
that's saying that they're going to fix

245
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:44,640
everything so the question is can

246
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:45,740
technology fix it here's my answer to

247
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,400
that one

248
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:52,880
if you experience it as a human and if I

249
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,110
get out of the way of the damn screen

250
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,200
you might actually listen you might

251
00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:02,490
actually do something about it this is a

252
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:04,890
human thing we have arguably most of the

253
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:08,040
technology that we need to fix a lot of

254
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:10,019
these problems buying next year

255
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,449
firewall with a different color blinky

256
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:15,420
light isn't really gonna serve you much

257
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:17,639
better than this year's firewall buying

258
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,620
endpoint protection detection which

259
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:22,410
let's be honest is like antivirus with

260
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:24,660
better marketing isn't gonna help you

261
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:28,500
any more effectively if you haven't

262
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:30,810
sorted the human element out the stuff I

263
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,329
do we work intersection technology it's

264
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:34,709
great if you deploy properly but if I

265
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:36,388
walk into a company and they're like are

266
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:38,699
we put deception around the service I'm

267
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:41,040
fuckin all of you users for God's sakes

268
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:44,339
what about you cloud what about all the

269
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,759
ICS IOT stuff oh well we didn't think

270
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:50,569
about that

271
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:52,860
dumbasses obviously we all have cyber

272
00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:53,819
save us all this ice you probably drink

273
00:11:52,860 --> 00:12:00,630
at this point shouldn't I

274
00:11:53,819 --> 00:12:02,040
sorry who the cyber cyber cyber this is

275
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:06,180
something that you can take through the

276
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:08,459
organizations that you work with many of

277
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:11,339
us sit on the red team's side of the

278
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:13,138
world we actually know what it is to

279
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:15,180
collaborate communicate and

280
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:17,130
cooperatively break everybody else's

281
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:20,609
shed we just did it with the Tesla for

282
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:21,930
crying out loud we all of us is like

283
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:26,579
half a dozen of us we got the pictures

284
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:29,760
on the Internet's now we have as an

285
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:31,469
attacker a much more effective method of

286
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,149
communicating and collaborating if I

287
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:35,730
want to break into an organization I

288
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:37,410
grab maybe the framework from somebody

289
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:39,569
in North Korea or somebody in Bali

290
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:41,699
somewhere else I bribed the tools from

291
00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:43,709
somebody in the Soviet Union or Israel I

292
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:45,269
grabbed the financial stuff from the

293
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:46,859
guys over in Estonia and I grabbed a

294
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:50,370
real nice botnet from the guys down in

295
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,959
Brazil and we communicate collaborate

296
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,750
and what I've taken all of your data I

297
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:59,609
monetize it through however many means

298
00:12:54,750 --> 00:13:03,779
and channels we the attacking side have

299
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:10,259
figured it out but unfortunately inside

300
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:13,310
organizations let's be honest we're

301
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:13,310
still in our silos

302
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:20,160
how many of you can honestly look in a

303
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:23,130
mirror and admit to yourself that you've

304
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:26,520
maybe blamed the developers or blame the

305
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:28,980
network team or blamed operations or

306
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:32,810
users I've blamed my own mother and

307
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:37,200
grandmother for crying aloud on stage

308
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:41,040
over the years but unfortunately a lot

309
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:44,490
of it comes down to us we're the ones in

310
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:47,969
the industry we're the ones that have to

311
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:50,570
be the ones that reach out and can be

312
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:53,460
Yoona Kate with everybody else out there

313
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:56,400
we have to be the ones that eat the

314
00:13:53,460 --> 00:14:01,380
humble pie go to the rest of the

315
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:03,600
business and go how can we help you how

316
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:05,130
can I help you understand the rest and

317
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,710
you know what there are some

318
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:10,680
organization too it's just are not going

319
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:12,690
to listen simple as that there are users

320
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:16,020
which won't listen no matter what you do

321
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:19,470
your job is to build as much protection

322
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:22,020
around them and put as much of a safety

323
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:25,170
net underneath them so that when they do

324
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:28,319
fail they don't take everybody else down

325
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:32,459
with them sometimes that's the best we

326
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:39,060
can do haze of them in a dark alley is

327
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:42,840
also another option current state of

328
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:45,209
information security in one's life yes

329
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,220
feel free to use this alright so

330
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:48,630
obviously it means we have to spend more

331
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,800
money doesn't it I mean for God's sakes

332
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,960
I mean what do we do we throw more money

333
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,740
at the problem this is what we are going

334
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:58,740
to be spending this year in security a

335
00:14:54,740 --> 00:15:02,660
hundred and twenty four billion freaking

336
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:05,370
dollars now some of that is sunk costs

337
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:09,199
the gear and technology that you already

338
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:15,000
have has to be maintained to some degree

339
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:17,700
but so much of that is new spend the

340
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,840
blinky lights at RSA and a black hat and

341
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:26,640
everywhere else the vendors telling you

342
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:32,100
they can fix your problem solve security

343
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:34,350
anti hacking software bastards simple

344
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:37,830
stuff your responsibilities as the

345
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:41,160
gatekeepers is to be asking those

346
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:44,120
awkward questions is to be having the

347
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:47,880
conversations with the leadership and

348
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:50,460
educating them in a way that they

349
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:53,610
understand so that when they do get

350
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:55,770
blinded by propaganda bullshit that so

351
00:15:53,610 --> 00:16:00,000
many people are putting out there they

352
00:15:55,770 --> 00:16:01,500
actually get to see through it in other

353
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,260
words you get to be the cynic for the

354
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,270
company so obviously we're spending all

355
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:12,350
this money is it actually helping well

356
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:15,590
short answer no six trillion by 2021

357
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:20,910
damages and all the other shit rolled in

358
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:22,590
we have to change this I think if memory

359
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:25,579
serves me right somebody did the numbers

360
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:31,160
on that that's like the third largest

361
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:34,650
global expenditure it's crazy

362
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:36,600
so we're spending all the money the fact

363
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:39,890
we're not doing much with it obviously

364
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,890
we have to have the conversation

365
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:47,810
of course we can blame the bloody French

366
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:53,010
all right who recognizes what that is

367
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:54,979
give me an answer all right one that was

368
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:58,170
supposed to us give me imagine up now

369
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:06,140
who where there sorry shit two four oh

370
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:13,020
good bloody catch splendid mmm all right

371
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:16,199
show of hands how many of you think you

372
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:24,920
could keep an attacker out of your

373
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:32,690
organisation any of you fair comment

374
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:34,830
semi averagely well skilled attacker hmm

375
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:37,940
you can unplug whatever you want I'm

376
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,939
still coming in through the front door

377
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:50,820
all right if we truly believe that we

378
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:53,820
can't keep anybody out why the hell are

379
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:58,080
we still sitting behind firewalls IDS's

380
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:59,730
IPS is DLP's heads literally like this

381
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,010
like the Trojans gonna fucking bring it

382
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,990
on bastards when the son of a bitch is

383
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:05,370
probably already on the inside oh shit

384
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:10,650
your data's on all go I see let me just

385
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:12,209
figure it out for you quickly just need

386
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:15,330
that zip it all up properly before I

387
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:22,200
exfil it using cat videos on the

388
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:25,559
internet so if we truly don't think that

389
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:28,470
we can keep somebody out why are we

390
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:34,500
still focused on this Premonition

391
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:36,929
preconceived idea of the perimeter all

392
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,090
of you should be having the

393
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:41,460
conversations with your organisations

394
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:44,340
and the people that are around you and

395
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:47,370
everybody saying there is no such thing

396
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:49,409
as the perimeter that the devices we

397
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:52,260
carry the systems we had every piece of

398
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:54,450
this technology is an attack vector let

399
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:57,300
alone the two-legged people the

400
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:59,250
we have to deal with as well it's all an

401
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:02,909
attack vector so how do we approach

402
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:05,370
things differently how do we assume that

403
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:08,340
somebody has already breached and at

404
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:09,239
which point in time a how are you going

405
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,639
to know about it

406
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:18,200
and what are you gonna do about it when

407
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:18,200
you finally find them all right

408
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:27,810
this is the biggie so something Cathy's

409
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,450
talked about a lot and Cathy years ago

410
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:32,190
just for reference challenged me because

411
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:34,230
there is a distinct possibility on a

412
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:36,020
regular basis the Taser comes out and I

413
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:38,370
get an itchy trigger finger and

414
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:41,129
apparently that is not necessarily a

415
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:45,510
good way of fostering will any of that

416
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:46,980
shit really so I got challenged and I

417
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:48,690
got challenged to go hey you're better

418
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,610
than that how can you actually

419
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:52,440
communicate more effectively rather than

420
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:54,449
just tasering somebody by the way if you

421
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,970
do take one of them you IMed the tasers

422
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:57,660
I was in Phoenix the frickin tased it

423
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:00,600
what's it called now

424
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:02,100
Aksum or axiom or whatever it is isn't

425
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,310
that something I've ever Pixar movie

426
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:08,280
axiom I remember somebody Google that

427
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:09,389
for me um there guys were sitting there

428
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,620
and it's like it's not called taser

429
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,450
anymore like look I've spent years

430
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,199
talking to people about Tasers is still

431
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:15,990
a freaking taser

432
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,490
if you go gangster with the Taser so

433
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:20,700
instead of doing this you go sideways

434
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:22,860
with it take two extra steps backwards

435
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:26,360
from your intended target you can put

436
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:31,050
one in the forehead and one in the groin

437
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:32,820
it's really fun for those who people

438
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:35,460
follow me on LinkedIn I actually put a

439
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:38,070
scale out there of basically offenses

440
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:40,590
against us not just us in the industry

441
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:42,179
just humans in general and whether you

442
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,320
just had to go gangster on them or

443
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,670
whether you need you to put them in a

444
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,070
swimming pool and put one in the

445
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:49,080
forehead one in the swimming pool and

446
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:50,580
cattle prods all sorts of things there's

447
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,909
natural Tahlia but exactly what you need

448
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:56,790
to do with people however what we should

449
00:20:53,910 --> 00:21:00,380
be doing is this we've done well rattled

450
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:03,720
on about communication and collaboration

451
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:06,510
coordination is another big one a lot of

452
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,760
us like to tinker a lot of us like to

453
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:10,290
experiment a lot of us like to do also

454
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,510
many of you have seen me over the years

455
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:14,668
talk about everything from health care

456
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:16,679
things to cows for crying out loud and

457
00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:20,250
all these other wonderful things that's

458
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:23,030
great but how can you take the research

459
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:28,890
and the stuff you enjoy and make a

460
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:32,428
difference how can you break a Tesla but

461
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:34,169
improve the safety of all of them how

462
00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:37,049
can we do that from responsible

463
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:39,030
disclosure standpoint the stuff I was

464
00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:41,400
doing with the medical devices a couple

465
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:43,740
of years ago where she talked to a lot

466
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,230
of the folks doing basically all other

467
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,850
stuff with the nanotech and bio nanotech

468
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:50,190
and now we're trying to work with them

469
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:52,439
the stuff from I am the cavalry the guys

470
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:56,840
in the work that they're doing there to

471
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:59,490
actually collaborate and coordinate

472
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:02,399
their efforts and other efforts from

473
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:08,220
people everywhere around in how to make

474
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:11,190
things safer for all of us so keep on

475
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:14,250
researching keep on messing with stuff

476
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:17,130
but then figure out how you can do

477
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:18,630
things better for others some stuff I'm

478
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:21,840
working on at the moment is worth is

479
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:23,010
with first responders how many of you

480
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,990
quick show of hands how many of you

481
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:27,629
basically sat in a queue of traffic and

482
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:29,429
the bloody blues and twos comes by being

483
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:33,600
an ambulance or fire truck or sun else

484
00:22:29,429 --> 00:22:35,490
and some dingleberry dickhead is sitting

485
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,928
on their telephone not paying attention

486
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:41,370
so we're working on a solution for that

487
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:44,549
we're working on something where we put

488
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:46,590
near field communication in an NFC field

489
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:47,639
in every single basically vehicle and

490
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:50,490
then we put something on everybody's

491
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,840
phones just simple stuff that came out

492
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:55,049
of fucking around with garage door

493
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,668
openers and NFC's so as you start

494
00:22:55,049 --> 00:22:58,410
tinkering with things as you start

495
00:22:56,669 --> 00:23:00,780
breaking and enjoying basically what

496
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:04,940
we're doing think about how you can make

497
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:04,940
things safer for others around you

498
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:18,720
which brings us to this one why do we

499
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:21,630
need to change keep it simple I can't

500
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:25,670
put it any simpler than that as an

501
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:28,140
industry we are still in our infancy

502
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,520
we're probably only in what the second

503
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,040
generation those of us that are getting

504
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,710
old and fuddled and starting to get

505
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:36,420
addled brains we're trying to bring the

506
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:37,980
next generation along and then the

507
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,570
generation after that hopefully is going

508
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,180
to realize the mistakes we've made and

509
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:44,010
hopefully make different ones but when

510
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:46,080
we first started the worst that happened

511
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:48,240
was that somebody broke into a room with

512
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,490
the mainframe on it and caused chaos and

513
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:54,420
mayhem five 10 years ago

514
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:59,640
similar kind of discussions we screw up

515
00:23:54,420 --> 00:24:01,560
doing our jobs now people die and for

516
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:05,070
those of you coming into this industry

517
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:09,149
that is a weight that you have to bear

518
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:11,340
and be willing to understand which is

519
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:12,650
why it's no longer any good to just go

520
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:16,679
out and break shit

521
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:19,950
figure out how to fix it figure out how

522
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:25,680
to work with everybody else and help

523
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:29,190
them understand how to fix it so how do

524
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:32,340
we change what do we need to actually do

525
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:34,260
apart from the four C's well it's an

526
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:37,580
overuse statement but it's something a

527
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,580
lot of us have been talking about

528
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:46,470
I'll give you some examples let's know

529
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:49,649
about a human we don't understand

530
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:53,159
security you cut anybody can anybody

531
00:24:49,649 --> 00:24:55,439
actually measure security and this is

532
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:59,389
just a simple I'll put a duck up on it

533
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:05,039
if anybody can quantify or measure

534
00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:09,258
security now think about safety safety

535
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:12,690
simple you either alive are you dead

536
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:15,899
easy really you either survived it or

537
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:21,210
you didn't we can quantify it and as

538
00:25:15,899 --> 00:25:23,158
humans we also know safety 60,000 years

539
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:26,039
ago we stuck our head out of a cave and

540
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:30,710
we either survived the day or we got

541
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:34,049
eaten by something else this day and age

542
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:37,559
there are people groups regions

543
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:41,210
religions belief systems which still

544
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:46,499
have safety issues even in this country

545
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:49,649
so we understand safety so when we talk

546
00:25:46,499 --> 00:25:52,710
to people and we discuss computers and

547
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:54,918
we discuss how to improve things for

548
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:58,409
people why don't we couch it in a safety

549
00:25:54,919 --> 00:26:00,899
conversation why don't we say hey the

550
00:25:58,409 --> 00:26:03,090
reason we want you to put a six digit

551
00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:04,469
passcode or the reason we want you to do

552
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:07,949
something different with your telephone

553
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:10,559
is to help protect your family is to

554
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:15,559
help protect the kids is to keep

555
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:17,759
everybody safe simple conversation

556
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:22,200
there's still about removing the easy

557
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:26,070
ways in how many of you have gone out to

558
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:30,960
showdown and we can still see 3389 on

559
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:33,629
the frickin internet seriously why the

560
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,279
fuck are we talking about a PT's we're

561
00:26:33,629 --> 00:26:38,639
talking about all this other shit we're

562
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:42,360
buying new blinky lights yet RDP still

563
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:47,100
on the fucking Internet this is simple

564
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:48,809
stuff when the vendor comes on site with

565
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:52,050
their new blinky thing that somehow

566
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:54,389
managed to get past you and they install

567
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:57,930
and they leave or they try to leave your

568
00:26:54,390 --> 00:27:05,880
site with defaults root Calvin or admin

569
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:08,100
admin set Equifax take them outside put

570
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:12,960
them on the front lawn of the company go

571
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:15,959
gangster and taser them no vendor should

572
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:19,200
ever be allowed to leave your facility

573
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:23,490
having left default credentials on their

574
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:25,410
equipment if they do you can taser them

575
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:27,090
I think it's written in law somewhere if

576
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:33,840
it's not give us about 10 minutes and

577
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:34,889
the database all right perimeter I think

578
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:40,010
we kind of talked about that one a

579
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:42,480
little bit simple stuff passwords they

580
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:45,540
we still have the ruddy things we still

581
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,120
have to deal with them but we can do

582
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:50,700
multi-factor we can do to factor we can

583
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:53,280
do all sorts of other things if we help

584
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:56,280
people understand the reasons from a

585
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,660
safety standpoint not from a security

586
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,220
standpoint not because you go to use a

587
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:00,900
twenty character password because nobody

588
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,070
ever uses it and not that you

589
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,540
unfortunately you can use half the

590
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:04,740
password safes out there now because the

591
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:09,120
bug is keep on getting cracked

592
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:14,490
Oh is there anybody from Nord Nordic

593
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:15,959
Nord VPN here I kid you not I got an

594
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:17,580
email from them this morning going hey

595
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:23,450
we'd like to talk to you about VPNs on

596
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:26,970
like hey sod off all right the big one

597
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:29,160
get a plan for those of you that are

598
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:31,160
responsible for the organization's or

599
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:35,690
for those of you that have to go out and

600
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:40,020
talk to companies around you shit is

601
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:42,390
going to happen the time to get a plan

602
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:45,410
especially an incident response plan is

603
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:47,910
not when the building is burning down

604
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:50,760
that is not the time to pick up yellow

605
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:52,770
pages and start googling who the hell I

606
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:55,770
have to find out to bring in to support

607
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:59,639
my incident response plan get a plan in

608
00:28:55,770 --> 00:29:02,460
place test of the plan this is where

609
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,080
bribery comes into play how many of you

610
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,230
are interested in social engineering and

611
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,990
human engineering

612
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:11,559
all right every single one of you should

613
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:14,110
be it's part of our job these days if

614
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:16,658
you want to actually help people

615
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:18,879
understand security and safety and you

616
00:29:16,659 --> 00:29:21,940
want to help further this cause you need

617
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:24,779
to learn human a social engineering you

618
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:29,110
literally have to become a psychologist

619
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:31,450
and part of it is to get a plan the

620
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:33,010
logic is simple if I can bribe enough

621
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:34,899
people to come and hang out in a room

622
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:36,639
for a couple of hours with me with

623
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:39,039
coffee and donuts or whatever the hell

624
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:43,479
it takes and we can talk about what

625
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:46,629
happens if what happens when we practice

626
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:49,779
that plan how many of you are former

627
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:53,260
military we remember the live fire

628
00:29:49,779 --> 00:29:56,070
exercises you got show that if you stood

629
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:59,769
up your ass got handed to you it hurts

630
00:29:56,070 --> 00:30:01,600
but we did that so that when we did end

631
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:03,429
up in the frickin sandbox and people

632
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,139
were shooting at us we would just sit

633
00:30:03,429 --> 00:30:07,510
there and wait for it to slow down for a

634
00:30:05,139 --> 00:30:09,939
minute we didn't stand up running around

635
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:13,990
like headless chickens that's the whole

636
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:17,200
logic behind get a plan if you test it

637
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:21,070
on a regular basis even if you just get

638
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,389
your own team around you you expand it

639
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,830
from the team in you're like hey let's

640
00:30:22,389 --> 00:30:25,629
bring the managers in now we know what

641
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:27,279
we do in then you're like hey let's

642
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:30,309
bring the dev and the obstacles in let's

643
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:36,059
bring IT and let's bring OD in let's all

644
00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:37,990
help further this simple stuff and

645
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:40,450
doesn't cost any money

646
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:44,159
worst case scenario you're out a couple

647
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:44,159
of gallons of coffee and a few muffins

648
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:51,250
now

649
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:52,490
can we tailor somebody short answer yes

650
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:55,490
okay

651
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:59,080
I hope the vendors that are in here none

652
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:59,080
of them have any of this shit going on

653
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:07,700
there is one Oh clay tell we have things

654
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:09,590
we've actually got the Tesla we can run

655
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:11,510
extra cables to the Tesla what are those

656
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:15,649
things running like 40,000 volts or

657
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:18,770
something that'll be good here bender

658
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:22,360
bender bender bender bender bender great

659
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:29,000
just put this on your tongue all right

660
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:29,889
if anybody tells you they can protect

661
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,250
you

662
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:35,690
you can kick them where it hurts if

663
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:38,420
anybody tells you they can keep you

664
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:40,550
secure that's when you can start

665
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,800
bringing the tasers out anybody puts a

666
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:46,879
fucking hooded figure up with no face on

667
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:50,180
it they get a paddling pool and a Taser

668
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,720
with the cattle prod okay it might be a

669
00:31:50,180 --> 00:32:00,640
little hot under the collar on this one

670
00:31:52,720 --> 00:32:00,640
let's be honest we can't protect anybody

671
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:11,840
we can't keep people secure all we can

672
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:16,360
do is reduce the risk that's it that's

673
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:20,030
all we can do our job is to help people

674
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:26,149
organizations and enterprises understand

675
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:29,480
risk and reduce it whether they take our

676
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:31,070
advice or not is entirely up to them but

677
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:34,220
all we're gonna be able to do is help

678
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:36,740
them to understand it and go hey let me

679
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:39,980
show you ways that you can reduce your

680
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:42,050
risks maybe it is upgrading some of the

681
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,580
technology maybe it is understanding the

682
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:45,919
assets or putting the policies

683
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:47,419
procedures controls maybe it's putting

684
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,760
deception tech in place

685
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:52,610
maybe it's putting detection technology

686
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:56,870
in place but all we're doing is reducing

687
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:58,669
the risk we're fooling ourselves if we

688
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:59,790
tell people that we can actually protect

689
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:02,170
them

690
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:04,780
comes down to the simple question I

691
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:07,720
asked and we all agreed you can't stop

692
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:11,320
somebody from getting in all you can do

693
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:14,650
is do a better job of understanding your

694
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:18,490
own environments when they're in and how

695
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:19,840
quickly you can close them down the

696
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:22,120
person that's waving over there would

697
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,959
you like a ducky oh you've got people

698
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:32,679
coming we'll have a ducky as well Oh too

699
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:34,720
far almost nice almost nice catch so

700
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:37,240
quick one some of the stupid crazy shit

701
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:41,070
that I'm working on this is the stuff

702
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:43,330
I'm messing around with these days yeah

703
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:47,350
takes a second doesn't it but it's kind

704
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:48,580
of fun wolf in sheep's clothing this is

705
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:50,560
a stuff I'm messing around with

706
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:52,000
deliberately because again you're not

707
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,889
gonna stop anybody from getting in

708
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,240
snowball's chance in hell so if they're

709
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:57,910
in what are you gonna do about it how

710
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:59,350
are you gonna know about it so this is

711
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:01,390
some of the logic how many of you

712
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:04,090
understand quantum mechanics and quantum

713
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:07,740
physics the one who admit to it in front

714
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:10,929
of everybody else okay good well done

715
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:14,260
everybody recognize that all right so me

716
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:16,230
give me an answer too many of you

717
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:19,750
buggers all right over here

718
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:20,710
nice I'm not I was gonna hold some of

719
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:23,380
those but they're probably a little too

720
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:25,600
heavy here's the logic between

721
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:28,780
Schrodinger's cat and observer theory

722
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:31,719
the concept is simple you lock Kitty in

723
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:34,690
the box Kitty's either pissed off or out

724
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:37,719
of oxygen and dead simple theory really

725
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:40,929
the only way you know if Kitty is pissed

726
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:45,520
or dead is if you actually interact with

727
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:47,110
the Box if you observe the box if you

728
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,739
look at a lot of the technologies that

729
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:53,200
we have these days as an attacker in

730
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:55,479
order for me to trip over an alarm I

731
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:57,640
actually have to interact with something

732
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:00,760
I got a poke it kick it take it steal it

733
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:02,379
or move it that's not very good that's

734
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:04,180
like going into the middle of the ocean

735
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:07,150
and fishing and hoping that one fish

736
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:08,740
will eventually bite what we need to do

737
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:11,920
is change that to much more of an

738
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:13,359
observer theory as an attacker I'm

739
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,450
always going to be able to get to the

740
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,680
first system agreed snowball's chance in

741
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:19,899
hell of keeping me at us while we have

742
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:23,770
users all Luke's only click thank you

743
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:30,210
pwned for reference are we recording

744
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:30,210
this we are are me alright for reference

745
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:38,590
how do I say this

746
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:40,270
carefully yeah there was a we'll call it

747
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:43,450
a competition shall we

748
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:46,900
there was a competition recently it was

749
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:49,960
a fully patched Windows 10 system on top

750
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:51,640
of virtual machine the competition was

751
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,740
to pone the Windows 10 fully patched

752
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:57,819
system and then to break out of a

753
00:35:53,740 --> 00:36:02,200
virtualized environment the team that

754
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:04,600
won won some good money 25000 for the

755
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,790
Windows 10 system and another 75 K for

756
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,230
breaking out of a protected VM it was

757
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:11,800
actually shared between several

758
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:13,570
countries and a bunch of us 66 seconds

759
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,580
to break the windows 10 machine a

760
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:17,760
further two and a half minutes to break

761
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:21,340
out of the protected virtual environment

762
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,660
that's all it took it was fun took us a

763
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:24,610
while to program everything and get it

764
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:27,220
all in place but that's all it took us

765
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:29,230
to broke to break so from that

766
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:32,680
standpoint no we will get to computer

767
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:35,020
number one now as an attacker if I'm on

768
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,700
computer number one I'm gonna start

769
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:38,410
rifling around I'm gonna start looking

770
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:40,390
at what you have I'm going to take your

771
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:41,830
nslookup so I'm gonna take everything I

772
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:44,230
possibly can sure sell not gonna scam

773
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:45,850
shit cuz that'll be stupid unless we

774
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:47,680
know it's an MSP who's not watching at

775
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:49,620
which point I can just use angry IP scan

776
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,580
and they won't have a freaking clue

777
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:55,299
misconfigured network card you're fine

778
00:36:51,580 --> 00:37:00,340
so the logic here is as an observer

779
00:36:55,300 --> 00:37:02,980
effect as a defender why can't we build

780
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:05,170
something that the moment you start just

781
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:08,440
asking questions not even interacting

782
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:11,890
but the moment you go hey who is around

783
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:14,890
me hey what credentials do you have hey

784
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:17,259
is this running is this system doing is

785
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:19,450
something happening that is the moment

786
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:22,390
that as a defensive system it should

787
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:23,549
wake up and go hey the fuck is going on

788
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:26,379
over here

789
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:27,330
that is where the cat basically turns

790
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:31,010
from something

791
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:35,160
SIV into something a little more active

792
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:38,370
Schrodinger's Revenge cat woke up and it

793
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,839
was pissed that's what we're building

794
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:43,310
and that's what we're trying to look at

795
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:46,680
and again I look at everybody here as

796
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:50,549
you start to look at solutions as you

797
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:56,549
start to talk to the vendors hold them

798
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:59,880
accountable as you bring somebody in do

799
00:37:56,550 --> 00:38:02,310
they help your maturity do they move the

800
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,400
needle on NIST or anything along those

801
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:06,900
lines what are they doing to benefit you

802
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,420
and the organization's you're

803
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:12,480
responsible for not are they just

804
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:16,020
another tick in the box but how do they

805
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:19,380
actually help how do they give more

806
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:23,009
teeth to the blue team because that's

807
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:31,170
what it's all about these days all right

808
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:34,500
I promised I would put this one up on

809
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:36,060
the internet so it's up this is awesome

810
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,890
how many of you remember a couple of

811
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:42,750
years ago in the 220 what are we in

812
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:43,950
there 2019 army 2017 bunch of stuff in

813
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:45,420
the Middle East and a bunch of stuff in

814
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:46,109
the u.s. got breached and attacked

815
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,400
pretty badly

816
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:50,040
well successfully depends on how you

817
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:53,130
want to look at it we blame the Iranians

818
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:55,740
bastards or friggin big into our shed

819
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:59,160
and where else what came out in them and

820
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:01,919
the post last week the Russians were

821
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:04,500
actually using the Iranian systems like

822
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,700
yeah attribution congratulations we

823
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:09,180
carpet-bomb the wrong people

824
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:10,680
oops now the big question is this who's

825
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:13,290
actually riding on the piggyback of the

826
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:17,210
Russians did we blame the Chinese do we

827
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:22,170
blame the North Koreans do we blame NSA

828
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:25,100
GCHQ take your pick for those of you

829
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:29,430
that have to face these questions

830
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:31,589
fundamental attribution error here's a

831
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:33,899
question for all of you and I look

832
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:37,020
forward to this one how many of you

833
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:40,350
think or realize that you would be able

834
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:41,029
to actually pinpoint exactly who an

835
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:49,098
attacker

836
00:39:41,029 --> 00:39:50,479
is anybody come on I know we've got

837
00:39:49,099 --> 00:39:56,779
blamed ice so we can have a pretty good

838
00:39:50,479 --> 00:40:00,019
guesser there these days I yeah

839
00:39:56,779 --> 00:40:02,539
actually how many of you are familiar

840
00:40:00,019 --> 00:40:04,729
with the miter attack framework how many

841
00:40:02,539 --> 00:40:07,249
of you are not familiar with it all

842
00:40:04,729 --> 00:40:10,848
right seriously get out on the internets

843
00:40:07,249 --> 00:40:13,428
and google it it's actually really nice

844
00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:15,259
it's not perfect but it's an amazing

845
00:40:13,429 --> 00:40:16,880
framework that was put together by a

846
00:40:15,259 --> 00:40:19,339
whole bunch of people who probably need

847
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,599
some damn good hugs actually yeah and

848
00:40:19,339 --> 00:40:24,380
it's a really good framework that

849
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:26,719
explains in 12 steps 12 steps 12 steps

850
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:28,579
exactly how an attacker goes from open

851
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:30,229
source intelligence countering to

852
00:40:28,579 --> 00:40:33,349
basically harvesting it and taking it

853
00:40:30,229 --> 00:40:36,229
out mitre attack frame look really nice

854
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:38,869
and again if you're starting to look at

855
00:40:36,229 --> 00:40:40,848
technologies to bring in start looking

856
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:44,089
at that framework and go how can your

857
00:40:40,849 --> 00:40:46,150
technology help reduce the risks in any

858
00:40:44,089 --> 00:40:48,529
one or two or three of these categories

859
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:52,119
because if they can't you are allowed to

860
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:52,119
take him out and boot him in the ass

861
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:58,549
this one's a biggie we've got Congress

862
00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:00,799
that are demanding that we carpet bomb

863
00:40:58,549 --> 00:41:04,159
whoever's attacking us next and the

864
00:41:00,799 --> 00:41:07,069
problem is we have no frickin clue we

865
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:09,140
could take a bloody good guess but even

866
00:41:07,069 --> 00:41:11,989
if we know who's hands are on the

867
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:14,629
keyboards we sure as hell don't know the

868
00:41:11,989 --> 00:41:17,359
motivation that the people whose hands

869
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:19,400
that belong to so we have some huge

870
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:22,308
issues here so whenever you hear people

871
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:26,299
starting to blame pick your country of

872
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:29,150
origin start to question it please step

873
00:41:26,299 --> 00:41:35,770
up and have the conversations about how

874
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:38,980
sure are they simple stuff

875
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:40,270
hi like this one thing uh probably use

876
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:43,060
this last year and I'm still using it

877
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:44,890
this year because I really like it all

878
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:47,710
of us have probably covered this

879
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:52,660
industry from different angles and

880
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:56,530
origins all of us come from different

881
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:59,920
backgrounds but we're all in this

882
00:41:56,530 --> 00:42:02,290
together and that same message goes for

883
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:05,590
the organizations you work for and work

884
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:07,660
with if you're sad around the same table

885
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:09,910
with developers and ops and everybody's

886
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:11,319
blaming the network team last I checked

887
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:14,020
you're probably getting the same

888
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:17,230
paycheck from the same company you're

889
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:22,090
all in the same boat together work

890
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:23,470
together collaborate together because

891
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:27,600
it's the only way this shit's gonna

892
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:31,899
change the blame game that's got to stop

893
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:35,730
we're all responsible us probably more

894
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:38,590
than most okay

895
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:44,680
I've used this a few times our continual

896
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:45,670
to use it this is a community this

897
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:49,149
conference

898
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:51,400
besides all day DevOps take your pick on

899
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:54,160
the conferences this one kind of my

900
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,950
favorite this is my home always has been

901
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,720
probably always will be because you know

902
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:00,490
what there's a bunch of us who are crazy

903
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,589
geeks in the industry and there's a

904
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:03,819
bunch of kids here learning that we're

905
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:06,760
all learning but some of them are like

906
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:10,390
holy shit what do I have to do next it's

907
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:14,770
kind of fun to see them we're here to

908
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:18,339
help everybody prima donnas need not

909
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:21,340
apply if you see a prima donna

910
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:21,970
you can go gangster on them please all I

911
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:24,670
ask

912
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:27,600
as individuals we're going to fail it's

913
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:33,360
as simple as that it is going to take

914
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:48,270
every single one of us so

915
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:48,270
that's my finalist like Mike is missed

916
00:43:53,220 --> 00:44:06,310
those of you who know Mike he's missed

917
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:09,790
so raise a glass twin please - Mike all

918
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:11,080
right laughs all right we got ten

919
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:14,170
minutes or so

920
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:16,960
five minutes all right questions from

921
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:21,460
anybody you don't get any more alcohol

922
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:23,260
until you ask questions how do we Blake

923
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:25,000
in the Gulf okay so where is our amazing

924
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,810
lady she was there she is she's not

925
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,160
paying attention

926
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:32,290
she's Google yeah you see you were

927
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,000
listening so she figured it out in the

928
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:35,259
end we're in there we're breaking all

929
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,460
the shit with telling cables and all

930
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:40,660
this other kind of crazy stuff that

931
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:45,460
she's like hey ha quick hey gets you in

932
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:48,160
there's a bypass yeah now that attack

933
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:50,080
vector has now been taken offline there

934
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,930
is now another hundred dollars in the

935
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:55,200
glove box and you gotta find another

936
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:58,450
attack vector to get into the glove box

937
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:00,279
so when not the idea is to not take

938
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:02,290
bolts to the glove box and unbolt the

939
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:04,810
damn thing because we thought about

940
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:06,580
doing that - but - as you try to leave

941
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:08,020
everything intact so there's a couple of

942
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:09,220
other attack vectors I'll leave all of

943
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:12,790
you with because I'm actually flying out

944
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:14,950
this evening so can bus architecture the

945
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:16,180
glove box on the Tesla there is no

946
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:19,000
physical glove box

947
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:20,410
it's an actuator figure out what the pit

948
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,690
is and see if you can actually get the

949
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:24,850
actuator to work the glove box has

950
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:26,950
hinges good old-school hinges see what

951
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:28,868
you can do with those and there's a few

952
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:30,730
other attack vectors so have fun with it

953
00:45:28,869 --> 00:45:32,170
chris has also used a PIN number he

954
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:34,090
unfortunately changed his pin number

955
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:36,320
when we figured out what his pin number

956
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:38,700
was

957
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:42,090
but should you be able to get hold of

958
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:44,970
his app or his phone or be able to

959
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:46,650
intercept signals hint hint

960
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:49,709
you might be able to get into it that

961
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:51,120
way too so have some fun with it that's

962
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:53,550
actually a fun one there's some amazing

963
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:55,380
stuff over the glovebox one was awesome

964
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:57,090
I mean it was seriously a team effort it

965
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,560
took us less than a minute to break it

966
00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:00,420
so this is the irony of the whole thing

967
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:04,320
it took us under a minute to break into

968
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:06,960
the Tesla which was fantastic it took us

969
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:08,670
another minute and a half two minutes it

970
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,930
would have taken actually it took us

971
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:11,910
longer than that because we have to find

972
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:13,410
a freaking 9-volt battery but if you

973
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:15,180
find a 9-volt battery you can pop a

974
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:17,879
panel off of the front of the Tesla and

975
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,720
pop the bonnet which then gets you into

976
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,280
the battery and you can start

977
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:25,980
disconnecting shit and do all sorts

978
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:30,630
don't touch the orange wires this like a

979
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:36,690
tingly sensation really intense tingly

980
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:38,730
sensation don't do it not fun and so

981
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:40,740
that got us into that I'm kidding I mean

982
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:42,300
we're in the freakin Tesla we've pop

983
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:45,299
panels we've done everything inside like

984
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:46,470
10 minutes and like two and a half three

985
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,810
hours later we're still trying to get

986
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:50,310
into the freakin glovebox it's like we

987
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:55,670
failed but it was fun

988
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:55,670
all right other questions go for it

989
00:47:01,069 --> 00:47:04,069
yeah

990
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:07,359
yeah

991
00:47:14,279 --> 00:47:21,130
okay give me your ID before you get out

992
00:47:16,659 --> 00:47:23,289
I don't so for me if you assume

993
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:25,029
somebody's on the inside what you have

994
00:47:23,289 --> 00:47:28,209
to for me what you have to take a step

995
00:47:25,029 --> 00:47:30,099
back and go is like okay how do i what

996
00:47:28,209 --> 00:47:32,709
eyes do I have on my environment and

997
00:47:30,099 --> 00:47:34,869
this isn't going to put end point stuff

998
00:47:32,709 --> 00:47:36,819
all over the place it's how well do I

999
00:47:34,869 --> 00:47:39,459
understand what I'm actually in control

1000
00:47:36,819 --> 00:47:41,140
of I mean for me the whole endpoint

1001
00:47:39,459 --> 00:47:43,149
protection stuff is kind of crazy

1002
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:44,769
because you ask the question of any

1003
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:47,829
corporation do you know where all of

1004
00:47:44,769 --> 00:47:49,209
your end points are nobody does let

1005
00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:51,130
alone the ones they've got on Asset

1006
00:47:49,209 --> 00:47:52,658
Management let alone everything else so

1007
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:54,999
the question that goes okay let's go up

1008
00:47:52,659 --> 00:47:57,219
a layer what can I understand about the

1009
00:47:54,999 --> 00:47:59,078
network it's travelling over either my

1010
00:47:57,219 --> 00:48:00,489
network or networks associated with me

1011
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:02,529
or vendor networks or anything like that

1012
00:48:00,489 --> 00:48:06,159
how can I keep eyes on any of that

1013
00:48:02,529 --> 00:48:09,249
effectively and what I'm trying to do is

1014
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:11,650
not go hey go talk to our booth but go

1015
00:48:09,249 --> 00:48:13,209
talk to our booth but without saying

1016
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:16,599
that take a look at what's actually

1017
00:48:13,209 --> 00:48:18,308
going on on the network that's one set

1018
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:20,529
of eyes and it's not really saying the

1019
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:22,809
behavior and analytics or the anomalous

1020
00:48:20,529 --> 00:48:24,400
stuff it's just at least knowing what's

1021
00:48:22,809 --> 00:48:27,369
meant to be on the network versus what

1022
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:29,140
is or isn't on the network the defaults

1023
00:48:27,369 --> 00:48:31,089
get rid of all the damn defaults in the

1024
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:33,879
environment the education the human

1025
00:48:31,089 --> 00:48:36,099
education again that problem we have

1026
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:39,909
these days is we educate people once a

1027
00:48:36,099 --> 00:48:42,249
year don't click shit don't send shit PS

1028
00:48:39,909 --> 00:48:43,449
will remember it for another 364 days

1029
00:48:42,249 --> 00:48:47,919
otherwise you're fired

1030
00:48:43,449 --> 00:48:49,569
what use is that you know Mark Miller

1031
00:48:47,919 --> 00:48:51,098
from sono type and I and a couple of

1032
00:48:49,569 --> 00:48:52,390
other guys who have been basically every

1033
00:48:51,099 --> 00:48:54,579
single month putting something on the

1034
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:56,799
internet it's January it's tax season

1035
00:48:54,579 --> 00:48:59,229
don't click shit from the bloody IRS

1036
00:48:56,799 --> 00:49:03,419
it's February Valentine's Day

1037
00:48:59,229 --> 00:49:03,419
nobody fucking loves you on the Internet

1038
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:10,119
[Applause]

1039
00:49:06,419 --> 00:49:11,919
why are you playing shit and you just do

1040
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:14,650
it every single month just trying to

1041
00:49:11,919 --> 00:49:17,078
reinforce it to users it's not perfect

1042
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:19,509
but it moves the bathroom there to there

1043
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:21,189
so now you can take your eye off of

1044
00:49:19,509 --> 00:49:22,390
having to worry quite so much about the

1045
00:49:21,189 --> 00:49:23,949
hundred percent you got to worry about

1046
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:26,770
maybe the twenty or thirty percent so

1047
00:49:23,949 --> 00:49:28,450
you can do stuff with that and then

1048
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:30,310
starting at the environment you're just

1049
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:32,200
looking and keeping eyes on that one and

1050
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:34,779
the education would leadership is a huge

1051
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:36,100
part of it and some of it is literally

1052
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:39,820
sitting down and going okay

1053
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:42,009
what do you care about because when we

1054
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:44,800
go into organizations we talk about risk

1055
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:46,300
and we talk about what we care about but

1056
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,310
we don't necessarily understand what

1057
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:50,080
finance cares about or what the

1058
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:51,640
leadership or the board cares about or

1059
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:53,740
what manufacturing cares about

1060
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:55,990
manufacturing cares about the fact that

1061
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:57,189
their widget is in China and we've been

1062
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:59,109
the crap out of them with all these

1063
00:49:57,190 --> 00:50:00,250
damage with all the bloody tariffs and

1064
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:01,480
stuff and how are they going to move and

1065
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:04,120
how are they going to do with it that's

1066
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:05,590
their risk and then they care about

1067
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:07,330
maybe transportation so if you

1068
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:09,790
understand everybody else's risk and

1069
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:13,270
you're hey here are my risks how do we

1070
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:15,520
together reduce risk not how do I just

1071
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:18,759
reduce mine how do we how do I help you

1072
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:20,200
reduce some of your risks I think that's

1073
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:22,690
a big part of it and it's coming to the

1074
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:24,129
table that way rather than coming to the

1075
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:25,690
table go hey I've got all these risks

1076
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:27,670
and you need to give me money so I can

1077
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:29,170
fix them all it's like hey I've got

1078
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:31,450
these challenges hey I know you have

1079
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:32,950
challenges how can I help you and you

1080
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:35,529
start to build that trust and

1081
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:36,970
collaborative relationship it's not

1082
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:39,010
perfect and again we're never gonna keep

1083
00:50:36,970 --> 00:50:41,410
everybody out I'm about to get yelled at

1084
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:47,970
honey nope oh you're awesome I love you

1085
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:51,730
oh I get a hug I get a hug I like hugs

1086
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:52,899
all right got up ha I don't have the

1087
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:55,330
best of answers but part of it is

1088
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:57,190
visibility part of it is communication

1089
00:50:55,330 --> 00:51:00,940
part of it is education again it's all

1090
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:03,790
the human stuff and that'll help to at

1091
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:06,940
least reduce some of it and you know go

1092
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:07,990
visit the booth that's again that's part

1093
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:09,430
of the reason I'm doing the detection

1094
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:10,990
deception stuff it's as simple as that

1095
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:12,520
because I don't see much else out there

1096
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:14,080
that's helping to reduce it all right

1097
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:17,710
one final question that I can answer in

1098
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:18,970
20 seconds anything nothing good all

1099
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:20,650
