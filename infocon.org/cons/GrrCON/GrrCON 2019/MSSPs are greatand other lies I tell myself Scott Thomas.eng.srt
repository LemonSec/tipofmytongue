1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,940
so obviously the title is a little bit

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:07,619
of a pan towards EMS SPS we all use them

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,080
we all need them but it's something that

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,530
we want to make sure that people are

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,650
understanding what they're getting

6
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:16,230
themselves into for those that don't

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,720
know me my name is Scott Thomas I work

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,699
as the director of information security

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,948
on the global team for Jones Lang

10
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,510
LaSalle obviously I do not speak for

11
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:31,199
them that's just who I work for

12
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:33,660
I speak for myself no one else so why I

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,430
was looking at giving this talk so I was

14
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,739
sitting in at my desk at work

15
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,570
trying to understand contract

16
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:41,160
negotiations with a company we're

17
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,500
currently working with and trying to

18
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,230
understand like what do we need to do to

19
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,579
make this successful and in talking with

20
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,870
a number of the people I'd know in the

21
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,420
industry that have gone through a lot of

22
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,250
this stuff and said you know we deal

23
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,260
with these people we have to because

24
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,360
it's easier to outsource than hiring to

25
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,030
insource people you know I wanted to

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,469
make sure that I give the knowledge that

27
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,820
I had that we've the pain that we've

28
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:05,159
gone through in the current process so

29
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,560
we're dealing with as well as what I've

30
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,510
done as at MSSP previously when I was a

31
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,520
consultant I will leave time at the end

32
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,680
so if you guys have questions feel free

33
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,539
to either raise your hand I've you know

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,270
I can stop then and we can answer then

35
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,920
or we can always do that at the end I

36
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,390
would like to be this to be a little bit

37
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,490
interactive because I know that a lot of

38
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,200
people have MS SPS that they deal with

39
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,429
and other people are gonna have those

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,080
same issues and I want this to be a

41
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,280
knowledge share as much for me as it is

42
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:35,939
from all of you to each other as well

43
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:38,700
obviously I'm cornholio school all right

44
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,889
so the reason that I decided to give

45
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,020
this talk is I read a thing on Twitter

46
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,360
one time about if you're gonna give a

47
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,990
talk why should you be the one to do it

48
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,210
and I've dealt with a lot of MSSP is my

49
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,130
previous job we had five of them at one

50
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,350
time that we outsourced to a number of

51
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,570
our different projects and programs too

52
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,919
and the interactions between them were

53
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,960
difficult to say the least

54
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,270
I also left that company and went and

55
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,189
became an MSSP and I was a consultant

56
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,600
for two years so I know some of the tips

57
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:08,910
and tricks that some of them like to use

58
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,008
to say oh the contract actually means

59
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,290
this and that's how they get around not

60
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:15,059
providing you what you should be getting

61
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,230
I then came back into the corporate

62
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,319
world and I've been dealing with

63
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,090
multiple MSSP n-now in wanting contract

64
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,329
negotiations that seemed to be never

65
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:28,019
never-ending

66
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:30,860
all right Lauren stuffs over so I like

67
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:33,510
dogs sign dogs are always in my talks

68
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,410
but let's start with before you want to

69
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,329
hire an MSSP

70
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:38,299
obviously you're gonna have to contract

71
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,650
with someone you want to make sure that

72
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:42,870
you need to make sure what the what's

73
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,090
driving the engagement is what's driving

74
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,549
who you're choosing for the MSP what

75
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,500
they're going to do basically the entire

76
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:53,910
front to back of how this process is

77
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:55,859
going to work usually this comes from

78
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,480
one of a couple different areas if this

79
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:59,370
is a management directive it usually

80
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,790
comes from some of its you know c-level

81
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:05,819
CIO see ISO CEO they may have heard you

82
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,410
know a quick executive some around

83
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:09,298
something that ho am s ESPYs are great

84
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,109
and you need to do this or outsource it

85
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:12,180
they're gonna save you so much money

86
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:15,780
there's always some sort of a direction

87
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:18,750
that it's coming from if you're a CIO it

88
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:21,000
could be cost related obviously cost is

89
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,870
a big thing for a CIO on CEO they want

90
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,980
to make sure that they're getting the

91
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,109
most bang for their buck because they

92
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:28,220
need to make sure that the shareholders

93
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:28,220
are getting their value for their money

94
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:34,200
if you're a director level obviously

95
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:36,510
Lumbergh managers and directors may not

96
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,849
have people on their team that currently

97
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:41,190
meet their skill set it might be someone

98
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:43,798
where I need a checkbox for a pen test

99
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,510
obviously you go to an MSP and ssp for

100
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,639
that because they've got people on staff

101
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,200
that do that you may not unless you're a

102
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:50,760
larger organization you probably don't

103
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,399
have a red team or an internal pen test

104
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,560
team MSS peas are great for that so it's

105
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,019
a good reason to go to an MSSP to say

106
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:03,419
I'm gonna have some savings in this I'm

107
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:05,129
gonna you know go down this road so if

108
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:09,870
you we start with the the C is on the

109
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:11,910
CIO obviously everyone wants savings but

110
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,819
why are we paying this much for this or

111
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:16,500
that why are we paying for you know this

112
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,699
company versus that company there's a

113
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,770
number of different reasons you may do

114
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:24,390
it one thing is is that cost savings you

115
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,120
can get cost savings from consultants

116
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:29,940
the big thing consultants don't do is

117
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,060
other duties as assigned anybody have

118
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:35,310
that as their job title a lot of people

119
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,630
so if you're an employee your manager

120
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,090
can come up to you and say hey we're

121
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:40,500
thinking about doing this see what you

122
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,270
can do with this give me some ideas

123
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,070
give me some talking us and some

124
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:47,250
feedback on this is this a good idea is

125
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:49,020
it not a good idea etc the contractors

126
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,699
and consultants don't have that you

127
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,590
can't give them anything and say hey I

128
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,850
know you're on the clock to do this

129
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,500
particular job but I want you to look

130
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,330
into this as well that's going to end up

131
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,770
as a contract addendum that's gonna end

132
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,380
up with you know extra money out of your

133
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:03,419
pocket that's one thing to consider if

134
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,789
you are going to go to an MSSP is that

135
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:07,740
they are usually a single you know a

136
00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:10,710
one-trick pony a single job that that's

137
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,360
what they do you can't throw anything at

138
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,280
them and you know obviously contract

139
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,780
restrictions they may be obstinate as

140
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:21,210
well the I saw this on the internet and

141
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:24,299
I like to use this as the way that a

142
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:27,270
contractor does their job I push this

143
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,360
button I have so many MS SPS that tell

144
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:31,740
me what this is my job that's all I do

145
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,900
so they push that one button and it may

146
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,300
be ridiculously good at pushing that one

147
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,570
button it may be the best server admin

148
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,740
you've ever seen but that's all they do

149
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:42,120
you can't tell them oh you're a server

150
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,440
admin okay I need you to write up the

151
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,580
security policy they're not that's not

152
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,120
what they're there for you need to get

153
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:49,349
somebody else to do that

154
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,370
does anybody seen the Venn diagram of

155
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:54,900
good fast and cheap I'm gonna argue with

156
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:58,289
the Venn diagram of good fast and cheap

157
00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:04,760
has anyone had an MSP MSSP consulting

158
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:08,940
that is good and cheap anyone

159
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:11,370
not one and one okay so usually if

160
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,300
you're good and cheap you're gonna be

161
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,480
rolled off to a different account

162
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,850
because the company can make more money

163
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,220
on you in a different account so they

164
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,480
won't leave you on that account so

165
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,790
you're usually you're ending up with

166
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,050
good and expensive or good and fast

167
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,420
you know where you're paying a lot of

168
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,620
money for it or you get the people at

169
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,820
our entry level that are still learning

170
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,040
and things like that if you're going to

171
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,990
go the cheap route so it is possible to

172
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:37,140
do savings from this to say you know hey

173
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,760
I'm gonna use an MSSP to provide this

174
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,289
service or whatever but it's gonna be

175
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,060
difficult to get those really really

176
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,860
good people at a cheap price you're

177
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:47,450
gonna have to pay for it so your savings

178
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,450
may not be as big as you think they are

179
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:55,409
but if you're CIO or see ISO or that use

180
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:59,130
your network everybody's here to network

181
00:06:55,410 --> 00:07:02,520
right not everybody who's having coffee

182
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:04,140
here what I mean your network is going

183
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,729
to be your best way of understanding

184
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,050
what you're getting from that company

185
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:09,630
because I guarantee if it's a

186
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:11,700
three-letter company that's that you're

187
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:13,320
looking at outsourcing there's going to

188
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,849
be someone in your network that has used

189
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,409
them or has experience with them or has

190
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,570
dealt with them or had problems with

191
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:20,670
them and they're gonna be the ones that

192
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:22,020
you want to talk to and say okay what

193
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:23,690
were the pitfalls that you wish you what

194
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,740
someone would have told you beforehand

195
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,880
because that's that's how you're going

196
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,540
to need to get into the contract

197
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:33,600
negotiations with and obviously if

198
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:36,000
you're a CIS o-- or CIO or CTO or any of

199
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,620
the sea levels and a CEO comes to you on

200
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,960
this a lot of times they haven't gotten

201
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,460
the full picture they may have seen

202
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,919
other than oh I read this in a magazine

203
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:46,080
on an airline well did you read the

204
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,180
whole article did it tell you that hey

205
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,430
you can save stuff but here's the

206
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,750
drawbacks to it a lot of times they

207
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,100
haven't they think they oh well here's a

208
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,290
way to save money make it happen and

209
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,550
they just want to throw something at the

210
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,230
you know their subordinates and say hey

211
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,880
this is what you need to do go figure it

212
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:02,160
out which that's you know what a CEO

213
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,590
does but if you're a CIO or C ISO make

214
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,820
sure that that's what you're looking at

215
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,320
talk to them talk to the CEO and say

216
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,180
okay give me some details of where you

217
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,770
got this information what do you want to

218
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,640
get out of it how much savings is there

219
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:16,560
a percentage etc I did have one story to

220
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,449
impart about this type of a thing

221
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,360
I had a cio previously

222
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:23,430
who was in a town hall and decided that

223
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,409
he was going to give a kind of a State

224
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,349
of the Union speech or whatever and he

225
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:28,558
said we're gonna be moving to the clock

226
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:30,029
okay

227
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:34,079
everybody's moving the cloud and big

228
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:35,820
deal so somebody raised their hand for a

229
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:37,138
change it wasn't me and I and somebody

230
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,389
asked well why are we moving to the

231
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:42,510
cloud and he said because the cloud is

232
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:44,639
more secure and at least we got a couple

233
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:47,790
chuckles out of that and I was like oh

234
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,990
God oh okay I immediately send an email

235
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,250
while I was sitting there to his

236
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,720
assistant I'm like I need to get on his

237
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,209
calendar I need to know where he found

238
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,490
this information because that's not true

239
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:57,989
the cloud is could be secure depending

240
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,790
on how you configure it so can an

241
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,380
on-prem but that doesn't mean the cloud

242
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,910
is always more secure and so I had it

243
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,459
and sit down with this guy for a half an

244
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:08,219
hour to say okay what did you understand

245
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:09,239
about this and he's oh well I misspoke I

246
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,070
didn't mean that the cloud is more

247
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,170
secured I said the cloud can be secure I

248
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:14,550
said well that's not what you said so we

249
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:20,969
need to fix this picture and he never

250
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:23,490
did so I left that company all right so

251
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,839
if you're a director or a manager it

252
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,730
could be that you're missing something

253
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:28,949
on your team and you want to go to an

254
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:31,560
MSSP to try and get something that you

255
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:34,500
are lacking obviously pentest is an easy

256
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,719
one to go to because MSS PS are really

257
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,160
good at pen tests they're not as good

258
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,149
when you try and bring other people that

259
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,149
do different jobs in

260
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,800
they're not always the expert also

261
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:53,349
anybody ever seen the YouTube video of

262
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:55,569
the expert have couple handfuls there's

263
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:57,610
a YouTube video it's funny it's got a

264
00:09:55,569 --> 00:10:00,519
guy that's brought in as the expert on

265
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:02,769
lines and so the the client is asking

266
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:05,110
him well we want seven perpendicular

267
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:07,300
lines some written and reading some

268
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:09,480
written in transparent ink and he's like

269
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,920
well perpendicular to what each other

270
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,720
he's like well that can't be done oh oh

271
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,430
oh well you're the expert you figure it

272
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,110
out and that's what sales people are

273
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:20,199
going to do to you when you're looking

274
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:22,000
at going to an MSSP they're going to

275
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:24,490
tell you oh we can do everything we have

276
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,350
an expert and they're gonna bring this

277
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,959
person in and being the expert I've been

278
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:30,130
in those meetings where you get there

279
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,170
and you're like okay what are we doing

280
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:34,449
oh well the client wants this well

281
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:37,469
that's not possible oh you don't say

282
00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:40,569
that we'll figure it out

283
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:42,339
you can't figure out impossible it just

284
00:10:40,569 --> 00:10:43,899
doesn't work so having that you know

285
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:46,480
understand your salespeople are going to

286
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:50,490
just tell you anything that's where you

287
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,490
need to start your contract negotiations

288
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:59,099
oh and the other thing that I was gonna

289
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:01,359
bring up was anybody ever had the

290
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:02,919
dealing with a salesperson who said oh

291
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:04,779
we had the perfect person for this but

292
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:10,289
he's rolling off a project it'll take a

293
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:13,389
while to get him in here anyway no why

294
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:15,789
exactly they have to go hire him they

295
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:17,439
that person doesn't exist a lot of em

296
00:11:15,789 --> 00:11:19,479
SSPs do that they say oh yeah we can

297
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:21,009
totally do that let us you know either

298
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,909
figure this out or whatever won't come

299
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:23,649
back to you that's because they're going

300
00:11:21,909 --> 00:11:25,689
to look for someone to do it they don't

301
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:27,309
necessarily have that in-house so you

302
00:11:25,689 --> 00:11:28,929
don't always get the expert and you may

303
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:38,529
get the next person that they found that

304
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:40,299
has heard that word before the other

305
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:43,239
thing is is do they cover all your needs

306
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:45,549
a lot of times your MSS P's want to be

307
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:47,979
everything to you well I take that out

308
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:50,289
every security and if there's any

309
00:11:47,979 --> 00:11:51,849
vendors here I'm sorry every vendor in

310
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:53,949
that hall over there wants to sell you

311
00:11:51,849 --> 00:11:56,169
everything they can for any price that

312
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:57,399
they can get you to pay for it so

313
00:11:56,169 --> 00:11:59,499
they're going to say that they can do

314
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:01,689
anything for anything for you but that

315
00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:04,059
isn't always the case you can end up

316
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:05,709
with an issue like we had at my current

317
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:08,499
job where we we had an issue with social

318
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:09,998
media and we said okay does anybody do

319
00:12:08,499 --> 00:12:12,009
this particular thing for social media

320
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:13,509
we went to the company that has that

321
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:15,519
social media platform and said what can

322
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:16,949
we do to try and clean this up and clear

323
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:21,699
out the people that are on that platform

324
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:23,079
we don't allow that oh okay and then we

325
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,819
get an email back after we'd sent out

326
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:25,299
the the communication to a bunch of MS

327
00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:27,819
SPS

328
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:30,459
here's what we want to do with MMS SPS

329
00:12:27,819 --> 00:12:31,868
says oh we can do this really because

330
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:35,738
the company just said that they don't

331
00:12:31,869 --> 00:12:38,079
allow it we can get around that okay

332
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:40,509
well show it to us oh well we'll have to

333
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,819
build it so we'll start a POC contract

334
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:44,469
with you well you will split the cost

335
00:12:42,819 --> 00:12:47,579
with you while we build this out and

336
00:12:44,469 --> 00:12:51,219
then we'll charge a monthly fee for it

337
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:52,628
I'm not paying for your R&D you either

338
00:12:51,219 --> 00:12:55,179
come to me with a product or you don't

339
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:56,649
come to me at all so they may not cover

340
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:57,669
all your needs and it may be back to the

341
00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:58,989
same thing where you're like oh well

342
00:12:57,669 --> 00:13:02,529
you're gonna go hire somebody that can

343
00:12:58,989 --> 00:13:03,759
do whatever you think I that I want so

344
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:06,279
they wanted us to spend a lot of money

345
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:08,489
for something that they actually didn't

346
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:08,489
do

347
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,490
occasionally you will when you're

348
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:15,290
working with MSS Peas depending on the

349
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:16,760
scale obviously if it's something where

350
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,079
you're doing the entire program you may

351
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,090
need a server admin you may need

352
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,280
messaging team whatever it may be easy

353
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:24,080
for them they may have run books they

354
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,430
may have playbooks it may be something

355
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,100
that's pretty simple for them to go

356
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:29,689
through and you know decide ok yeah I

357
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:32,470
got people that sit on the bench that do

358
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:34,910
this and they move in sure no problem

359
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:37,220
the problem when it comes in when you

360
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,719
start to ask for those weird things the

361
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,740
things that you don't necessarily get

362
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,380
all the time

363
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:45,830
does anybody here do any kind of RPG

364
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:47,450
code review nobody exactly because

365
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:49,910
nobody does that so that's what you're

366
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:51,830
asking for you're not necessarily going

367
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:53,390
to get it or you may get back to the oh

368
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,880
we'll find somebody to hire to do that

369
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:58,250
so make sure that what you're paying for

370
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,630
is what you're getting so if you're easy

371
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,550
and you get you know hey I need a

372
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:03,050
messaging admin or whatever that's gonna

373
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,790
be a cheap fill and they have those

374
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,560
people if you want something specific

375
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,790
your cost savings may not be there

376
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,369
because you need to find someone that

377
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:15,920
does this so going in MSSP route may not

378
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:20,750
be the answer I hate efficiency

379
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:24,410
consultants anybody where nobody works

380
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:26,810
for them right ok cool so you get these

381
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:28,100
people that come in and they want to

382
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:30,020
tell you that all we're gonna save you

383
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,520
so much money we're gonna identify all

384
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,410
the gaps we're gonna identify all the

385
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,819
overages and where you're you you have

386
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,120
too many people and all this kind of

387
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,890
stuff

388
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,470
it basically means layoffs that's all

389
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:40,850
these people do they're gonna come in

390
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,840
and they're gonna say you know hey we're

391
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,270
gonna make these bunch of

392
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:46,040
recommendations and you're gonna be

393
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,939
saving so much money but the problem is

394
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,699
is that they don't make those

395
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:51,320
recommendations - can people to make

396
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,890
people do more than more than one job

397
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,540
things like that you're not going to

398
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:58,250
hire them back you're gonna spend all

399
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,199
this money and they expect you to save

400
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:02,300
in addition to what you've already spent

401
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,500
with them so if you spent 10 million

402
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,939
dollars with them to come in and do an

403
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,830
efficiency evaluation of your company

404
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:10,190
they're gonna tell you that you can save

405
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:11,510
110 million they don't know how but

406
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:14,270
that's what they're gonna tell you and

407
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:16,340
it's almost always always always layoffs

408
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:19,130
they're gonna tell you if you outsource

409
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:21,920
you can do it so much cheaper if you you

410
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:24,110
know reduce this group from 3 to 5

411
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,149
five to three it'll automatically save

412
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,529
you X amount well they're not actually

413
00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:28,760
going and talking to the people that do

414
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:31,579
the jobs they're not actually going

415
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:34,579
through and saying hey you know what do

416
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:35,899
you do nobody really talks to you if

417
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:37,969
anybody's been through this efficiency

418
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:39,110
consultants thing they never come talk

419
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,269
to you and ask you how do you do your

420
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,860
job because then they'll start to see

421
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:45,589
the little things like other duties as

422
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,480
assigned they're only gonna see the job

423
00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:51,190
title and say oh you got four people

424
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:53,750
that do server admin okay you need one

425
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:55,970
really why well that that's industry

426
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,440
standard is one person okay well so

427
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,699
we'll fire three people now less than

428
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:04,160
that one person quits because they got

429
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:05,599
too much work to do the big thing to

430
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,279
think about with efficiency consultants

431
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,639
is who brought them in a lot of times

432
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:13,820
the CEO wants to do you know show a big

433
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:16,310
bottom-line increase for the

434
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,750
shareholders but that doesn't

435
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:19,670
necessarily bode well for the company

436
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:21,620
you have to look at who brought them in

437
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:26,329
why they brought them in maybe it's

438
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:28,339
something that's a bad idea usually like

439
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:30,769
I said it means layoffs and that's

440
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:32,269
unfortunately their big m/l is all we

441
00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:34,550
can outsource and or you have too many

442
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:36,140
people so they're gonna try and say that

443
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:38,060
you're you spend a lot of money on

444
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:41,769
capital for you know the HR side and

445
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,768
you're not getting anything out of it

446
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:50,600
has anybody ever been involved in an

447
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:55,459
efficiency consultants evaluation one

448
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:58,430
person do people so it's painful because

449
00:16:55,459 --> 00:17:01,579
you get told from on high what actually

450
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:03,170
your job is and how you do it so your

451
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:06,139
manager may understand that you know

452
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:07,790
twenty percent of your time is in you

453
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:10,610
know threat hunting and twenty percent

454
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:11,990
is in policy writing and and they may

455
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:14,510
understand because you may have to do a

456
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:17,660
timesheet but what they don't do is they

457
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:19,099
don't come to your level usually and ask

458
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:21,679
you questions about how you do your job

459
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:22,938
an example of this is that we had one of

460
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,949
the outsourcing companies that we were

461
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:26,540
working with did decide ok we're gonna

462
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:29,540
bring in these efficiency consultants so

463
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:31,010
we can evaluate your job so we know how

464
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:34,820
many people to bring in to do your job

465
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:35,780
as part of the outsourcing ok fine so

466
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,770
they come in

467
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,440
at the time I worked in ID

468
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:40,780
administration and they said Oh idea

469
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,390
administration we got that no problem

470
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:49,220
you haven't asked me what I do we we do

471
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:51,050
ID admin you were fine okay we have 12

472
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:54,650
people right now they do this we can do

473
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:56,960
it for how are you gonna do our job with

474
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:59,750
four we have nine full timers and four

475
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:03,680
consultants you can't do this like that

476
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:05,630
or actually in 13 at the time um how are

477
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,400
you gonna do that and they say oh we do

478
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,770
idea administration across the board

479
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,270
well then they came in the consulting

480
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:14,780
company came in and they actually

481
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:19,970
started to realize what we do their team

482
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:21,290
grew to 30 people not much of a cost

483
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,950
savings there on their part

484
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:26,149
so the consulting company was not happy

485
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:27,950
yeah I mean the people themselves were

486
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:29,840
cheaper than what we were being paid but

487
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:32,150
they had to do more of them to

488
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,000
compensate for what we do so it just

489
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:35,900
didn't work out for them

490
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,330
all right so anybody think that

491
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:41,740
everything is outsourcing

492
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:41,740
it's a good idea to outsource anything

493
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:52,340
I love this gift so risk management is

494
00:18:50,899 --> 00:18:55,699
one of the things I've continued to

495
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:58,039
fight outsourcing you cannot outsource

496
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:00,440
your risk effectively because the people

497
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:02,690
themselves that are doing the the jobs

498
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:05,870
on the outsourcing side don't care about

499
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:08,179
your company they care about fulfilling

500
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:10,668
the contract if you care about did you

501
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:12,019
renew they care about are you expanding

502
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:13,970
anything are you getting more

503
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:17,029
information so that you know you can

504
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:18,919
want to use more of their services they

505
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:20,690
don't care about did you get popped or

506
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:23,990
not unless it's in the contract that

507
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:25,820
they're responsible for that they just

508
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:27,320
don't care so it's not something that

509
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,939
you want to outsource is your risk

510
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,918
management area you may outsource ID

511
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,870
administration you may outsource you

512
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:34,159
know pen testing things like that but

513
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,928
your risk management the people that

514
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:37,669
actually evaluate the risks and tell the

515
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:39,740
business what to do as far as like hey

516
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:41,269
this is a bad idea if you want to accept

517
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:44,179
the risk that's fine but the business

518
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:45,710
needs to do it that person is never a

519
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:48,110
good person do the outsourcing because

520
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:49,370
unfortunately they don't care they're

521
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:51,979
not going to go to the business with

522
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:53,959
good decisions and say we understand the

523
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:56,059
way your business works and here's why

524
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,190
we shit we should not accept this risk

525
00:19:56,059 --> 00:20:02,570
they're just gonna say industry says

526
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:09,519
this is bad that's not a whole big infra

527
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:09,519
yeah I'm sorry can you

528
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:26,610
No

529
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:34,680
yeah so the question was what happens if

530
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:36,870
it's just a checkbox type of an MSSP

531
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,340
contract and those exist it's definitely

532
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:40,949
like the pen testing side of it is

533
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,300
really easy to do that with because of

534
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,460
the fact that they come in they either

535
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,990
you know run a scan or they do a little

536
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,940
bit of you know data validation in that

537
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:49,230
and they say here's your report and then

538
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,610
you get your check box if you're

539
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:54,180
literally looking for that that's one

540
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:56,639
thing but most of the time most people

541
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:58,350
are not looking for a check box the

542
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,820
people that are at this conference don't

543
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:01,169
want a check box they want to know

544
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:20,850
what's wrong they want to know how to

545
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:23,690
fix it I'm not sure I understand the

546
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,689
question how do you

547
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:35,109
[Music]

548
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:43,809
I mean it could be if you're if it's

549
00:21:41,139 --> 00:21:46,149
something where the management is

550
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:47,740
bringing an MSSP and to do a pen test

551
00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:50,229
over to find out if you are drink doing

552
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,999
your job correctly that's that's 100%

553
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:54,639
possible I mean I haven't seen it

554
00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:56,350
personally but I can definitely see the

555
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:57,639
use case for that if the manager doesn't

556
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:59,110
trust you that you're not doing your job

557
00:21:57,639 --> 00:22:01,418
correctly then yeah I can see them

558
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:03,549
bringing in a pen test to say you said

559
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:05,440
that this was secure and it's not that's

560
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:22,690
probably a very valid use case I've just

561
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:24,759
never seen it personally yeah I get to

562
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:26,230
that later in the slides about the

563
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:27,940
response if something goes wrong and

564
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:32,679
things like that yeah we'll get to that

565
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:34,059
just in a minute so if someone does make

566
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:36,159
the decision on you know from the

567
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:37,600
c-level to say or director level to say

568
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,389
we need to outsource this particular

569
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,090
task you need to start looking at which

570
00:22:40,389 --> 00:22:44,918
company is right for you because if you

571
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:46,689
know obviously you've got hundreds of

572
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:48,340
companies out there that will do certain

573
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:49,600
jobs you need to make sure that you get

574
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,889
the right one that fits with your

575
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,330
culture it fits with your needs and

576
00:22:50,889 --> 00:22:58,360
things like that so it's going to be

577
00:22:55,330 --> 00:23:00,279
painful you're probably going to be

578
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,928
pulled in to review certain parts of it

579
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:03,820
you may not be as involved as you would

580
00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:05,350
like to be but you should at least be

581
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:08,379
involved in some way shape or form and

582
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:10,209
if if if it affects your job you should

583
00:23:08,379 --> 00:23:11,590
be able to explain your role explain

584
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:15,039
what you're expecting from them things

585
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:17,049
like that the one thing that I didn't

586
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:20,679
expect when I went to a true global

587
00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:23,369
company is your company that you're

588
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:25,869
looking at big enough to support you

589
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:28,149
this was a big thing for me when I moved

590
00:23:25,869 --> 00:23:30,100
to continue when we started to say you

591
00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:31,928
get a lot of people like everyone here

592
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,899
has their favorite security company

593
00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:37,779
right it may be a trusted SEC it may be

594
00:23:34,899 --> 00:23:39,939
you know like secure works I don't know

595
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:41,710
whoever and you're gonna say I know them

596
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:43,419
I'd the really good I know the people

597
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:46,210
that work there they really care they're

598
00:23:43,419 --> 00:23:49,600
gonna give and do us a great job when

599
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:50,410
you're in my situation I need people on

600
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:55,120
the ground in CID

601
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:57,550
in 12 hours as much as I love Dave and I

602
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,870
love trusted SEC he's not he can't put

603
00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:01,330
someone on a plane and get them there in

604
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:03,520
12 hours so he wouldn't be a good

605
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:05,830
category for like my incident response

606
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,930
team so you need to make sure when

607
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:09,370
you're looking at those type of teams is

608
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:11,020
that something that they're able to

609
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:13,149
cover your entire spectrum of what you

610
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:15,240
need and it may be something where you

611
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:17,950
need to go with someone that has a

612
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,320
comprehensive global coverage company

613
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:21,610
where they can be in sydney in 12 hours

614
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,159
because they're literally down the road

615
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:25,240
and unfortunately that means that you're

616
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,710
gonna have to look at people like

617
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,900
Verizon you're gonna have to look at

618
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:30,490
people like a why those type of

619
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:33,610
companies that have that coverage across

620
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:35,380
the globe so it's a lot of things that

621
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:37,929
you have to think about once you when

622
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:41,470
you're in your your particular role what

623
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:43,240
works for us so you know one another

624
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:45,100
thing I came up with that I hadn't

625
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,250
realized before was our data loss

626
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:50,080
prevention has to have people in amia

627
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:51,970
because this I learned recently anemia

628
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,750
when you do data loss prevention you

629
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:57,460
can't see the person that's doing it if

630
00:24:55,750 --> 00:25:01,630
you're looking at your console it has to

631
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:04,240
be obfuscated so you'll see somebody big

632
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:07,030
string of characters copy this file off

633
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,860
to this location so then you have to go

634
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:11,860
to your HR and legal teams and say this

635
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:13,179
happened what do I do then they get

636
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,919
involved they get an investigation

637
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,720
started at some level then they finally

638
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:19,750
have a process that says okay now we

639
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,280
cannot escape that name then they

640
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,120
actually go through and they talk to the

641
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,149
person and things like that

642
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:27,129
the PII laws in gdpr require that you

643
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:30,280
can't see that stuff so you need someone

644
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:31,990
in amia to do that so you can't do that

645
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,450
remotely it can't be somebody that's in

646
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:36,220
India that's doing that so your

647
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:38,530
outsourcing needs to understand that and

648
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:41,020
understand where the MSSP is sitting

649
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:43,170
because if it's not in amia they don't

650
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,170
qualify

651
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:50,809
this is another small company problem so

652
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:53,120
has anybody ever read a contract from

653
00:25:50,809 --> 00:25:56,750
start to finish on a managed service

654
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:59,389
provider have you looked at the part

655
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:01,940
where it says if you're unable to do XYZ

656
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:03,860
and you have to and they breach for

657
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:07,580
whatever reason the contract itself

658
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:10,189
they oxo amount of dollars back usually

659
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:11,809
it's something where they owe at least a

660
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:14,690
percentage of the total cost of the

661
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:17,780
contract back if not in addition to any

662
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:20,720
damages that happen that may bankrupt

663
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:22,370
the company if it's a small enough

664
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,590
company and you contract with them and

665
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:25,639
they do something really bad that

666
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:28,040
company may no longer exist if you're

667
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,140
large enough that was another thing I

668
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:32,389
didn't think about before I started this

669
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:34,940
most recent contract negotiation it's

670
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:37,370
just the being that I was in a us-based

671
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:39,340
company I never really had to take that

672
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:41,809
into account because we weren't that big

673
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:43,280
but if your company is that big that's

674
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:45,740
something I would look at if I was

675
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:51,678
looking for an MSSP can they handle if

676
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:52,820
something goes sideways and then

677
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,130
obviously you're gonna want to talk to

678
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:56,809
your references right I want to talk to

679
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:58,490
people in my vertical that have used you

680
00:26:56,809 --> 00:27:01,220
before what they've let you know talk to

681
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:04,370
and this is great for that company to

682
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:05,360
provide you if they can't the problem

683
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:08,000
with that is they're going to

684
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,649
cherry-pick they're going to go to the

685
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,419
companies that say oh they did a really

686
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:13,630
great job for us they're not gonna give

687
00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:15,980
you the people like wow they really suck

688
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:17,240
it's just that's not good business for

689
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,309
them they're gonna look for the ones

690
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,690
that actually you know like them before

691
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:23,809
they actually you know just put them on

692
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:25,910
the phone with you so go back to your

693
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:29,000
network find the people who have used

694
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:30,770
that company use Twitter use networking

695
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,929
groups throw it out on you know on

696
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:35,179
LinkedIn something to say hey I'm

697
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:35,840
looking at company X has anybody else

698
00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:37,490
used them

699
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,459
get out chant and get out of the channel

700
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:41,630
on that and talk to that company and

701
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:43,490
find a real story without working

702
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:46,250
through the MSSP to find out how they

703
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:48,160
that company feels about it it may be

704
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:51,500
that they love it and maybe they hate it

705
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:53,929
but I guarantee if it's a three-letter

706
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:56,560
consulting company I've worked for three

707
00:27:53,929 --> 00:27:58,870
of them and I hate them

708
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:01,149
so I will give more than candid feedback

709
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:02,949
after this of any of the ones I've

710
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:05,260
worked with and good and bad things

711
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:05,800
about them so if you guys want to ask me

712
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:09,310
after that

713
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:11,950
feel free so once you have a company in

714
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:13,720
mind so once you say ok we're gonna go

715
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:15,370
with company X they're big enough for us

716
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,080
they can handle the the issues of

717
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:17,590
something goes sideways we've got good

718
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,990
reviews

719
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:21,760
everybody likes um they can cover what

720
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:26,250
we need yes we're good

721
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:28,210
awesome this is my life lately

722
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:30,220
everything goes back and forth and back

723
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:32,050
and forth because both sides are gonna

724
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:34,780
have lawyers involved and both sides are

725
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:35,680
gonna try and screw the other one it

726
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,270
just happens

727
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,980
so you're gonna get oh well we're gonna

728
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:40,510
change this slightly we don't like that

729
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:42,160
change how about we change this slightly

730
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,300
and you're gonna go back and forth and

731
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,240
they're going to come back to you and

732
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:48,760
say well can we get by with doing this

733
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,220
part of your job and not this part well

734
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,360
can can we get by with everything except

735
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:57,160
for this piece and we'll do this piece

736
00:28:52,360 --> 00:29:00,820
in-house so you unfortunately was beets

737
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:02,710
no hmm

738
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:04,960
it has been my life for 8 freaking

739
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:06,610
months of going back and forth with one

740
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:11,740
vendor right now just trying to get one

741
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:13,419
contract in place too much yeah the

742
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:14,890
lawyers that are loving it because their

743
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:17,020
internal lawyers but they love the

744
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:18,880
contract language and say well that word

745
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:20,590
means this and it doesn't mean this and

746
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,850
it's like well it's a word like it

747
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:27,639
doesn't really affect the contract that

748
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:30,790
much but make sure legal is involved

749
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:32,230
anybody seen Beverly Hills Cop they will

750
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:34,840
the lawyers aren't gonna crawl up your

751
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:36,760
ass with a microscope and they're going

752
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,629
to find every little thing that may be

753
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,900
wrong with it

754
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:42,160
which is good for your site they'll make

755
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,600
sure your language is great they'll make

756
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,790
sure that you're protected and that's

757
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,260
what they're supposed to do the lawyers

758
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:48,879
on the other side are going to make sure

759
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:50,200
that they can try and get the most out

760
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,940
of it that they can and make sure that

761
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,370
they have the most wiggle room in the

762
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:56,350
contract to be able to say you know what

763
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:58,780
this is something that we can get by

764
00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:00,600
with saying this because we can twist it

765
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:02,620
this way and then we don't have to do it

766
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,719
that's what the lawyers are involved

767
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:06,760
with our for so the your lawyers need to

768
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,170
be able to say this is okay or this is

769
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,790
not okay and I understand what you're

770
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:11,710
trying to go through because if you

771
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:12,970
don't understand if the lawyers are not

772
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,530
technical enough to understand what

773
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,940
you're trying to do they're not going to

774
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:17,379
know the language well enough to know

775
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:22,030
when a company is trying to weasel out

776
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:24,430
of it the biggest thing that you want to

777
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:30,340
take away from this talk get everything

778
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:31,660
in writing if possible . if it's not in

779
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,399
writing they're gonna say we don't do

780
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:35,770
that or it's not part of the contract or

781
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,900
we can do an addendum for this much

782
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:39,520
extra money well yeah that's great but

783
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,480
i've already spent all this money on you

784
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,010
that you're supposed to doing this job

785
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,590
well yeah but that that particular line

786
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:49,660
item wasn't in the contract that's the

787
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:51,790
way it gets to bite you going back to

788
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:55,030
the legal side of things though the best

789
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:59,050
thing i saw in a previous contract as it

790
00:30:55,030 --> 00:31:02,980
is today I heard somebody chuckle on

791
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:04,930
that one that saved us so much that the

792
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:06,490
issue where we had with the ID admin

793
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:08,260
side of things where they came back and

794
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:10,750
they said you know what we don't do the

795
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:14,110
ID admin like that well the contract

796
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:14,740
says as we do it today so we were able

797
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:16,059
to say

798
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,380
here's proof of the things that we do

799
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:19,899
today here's the request that we

800
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:21,399
processed etc and they had to bring

801
00:31:19,899 --> 00:31:24,729
people in because it was in the contract

802
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:26,379
to say as it was done today that was our

803
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:28,600
best friend in that contract because it

804
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:31,899
saved us so much effort and so much time

805
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:34,918
that that MSSP refused to put it in the

806
00:31:31,899 --> 00:31:34,918
next time the contract a merabh

807
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:42,880
alternatively if something isn't

808
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,140
specific in the contract you can get

809
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,620
more out of them than they want you to

810
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:49,840
get out of it so our current contract we

811
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:52,600
have with at MSSP says they do

812
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,158
vulnerability management I love this

813
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,289
because that was my life for almost a

814
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,940
decade so I'm like ok let's let's play

815
00:31:56,289 --> 00:32:03,220
this game why are we being limited to

816
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:06,370
2500 IPs well that was what the contract

817
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:09,970
is no it's not contract says you do vm

818
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:13,350
for us well the way we base the contract

819
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:17,260
pricing was off of 2500 IPs I don't care

820
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:18,879
not my problem we literally went back to

821
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:20,980
them and said unlock the account because

822
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,870
we have more IPS to scan well that would

823
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:25,059
cost more money well cost you more money

824
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:26,229
it's not costing us any more I don't

825
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:28,000
care what you have to pay for it you

826
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:30,270
said you would do VM for us for this

827
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,480
long it's the contract hasn't ended yet

828
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:35,770
unlock the account and they had to so

829
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:38,320
the basics of what I'm trying to tell

830
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:40,570
you is no your contract better than they

831
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,520
do make sure your lawyers are involved

832
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:44,350
make sure you know you want everything

833
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:46,929
that you have in that contract the way

834
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:48,490
that you want it make sure that you talk

835
00:32:46,929 --> 00:32:50,380
to your legal team make sure you talk to

836
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:51,760
them and say here's the things that we

837
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,740
want them to do here's the contract

838
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:57,908
they're coming back with is there a way

839
00:32:53,740 --> 00:33:00,309
to make sure that this happens so the

840
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:02,710
drawback to that is that you end up with

841
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:05,590
a contract with this is when I was on

842
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:08,679
the MSSP side somebody wrote a statement

843
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:11,110
of work prior to when I got there and my

844
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:14,919
VP came to me and said ok in the

845
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:18,219
contract it says we provide this I don't

846
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:20,679
know what that is well it's written in

847
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:22,360
the contract so figure it out but I

848
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:22,779
didn't write the contract I have no idea

849
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,600
what this is

850
00:33:22,779 --> 00:33:26,559
we don't do whatever this is well we

851
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,219
have to figure out because it's in the

852
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,750
contract we have to provide it

853
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:33,240
sozin MSSP you're looking at okay what

854
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:35,310
what I don't know what am I supposed to

855
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,580
do so you had to figure out what that is

856
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:39,629
and hope the client was okay with it so

857
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:41,639
make sure that when you're going through

858
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:43,050
the contracting process you're MSSP

859
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,880
gives you examples of what they're going

860
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:46,770
to do because they may be just putting

861
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:50,070
words on paper that they've been using

862
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:51,270
as a boilerplate for years and then they

863
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,649
don't know what that is and they can't

864
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:54,030
provide it to you so when you go back

865
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:55,280
and say well I didn't get this report

866
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:58,139
well we don't know what that report is

867
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:59,879
it's not my problem another thing that

868
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,560
you need to go back to the contract make

869
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:05,400
sure that you know the contract better

870
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:07,740
than they do oh and the other thing was

871
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:10,280
um make sure your contract doesn't

872
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:12,690
contradict another part of the contract

873
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:15,030
so your contract may say we do Vaughn

874
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:16,710
management okay great sounds good

875
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:19,260
make sure you read the whole contract

876
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:22,860
cuz later it may say you know if an act

877
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:24,690
of deity happens we'll do this well in

878
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,970
the event of a breach will do your

879
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:28,170
vulnerability management at that point

880
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:29,759
well technically you said you would do

881
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:32,460
it here oh yeah but the caveat is we'll

882
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,380
do it in the event of a breach so make

883
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:39,389
sure you know the entire contract not

884
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:43,260
just your section so some people may

885
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:45,659
want to fight the MSSP integration or

886
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:48,060
the rollout to a different MSSP or

887
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:50,279
things like that I thought about this a

888
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:52,920
lot with writing this talk what do and

889
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:54,360
should you fight it and I've come up

890
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,639
with a couple things that I think that

891
00:34:54,360 --> 00:35:00,990
yes maybe you should fight it but it

892
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:02,730
really depends on your role what you

893
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:05,540
think they're trying to do with the MSSP

894
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:10,800
if you think it's good for the company

895
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:13,950
etc um so the biggest one for me is it

896
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,290
would be part of your job and you like

897
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:18,390
your job like I like what I'm doing I

898
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:19,740
don't want to change it and the company

899
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:21,600
wants to change it for this reason is

900
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:23,700
that reason make does that make the

901
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,750
reason makes sense or is this you know

902
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,919
is this you fighting for your job

903
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,630
because you like your job and you don't

904
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,710
want to change or is this you fighting

905
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:30,150
for your job because you're good at it

906
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:32,100
you know it's the right thing for your

907
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:33,570
company and you don't think that MS

908
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,819
ESPYs would be the right way to go in

909
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:38,100
that situation if you have the ability

910
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:40,050
to voice your concern and/or fight the

911
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,640
MSSP move I would say that's absolutely

912
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:44,730
a good reason to do so

913
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,989
I mean if you have that that clout

914
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:47,430
that's one thing if you don't

915
00:35:45,989 --> 00:35:50,430
unfortunately sometimes you just have to

916
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:55,499
update your resume and let the snake eat

917
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:56,879
itself I still think it's it's so bad

918
00:35:55,499 --> 00:36:00,149
because that unfortunately that snake is

919
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:04,529
in a lot of stress but it's still a cute

920
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:06,059
picture but even if you do fight it

921
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:08,069
sometimes the CEOs just want to make

922
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:10,019
money and literally a you know a

923
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:11,308
efficiency consultant or someone in

924
00:36:10,019 --> 00:36:12,720
their network or whatever I said oh I

925
00:36:11,309 --> 00:36:16,380
save so much money by you know

926
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,368
outsourcing the company X you can but

927
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,839
that doesn't mean you're not gonna ruin

928
00:36:17,369 --> 00:36:20,190
people's lives that doesn't mean your

929
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:22,170
company itself is not going to be in a

930
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:23,819
worse risk position and you outsource

931
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:26,519
stuff to a company that doesn't care

932
00:36:23,819 --> 00:36:27,960
about you and yeah they'll do it but

933
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:33,029
they aren't gonna do it to the same as

934
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:34,589
people that are inside the company all

935
00:36:33,029 --> 00:36:37,799
right so let's say a contract is in

936
00:36:34,589 --> 00:36:40,288
place you have to know where your you're

937
00:36:37,799 --> 00:36:41,630
working with this MSSP from you have to

938
00:36:40,289 --> 00:36:44,099
know what role you're trying to follow

939
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:48,480
so you know how to deal with the

940
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:50,599
impending shitstorm so if you're an

941
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,410
analyst and you're you know the

942
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:55,410
rank-and-file member of the security

943
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:57,660
team or whatever it is make friends I

944
00:36:55,410 --> 00:37:00,210
cannot stress this enough the people

945
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:01,710
that are on the MSSP side it's not their

946
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:04,259
fault that the contract didn't go the

947
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:06,390
way that it should have but if you make

948
00:37:04,259 --> 00:37:07,799
friends with that group they're more

949
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:10,650
than what they're usually more willing

950
00:37:07,799 --> 00:37:12,569
to help you out when you need it via a

951
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:14,039
coffee you know taking is send them an

952
00:37:12,569 --> 00:37:16,470
email to their boss that they've helped

953
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:18,210
you maybe not tell exactly what they did

954
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:20,339
just say you know person was really

955
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:21,539
helpful they they really you know got me

956
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:23,489
out of a tight spot or something like

957
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:26,220
that that will build a lot of political

958
00:37:23,489 --> 00:37:27,869
capital with that team and in my current

959
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:30,348
role even though I don't have direct

960
00:37:27,869 --> 00:37:32,700
authority over the IT side of things

961
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:34,499
because I've gone to them and I said hey

962
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,788
how can I help you what can I help you

963
00:37:34,499 --> 00:37:37,890
in you know is there anything I can do

964
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:39,359
for you or when they did go out of their

965
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:41,220
way and above what they should be doing

966
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:43,380
on the contract to help me out with a

967
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:44,819
certain thing I made sure to contact

968
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,950
their manager and say hey that person

969
00:37:44,819 --> 00:37:48,650
was really helpful I appreciated it

970
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:51,509
please make sure that they know I'm

971
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:53,299
happy that they're around and I have had

972
00:37:51,509 --> 00:37:55,440
nothing but good success with that and

973
00:37:53,299 --> 00:37:56,550
obviously your cut your

974
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,170
contractors are trying to work within

975
00:37:56,550 --> 00:38:00,390
the string of the restraints of the

976
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:03,060
contract but they may be more willing to

977
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:09,020
help you outside of that if you're not a

978
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:12,090
jerk to them if you're a director

979
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:14,580

00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:16,620
to have things reports documentation

981
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:18,299
whatever it is in the contract that you

982
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:20,069
have that you're supposed to get every

983
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,870

984
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:23,520

986
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,890
accountable to it because they are going

987
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:31,259
to miss stuff time line slip it happens

988
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:33,060
evans everybody make sure that you get

989
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,410

on tuesday okay two days slip not a big

992
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:41,100
deal and it's hey I didn't get the

993
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:44,520
report last month oh yeah we forgot

994
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:47,040
about that okay we'll get on it get me

995
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:48,240
that report it goes back to

996
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:54,150
understanding the contract more than

997
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:57,180
they do if you're a c-level they're

998
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:58,620
going to try to screw you over they want

999
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:00,569
you to pay for stuff that they don't

1000
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:03,540
actually have to do because that makes

1001
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:06,000
money for them the way that ms has a lot

1002
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:10,259
of MS espy's work is they're going to

1003
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:14,130
try and get a efficiency out of putting

1004
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:15,860
multiple contracts on one person John

1005
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:18,030
Doerr Jane Doe is this type of a person

1006
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:20,460
they've got four accounts that they work

1007
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:22,920
on well they don't have to do as much

1008
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:24,240
for our account a then they can focus

1009
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,070
more time and they can add another

1010
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,290
account maybe because they're not giving

1011
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:29,610
you what you're supposed to be getting

1012
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:31,500
make sure you know the contract well

1013
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:33,690
enough to know what you're supposed to

1014
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:36,060
be getting out of them the big thing on

1015
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:37,290
this one that I like to say and my

1016
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,360
co-workers have heard me say this is a

1017
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:41,370
couple times

1018
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:44,730
anybody seen Roadhouse the movie

1019
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:46,200
Roadhouse Patrick Swayze he's talking to

1020
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:49,410
a bunch of bouncers and he's like I'm

1021
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:53,460
telling you to be nice oh what a be nice

1022
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:55,379
until it is time to not be nice try to

1023
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,970
work with the MSSP try to make sure that

1024
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:59,310
they understand that you're not just

1025
00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:00,629
gonna let them slide but then you're

1026
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:02,220
going to sometimes have to get to the

1027
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:04,200
point to where you are going to have to

1028
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:06,779
be the hammer and say you know what no

1029
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:09,560
you owe this to me figure it out this is

1030
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,560
your problem not mine

1031
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:22,099
I thought that was funny when you do go

1032
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:25,328
ahead and buy some sort of service or a

1033
00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:28,220
program or whatever it is from an MSSP

1034
00:40:25,329 --> 00:40:29,660
understand what you bought from them to

1035
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:32,868
the point the one person made earlier

1036
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:34,940
about it being a penetration test know

1037
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:38,540
that if you're you know if it's a task

1038
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:40,010
or a project or some small thing make

1039
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:42,140
sure that they give you status chat and

1040
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:44,329
status updates you know give you updates

1041
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:45,680
when they slip their timelines validate

1042
00:40:44,329 --> 00:40:47,150
their deliverables if they give you an

1043
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,649
SS scan and they said they're gonna do a

1044
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:52,880
pen test does anybody here want to

1045
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:55,309
accept that yeah I I have given one

1046
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,349
coworker and no end of shit for that for

1047
00:40:55,309 --> 00:40:59,480
getting a necess can for a pen test I

1048
00:40:57,349 --> 00:41:00,650
was like we will not do business with

1049
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:04,369
this company again I will make sure of

1050
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:06,020
it so if you get a task or a project and

1051
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:09,440
that's what you're paying for make sure

1052
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:10,910
you get what you're paying for sometimes

1053
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,319
you pay for a program and that's what

1054
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:14,270
we're dealing with right now and my

1055
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:16,970
company we're trying to get an entire

1056
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:19,160
program to understand our you know where

1057
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:22,660
we can expand our security team through

1058
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:25,430
a managed service so are you getting a

1059
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:27,368
actual C cert team out of this or are

1060
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:29,598
you getting a documentation monkey I

1061
00:41:27,369 --> 00:41:31,549
literally have in the previous contract

1062
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:34,309
a person that they are supposed to file

1063
00:41:31,549 --> 00:41:35,690
an incident report okay well what did

1064
00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:36,770
you know I just file I just write

1065
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:38,930
throughout the word document

1066
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:42,200
well what about I'm not technical I

1067
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:44,240
don't know know what you're paying for

1068
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,950
and make sure they provide that person

1069
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,270
to you because they're gonna try and get

1070
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:51,730
away with giving you the cheapest person

1071
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:53,660
they can with whatever you'll accept oh

1072
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:54,920
and the other thing is make sure that

1073
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:56,598
you taught and make sure they talk

1074
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,400
between their teams if you're buying a

1075
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:59,960
program and you have somebody that's on

1076
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,369
a C search side and you got somebody

1077
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,750
that's a security analyst and a sake

1078
00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:03,799
analyst and all this kind of stuff they

1079
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,930
need to talk if they're all the same

1080
00:42:03,799 --> 00:42:07,460
company they should not be telling you

1081
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:08,598
to tell that group to what to do and to

1082
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:10,579
come back to you to tell that group

1083
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:12,920
you're not a conduit between them if

1084
00:42:10,579 --> 00:42:14,990
they're the same MSP they demo a better

1085
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:19,430
talk to each other and that is a huge

1086
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:22,808
bony contention right now with me okay

1087
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:26,149
this one I'm gonna get ranting about a

1088
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:28,420
lot of places are doing virtual CISOs

1089
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:28,420
now

1090
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:32,549
not a thing

1091
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:37,120
especially when you're not you've never

1092
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:39,190
been a CE so you're not a virtual see so

1093
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:41,920
now it doesn't happen if you don't have

1094
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:43,680
the experience you're not one just

1095
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,060
because somebody slaps a title on you

1096
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,490
some of the people that do this job I

1097
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:49,900
respect I really do that I understand

1098
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:51,700
why they got in they wanted to be a

1099
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:54,060
consultant now that they're out a higher

1100
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:56,319
level they can do consulting in this

1101
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:58,330
capacity if it's something where you

1102
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,370
know they need the outside voice they

1103
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:01,750
need the bull in china shop whatever it

1104
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:04,000
is to get something done on that side

1105
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:05,710
they say we need somebody come in drop a

1106
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,440
bunch of this is all bad stuff on our

1107
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:09,520
board and say you need to fix it so that

1108
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,420
the board understands because it's

1109
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:14,230
somebody coming in from the outside

1110
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:16,570
yelling at us okay I get it but it's not

1111
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:18,670
an ideal situation especially not

1112
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:20,590
someone who's never done it before we

1113
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:22,180
all rant all the time we all rant on

1114
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:24,490
Twitter we all ran to unread it we all

1115
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:27,250
reverie buddy can rant does that person

1116
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:31,770
have the experience as they see so to be

1117
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:34,930
a virtual see so a lot of them don't

1118
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:37,000
anyway and the other thing the other

1119
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:38,290
thing is how virtual do you need them

1120
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,910
some of these you know some of these

1121
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:41,290
virtual CISOs are out there they may

1122
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:43,960
come in once a quarter and just say

1123
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:45,759
stuff and then they leave if that's the

1124
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:47,740
bull in the china shop that you need ok

1125
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,210
fine but no how often you need them to

1126
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:50,560
be there if it's something you're

1127
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,100
expecting them to be there three days a

1128
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,170
week

1129
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:54,490
make sure they're in the office three

1130
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:55,900
days a week like you contracted on for

1131
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:58,029
because a lot of times are gonna be

1132
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:59,500
along remote or I'm a way it you know

1133
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:01,600
someone who's a conference or whatever

1134
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:06,850
make sure they give you the time that

1135
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:08,350
they are supposed to be giving you all

1136
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:10,900
right so let's switch to the consulting

1137
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:12,910
side so I was nm SSP consultant for two

1138
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:15,010
years I had some tips and tricks that I

1139
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:18,160
did work through and tried to understand

1140
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:21,120
I have a contract that I don't know what

1141
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,170
it means how can I make the client happy

1142
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:26,770
without understanding what that client

1143
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:28,330
what the contract means biggest question

1144
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:30,370
I got when I was in MSSP consultant for

1145
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:34,930
vulnerability management what are other

1146
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:37,170
companies at our vertical doing most of

1147
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:39,160
the verticals we had one client oh

1148
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:40,720
you're an energy sector client we have

1149
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,759
you as an energy sector

1150
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,410
so I can't say well the other energy

1151
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,760
section sector clients that we have are

1152
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:48,160
doing this because we didn't have any I

1153
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,720
think I wouldn't lie I wouldn't you know

1154
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,520
I just refused to do that

1155
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:54,549
so what I would do is I change the words

1156
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:56,680
a little bit I can't specifically speak

1157
00:44:54,550 --> 00:45:00,010
to your vertical but I have seen other

1158
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:03,040
companies do this when I went to be a

1159
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:04,630
consultant I had had five years four or

1160
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:08,020
five years of experience as vulnerable

1161
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:09,760
team management for one company so when

1162
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:13,780
I was telling them that I had seen it at

1163
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:15,880
other companies one so that's a trick

1164
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:17,829
that consultants can use to say here's

1165
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:20,170
some information for you but it's not

1166
00:45:17,829 --> 00:45:22,030
necessarily relevant to you so you ask

1167
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:23,200
them a direct question make sure you get

1168
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:27,160
a direct answer because they are gonna

1169
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:29,049
try and wish you watch me answer you the

1170
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,879
other one is is that as I got farther

1171
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:32,349
into it I did start to use some of my

1172
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:35,079
other clients or in different verticals

1173
00:45:32,349 --> 00:45:39,880
in that vertical and say well other

1174
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:41,710
clients that we work with do this so I

1175
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:45,790
mean you will get some of that kind of

1176
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:47,530
back and forth language another thing

1177
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:48,790
they're going to do is bring in multiple

1178
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:51,970
people under one account

1179
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:53,490
oh here's John Doe or Jane Doe and six

1180
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:56,529
people are doing the job on the backend

1181
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:58,029
they're responding as that person but

1182
00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:00,460
that person may be only on the account

1183
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:03,369
one day a week but they're giving you

1184
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:05,190
that's that service with using other

1185
00:46:03,369 --> 00:46:07,599
people logging into that same account

1186
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:09,010
make sure that if you know if you have a

1187
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,869
named person on your account that that

1188
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:12,130
named person is who's working on the

1189
00:46:10,869 --> 00:46:13,599
account I've seen that with those

1190
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:15,579
three-letter companies multiple times

1191
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:19,150
they bring in somebody and they say oh

1192
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:20,680
I'm John Doe your voice sounds from it

1193
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:22,060
sounds different than I mean I've talked

1194
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:25,598
to John Doe a lot and you're not John

1195
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:28,299
Doe I'm John Doe pretty sure you're not

1196
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:30,369
a lot of the a lot of them do that

1197
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:33,099
because it's a lot of the MSSP s are

1198
00:46:30,369 --> 00:46:34,900
deliverable based so they're going to

1199
00:46:33,099 --> 00:46:39,569
try and throw multiple clients at their

1200
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:39,569
their consultants so that they get yeah

1201
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:51,700
right now it's not necessarily a bad

1202
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:54,279
thing to have more than one person in

1203
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:56,919
the account just understand that don't

1204
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:58,540
let them sell you one person and then

1205
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,550
have a bunch of people behind it they

1206
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:01,810
may be junior or maybe whatever that

1207
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:03,430
you're not getting what you're supposed

1208
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:05,799
to be paying for if you're paying for a

1209
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:07,750
senior analyst you don't want the senior

1210
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,280
analyst there for an hour or two hours a

1211
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:10,390
week and they've got a bunch of junior

1212
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,270
analysts doing the work behind the

1213
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:14,710
scenes so yeah I totally agree with you

1214
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:17,200
as far as the I'm sorry the question was

1215
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:18,730
do I feel it is bad to have more than

1216
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,410
one person on the account and it's not

1217
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:22,150
necessarily as long as that's what

1218
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:25,060
you're paying for if you're paying for a

1219
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:26,410
service and not a named person and they

1220
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:28,000
say we're gonna throw five people at

1221
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:29,020
this fine I don't care how many people

1222
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,210
you have to throw it as long as it's

1223
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:32,620
still this price it's when they start

1224
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:34,270
saying that it's this person you're

1225
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:35,620
paying for a senior analyst and you're

1226
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:37,330
getting somebody that just walked in off

1227
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,290
the street you're not gonna be happy

1228
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:42,640
because you're not gonna get the product

1229
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:44,500
they expect but anyway the deliverable

1230
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,940
side of the consultancies usually

1231
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,650
they're going to throw multiple projects

1232
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:49,500
at one consultant because that that

1233
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:51,970
person works more than 40 hours a week

1234
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,530
they get the economy of scale of saying

1235
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:55,330
oh well this person is working 60 hours

1236
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:57,550
a week I can give them extra work and

1237
00:47:55,330 --> 00:48:01,029
still get the same amount of income or

1238
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:02,860
more coming in from the client so they

1239
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:06,480
they burn out their consultants pretty

1240
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:08,260
quick and get a little short on time

1241
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,330
this is painful

1242
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:12,640
ripping and replacing one program

1243
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:14,529
consultant to another is super painful

1244
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:17,470
you're going to end up with a whole

1245
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:21,470
bunch of issues and they're all gonna

1246
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:26,390
hurt every single one of them

1247
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:28,220
like seriously gonna hurt so you're

1248
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:31,069
outgoing team if you're replacing

1249
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:33,439
company X with company a company X going

1250
00:48:31,069 --> 00:48:35,420
out isn't gonna want to train their

1251
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,829
replacements nobody wants to train their

1252
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:37,910
replacement you were being told well you

1253
00:48:36,829 --> 00:48:39,920
don't we don't want you anymore

1254
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:42,560
where you know your job is being given

1255
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,119
to someone else then that's what they're

1256
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:45,560
going to do they're gonna oh I I don't

1257
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:47,690
know we didn't have any documentation

1258
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:49,910
yada yada so they're not gonna want to

1259
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:50,930
do that the incoming team is gonna tell

1260
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:53,270
you they weren't trained they're gonna

1261
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:54,589
tell you there's no documentation make

1262
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:56,450
sure that if you're doing a rip and

1263
00:48:54,589 --> 00:48:58,490
replace know that it's gonna be painful

1264
00:48:56,450 --> 00:49:00,379
and know that it's going to be a

1265
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:02,839
contentious debate between the two of

1266
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:03,890
them make sure somewhere in your kind

1267
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:05,540
going back to the contract make sure

1268
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:08,290
that in your contract it says if you

1269
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:10,640
leave and you know that company is being

1270
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:13,250
replaced that they will provide

1271
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:16,190
documentation because if they don't tell

1272
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:17,569
you what they do now the new people

1273
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:19,040
coming in aren't gonna be able to hit

1274
00:49:17,569 --> 00:49:25,310
the ground right and know how to do the

1275
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:27,440
job going forward so obviously I talked

1276
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:29,119
a lot about MMS ESPYs if you want to

1277
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:32,510
bring it back in house during the rip

1278
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:34,329
and replace understand can you afford a

1279
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:36,349
full-time or dedicated resource

1280
00:49:34,329 --> 00:49:37,970
including every a lot of people in here

1281
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:40,430
our managers and that and and per

1282
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:42,140
tonight procure people into the company

1283
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:44,180
think about that when you're looking at

1284
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:46,609
bringing it back in-house if you pay a

1285
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:49,160
consultant $100 an hour and you pay

1286
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:50,540
somebody else 50 or 60 dollars now what

1287
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,828
is the makeup of the benefits for that

1288
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:54,170
person does it go over that hundred

1289
00:49:51,829 --> 00:49:55,970
dollars an hour figure out if you want

1290
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:58,040
to have that person with other duties as

1291
00:49:55,970 --> 00:50:02,140
assigned for maybe a little bit extra

1292
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:07,790
cost versus having the MSSP come in

1293
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:09,950
alright so wrap up for this is know your

1294
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:14,089
contract everybody seen that the film

1295
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:15,980
from Microsoft 95 I think it was Windows

1296
00:50:14,089 --> 00:50:21,920
95 with Steve Ballmer developers

1297
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:24,319
developers developers forwards inside

1298
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,970
out and upside out I mean if you know it

1299
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:27,500
better than them you're gonna be in such

1300
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:30,649
a better position than your and then if

1301
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:35,050
they know better than you and I think I

1302
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:35,050
have just a few minutes for questions

1303
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:49,390
right so that the question was what size

1304
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,950
of a company would this be good for the

1305
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:55,060
two companies that I've dealt with as

1306
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:58,240
far as the the being a procurement side

1307
00:50:55,060 --> 00:51:00,820
for the consultants has been pretty

1308
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:03,430
pretty substantial usually six eight ten

1309
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:05,140
thousand people or above being a

1310
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:07,118
consultant I've seen a number of the

1311
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:09,430
smaller companies where their security

1312
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:11,260
team is one person they unfortunately

1313
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:13,419
don't have the legal team in that to get

1314
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:16,180
involved so the security person needs to

1315
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:18,250
be that you know eyes on the contract to

1316
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:19,868
go through it and understand you know

1317
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:22,359
what they what they're getting into and

1318
00:51:19,869 --> 00:51:23,680
and try it as best they can make sure

1319
00:51:22,359 --> 00:51:28,000
that it's in the contract where it can

1320
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:29,859
be I mean unfortunately without the

1321
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:36,250
budget for lawyers that's as good as you

1322
00:51:29,859 --> 00:51:38,290
can do yeah usually when you're talking

1323
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:42,850
about contracts this size it's in the

1324
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:44,470
millions of dollars anyway I'll be

1325
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:46,259
outside afterwards if anybody else wants

1326
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:49,428
to have any questions thank you

1327
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:49,429
