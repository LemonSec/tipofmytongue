14
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,949

20
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:45,570
unfortunately not able to talk about

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,910
what I really wanted to talk about and

22
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,059
then I'm kind of like alright great

23
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,709

24
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,849
you know what for the next 45 minutes

25
00:00:52,710 --> 00:01:00,000
we're just gonna talk about why I like

26
00:00:53,850 --> 00:01:02,480
kittens you know alright just one I

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,709
couldn't pass off it was actually

28
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,570
apparently the cutest one out of two

29
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:09,298
hundred whatever but this is like the

30
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,369
caption is here we see an adorable

31
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,830
kitten cleaning its tiny squishy beans

32
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:15,210
I'm like what look what is wrong with

33
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,920
people I don't even understand what's

34
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,390
going on here but I had to share that

35
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,830
with you but no we're not really gonna

36
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,759
talk about that for 45 minutes I'm sure

37
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:26,250
who doesn't like cat pictures right so

38
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:28,439
as I was really contemplating what to

39
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,329
talk about you know I mean not like I'd

40
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,908
realize it I mean this place is full of

41
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:34,439
just really brilliant smart people you

42
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,159
know I mean we just get so inundated

43
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:41,490
like in a way we kind of I guess saying

44
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,259
we I'm not saying I know a lot but point

45
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,880
being is we as a whole know a lot of

46
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,100
stuff you know we're just inundated with

47
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,600
technology left and right you know

48
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,419
what's in the latest new blue tubes

49
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,610
coming out what's you know the next can

50
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,880
bus you know all this stuff it's it's we

51
00:01:53,610 --> 00:02:00,659
just throw ourselves with it because we

52
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,699
just kind of get it that kind of gets us

53
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,140
to this whole concept of well we start

54
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,540
problem solving in our minds right I

55
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,829
mean it as a result of that we end up

56
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,489
kind of ending up in our own little

57
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:12,510
bubble or own little world so I thought

58
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,520
I really want to share something new

59
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,410
with you guys it's

60
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,140
tangible that no matter where you're at

61
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:19,100
if you're new in this industry if you've

62
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,630
been around for a long time

63
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:25,609
everybody could really kind of walk away

64
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:30,290
with so my talk is called how Nathan

65
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:31,310
crashed and burned my thoughts with this

66
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:36,049
well yeah all right so we're not talking

67
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:40,210
about this kind of crashing burn we're

68
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:40,210
talking like this kind of crash and burn

69
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,030
actually took me a while to find some

70
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,859
that actually we're like fitting it's

71
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,570
amazing how many CGI'd like plane

72
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,950
crashes there are which is casually kind

73
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,510
of creepy if you think about people sit

74
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,630
around think about how they get made in

75
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:55,549
videos of plashing crashing planes so

76
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:57,290
alright so really it comes down to

77
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,700
nobody really told me a lot of things I

78
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:01,070
was just going through my career that I

79
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,570
really wish that I learned early on

80
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:05,510
because I think it would have saved me a

81
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:09,079
lot of time pain and heartache and this

82
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:10,670
is really of I guess you know they say

83
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,920
it kind of meets sharing a lot of the

84
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:16,339
the challenges that I ran into you

85
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,079
really kind of taken the hard path and

86
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,830
really cheering with you all so you

87
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,830
don't have to make those same mistakes

88
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,530
this I guess you could kind of say is

89
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:29,660
our our path and life right or at least

90
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:31,459
what we're told we go through right so

91
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:33,260
it come at the beginning you know I mean

92
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:35,150
we're born you know it's like the golden

93
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,829
years right you're you're like pre-k

94
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,959
whatever you're not even in school yet

95
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,700
you know that you know at the top here

96
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,050
is what we're talking about you know

97
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,549
they start coming on the curve you start

98
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,740
going through like high school and all

99
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:47,540
that you get to this point you're like I

100
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,580
don't know what's going on why I'm on

101
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,560
this plane you know get around the curve

102
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:53,450
again here and you're like I actually

103
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,250
don't really remember what happened here

104
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:58,190
in my life but they come around here

105
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,940
we're off to college you know I guess

106
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,670
we're know what we're doing with our

107
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:03,260
lives that from here we come around here

108
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,059
curve alright we make twenty billion

109
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:07,810
whatever you know have twenty billion

110
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,830
kids lose 20 billion well whatever right

111
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:12,590
start cruising through life some more

112
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:14,270
through the circles up some clouds cuz

113
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,910
sure they're cool graphics whatever

114
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:18,700
still come around here in our life

115
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:21,290
somehow we've avoided death again and

116
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,190
it's we keep going you know now we just

117
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,570
get to the point where we're just

118
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,880
figuring out you know what our chances

119
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,070
are life and death

120
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,900
and then we finally get to the end all

121
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,159
right so what right all right the big

122
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,960
takeaway from here is all right you

123
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,910
start your bourne boom and get to the

124
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,258
end you're dead all right that's pretty

125
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,310
much what the world tells you now this

126
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:38,889
is kind of what I thought of like how a

127
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,210
hacker works in their life so you come

128
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:41,410
out the gate and you fall off the edge

129
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,690
immediately you don't even make the

130
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,620
career right next thing you know your

131
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,389
parents are trying to figure out why

132
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,520
everything in your house is exploding

133
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:49,930
doesn't work anymore and what happened

134
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,750
to your sisters you know little iPod

135
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,910
right from there we somehow magically

136
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,160
get through high school and then when we

137
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,169
get to that nest point life again we

138
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,259
somehow totally missed the boat we had

139
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:04,198
up in like left field right if by them

140
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:06,820
our choices having quite killed us yet

141
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,349
we somehow spin around the next 20-30

142
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,820
years trying to figure out what's going

143
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:11,590
on and then we finally get to the point

144
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,870
where we ask ourselves what do I want to

145
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:19,869
do with my life that would figure that

146
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:21,039
out and we're dead yes so I'm like all

147
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:24,970
right

148
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:26,889
truly the irony here's what the world is

149
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,870
telling us this happened it's really

150
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:30,550
what's happening right like we've got

151
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,930
these whole concepts you know about how

152
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,030
how we're supposed to live our lives

153
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,919
what it's supposed to look like and

154
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:38,469
really just kind of brainwashing this I

155
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,270
think our whole lives so we're gonna

156
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,220
kind of dive off the deep end the first

157
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:47,169
thing that I would recommend you guys do

158
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:49,090
in that it was a hard lesson for me stop

159
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:53,830
thinking the world while all revolves

160
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:55,508
around to you yeah I should have warned

161
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,219
you that at least at some point if you

162
00:05:55,509 --> 00:05:59,320
don't get annoyed by some of the things

163
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:01,720
I'm telling you you might want to leave

164
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,130
so I really thought I was the man you

165
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,349
know going through life I was like you

166
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,120
know what I got this figured out this is

167
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:09,520
all about me I got this what do I need

168
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,710
other people for I got me kicked off

169
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,258
teams working with groups of people they

170
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:17,109
just didn't wrong way around that was a

171
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:19,599
result of wanting it my way because you

172
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,680
know I knew best right how many times

173
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:21,969
have you been in a meeting you had a

174
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,919
solution be like dude you know what I

175
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:27,909
got the best solution forget all these

176
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:29,830
other guys right right yeah yeah yeah

177
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:30,909
thank you someone who's honest thank you

178
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,630
all right

179
00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:37,389
I really wouldn't put the team the needs

180
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:39,969
of the others on the team above my own

181
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:41,650
because I had the best idea right forget

182
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:44,229
them if they can't hold their weight if

183
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:45,688
they can't pull along leave him in the

184
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:50,169
dust

185
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:52,870
ouch I wasn't really able to express my

186
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:54,729
ideas to others same idea right cuz I

187
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:57,219
got this figured out I know what's going

188
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:59,020
on forget the other guy right that

189
00:06:57,219 --> 00:07:02,080
actually made it even worse because I

190
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,560
didn't really know how to delegate what

191
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,090
I knew

192
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,030
so someone finally realized okay this

193
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,770
guy knows what he's talking about and I

194
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,179
guess we'll just give him free rein but

195
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,490
then because I was so used to doing

196
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:15,520
things in my own way I had no idea

197
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:17,529
really how to help explain my ideas to

198
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,240
other people and really where to go from

199
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:21,909
there

200
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,250
that really tied into you me not really

201
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:25,960
knowing how to collaborate new things

202
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,819
and even grow with others if you can't

203
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,888
admit where your own shortcomings are

204
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:32,080
are you gonna accept new ideas right I

205
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:33,819
see that a lot where we almost get so

206
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,560
wrapped around this one thing that like

207
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:37,150
you know we think we're awesome at that

208
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:41,680
we don't want to listen to input and

209
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:48,878
insight from others that kind of brings

210
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:50,639
me to this interesting story I worked

211
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,690
with this company for a short while I

212
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,639
don't remember if I was there for three

213
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:56,139
months six months or nine months I'm

214
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,430
pretty sure I was at least there for six

215
00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:01,000
months because I was able to collect

216
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:02,800
unemployment they were a global company

217
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,199
that had about I think about thirty

218
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,210
percent market share and I was brought

219
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,009
in like his mid-level engineer and I

220
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:11,169
came in and they knew I was in the

221
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:13,360
security space and they kind of promised

222
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:15,279
it did move me in there but I was

223
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,110
working on the software side and it was

224
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:21,550
great because I was really able to apply

225
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:23,229
myself but the downside is that I really

226
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:26,589
wasn't listening others I was just kind

227
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:28,270
of doing my own thing as a result the

228
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:30,189
project managers didn't want to work

229
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,508
with me in a passive aggressive way I

230
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:35,050
basically kind of got kicked out the

231
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:37,110
door so and the weird thing is I didn't

232
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:39,159
even realize what happened until later

233
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,479
realizing that it really wasn't me sure

234
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,640
there's you know those those cultural

235
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,579
pieces but I really broke rolled back to

236
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,750
the fact that you know I wanted a my way

237
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:50,310
there was actually this ridiculous thing

238
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:51,450
where we would go on what'd he call it

239
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,949
like

240
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,410
site projects for like a couple weeks

241
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:57,390
and the project managers didn't want us

242
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,829
are geing breakfast for the per diem

243
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:01,860
because they're letting us stay at a at

244
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:03,660
a more expensive hotel and it was like

245
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,490
seven dollars a day and I'm thinking

246
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,990
we'll forget you guys we're getting back

247
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,460
at like 3:00 in the afternoon I'm a guy

248
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,950
getting breakfast there I'm gonna still

249
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,780
charge for the per diem right so that

250
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,850
simple little thing seven bucks a day

251
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,589
right I mean I really wasn't caring

252
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:19,530
about where they were at what their

253
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:21,090
limitations were and and I just kind of

254
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:23,730
dulled right in and they never really

255
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:28,080
want to work with me again so was it

256
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:29,310
really worth what 28 bucks you know for

257
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,510
that two weeks or whatever it was for

258
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:37,349
the breakfast now so sorry so where do

259
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:40,620
we go from here I what's a better way to

260
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:42,690
look around this really got

261
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:52,230
acknowledging heart that you're not a

262
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:53,490
perfect person and that's okay I don't

263
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:56,930
know how much that kind of resonates

264
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,930
with you all if you kind of feel that

265
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,730
you have to live up to that expectation

266
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:11,099
but the reality is I had to realize that

267
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:14,520
it's okay not to be perfect being able

268
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:18,360
to accept criticism probably the next

269
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,160
biggest painful thing knowing that

270
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,420
you're wrong

271
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,980
that's a hard thing to learn you know

272
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,630
but it'll help you because chances are

273
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,220
after telling you something you want to

274
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:30,990
listen to it because it's gonna help you

275
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:32,400
later next thing is kind of performance

276
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,110
we kind of gotten in this world where we

277
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,730
think we pretty much have to you know

278
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,740
work non-stop right that we're

279
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,790
overloaded

280
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:41,790
overworked we've got this need we got to

281
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:43,740
succeed no matter what a perfectionist

282
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,209
always gotta have his answer that kind

283
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:48,720
of gets you into this really weird cycle

284
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:50,820
of burnout I experienced that where

285
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,030
pretty much I was going so hard and

286
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:56,490
trying to do everything that I hit the

287
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:57,720
wall where I actually couldn't think it

288
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,480
was weird like I'm literally sitting on

289
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,090
my desk and you know you couldn't ask me

290
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,020
to add you know like three plus seven

291
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,760
together in my

292
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,500
it's the most simple thing but my head

293
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,000
was hurting so much I burned my body out

294
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,950
so hard from trying to push those limits

295
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,450
you know living off mountain doing and

296
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,310
Domino's really not the best combination

297
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,959
in the first place but you know when

298
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,430
you're like so driven and I gotta solve

299
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:19,229
this problem I got to do this thing I

300
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:20,910
don't really care you kind of throw

301
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:22,589
these things to the side but the real

302
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:27,149
question is why is this driving you what

303
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:28,320
what why does that really matter it did

304
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:29,910
almost kill me it's kind of funny

305
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,850
because it seems like I run into death

306
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:34,230
situations a lot like that almost

307
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,510
happening like two weeks ago I think I

308
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,649
pissed off the wrong group of people as

309
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,689
I was putting this in here I realized

310
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:41,550
that but yeah I almost died from that

311
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,720
situation with with my health and during

312
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,079
the whole adrenaline thing and trying to

313
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,080
push those limits

314
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:51,480
reality's trying to solve the world's

315
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:53,100
problems then I can make you happy you

316
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,360
know it's like you start trying to push

317
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,170
for some goal that you think that's

318
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,880
gonna make you happy

319
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:59,099
the reality is it's not gonna make you

320
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,510
happy you know it's again it's like this

321
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,250
weird psychology thing and I'm sharing

322
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:04,589
this stuff with you guys not really to

323
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,940
tell you like how to live your life but

324
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:07,560
it's more of this concept of do you

325
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:11,040
realize if you're trapped in these

326
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,180
cycles and honestly it like I said if

327
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,910
somebody told me of this at least

328
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:19,770
planted that idea in my head I hope I

329
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:22,529
woulda listened I guess the part that

330
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:23,910
I'd like to say what this is you don't

331
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:26,029
want that prove to yourself that it you

332
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:29,459
don't have to prove yourself to anybody

333
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:30,480
I don't know if it's generational thing

334
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:32,010
we're really kind of learning from our

335
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,200
parents where things are wrong with us

336
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:36,529
but yeah you don't have to prove

337
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,529
anything yourself

338
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:40,770
it was so wrapped up with my whole life

339
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:43,410
like even it happened to my dad we

340
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:46,170
actually lost maybe tens maybe hundreds

341
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:47,640
of millions of dollars because he was

342
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:49,500
trying to push that limit just a little

343
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,839
bit more just a little bit more pretty

344
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,250
much like his whole life and everything

345
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,200
was lost pretty much like in favor in a

346
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,760
moment so I don't share this stuff

347
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:02,100
lightly with you I know it's kind of

348
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:03,660
weird stuff but it matters a lot of

349
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,490
personal projects that of mine have went

350
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,770
up in smoke because of this as well

351
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:10,050
I had a web hosting company go under a

352
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:13,170
IT services company go under crypto

353
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:14,910
currency exchange and to be honest all

354
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,410
my relationships suffer too because I

355
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:18,449
was so focused on making this thing

356
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,279
happen that you know what once I succeed

357
00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:21,599
once I get this thing that'll chase the

358
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:23,310
other stuff you know you know whatever

359
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,750
yeah you know relationships that's great

360
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,329
but I'd love to have a bunch of money

361
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,500
and be happy first and that's that's

362
00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:33,599
part of the whole problem you know we

363
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:36,089
getting this weird mindset so where you

364
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,649
start I'd say just stop in and say why

365
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:39,060
do I think I need to do whatever I'm

366
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:41,550
doing like right now like it's

367
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:43,739
mission-critical like if you're like my

368
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:46,969
sand is down I can't keep to my files oh

369
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:48,660
my gosh I can't go out I can't eat why

370
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,310
now I'm not saying you can't have

371
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,449
boundaries like you know we tinker with

372
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,250
stuff but when something becomes so

373
00:13:51,449 --> 00:13:55,709
critical that it starts damaging your

374
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:57,779
health or everything else is like kind

375
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:59,008
of taking over you really want to stop

376
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:02,459
and take take note of what's kind of

377
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:07,350
going on with you so stop slowing down

378
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:09,089
figuring out what's going on a lot of

379
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:11,069
times what we think is a big deal isn't

380
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:12,779
a big deal all the time at work right

381
00:14:11,069 --> 00:14:14,370
man we got to get this report done in

382
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:17,009
it's got it and even by Friday oh my

383
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:19,439
gosh we got to get this RF RFP in by six

384
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:20,910
o'clock otherwise the world's gonna end

385
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:22,230
so you burn out your adrenaline you're

386
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:26,100
punching through it and then you get to

387
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:27,870
the end and what there's really no

388
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,819
payoff all right you're pushing for some

389
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:33,420
kind of imaginary goal that you're never

390
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:36,449
gonna hit so if you take your time

391
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,529
you're gonna think clearer it's all

392
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:39,149
going to turn out better and I'm not

393
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:40,949
talking about saying all right if you

394
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:43,949
see a baby in the middle of the streets

395
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:45,540
stop think try to grab that baby before

396
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,680
it gets hit no I'm not talking like that

397
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,180
of course there's things that really

398
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:52,109
come up that you know you just have to

399
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:53,519
make decisions but if if stuffs

400
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,899
happening that you don't know why you're

401
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,639
doing you're going to autopilot mode

402
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:58,410
that ruler should be kind of like like a

403
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:03,329
key indicators to you know what's going

404
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:07,829
on or that something might be off going

405
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:09,359
solo is lonely in limiting all right so

406
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:11,609
how many people can resonate with this

407
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,290
whole idea of saying I do my own thing

408
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:21,689
how I want when I want and where I want

409
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:24,329
yeah exactly right yeah so what I

410
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:28,050
realize is that was stunting my creative

411
00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:29,800
growth when I was doing it my way that

412
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,839
was stopping me from realizing that or

413
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:35,740
their ways in accepting other ways to do

414
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,779
things and just just really being able

415
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:41,769
to let go and realize there was more

416
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:43,630
going on here successfully isn't a solo

417
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:45,250
thing and I think this is another huge

418
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:48,250
thing that society is really messed with

419
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:50,320
us about if you think you're gonna

420
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,820
become a billionaire by living in a dark

421
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,529
room programming or solving a problem

422
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:57,430
with no one else involved you're

423
00:15:53,529 --> 00:16:04,089
delusional and yeah I actually thought

424
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:05,469
that's how things worked then you start

425
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:09,040
believing bad things about yourself it's

426
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:10,510
a soul it's like this weird cyclical

427
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,469
cycle where you start being by yourself

428
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,760
and then you start trying to figure out

429
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,430
things by yourself so you start coming

430
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:17,500
up with these weird chaotic things that

431
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:20,709
are dis aren't the truth you know only I

432
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:22,209
can fix this thing everybody's against

433
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:24,459
me because they don't see my point of

434
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:30,099
view you know and in all these other

435
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:32,109
things you also miss opportunities to

436
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,779
grow as a person as well as you know

437
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:37,630
just kind of those other pieces as well

438
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:40,300
the reality check is ask any successful

439
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:42,220
person out there how much help they've

440
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,719
gotten from other people like guarantee

441
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,829
they're gonna tell you they've had a lot

442
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,529
of people helping them out and that

443
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:48,880
they're just really grateful for a lot

444
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:50,920
of the help that they've got if they're

445
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,360
not they're lying to you chances are is

446
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,979
because they're trying to buy something

447
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,360
for or get you to buy something or buy

448
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:59,890
it sell into something that it's all

449
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,779
about you and nobody else this is kind

450
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:04,900
of interesting too because I realized

451
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:07,000
that if you're stuck where you're at and

452
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,309
you're not getting promoted if you're

453
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,020
finding that other people are getting

454
00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:11,459
jobs and positions that you're looking

455
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,290
for

456
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:16,030
chances are it's you and it's not the

457
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,990
people are you're around because people

458
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,369
are getting promoted and put in

459
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,540
positions because they know how to deal

460
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:21,119
with other people they're used to

461
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:23,889
dealing with confrontation and conflict

462
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,819
to some degree now let's be honest

463
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,169
there's a lot of people that are in

464
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:28,510
management positions that probably

465
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:30,100
shouldn't be right but in an ideal world

466
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:32,320
where you want to be is you want to be

467
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,540
that person that gets selected because

468
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,820
you've got that that heart that ability

469
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:39,129
to talk to people to hear criticism to

470
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,090
receive stuff that's hard to listen to

471
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,770
the people that are honor you that are

472
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,570
pissed off

473
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:45,150
and not take it personally because nine

474
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:46,200
times out of ten it's not you it's done

475
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,720
that they gotta get stuff off their

476
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,190
chest but if your solo doing your own

477
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,480
thing wrapped up in your own world

478
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:55,620
you're gonna completely miss that I

479
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,150
pretty sure I've lost a couple people

480
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:00,719
working for me because of that to you

481
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:01,950
I'll piss off a lot of people and I got

482
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,280
a lot of grace in that too so it all

483
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,280
worked out

484
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,640
truthfully any organization you want to

485
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,290
be looking for is gonna be looking for

486
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,700
people that are that are from a

487
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:14,639
leadership standpoint they can take

488
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:17,670
orders so again it's not my way it's not

489
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,620
what I want to do it's more of what can

490
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:21,090
I do for the organization how do they

491
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,860
need to help me it's like this total

492
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:25,169
shift from looking at yourself to saying

493
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,760
what do I get out of this saying how can

494
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:28,440
I help others that's what a lot of this

495
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,730
really ropes around instead of looking

496
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,360
at this from the standpoint of what's in

497
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,220
it for me

498
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:37,530
and looking at more of like how can I be

499
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:38,760
a asset or helping other people learning

500
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:41,430
to deal with people all right we're to

501
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,740
cover that room accepting help from

502
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:44,940
others that's another huge one I think

503
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,590
it really kind of ties in even that

504
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,750
whole performance thing too like we got

505
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:50,100
it like figure it all ourselves we can't

506
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:53,840
ask for help because we asked for help

507
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:59,060
were weak where did that come from

508
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:01,470
unlearn that okay yeah I kind of had

509
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:03,419
interesting thoughts with this one so

510
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:06,420
gaming a movies man there's complete

511
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,860
waste of time it's reality why it's an

512
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,480
escape you know I mean it's

513
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,949
entertainment why do we were typically

514
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,120
go to it because you're trying to escape

515
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,660
for him something something's kind of

516
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,879
going on

517
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,080
you got more tired how many times you

518
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,640
gotten home after a long day and you're

519
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,560
like dude I'm just gonna pop on Netflix

520
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,820
do this thing next thing you know it's

521
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,889
like 4:00 in the morning you're

522
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,929
exhausted and then you just drag the

523
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:26,340
next day right we somehow buy into this

524
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,170
whole thing we're like I'm just gonna do

525
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:33,840
the same habit it's gonna somehow work

526
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:34,440
out better but it just drains you we got

527
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,030
to the point where everything

528
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,950
overstimulates you you don't think about

529
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,330
it now even on the social media what

530
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,490
things get the most attention the things

531
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:43,710
that either piss you off or like pull on

532
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:45,120
you in some way like even even all right

533
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,950
let's be honest who the heck watches

534
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,659
cable TV or the mainstream news networks

535
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,880
anymore they're turning to every trick

536
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,770
that they can which is stimulating you

537
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,149
to get you dragged in to get you

538
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:56,189
emotional get you pull

539
00:19:54,149 --> 00:19:58,228
in so these are all these really weird

540
00:19:56,189 --> 00:20:00,239
like snags and tricks that really start

541
00:19:58,229 --> 00:20:02,639
jacking with us to be honest it's been

542
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:04,979
about I think two months maybe one month

543
00:20:02,639 --> 00:20:06,718
where I haven't really plugged into any

544
00:20:04,979 --> 00:20:08,399
TV and all this kind of stuff and it was

545
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:10,259
really hard but I feel amazing I

546
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:11,668
actually sleep better I feel like I got

547
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:13,139
way more time in the day it's actually

548
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:15,689
weird I was like what do I do with

549
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:19,408
myself now so hopefully you can have

550
00:20:15,689 --> 00:20:21,149
that same revelation to also get angry

551
00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:22,199
oh my gosh seriously when's the last

552
00:20:21,149 --> 00:20:24,359
time you ever played a first-person

553
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:27,029
shooter and like I cannot believe how

554
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:28,739
many enraged thirteen-year-old boys are

555
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:30,839
on there just cussing up a storm I'm

556
00:20:28,739 --> 00:20:32,279
like are your parents not hold that mean

557
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:33,658
it's just amazing I'm like actually

558
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:39,959
worried for what's gonna happen with

559
00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:41,129
these guys grow up you know that's

560
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:45,319
pretty straight forward wasting time

561
00:20:41,129 --> 00:20:47,698
right not just constructive all that

562
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:49,199
this isn't easy to against this false

563
00:20:47,699 --> 00:20:50,489
sense of achieving and I was kind of

564
00:20:49,199 --> 00:20:52,649
wrapping that around my head as far as

565
00:20:50,489 --> 00:20:53,999
like even TV shows and also like gaming

566
00:20:52,649 --> 00:20:55,918
you know like when you unlock those

567
00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:57,779
achievements or like congratulations you

568
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,549
have unlocked all 400 achievements of

569
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:00,419
this game

570
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:02,489
awesome so is your quality of life

571
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:04,679
better is anybody gonna know what that

572
00:21:02,489 --> 00:21:07,619
game was like two years from now maybe

573
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,369
six months like why you know again it

574
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:10,049
kind of ties back to the whole

575
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:11,549
performance thing we got we did

576
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:12,899
something we got to feel good about

577
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:14,789
ourselves scoobsie completed something

578
00:21:12,899 --> 00:21:17,369
but it's it's a lie it's all a lie I

579
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:19,949
actually did the math on this

580
00:21:17,369 --> 00:21:20,698
I watched everybody know it's like

581
00:21:19,949 --> 00:21:25,159
Stargate rapes

582
00:21:20,699 --> 00:21:27,839
sg-1 and all that kinda stuff yeah so in

583
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:30,329
three months ago I watched the entire

584
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:32,339
series four beginning in the end why I

585
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:34,619
don't know being nostalgic right I

586
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:37,019
didn't math on that and I realized if

587
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:40,228
you were to do a non-stop I put so by

588
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:42,959
episode the whole thing it's 6 days 9

589
00:21:40,229 --> 00:21:45,239
hours and 15 minutes of time that's not

590
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:46,819
taking a leak that's not eating that's

591
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:50,429
not sleeping that's it straight through

592
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:53,729
153 hours of 15 minutes or 9180 nine

593
00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:56,669
minutes the sad thing is I did that

594
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:59,609
twice in my life dude like seriously

595
00:21:56,669 --> 00:22:04,259
that's like two weeks of my life that I

596
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:05,428
wasted on a stupid show I can't believe

597
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:05,789
someone's excited about that but you

598
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:07,500
know okay

599
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:13,170
that's why this talk

600
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:16,400
for you too man all right it's an escape

601
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:18,900
so I would say what are you running from

602
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,060
that's a hard thing to ask yourself and

603
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,920
even focus if you try to escape from

604
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,720
something you're trying to run from that

605
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,950
thing so I asked what are you running

606
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,850
from that's making you real go to those

607
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:31,890
other things what are you trying to

608
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:34,290
avoid choose to confront that and or let

609
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:36,240
it go otherwise you're gonna give

610
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:38,090
basically stuck in the same cycle you

611
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,050
know you're not gonna escape out of that

612
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:41,370
starting off technology that's actually

613
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:44,460
probably the one of the weirdest things

614
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:47,100
to you but we get wrapped around in that

615
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:49,440
to you I realized that like when I would

616
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,610
start coding at night again I start

617
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,050
getting wrapped up on my head you know

618
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:53,520
it's all the whole problem solving thing

619
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:54,810
let's let's make this work let's make

620
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,280
this happen

621
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,780
yes really we're doing that and then you

622
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:01,590
got the TV on on the background like how

623
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:02,730
my stoop is that but we need to get out

624
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,139
we need to get away from some of this

625
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,610
stuff I'm not saying don't have hobbies

626
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,230
don't tinker with this stuff but it's

627
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:08,909
like we've gotten so tied into the stuff

628
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:14,970
that we can't even see the outside world

629
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:16,170
right so I guess kind of before we get

630
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:17,250
to some of the question stuff even if

631
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:18,450
you guys are gonna have some of this

632
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,550
question stuff I didn't really even know

633
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:21,720
where this is gonna go I actually wasn't

634
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:23,879
sure it was gonna have more than like

635
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,140
two people left in the room me being one

636
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,390
of them the sound guy probably being the

637
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:29,220
other right so real-life application

638
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:30,690
types of stuff so I would say this all

639
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,670
asserts all that stuff that you're

640
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:34,980
chasing in the world isn't gonna do you

641
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:37,140
jack until you can't confront this stuff

642
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:41,610
and deal with this stuff I'm telling you

643
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:43,440
first-hand experience I'm 37 38 I'm 38

644
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:45,240
years old and I have gone through so

645
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,810
much heartache and pain and crash and

646
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,580
burn because it took me what at least a

647
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:52,110
decade to figure some of this stuff out

648
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:54,780
and actually kind of come to terms with

649
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:56,699
some of the stuff I'm not saying I got

650
00:23:54,780 --> 00:24:01,020
all the answers but it's a great start

651
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:03,150
for what's going on with me typically if

652
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:11,310
you haven't figured this out the harder

653
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:13,050
choice is the better choice but the only

654
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:14,310
ones gonna make that choice and confront

655
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:17,399
it nobody else is gonna be able to do

656
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:19,350
that for you I say kind of again kind of

657
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,270
do like a spirit check what's going on

658
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:23,669
inside you are you lying to yourself

659
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:25,500
no dude everything's cool it's all good

660
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:27,540
you try to convince yourself emotionally

661
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,820
give yourself that high like yeah I'm

662
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:31,790
solid are you really are you just trying

663
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:34,050
to make yourself feel better

664
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:35,340
once you come to terms with yourself it

665
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:38,580
might be hard but you're gonna feel a

666
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:40,490
lot better about yourself I say the

667
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:44,189
truth is how I got through this stuff in

668
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:46,890
bear with me I said was God he got me

669
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:48,210
through this stuff and I'm not telling

670
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:50,640
you what to believe and all I kind of

671
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:52,230
stop what I'm telling you is realizing

672
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:57,930
that there was more to myself really

673
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:59,850
helped a lot so what that's that's just

674
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:10,710
all I have for you so are there any

675
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:12,030
questions out there up here when I get

676
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:15,960
some more experience am I really gonna

677
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:18,570
give the same talk I don't know I'll let

678
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,670
you know in 10 years I find that there

679
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:22,439
really is no destination until you hit

680
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:23,520
that grade point right we're all

681
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,100
learning we're all growing with all

682
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,420
different places but you know I think

683
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,500
the best thing we can do is really help

684
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,960
each other and share with each other

685
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,370
where we're at what we've gone through

686
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,020
so that you know the next generation

687
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:41,429
doesn't have to deal with that stuff you

688
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:43,740
know do I think the next generation will

689
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:45,540
listen I don't know best I can do is

690
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:47,760
hope you know even if what I'm saying

691
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:50,730
just rejected the fact that they've

692
00:25:47,760 --> 00:26:01,850
still heard it I feel like I've done

693
00:25:50,730 --> 00:26:03,960
what I could so yeah yes hmm

694
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:05,780
well the interesting thing is I'm not

695
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,670
sure how much of this stuff I learned

696
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:10,410
through the failures it was looking back

697
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:13,500
that I realized that these failures were

698
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:14,880
caused by these things so it wasn't the

699
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,720
failures itself because I understand

700
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,700
what you're saying it's this whole

701
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,620
concept of like oh let's go forward

702
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,710
crash and burn and then I'll learn from

703
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,879
that lesson but to realize the reason

704
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:29,300
why I'm sharing this thing is I didn't

705
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:29,300
learn the lesson so

706
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:38,259
all right why thank you for your time

707
00:26:35,859 --> 00:26:39,230
and I wish the very best for you all and

708
00:26:38,259 --> 00:26:39,900
have a great day

709
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,979
