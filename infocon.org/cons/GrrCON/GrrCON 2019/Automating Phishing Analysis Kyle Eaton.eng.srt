2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:14,009
all right I guess it's time let's begin

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,750
so first thanks for joining I know it's

4
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:20,850
right before lunch but it's nice to be

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:22,980
back in Grand Rapids burger I'm so first

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,410
up a little bit about me right now I'm a

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,740
lead security engineer at Target I work

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,300
on the Intel and detection team so one

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,549
of our big responsibilities as we track

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,550
threat actors and try to build detection

11
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:37,739
around those threat actors before that I

12
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,489
was on the incident response team in a

13
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:43,110
couple of roles and I had Incident

14
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:46,620
Response and web app and testing

15
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:48,120
experience in the area at a community

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,730
college and a health care system that

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,149
you probably can guess but yeah it's

18
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:56,250
it's a it's really nice to be back in

19
00:00:53,149 --> 00:01:01,230
Michigan to talk about phishing and

20
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:03,780
building detection so like I said we're

21
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,860
gonna be talking about fishing so we're

22
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,439
gonna be talking about the pages

23
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:10,409
analysis how you can build detection and

24
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,189
how we can automate this phishing as you

25
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,840
all know is still a really big issue

26
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:18,658
attacks big and small often stem from an

27
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,530
email nexus so we're gonna be looking at

28
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,229
that

29
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,740
while malware is really fun this talk is

30
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:27,179
mostly focused on credential fishing

31
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:29,520
which right it's still important but

32
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,810
maybe not quite as flashy but hopefully

33
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,439
we can find some stuff to make it a

34
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,909
little bit more flashy and again right

35
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:38,750
the whole whole point of this is to try

36
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:42,420
to make it easier for an ALICE analysis

37
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:46,670
speed up your time that you have someone

38
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:48,720
actually looking at the phishing page

39
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:51,630
and hopefully we can also create some

40
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,649
detection we have some ways that we can

41
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:57,060
hopefully do that automatically

42
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:59,790
so first up great we're just gonna talk

43
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,710
about the actual and houses of the page

44
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,210
there's a few things that I like to look

45
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,880
for when I'm looking at a phishing page

46
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:08,258
first up rate you kind of get just like

47
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,669
a gut feeling of the page right like

48
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:10,988
you've seen enough phishing pages you

49
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:13,899
know kind of what to look for what

50
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:16,150
you're expecting to see but on the

51
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:19,629
inside of the page I really like to look

52
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:22,330
at forms and inputs so the form will

53
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:24,359
tell you where the data goes and input

54
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:28,269
tags will tell you what that data is

55
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,590
that they're sending it's not super

56
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:33,510
common but I also like to look for

57
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:35,860
external domains these can provide

58
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:38,980
regulars additional disk insight into

59
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:42,760
like infrastructure used or have

60
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:45,429
anything around there like I said right

61
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,769
like phishing is a big issue so it's

62
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:51,129
something we want to track but due to

63
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:52,379
the amount of phishing this can create a

64
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,819
bit of a problem

65
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:58,090
however if anyone saw my talk last year

66
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:59,108
I showed some of the analysis benefits

67
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:02,140
you can get from looking at phishing

68
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:05,920
pages so we're gonna be talking a little

69
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:07,988
bit about that but more around how your

70
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,988
analysts can use it and how you can

71
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:12,609
build detection for it and again right

72
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:14,799
look the problem with with doing all of

73
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:18,459
this stuff manually is right like it's a

74
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:22,450
manual process it's slow and depending

75
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:25,090
on the amount of fishing reports you get

76
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:28,000
this can be a huge time sink so you

77
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,650
could have your folks like maybe maybe

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,760
this is not your full-time job maybe

79
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,049
this is just something you can just

80
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,959
dedicate like twenty percent of your day

81
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:40,389
to so like this stuff can build up

82
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:42,489
pretty quick additionally the pages they

83
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:44,169
like could just go down right so while

84
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:45,970
you're looking at it you go to look at

85
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:47,680
it in the next day pages down and now

86
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:55,090
you don't know what was what was on the

87
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:57,220
site so so my solution to this whole

88
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:02,500
thing is right like let's let's try to

89
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:04,780
automate it so my my process was let's

90
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,269
grab the page and look at the form data

91
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,440
because that's where at least to me

92
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:11,379
that's where the meat and potatoes of a

93
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:15,340
fishing page is so we're gonna look at

94
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:21,099
this data we're gonna grab the page find

95
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:22,960
the form and see what's being sent at

96
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,699
least for my thought process I was like

97
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,739
well let's let's take a look at it in

98
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:29,080
Python that's the language I'm most

99
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:33,009
familiar with and there's a few things

100
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:35,039
we were gonna want to consider right so

101
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:38,710
first off we're gonna need to be doing

102
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:40,930
HTTP requests I'm most familiar with

103
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:43,180
using the request library however

104
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,639
there's some issues of that the first

105
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,830
being that it makes following redirects

106
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:50,560
kind of a pain and it won't render the

107
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,969
JavaScript and we're also parsing the

108
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,639
page so we're gonna want to look at a

109
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:58,419
beautiful soup for example this will let

110
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:01,780
you take apart the HTML and really dig

111
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:04,750
into how the structure of the page is

112
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,979
laid out and like I said requests isn't

113
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,889
gonna actually work for us in this case

114
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:11,800
and so I was looking at selenium that's

115
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:16,389
a headless browser that you can interact

116
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:18,910
with in Python or Java if you wanted but

117
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:21,100
it has a lot of benefits over but we're

118
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:22,509
using requests in this way so it'll

119
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,460
follow redirects and you can grab

120
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:25,990
screenshots the screenshots make it

121
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,090
really useful for when you want your

122
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,330
analysts to like look at the page and be

123
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:33,849
able to like rely on their gut instinct

124
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:36,250
and we kind of had this last year I

125
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:38,500
mentioned right like you can double you

126
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:41,319
get a PHP file and expect to get the

127
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:44,620
actual PHP source code because it'll be

128
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:45,940
rendered on the client side sorry I know

129
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,520
it'll be rendered on the server side and

130
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,020
you only get the HTML output that's true

131
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,580
for selenium as well so like you can't

132
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:55,180
just start making these requests to try

133
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:58,448
to get the the real like a beefy content

134
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,400
to the page but we can get the HTML that

135
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:06,400
the browser sees and that the user sees

136
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:07,630
which is useful for this so next up

137
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,719
we're going to want to start creating

138
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:14,199
detection around this if you're doing

139
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,539
this manually as I was like this is

140
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:20,380
gonna most likely be their snort or

141
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:24,400
sericata signatures and you're gonna

142
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:26,020
want to look at the the post body this

143
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,280
is where where your real benefits are

144
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,460
going to

145
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,969
from I went with Cercado for a couple

146
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,770
reasons

147
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:35,910
right like the syntax between sericata

148
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:39,020
and snort are very similar and that

149
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:42,540
allows for kind of more cross-platform

150
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,680
between the rules and sericata or snort

151
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,650
is supported on a lot of different

152
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,510
products which is nice and it also lets

153
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:52,770
us get a little deeper than some other

154
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:56,340
detection types might so we can get a

155
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:58,950
little bit more into the post body to

156
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:01,229
actually dig into what is going on in

157
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,520
the packet and then this just kind of

158
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,880
shows what we're what we're gonna be

159
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:08,010
looking at these highlighted bits are

160
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,560
from a real phishing page and these were

161
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:13,620
just like sample card numbers and

162
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:17,510
passwords and then just the information

163
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:19,560
we would want to potentially alert on

164
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,900
and again right like there's there's

165
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:26,070
some issues if you're trying to do this

166
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:28,500
all manually first off sericata and

167
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:31,979
snort both have signature id's that if

168
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:34,950
you put in either too large of a number

169
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:38,370
or the numbers we use the rules won't

170
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:39,990
load properly so this is a good way to

171
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,280
kind of automate that process we'll go

172
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:45,710
through the pages and we'll make sure

173
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,710
every rule has a unique signature ID

174
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,419
another downside to all the manual stuff

175
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,609
that hopefully we can try to resolve is

176
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:56,159
you're not having to capture a P cap for

177
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:58,680
each page and then dig into the post

178
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,450
body or open up the network tab in

179
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,600
Chrome or whatever and I try to actually

180
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:05,010
view the post body of this we can if we

181
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,640
can automate it and that's gonna be a

182
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:11,250
win for creating detection and then I

183
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:14,909
wanted to quickly just jump into rule

184
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:16,580
syntax real quick so Cercado rule is

185
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:19,800
kind of broken up into three main parts

186
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:21,870
there's the action that happens so in

187
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,770
this case that's an alert it could also

188
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:27,660
be drop is also pretty common then we

189
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:31,549
have the headers that show the protocol

190
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:34,830
that we're looking at the eyepiece

191
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:37,049
variables or subnets that we're going to

192
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:39,460
and from along with the port's that

193
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:41,439
we're going to and from and then

194
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:44,170
into the options this is basically just

195
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,870
like the rule logic it'll have a message

196
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:49,780
that appears in the alert feed as well

197
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:51,960
as the signature ID that we already

198
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:55,360
talked about and then we get into the

199
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:57,450
actual logic of the rule so this is just

200
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,480
a simple one we're looking at post data

201
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:09,160
for a method and then the actual post

202
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:10,540
data just includes password equals so

203
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,839
again right like we're gonna want to

204
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:19,870
automate this this is just a way that we

205
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:23,920
can get into creating rules faster so

206
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:26,080
we're gonna read the HTTP body dig into

207
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:32,170
the HTML fine form data find input data

208
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:35,320
and make sure that we are finding the

209
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:37,469
right fields to create the rules from so

210
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,510
the the tool that I was working on I

211
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:42,220
like to name everything after animals so

212
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:46,720
like last year we were talking about

213
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:49,570
worka this year talking about muskrat so

214
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:53,080
it will go through grab the form data

215
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:56,070
grab input data and fill those into the

216
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:59,590
rule syntax using just like a template

217
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:01,960
to create these rules there are a few

218
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:05,190
types that we try to ignore and we can

219
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:09,850
get into that towards the top we ignore

220
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:12,540
buttons checkboxes and no script tags

221
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:15,400
all these things can sometimes appear in

222
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:18,280
either forms or inputs that I've seen

223
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:20,470
and they kind of just they're not always

224
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,160
sent so sometimes they'll be toggled on

225
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,690
when they shouldn't be

226
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:27,430
and it was just causing false positives

227
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:30,370
and worse in some cases was causing

228
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:32,739
false negatives so we just ignore some

229
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:35,710
of this stuff at risk of creating more

230
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,630
alerts than we should from what I've

231
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:45,700
seen so far that doesn't happen too

232
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:46,689
often and so yeah we kind of just I can

233
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,800
just kind of go through this a little

234
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:52,270
bit so the Python code here this is the

235
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,760
the portion that's actually generating

236
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,800
the

237
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:59,090
so at this point in the code we've

238
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:01,550
already extracted out the HTTP the HTML

239
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:02,690
from beautifulsoup we're looking at and

240
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,459
then we start going through looking for

241
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:07,580
form data and looking for the inputs

242
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:10,190
from there we save out any actions that

243
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:12,860
the action field in the form data that's

244
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:16,250
where the content is going to write so

245
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:20,600
that I'll be like post to log dot PHP we

246
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:23,600
can toggle this field on and off in in

247
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:27,020
muskrat just to help narrow in on on the

248
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,090
traffic we're looking at and then it

249
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:37,900
just kind of it just goes through adds

250
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:40,730
it to a rule and it just prints it so

251
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:43,660
right there are some issues that can

252
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:46,010
kind of come up with automatic detection

253
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:48,589
and I've already started to touch on one

254
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:50,780
and it's the the false positive true

255
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:53,510
positive false negative true negative

256
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:58,550
ratio right like if you're too focused

257
00:11:53,510 --> 00:12:00,020
in on one particular page you might get

258
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:02,270
to a scenario where you're only matching

259
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:04,130
that one page even though the same fish

260
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:06,290
kit might be deployed on another site

261
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:09,050
you should be able to match on that

262
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:11,870
content as well so if the rule is too

263
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:14,390
narrow you won't get those hits and this

264
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:15,920
is just a way that we can write there's

265
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:19,010
something we have to keep in mind when

266
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,199
it comes to these automatic rules so we

267
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:24,770
have to look at ways that we can make

268
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:27,740
this stuff either a little broader but

269
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:34,250
not without falling into the like the

270
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:37,790
pitfall of of hitting benign traffic and

271
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:40,310
again I kind of mentioned it last you

272
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:43,849
ready to talk on fish kits these are the

273
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:45,349
like HTTP source code for the page and

274
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:48,140
one of the things that I noticed last

275
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:50,060
year was that a lot of these pages

276
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,260
they'll be essentially redeployed over

277
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,219
and over with a different directory

278
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:57,170
structure which will make it so that the

279
00:12:54,220 --> 00:13:00,560
action field so the actual URI that the

280
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:03,110
data gets posted to changes which isn't

281
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,199
something that we really want in this

282
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,970
case because

283
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,190
the content of the page is the same but

284
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,649
the name of the director or like the

285
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:13,010
folder structure has changed so the

286
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:15,899
rules won't fire when they should so

287
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:20,910
it's just something we have to kind of

288
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:23,100
pay attention to or be aware of and one

289
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:25,380
of the things that similarly that we

290
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:29,070
noticed that's not often changed is the

291
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:33,449
actual file name of of where stuff gets

292
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:35,339
posted to does not often change so if

293
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:37,189
the directory structure changes but the

294
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:39,149
log that PHP stays the same each time

295
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:43,170
there might be something that we can do

296
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:44,339
there as well so that's that's something

297
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:46,709
I'm working on now and trying to just

298
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:54,329
like strip out the directory structure

299
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:56,099
from from the rural logic so right like

300
00:13:54,329 --> 00:14:00,239
at this point we've seen like automate

301
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:02,670
the the detection so we'll just kind of

302
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,070
like wrap it all together and this is

303
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:07,319
where I think maybe people will be able

304
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:10,440
to get the most benefit from it so you

305
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:13,230
have to provide a either a URL or a feed

306
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:16,829
of URLs to the tool so the feeds that I

307
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:19,230
like to use our URL scan now if anyone's

308
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:23,609
not familiar with URL scan check it out

309
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:26,220
it is a massive resource for anyone

310
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:29,160
who's looking at fishing they index

311
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:31,680
stuff from fish tank and open fish as

312
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:35,819
well as user submitted stuff manually or

313
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:38,430
through api's so you get a lot of good

314
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:41,610
fishing stuff there so that's that's the

315
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:45,029
feed I've been using it just allows for

316
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:50,040
us to get a pretty good ratio of actual

317
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:52,350
fishes to non fishing pages another

318
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,839
thing you could do is if you are running

319
00:14:52,350 --> 00:15:00,000
like bro or Zeke you can pull out your

320
00:14:54,839 --> 00:15:02,069
SMTP URLs and just kind of feed those

321
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,069
into it and this is where I think the

322
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:08,459
biggest benefit for a lot of folks could

323
00:15:05,069 --> 00:15:10,410
be is in finding the stuff that's

324
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:13,050
actually hitting your environment or the

325
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:15,449
stuff that is being reported to you so

326
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:17,250
if you have a like a phishing inbox

327
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:19,050
right like check this

328
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,980
for any links and submit those through

329
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:27,060
this tool it'll spit out an image with

330
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:28,560
the screenshot and a potential rule and

331
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,518
again right like so it'll just go

332
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:36,779
through grab the page grab a screenshot

333
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:39,540
generate a rule and test that right now

334
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:43,560
we're still testing manually through

335
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:46,920
just pcaps on the wire but this is where

336
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:49,219
the I think the real benefit for people

337
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:55,979
who don't have a large fishing program

338
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:57,660
where what they could get from this so

339
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,670
one of the other things I wanted to add

340
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,500
right like I've already mentioned the

341
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:04,079
the talk I gave last year was using

342
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,300
orchid to crawl phishing pages to try to

343
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,500
download the source code the source code

344
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,899
is actually really cool because a lot of

345
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:14,220
times it'll include adversary email

346
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:17,699
addresses or like web panels with really

347
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:20,430
cool passwords hard-coded into them so

348
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:24,269
one of the things you can do is these

349
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:27,269
tools they use the same sources and blog

350
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:31,470
feeds so they they kind of just like go

351
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:34,050
hand in hand and just a quick like one

352
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:36,149
minute of the talk last year essentially

353
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:38,878
what the tool does is you send it a URL

354
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:41,160
it breaks it down into the directory

355
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:43,350
structure tries every directory

356
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,209
structure that it finds looking for open

357
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:46,769
directories if it finds open directories

358
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:48,660
it'll look for any zip files in there

359
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:50,550
and then download them if it doesn't

360
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,740
find an open directory it'll still try

361
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:55,099
the directory name as a zip file because

362
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:57,809
we've had a lot of success with

363
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,939
attackers if directory indexing is

364
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:01,559
turned off the file still could be there

365
00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:05,369
named after the directory that it

366
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:11,780
expands out to so this is just one way

367
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:18,389
we can use this to grab attacker

368
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:20,609
potentially tools or write content when

369
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:22,230
when the attacker gets their own email

370
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:25,619
address submitted to them in the forum

371
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:29,309
they kind of can't move them a little

372
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:30,669
bit we had one that we were playing

373
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:32,200
around with where the

374
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,880
the page went down within like ten

375
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:40,240
minutes of us submitting his username

376
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:42,610
back to him which was pretty fun and

377
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:46,000
again there are a few considerations for

378
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:49,780
this whole thing so all of the rules are

379
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,310
generated from attacker data essentially

380
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:54,790
right like it's the phishing page we

381
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:56,710
don't control what that is so not that

382
00:17:54,790 --> 00:18:00,070
we have to worry about like malicious

383
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,940
content coming back to us as far as I

384
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:04,300
know there could be an issue with

385
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:06,400
beautifulsoup and python as far as I

386
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,260
know we don't have to worry about that

387
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,650
however the stuff is still attacker

388
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:13,660
controlled so the input fields could

389
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:15,520
very easily be named after something

390
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:18,490
incredibly benign they could use the

391
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:21,190
same input fields that Gmail uses and if

392
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:22,780
the rule is too broad you might now

393
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:27,010
start alerting on people logging into

394
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:30,550
Gmail which is not what you want and

395
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:33,010
again right we still have to rely on in

396
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:34,360
analysts got feelings like at the end of

397
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:37,570
the day they're like they're the people

398
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:39,820
who are involved most in in looking at

399
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:41,320
the phishing that goes on in your

400
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:46,480
environment they're gonna have the best

401
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:48,429
sense of what is normal so if they look

402
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,410
at something they're like not concerned

403
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:55,420
maybe we don't write a rule or maybe we

404
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:57,550
don't use the the rule for that one I'm

405
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,780
also there's there's like I mentioned

406
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:02,470
there's still some things that I want to

407
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:06,879
work on with this mainly more testing

408
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:09,610
right now it's sitting in a VPS that I

409
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,820
run just kind of periodically running

410
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:16,929
and creating new rules but the the thing

411
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:19,300
I'm trying to really get with it is more

412
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:23,290
rules from or more phishing pages from a

413
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:25,480
larger source so URL scans great but

414
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:28,030
that's only what people submit to it so

415
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:31,000
if I can get additional stuff then we

416
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:33,879
can create more rules and just more test

417
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,610
scenarios the more phishing sex we get

418
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,620
the more rules we can create all this

419
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:41,889
stuff helps to just create like a better

420
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:43,299
version of the tool and that's that's

421
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,129
really where I'm at

422
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:47,529
like I mentioned there's some stuff I

423
00:19:45,129 --> 00:19:49,359
want to do with the pruning the URI down

424
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:55,539
so that we're only alerting on

425
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:57,369
components of the URI and if anyone is

426
00:19:55,539 --> 00:20:00,099
at all interested in any of this or if

427
00:19:57,369 --> 00:20:01,418
you have like a nice sericata deployment

428
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:04,149
and you want to start running some test

429
00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:07,799
rules reach out I would very be very

430
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:11,258
happy to send over the test rules I have

431
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:12,969
and that is all I have so if anyone has

432
00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:14,320
any questions I would be happy to answer

433
00:20:12,969 --> 00:20:16,469
them

434
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:20,309
if not you can reach out to me on

435
00:20:16,469 --> 00:20:20,309
Twitter or I'll be around

436
