1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,460
yeah afternoon everybody is everybody

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:07,740
awake again ish I'm starting to see

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,769
people yawning now the beers kick yes

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:14,099
sir the beverage the adult beverages are

5
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:16,049
flowing well so this afternoon

6
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,789
John fatin is here he's going to talk a

7
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,800
little bit about crypto mining and its

8
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,199
explosion but I had to tell him really

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,500
quick that I have an interesting

10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:29,070
anecdote I currently have 1.7 Bitcoin

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,230
stored on a hard drive I have absolutely

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,020
no idea what the password is to unlock

13
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,030
this wallet and I want that new Google

14
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,070
supremacy thinkmaybe to help me out you

15
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,530
think that work possibly okay well

16
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,510
because I know it's like worth $14,000

17
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,430
right now I think someplace like that so

18
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,320
put your drive up for auction

19
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:51,539
oh so you guys should do that give

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,129
somebody like ten percent thanks

21
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,460
everybody

22
00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:57,570
happy Friday afternoon a couple things I

23
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,539
wanted to do today just kind of walk

24
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,520
about talk about crypto mining itself

25
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:04,920
and in a couple other things but a quick

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,420
agenda here just got a few slides I want

27
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,400
to talk about the actual landscape and

28
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,290
you know it just continues to evolve

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,270
especially with cryptocurrency

30
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:17,009
out there and some of the things we're

31
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:18,270
seeing from I'd sees potentially

32
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,979
unnerving things we're seeing from

33
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,949
companies like Facebook getting into it

34
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,450
with Libra but I really want to focus on

35
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,640
crypto jacking which is the malicious

36
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,860
crypto mining that might be affecting

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,310
your organization's today kind of the

38
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:36,960
easy way for those those crypto mining

39
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:39,689
attacks or infections if you want how

40
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,039
they can happen via phishing and I'll

41
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,779
show you a couple examples of that and

42
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,899
then what you can do to to protect

43
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,240
yourself so I'll run through a quick

44
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:49,920
kind of these things fairly quickly here

45
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,929
I got a demonstration at the end I'll

46
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,899
just walk through a quick example with

47
00:01:51,930 --> 00:02:01,079
you so I definitely want to talk about

48
00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:04,560
cryptocurrency and I'm from the umbrella

49
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,630
side of the house at Cisco and so what's

50
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,878
kind of cool about that is we we gather

51
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,489
a lot of statistics in terms of what

52
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,349
sites anybody in the world is going to

53
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,930
because we see about three to four

54
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:15,849
percent of

55
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,530
world's Internet traffic and so some of

56
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:20,709
these statistics came from our market

57
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:23,739
research in this case so we've seen just

58
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:26,560
ridiculous amounts of changes not only

59
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:29,260
in traffic but also in actual

60
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,599
cryptocurrency itself so what's driving

61
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:35,048
the market really is all the volatility

62
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:39,399
inside the the crypto currency exchanges

63
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:41,049
etc so early days people thought crypto

64
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,930
was just a way for malicious actors to

65
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:46,389
buy drugs guns and illegal goods but

66
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:49,689
more recently it's really it's become a

67
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:51,329
way for malicious actors to easily get

68
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:54,668
ransomware payments and remain anonymous

69
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:57,280
but quite frankly they've moved away

70
00:02:54,669 --> 00:02:59,290
from ransomware more so and gone right

71
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,840
right to cryptocurrency again because of

72
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:05,138
the the lucrative nature of the

73
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,109
cryptocurrency so on the dns traffic

74
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:11,260
side what we see is about a 250 X

75
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:15,519
increase in just a year and a half or so

76
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:18,069
so in March 2018 the Umbrella research

77
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:21,549
team was looking at about 600 K DNS

78
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:25,078
requests per day globally and now we're

79
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:29,439
seeing you know again 250 times that

80
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:31,959
over 102 million queries a day and so

81
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:34,180
it's a it's an enormous upswing we're

82
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:36,040
seeing it really across the world now

83
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:42,419
break down these numbers here in just a

84
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:45,459
little bit so and just by just by other

85
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:47,169
facts I'll throw out at ya is that we're

86
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:49,989
currently looking at around 200 billion

87
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:53,680
DNS requests we hit that number earlier

88
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:55,930
this week so it's a huge chunk of

89
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,220
information a giant data set that we're

90
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,400
looking at which gives us really a

91
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,530
pretty unique view into what's happening

92
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,470
what's occurring out there not just with

93
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:08,859
crypto mining but across other malicious

94
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:12,689
or even categories that you types of

95
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:12,689
volumes and patterns that we're seeing

96
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:20,019
so I want to talk a little bit about

97
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:21,339
cryptocurrency regulation out there and

98
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:24,159
there actually is some believe it or not

99
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:26,380
so but the fact is it's really not

100
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:26,980
consistent anywhere if you look at Japan

101
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,409
for exam

102
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,060
they're really at the forefront of

103
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:33,370
regulating crypto assets in their

104
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,230
organisations but again they have no no

105
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:39,130
authority or really no way to enforce

106
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:41,740
that elsewhere and so most countries

107
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:44,469
have very weak and anti money laundering

108
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,530
laws or really no enforcement out there

109
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:50,080
as a result it's kind of the Wild West

110
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:53,710
and so you know due to the fact that

111
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:58,840
there really is no FDIC or other types

112
00:04:53,710 --> 00:05:02,169
of international management or oversight

113
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:05,440
of this there's really little recourse

114
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:06,550
for lost assets for example so and so

115
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,060
where there's money there's criminals

116
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:11,470
right so organizations or bad actors

117
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,940
have kind of shifted towards this for

118
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,250
really a lot of reasons so they can

119
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:20,370
steal crypto funds or essentially steal

120
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:23,070
your assets to generate crypto funds

121
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:26,560
other information that we looked at was

122
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:31,990
sort of telling across North America

123
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:36,120
where the volume of crypto mining occurs

124
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:39,220
or traffic to crypto mining sites and

125
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:43,120
you've the US here with 62% is obviously

126
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:47,200
the world's leader so our corporate

127
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,490
users really the information behind this

128
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,920
reveals that the majority of crypto

129
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:54,580
mining obviously is from here but it's

130
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:56,920
followed by amia which has around 6% and

131
00:05:54,580 --> 00:06:00,960
then really the rest of the the world is

132
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,960
sort of equally distributed behind that

133
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:14,460
I think you might touch based on this

134
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:16,479
one already we saw that already this is

135
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,870
just specifically talking about

136
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:22,360
malicious crypto mining so if we look at

137
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:24,340
crypto mining by itself you know that's

138
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,310
great we can look at all that that

139
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:29,260
specific traffic and come up with some

140
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:31,030
statistics around this but we have a

141
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:34,420
security category specifically for

142
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:35,469
malicious crypto mining that we track we

143
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,800
look at the bad actors the

144
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:40,569
infrastructure of those actors and you

145
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,889
know through the same course of time

146
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:49,319
saw a huge increase again in in the

147
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:49,319
malicious activity around crypto mining

148
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:55,029
and so we look at North America

149
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:58,149
obviously it's 62% but then we looked a

150
00:06:55,029 --> 00:07:01,959
little bit deeper in terms of industry

151
00:06:58,149 --> 00:07:04,389
how that essentially slices out for

152
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:07,389
whatever reason its energy and utilities

153
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:09,580
are showing us really the the lion's

154
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:11,409
share of that volume followed by the

155
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:15,419
other industries but really all

156
00:07:11,409 --> 00:07:19,509
industries are somewhat affected and so

157
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:22,599
again you know we see all of that

158
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:26,649
particular information in this case if

159
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:27,729
we look at crypto mining by by size it

160
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:30,399
doesn't really matter what size

161
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:32,258
organization you're in on unwanted

162
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:35,139
crypto mining is really

163
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:37,389
non-discriminatory so in here our

164
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:40,149
research shows that malicious crypto

165
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:43,839
mining is highly prevalent across the

166
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:45,309
board pretty interesting to see that you

167
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:47,199
know medium-sized businesses obviously

168
00:07:45,309 --> 00:07:48,189
and I think a lot of that probably has

169
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,459
to deal with the fact that they don't

170
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:53,439
have as much in terms of resources as

171
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:57,419
larger enterprises and so that's

172
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:57,419
essentially how those numbers are skewed

173
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:08,019
so with the market volatility

174
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:10,419
essentially of crypto mining makes this

175
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:13,449
obviously much more financially

176
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:14,889
lucrative as I mentioned before in fact

177
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:16,509
more lucrative than ransomware and

178
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:20,139
that's essentially why the shift has

179
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:23,349
taken place so bad actors are they're

180
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:25,869
still peddling ransomware for sure but

181
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:28,628
this is an easier way to get at funds or

182
00:08:25,869 --> 00:08:32,439
use resources again to generate their

183
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:35,079
own funds also just a simple simple way

184
00:08:32,438 --> 00:08:36,669
the way crypto currencies and crypto

185
00:08:35,078 --> 00:08:39,188
mining is set up it's a simple way for

186
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:44,198
any bad actor to essentially generate

187
00:08:39,188 --> 00:08:47,170
cash attack individuals with exploit

188
00:08:44,198 --> 00:08:50,050
kits or other types of means like

189
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:53,790
JavaScript and really remain anonymous

190
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,790
through the whole process of it

191
00:08:55,590 --> 00:09:02,710
so quick quick terms I want to talk a

192
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,800
little bit about cryptocurrency here and

193
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:08,620
crypto mining so a little bit of crypto

194
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,670
crypto mining 101 here so we talked

195
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,260
about crypto mining is really the

196
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:13,689
process of earning or creating coins in

197
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:17,560
a digital currency right miners use

198
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:19,780
their own computing power and to verify

199
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:24,160
third party Bitcoin transactions or to

200
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:27,400
do computations for the entire

201
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,959
blockchain component and if if they're

202
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:32,400
able to compute the hash obviously

203
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,540
they're awarded any type or the as

204
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,790
others have and if they've done any

205
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:39,219
crypto mining you're awarded essentially

206
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:41,439
a proportional amount of cryptocurrency

207
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:45,310
based on what you've put into it from a

208
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:48,340
computation standpoint and when we talk

209
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:50,530
about malicious crypto mining the it's

210
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:54,520
really the miners secretly using your

211
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:56,140
assets to compute this provide the

212
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,300
calculations essentially to Mayan

213
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:00,330
cryptocurrencies through whatever

214
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,949
machines they can get a hold of or

215
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:05,110
there's a variety of means to do so as I

216
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:08,260
mentioned we see it in you know

217
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:11,950
JavaScript exploits easy to drop in from

218
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:15,370
a web attack perspective but then also

219
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:19,120
you know we see cloud AWS instance is

220
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:21,580
also being impacted so crypto mining is

221
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,320
really proven as a been proven as a

222
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,600
lucrative method for malicious actors to

223
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,760
make money and as a result they have

224
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,810
easily figured out ways to implant

225
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:35,050
crypto mining on a variety of your

226
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:36,520
computing assets so this is probably not

227
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,740
a surprise to anybody in here but the

228
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:41,050
the impact of crypto mining obviously

229
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:43,930
you know you can look at degraded

230
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:46,060
performance if you have processes

231
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:49,180
running while your employees are working

232
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:51,880
on those assets but certainly it does

233
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:54,339
have an impact on those machines in the

234
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:57,010
in varying amounts obviously they want

235
00:10:54,340 --> 00:11:00,010
to stay hidden as well so maybe you know

236
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:03,430
again the smart ones essentially will

237
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:04,569
regulate that themselves in terms of

238
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,939
regulations though with security

239
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,900
regulations crypto mining by employees

240
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,180
could be

241
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,010
even if you didn't know it in your

242
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,510
organization so there could be you know

243
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:15,040
obviously some sanctions relative to

244
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:16,960
that if you have crypto mining happening

245
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,949
in your your organization especially the

246
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:25,440
financial services industry system

247
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:27,610
attacks also vulnerabilities that

248
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,529
exploit your machines for crypto mining

249
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:32,400
are obviously the an open door to

250
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:35,260
deliver our other payloads as well so

251
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:37,600
something to be aware of right and then

252
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:40,960
we also see that it does impact your

253
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:45,250
bottom line not only in resources and

254
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:52,000
cost there but you know your AWS bill

255
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:53,410
essentially is impacted as well so we'll

256
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,800
talk about crypto jacking here for a

257
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:59,040
little bit and essentially you know

258
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,529
large let me just jump back for a second

259
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,060
crypto jak crypto jacking obviously as

260
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:05,290
we were talking about our malicious

261
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:09,189
crypto mining is essentially the the

262
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:12,579
secret use of of your business computing

263
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:15,880
power right to mine these currencies and

264
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:19,860
we've seen in the news lately cyber

265
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,860
victims are targeted really a variety

266
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:30,910
face but but essentially you know all

267
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:33,430
these form factors are at risk and we

268
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:34,810
see a lot of victims fall a lot of

269
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:37,959
people fall victim to this because of

270
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:39,640
just simple malicious injections in

271
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:41,380
JavaScript and I'll show you a quick

272
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,470
example of that in just a moment here so

273
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:48,400
if it's if it's coded properly there's

274
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:51,760
really no noticeable effect on a victim

275
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,980
system as I mentioned but it's really

276
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,200
super easy to fall victim to especially

277
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:59,140
if we see it from a from a phishing

278
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:01,600
perspective this is an example of a

279
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:05,110
JavaScript and there's it's super easy

280
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:08,920
to essentially infect a website if you

281
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:12,400
wanted to which makes it just super easy

282
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:14,949
to exploit and distribute this but

283
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:19,000
essentially in this case here this is a

284
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:21,520
script that will impact any any visitor

285
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,760
to a specific web site here if it's if

286
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,910
it's

287
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:29,830
running in here it will operate coin

288
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:32,170
hive in this case so generate processing

289
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:34,120
for for crypto mining here in this case

290
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:36,729
it also has some conditions right so

291
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,460
only if the user is not on a mobile

292
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:41,920
device for example so you've got more

293
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:48,070
system resources there may be something

294
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:48,699
that's harder to detect and so why

295
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:51,130
should you care

296
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:54,760
essentially if we look at the web-based

297
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:57,550
miners that that essentially go away or

298
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:01,000
or cease after you leave that particular

299
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:04,150
webpage perhaps not a big big risk and

300
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,010
not a not a huge concern but it's the

301
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:07,449
ones that are more persistent that that

302
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:12,090
we want to talk about and block and find

303
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:12,090
fine capabilities to uh to prevent

304
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:17,040
alright I want to talk about crypto

305
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:19,860
fishing and the other attack vector here

306
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:25,089
that's pretty easy to fall victim to and

307
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:27,790
I've got a quick couple of slides here

308
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:31,300
at a time to talk about distribution of

309
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:36,160
this through through Google Ads

310
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:38,530
in fact so here's a quick example if you

311
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,900
take a look at the top this one's

312
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:43,449
looking at Manero so a website that

313
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,829
takes you to my Manero comm you can take

314
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:47,170
a look at the link in here this is just

315
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:50,020
a Google ad that's in here the top one

316
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:51,969
looks very much like the second ad down

317
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:55,870
below it but the second one takes us to

318
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:58,060
a slightly different website if you can

319
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:00,520
see the the link in there I'll explain a

320
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:02,709
little bit more and if we look at the

321
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,930
websites themselves the first one looks

322
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:07,780
like this see at the very top my monaro

323
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:12,310
com and then if we go to the second one

324
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:15,430
here again with the the astral video

325
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:20,709
you'll see in fact almost this exact

326
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:24,160
same content right so when you set up

327
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:27,630
your Google ads in this case put your

328
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,630
description in here put your link in

329
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:35,099
on the right hand side put whatever

330
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:38,159
description you wish but when you have

331
00:15:35,099 --> 00:15:39,779
your your ad redirect at the very bottom

332
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:43,409
left you can have it to go go to

333
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:45,029
whatever website you wish right so you

334
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:54,839
think you're going to blockchain dot

335
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:59,249
info essentially you're not and so this

336
00:15:54,839 --> 00:16:01,259
is sort of an interesting we see this

337
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:03,359
quite a bit really across the board not

338
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:05,369
just in crypto mining but the use of

339
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:08,489
puny code you take a look at that

340
00:16:05,369 --> 00:16:12,869
website up above or the domain itself

341
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:15,419
domain itself looks and displays like

342
00:16:12,869 --> 00:16:17,189
blockchain dot info if you're looking at

343
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:19,949
this on a cell phone you don't have a

344
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:22,649
lot of real estate there's a good chance

345
00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:26,248
you might click on a web link that's in

346
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:28,289
any type of a phishing type of attack

347
00:16:26,249 --> 00:16:30,829
and you'll you'll not notice that that's

348
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:33,209
got essentially a

349
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:36,358
acrylic character right above the the

350
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:38,279
eye and chain so so how do you stop that

351
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:41,909
right those those are things you can't

352
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:44,729
really make your users more aware of the

353
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:47,699
puny code types of attacks unless they

354
00:16:44,729 --> 00:16:49,220
had a mic back defying glass they're

355
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:51,628
carrying with them all the time so

356
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:54,949
here's how we can protect against that

357
00:16:51,629 --> 00:16:58,889
so I'll talk a minute about Cisco

358
00:16:54,949 --> 00:17:01,469
umbrella I mentioned before that we we

359
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:04,349
see just tons of web traffic and

360
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:06,750
information on a daily basis right so

361
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:09,539
200 billion requests goes into this

362
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:11,549
giant data set that we build models

363
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:14,519
around and we look for different

364
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:18,829
patterns different characteristics of

365
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:22,319
the actual malicious or bad actor

366
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:24,869
infrastructure right and so it's pretty

367
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,339
simple to deploy umbrella I'll talk

368
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:30,268
about it today and we'll walk through a

369
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:32,940
quick example but again I mentioned

370
00:17:30,269 --> 00:17:34,250
before on average 180 now to 200 billion

371
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,830
a day

372
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:40,440
global distribution of that traffic

373
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:43,710
really gives us the ability to look at

374
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:46,140
all these different types of indicators

375
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:49,680
so in this case we're looking at

376
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:51,330
indicators which are specific category

377
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,480
so we have a crypto mining category

378
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:56,580
that's derived from a lot of different

379
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:59,430
sources which would include open source

380
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:02,310
intelligence infrastructure telemetry

381
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:04,110
that we're looking at hunting algorithms

382
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:07,250
partner relationships etc so all that

383
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:09,510
information really gets added over time

384
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:12,990
where we make essentially a

385
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:16,980
categorization to any domain based on in

386
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:19,530
this case crypto mining Nam and I think

387
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:22,310
maybe it's I'll just jump ahead and walk

388
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:22,310
through a quick demo

389
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:53,410
forgive my mouse to work for a second

390
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:56,529
here we go all right

391
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:56,529
[Music]

392
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:28,150
sorry guys I can't display what I want

393
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:28,149
to display in sound it's on my desktop

394
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,239
[Music]

395
00:20:55,610 --> 00:21:01,339
[Music]

396
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:09,149
I'm not getting anything to HDMI

397
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:27,320
all right sorry

398
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:35,580
well it's good B that's that's probably

399
00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:38,759
the case all right I'm sorry about that

400
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:40,230
I wanted to walk through a quick example

401
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:42,330
of that and I got a couple good things

402
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:44,850
to to show in that regard but we were

403
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:51,620
able to show this before it should be

404
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:51,620
able to even do it man

405
00:21:57,409 --> 00:22:02,879
best laid plans I guess unfortunately I

406
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,500
guess I'm not gonna be able to show it

407
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:06,299
at the time to you but I wanted to kind

408
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,279
of walk through a little bit of some

409
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:10,168
statistics and then drill down into some

410
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:11,370
of the crypto mining a real crypto

411
00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:13,139
mining sites that are out there and show

412
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:17,610
you some of the information behind it to

413
00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:21,049
see essentially a lot of those IOC s or

414
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:24,059
or indicators of their actual

415
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:45,230
infrastructure that we can view through

416
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:45,230
umbrella and that's a shame no dice okay

417
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:51,979
you did see it oh wow

418
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:59,309
except I can't see it all right well

419
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,620
that was interesting because they it

420
00:22:59,309 --> 00:23:03,870
doesn't show here anymore that's okay

421
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:06,479
so in an umbrella really quickly sorry

422
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:08,639
took up too much time on that I'm just

423
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,669
going to go to a quick report in here

424
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:12,870
and just show you some of my top

425
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:14,700
destinations or top categories rather

426
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:17,489
let's just take a look at crypto lining

427
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:20,039
first for example so down below on the

428
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:22,379
right hand side you'll see that the

429
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:24,179
actual categories in here I'm most

430
00:23:22,379 --> 00:23:27,389
concerned about security so I'll just

431
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:29,940
click on that real quick and then as we

432
00:23:27,389 --> 00:23:33,270
roll down let's see the different ones

433
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:35,010
that are listed in here so

434
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:37,770
we have command and control but here's

435
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:38,460
crypto mining so let's take a look at

436
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:40,560
this

437
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,810
so this says this report basically is

438
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:45,770
pointing out in the last 24 hours we

439
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:47,490
have 56 DNS requests in this

440
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:50,700
organization that are being attributed

441
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:52,310
to two crypto mining so we can look at

442
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,830
all that information there's there's

443
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:57,659
additional information from a chart

444
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:59,189
perspective lot of graphs etc but then

445
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:01,110
then we could actually look at who's

446
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:04,110
doing it from an identity standpoint or

447
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:05,939
what network or what user and then

448
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:10,189
finally we can get down and look at any

449
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:14,040
of these actual examples so in this case

450
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:15,630
we'll take a look at first one looks

451
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,629
fine so I'll grab this particular

452
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:21,360
example so this is going to show me a

453
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:22,770
little information relative to what my

454
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,429
global traffic or what the global

455
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:28,200
traffic across umbrella is versus what's

456
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:31,350
coming out of my organization so

457
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,970
hopefully if I look at the my percentage

458
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:34,770
of the global traffic that's a very low

459
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:36,960
number otherwise this would look like he

460
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:40,110
be targeted attack against my

461
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:43,320
organization but in this case it's not

462
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:46,979
which is great good news but you can see

463
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:49,230
when the actual requests were being made

464
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:50,790
we see them in green that means there

465
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:52,050
are some DNS requests are going out

466
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:54,920
there they're not being blocked which

467
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:58,680
could be based on a particular policy

468
00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:00,480
that's not applied or not enforced and

469
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,040
then down below we can look at

470
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,790
additional information so this

471
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:07,530
particular it's Nano pool that org we're

472
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:16,050
blocking it for some users but not all

473
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:17,730
users right and then if I wanted to we

474
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:22,230
can open up investigate and take a look

475
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:23,730
at that Nano pool work so this is kind

476
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:26,820
of cool this shows us a lot of the

477
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:30,360
intelligence behind umbrella we expose

478
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:32,970
this in investigate which is either API

479
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:36,780
or geek driven in this case we have a

480
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:38,340
there's a benign score our security

481
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:43,170
score that's out here we go from 0 to

482
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:45,270
100 100 being bad zero being good this

483
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:47,790
one does have a benign Oh

484
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:50,460
we're all score in it except it's been

485
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:52,290
classified for crypto mining so if

486
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,420
you're blocking it in your policy you

487
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:55,950
selected that it will be blocked in this

488
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,620
case there's information that shows us

489
00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:01,560
when did that

490
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:04,199
when did that particular domain or this

491
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,700
website come on board we can see over

492
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,000
time you know when it was registered

493
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:10,800
originally when we first saw it in the

494
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,500
umbrella world so when did any of that

495
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:15,840
traffic hit umbrella and then other

496
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,190
information would be all right we we

497
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,340
noticed that we classify this at one

498
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:22,110
point in time as potentially harmful so

499
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:25,020
there may have been samples that were

500
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:27,719
submitted by other Cisco customers that

501
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:30,870
show that there might be but harmful man

502
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,670
maybe not consistent but once in a while

503
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:35,600
harmful data is being delivered from

504
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:40,080
this website and then ultimately in May

505
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:42,209
of 2018 we went further and categorized

506
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,970
to descriptive lending because of known

507
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:47,940
crypto mining or again Intelligence

508
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:49,410
we're getting and then further down you

509
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:54,450
can see information relative to the

510
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:57,450
actual dns resolution in their IP

511
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:59,280
address itself is it fax fluxing those

512
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:01,350
are all indicators it would drive up the

513
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:03,590
score a little bit further the Whois

514
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:06,530
information is all in there so does that

515
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:10,340
registrant have any other malicious

516
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:12,889
websites or any other malicious

517
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:15,959
infrastructure attributed to them and

518
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:18,060
then some geo location as well so this

519
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,280
one is actually hosted in US but

520
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:22,020
interestingly enough there's 41 percent

521
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,580
of the end of the web traffic is coming

522
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,050
from Turkey and you can see a

523
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:30,689
distribution of where the requests are

524
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:33,690
coming from right and then any

525
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:36,300
Associated samples from that are

526
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:38,310
submitted to Cisco threatened rid are

527
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,540
also exposed in here we can see what

528
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:43,649
those samples are what they're capable

529
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:47,490
of doing and then other information that

530
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:49,320
you could also pivot on so the ASN this

531
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:51,060
is basically showing us our TTL or our

532
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,879
you know whether it's fast flexing and

533
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:55,830
then I'm just rolling down just a little

534
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:59,040
bit further there's other models in here

535
00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:01,559
that look for natural language

536
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:04,200
and DGA capabilities so if this was a

537
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:05,549
domain generated algorithm which it is

538
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,250
not it would have a higher score

539
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:12,510
relative to that and then also drive up

540
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:15,990
it's it's a propensity to be categorized

541
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:17,669
as malicious all right and then some of

542
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,870
these other domains is there's a number

543
00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:22,470
of them that have been spawned out here

544
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:25,229
that we can see we track all those in

545
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:27,870
anything that's associated with with

546
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:29,880
nano pool that work as a sub domain is

547
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:32,340
listed out here and co-occurrence this

548
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:35,820
is also an important piece right so any

549
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:38,100
website that's been accessed within a

550
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:41,280
few seconds from prior or right after

551
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,990
your subject domain we call that a

552
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,309
co-occurrence so it's typically like a

553
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:46,890
dropper site or your being redirected

554
00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:49,980
from some particular site so many times

555
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:52,620
you'll find if you were to open up any

556
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,309
of these items in here like minor gate

557
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,979
com

558
00:28:53,309 --> 00:28:59,790
it may also be categorized in this case

559
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:02,190
that's potentially unwanted it's got a

560
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:05,428
good security rank so it may or may not

561
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:06,870
be categorized in this case but that's

562
00:29:05,429 --> 00:29:08,390
kind of the key there so we can drill

563
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:11,340
down and look at some of those

564
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:15,150
components in terms of a policy very

565
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:17,520
easy to to install a policy and have it

566
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:19,280
apply to any any network or any any user

567
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,660
in your organization using umbrella

568
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:23,668
crypto mining is a security category we

569
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:26,130
have in there's probably even been in in

570
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:27,870
the product for about two years and then

571
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:29,880
you know we just have all the models

572
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:31,979
that continue to go through that data

573
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:37,830
set on a daily basis to continue to

574
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:40,350
upgrade exactly is this possibly really

575
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:44,820
all the different crypto mining sites

576
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:49,020
out there and with that I finished them

577
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:51,178
I'll conclude so any questions so far

578
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:53,340
sorry took me a while to get moving

579
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:57,020
around here it's really never saw that

580
00:29:53,340 --> 00:30:00,020
happened before huh but any case

581
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,020
question

582
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:14,990
sure yes you would have to yeah

583
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:17,850
certainly I

584
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:21,510
besides the commercial version at work

585
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:24,419
of umbrella the question was you're

586
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:27,750
using Open DNS at home can you also

587
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:28,980
block on crypto mining by up updating or

588
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:43,500
editing the policy and the answer was

589
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:45,570
yes yeah definitely so there's a lot

590
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,010
more reports built in the air but really

591
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:51,330
all the DNS traffic is being reported

592
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:53,420
and if you have user attribution enabled

593
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:56,090
within umbrella which means you're

594
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:57,840
you've integrated with Active Directory

595
00:30:56,090 --> 00:31:00,840
potentially you're pulling that

596
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,730
information and or it's the originating

597
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,459
IP address that you're pulling from you

598
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:07,890
know whatever network device that's

599
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:10,830
integrated with umbrella then you can

600
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:12,240
find out exactly which you know

601
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:14,340
essentially track trace it back to the

602
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,870
particular user then it's you look at

603
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:18,689
that identity or that IP address and

604
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:21,629
identify you know what other traffic in

605
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:25,620
a in a week or a day or in a months

606
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:27,390
period is that individual gone to so

607
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,610
there's there's a lot of ways to spin

608
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:32,429
that that information and all the

609
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:35,760
reports can be scheduled to be delivered

610
00:31:32,429 --> 00:31:42,900
to your email generated or you can you

611
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:45,020
can export any report out question the

612
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,020
back

613
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,890
[Music]

614
00:31:53,560 --> 00:32:03,330
oh can they can they make the adjustment

615
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:14,080
you talk about Google ads I you know

616
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:15,160
they quite frankly you could put it

617
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,990
whatever you want to from a domain

618
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:19,300
perspective than that in that Google ad

619
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:28,060
right your ad can redirect it to

620
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:30,460
anything essentially there may be a gap

621
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:32,620
in time before anything gets enforced in

622
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:58,600
that regard but it's not something

623
00:32:32,620 --> 00:33:00,189
that's immediate that's yeah that's the

624
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,560
limitation so what we're talking about

625
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:03,940
here is just on the DNS side itself and

626
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:07,030
so it wouldn't really be able to get

627
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:09,580
into to github deeper so it would

628
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:11,740
require a deeper inspection and so in

629
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:13,870
that case if and there may be a lot of

630
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:17,650
other use cases but the commercial

631
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:19,510
version of umbrella not the home version

632
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:22,300
the commercial version of umbrella also

633
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:26,230
has services for cloud delivered

634
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:28,180
firewall as well as full web proxy so in

635
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:31,270
that case we would do a URL inspection

636
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:33,010
on that and you'd have an ability to if

637
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:35,440
you wanted to blacklist or whitelist

638
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:37,420
specific domains in like github for

639
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:43,560
example that would give you that

640
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:43,560
capability sure

641
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:59,670
I don't have the statistics on that but

642
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:01,409
we do have the destinations I'm sure we

643
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:05,150
can pull that information together

644
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:07,770
pretty easily but uh but yeah I think

645
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:11,160
whatever has it seems like most of the

646
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:12,210
currencies fallen off a bit we had a bit

647
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:14,790
of a dip

648
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:16,800
most recently but but they've all sort

649
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:22,850
of moved and have been very volatile

650
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:26,610
right so um again I I see that there's

651
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:28,230
you know there's they're all lucrative

652
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:29,790
right and they're all essentially being

653
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:33,080
leveraged no no what's gonna happen when

654
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:35,550
if you look at Facebook now right with

655
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:37,319
Libra they're trying to control a lot of

656
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:39,660
capabilities around crypto currency

657
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,190
their government's a little bit sketchy

658
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:42,359
on that right now so I'm not sure

659
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:44,310
exactly what came out of the the

660
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:48,660
meetings they had this week but it was

661
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:49,799
it was sort of interesting I think that

662
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:52,500
we're gonna see more and more

663
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:57,420
cryptocurrencies evolve over time and uh

664
00:34:52,500 --> 00:35:00,180
I think they all will have none of them

665
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:02,790
have a way to automatically combat you

666
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:05,029
know malicious use obviously so we just

667
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:08,310
have to find other other types of

668
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:16,560
controls to to expose it and then find a

669
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:18,740
way to block it if necessary question in

670
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,740
the back

671
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:48,339
well I would argue that they they are

672
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,109
happy in your system if you're if you're

673
00:35:48,339 --> 00:35:53,420
you know dropping any type of code on

674
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:54,619
that machine and allowing that machine

675
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:57,049
or taking over the resources that

676
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:58,220
machine it today it's crypto mining

677
00:35:57,049 --> 00:36:05,380
tomorrow it's gonna be something else

678
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:05,379
right right exactly

679
00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:12,980
potentially and again you know in some

680
00:36:10,819 --> 00:36:15,849
cases that's it's temporary right so

681
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:22,700
maybe it's not a no harm no foul right

682
00:36:15,849 --> 00:36:23,920
but again it's it's good to expose it

683
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:27,109
right to be able to see what's happening

684
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:30,380
on your in your environment from a

685
00:36:27,109 --> 00:36:32,240
variety of reasons we just looked at

686
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:33,680
crypto mining there's obviously if I see

687
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,029
command and control and there was a

688
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,940
pretty good number of command and

689
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:40,099
control communication attempts being

690
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:42,049
blocked there right that just tells me

691
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:43,309
that we've been owned or that machine's

692
00:36:42,049 --> 00:36:46,579
been owned at some point in time it

693
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:49,900
can't communicate anymore but I need to

694
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:49,900
know what to go fix in my environment

695
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:01,160
yeah so everything I showed you today

696
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:03,710
was standalone there's that there's

697
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:08,210
nothing that is a requirement for MA

698
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:10,839
from a separate Cisco investment

699
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:10,839
perspective

700
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:19,700
um you know potentially right so we look

701
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,950
at I would just you know if you look at

702
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,970
content filtering yourself and in

703
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:28,759
depending on how you're doing any

704
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:30,230
Content analysis or blocking today it

705
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,660
may or may not depending on the use case

706
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:45,260
if we're looking at just specific things

707
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:48,830
in here so for example this is where the

708
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:50,630
policies exist in here this one has just

709
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:52,790
DNS policies that's that's all we're

710
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:55,850
dealing with today as opposed to like

711
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:57,430
web policies but in this case if I were

712
00:37:55,850 --> 00:38:01,610
to have let's say a policy for my

713
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:05,649
at-home laptops right I can go in here

714
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:05,650
and I can edit my security settings

715
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:13,070
right I definitely want to stop malware

716
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,750
command control the obvious ones there's

717
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:17,800
some additional ones in here too like

718
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:21,440
DNS tunneling see crypto mining in here

719
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:23,720
but you know potentially potentially

720
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,490
harmful domains is a category that we

721
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:30,319
leverage in there that sometimes gets a

722
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:32,540
little fuzzy right so or or newly seen

723
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:35,690
domains that's it's pretty good use case

724
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:39,200
in a lot of a lot of cases but besides

725
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:42,020
just the security piece you've got

726
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:45,520
content blocking again at the at the DNS

727
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:45,520
layer that can be applied

728
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:51,620
all right so about a hundred different

729
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:55,010
categories and this is consistent across

730
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:57,710
Cisco but these categories essentially

731
00:38:55,010 --> 00:39:01,130
can be identified so whatever that

732
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:03,260
categorization we automatically from

733
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:06,230
Cisco tell us relative to categorization

734
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:09,440
and web reputation inside of umbrella

735
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:14,630
and so you know potentially you could

736
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:16,910
leverage this in in lieu of a web proxy

737
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:19,180
if you're only doing content filtering

738
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:19,180
today

739
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:22,848
there was another question someone had

740
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:30,130
you

741
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:54,919
is this being recorded yeah I can't talk

742
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:59,090
about any dates in in umbrella and just

743
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:00,890
not not gonna go down that path in terms

744
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:03,440
of what we're building out essentially

745
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:05,990
is really a capability for our secure

746
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:09,770
Internet gateway right across all of the

747
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:12,410
30 umbrella data centers globally to

748
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:16,040
make it really easy for you to expand

749
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:19,910
the services beyond just DNS services in

750
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:23,090
here to other areas cloud firewall for

751
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:25,009
example we also have Casspi services

752
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:28,010
that are in here I've already been added

753
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:31,270
to umbrella so for example there's a

754
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:34,130
report in here for application discovery

755
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:37,759
really looking at all your your SAS

756
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:40,160
based applications in umbrella what what

757
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,440
applications that are unsanctioned are

758
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,240
your users going to anywhere right and

759
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,970
so we can see that information you can

760
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,770
categorize those applications and block

761
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:51,339
either the category or specific

762
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:51,340
applications

763
00:40:52,510 --> 00:41:01,990
so yeah I'll briefly show that there's a

764
00:40:56,180 --> 00:41:06,859
report here simply called app discovery

765
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:08,600
this is you should be able to turn that

766
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:12,170
on if you don't have it it's part of a

767
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:18,500
package package so if you have that you

768
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:20,120
own this particular okay gotcha so this

769
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,910
is telling me that I've got a bunch of

770
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:24,799
different applications and we show

771
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:27,190
various degrees of risk associated with

772
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,330
that in this case I've got 13 different

773
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:31,850
anonymizer applications that I probably

774
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:34,250
need to look at so I can drill down into

775
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:39,770
this a little bit find some information

776
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:42,740
about the actual application itself this

777
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:46,100
one has a very high security we use a

778
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:48,290
combination of of the business risk we

779
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:50,089
pull information from dun bradstreet and

780
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:53,270
other other sources to

781
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:54,950
assess this and then also we're looking

782
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:56,810
at a usage risk how often this is being

783
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:58,790
used how many users are are going to

784
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:01,640
this particular application on a regular

785
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:03,410
basis and then what do you want to do

786
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:07,430
about it right so I can go in here and

787
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:11,480
drive towards my policies and do a do a

788
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:16,000
block again this category or if either

789
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:16,000
all anonymizer x' or specific ones

790
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:36,890
yes sir yeah definitely so you can apply

791
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:39,950
policies to groups or 80 users

792
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:42,379
essentially is the question question is

793
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:46,839
about applying policy to 80 groups and

794
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:48,559
so when you authenticate or I'm sorry

795
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:49,880
integrate with Active Directory

796
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:53,240
essentially what you're doing is

797
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:56,270
populating in the umbrella platform for

798
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,740
your organization your your schema in

799
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:59,720
fact you can share specific groups

800
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:02,660
doesn't have to be all your groups in

801
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:05,390
your in your organization and so when we

802
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:09,649
get a request we see information with

803
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:12,308
that that came from a specific user so

804
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:16,760
part of the DNS request also includes

805
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:18,770
the encrypted 80 user or 80 group along

806
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,900
with originating IP address if that

807
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:23,390
information is available and so if we

808
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:25,970
see that in the request itself will

809
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:28,328
apply the the most granular policy that

810
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,328
exists

811
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:49,520
yeah so the agent does more than just

812
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:51,590
intercept your DNS request and route it

813
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,870
to umbrella but the key thing there is

814
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:56,980
that we do have a roaming client that we

815
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:59,720
install it's also part of any connect

816
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:01,790
the key use case there is obviously that

817
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,080
your your most infected machines are

818
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:04,430
happening when they leave your four

819
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:06,049
walls right there going home they go

820
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:09,649
into Starbucks whatever they're clicking

821
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:12,800
on puny code links on a website

822
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:14,290
someplace and now they're infected so we

823
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,060
want to make sure that when you leave a

824
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:19,850
protected Network now you have got the

825
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:23,509
capability where all of the DNS requests

826
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:28,009
are going to be intercepted and directed

827
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:33,980
towards umbrella so along with that it

828
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:35,330
also packages yeah an e DNS component is

829
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:37,820
added on to that which would include

830
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:41,540
again the IP address or the the user

831
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:43,880
name if it's available last login

832
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:55,759
essentially is technically what what is

833
00:44:43,880 --> 00:45:06,080
provided something comes up from what

834
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:08,900
source mm-hmm there is and that would

835
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:13,730
require some additional integration so

836
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:17,150
we Cisco provides what we call Cisco

837
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:20,150
threat response CTR we've got a demo of

838
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:23,540
it in our booth right now basically you

839
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:25,820
can see the trajectory of any end in it

840
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:28,610
already could pop it in the IOC and see

841
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:30,530
if you're affected any machine any

842
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:32,630
device within your organization this is

843
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:35,180
infected where it's at what is reaching

844
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:36,530
out to what's what's calling out to and

845
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:38,720
then you can also take an action an

846
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:40,250
immediate remediation if you wanted to

847
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:43,069
isolate that particular machine you

848
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:48,160
could do so or if you wanted to you know

849
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:51,200
delete whatever the particular IOC or a

850
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:53,560
offending factor is that can be taken

851
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,560
care of too

852
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:58,950
but it's a you know you get the question

853
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:00,660
of you know somebody comes to you and

854
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:04,200
says hey I read about this particular

855
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:06,960
attack am i impacted by this with CTR

856
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:10,169
which again uses Cisco amp - Cisco

857
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:12,450
threat grid and umbrella for visibility

858
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:15,330
in terms of if for any domain it

859
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:17,098
provides information relative to again

860
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:21,060
what we showed and investigate right all

861
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:24,839
the factors are there exposed so you can

862
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:27,259
actually see a graphical picture in

863
00:46:24,839 --> 00:46:27,259
short order
