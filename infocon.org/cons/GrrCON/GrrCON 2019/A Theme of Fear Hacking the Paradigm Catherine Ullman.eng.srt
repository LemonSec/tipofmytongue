with questions and here we go so this is

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,229
kind of our basic agenda I'll talk a

28
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,270
little bit about me

29
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:14,220
very little cuz you don't want to hear

30
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,590
too much about me and then we're going

31
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,289
to talk about this idea of fear fear and

32
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,290
loathing cost of fear the history some

33
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,820
consequences of fear you know we're how

34
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,170
we're gonna move forward to move away

35
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,770
from the fear after we change the

36
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:31,740
paradigm and some final thoughts so this

37
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:35,490
is a little bit about me me but not

38
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,949
really this is mini mini as a sloth who

39
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,798
I absolutely adored she lived to be

40
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,649
about 32 years old she was a resident of

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,630
the Buffalo zoo and I used to go visit

42
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,670
her frequently and unfortunately old age

43
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,100
does happen and she wanted for the heart

44
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,869
condition and she's been longer with us

45
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,729
but I put this up just because you know

46
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:58,320
I'm kind of sloth like I like to kind of

47
00:01:53,729 --> 00:02:00,030
hang around and sleep but I don't get to

48
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,559
do a whole lot of that here cuz I'm too

49
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,710
busy having fun with all you guys so

50
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,020
this is really more about me I've been

51
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,848
at the university almost 20 years I'm

52
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,090
involved in lots of stuff I speak at

53
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:12,780
lots of cons I have a few certifications

54
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,060
and degrees in

55
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,800
things and if you really want more info

56
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,740
about me hit me up later and I'm happy

57
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,810
to tell ya alright so let's start with

58
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,670
fear and loathing and the first time I

59
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:27,810
gave this talk by the way was in Vegas

60
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:30,780
so it was particularly appropriate so

61
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:34,800
take a look at this sort of interesting

62
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:37,530
right look at the date 1989 this was not

63
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,580
yesterday right this is a while ago sort

64
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:45,019
of quote early days look at this one

65
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:49,860
from 2007 see anything really similar

66
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:54,660
what's similar here same approach right

67
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:56,489
and what's being used here here all

68
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,989
right this this this fear tactic this

69
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:00,180
language that we see find out what's

70
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:02,220
lurking your system can be infected it's

71
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,170
the same language we have been using

72
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,750
fear for a bazillion years it has been

73
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,910
around forever and we still use it and

74
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,680
unfortunately to some degree it's still

75
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:15,269
working right we're still selling stuff

76
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:18,180
using fear and this is not ideal so this

77
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:22,560
is what we think fear can do we think it

78
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:26,070
has the capacity to motivate and change

79
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,680
behavior in a positive way but we're

80
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:32,430
gonna see that's not really what fear is

81
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,350
good at it it has the potential to do

82
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:37,590
some behavior changing but it's usually

83
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:41,010
short-term it's very very difficult to

84
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:43,049
manage and it in terms of managing

85
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:46,440
expectations you're gonna have a really

86
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:48,030
hard time with it so let's well let's

87
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,299
take a step back and look at the cost of

88
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:53,760
that fear so we spend a lot of money

89
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:55,829
because there's a lot of fear right

90
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,840
we're so afraid that the bad guys are

91
00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:01,290
gonna break in and get us that

92
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,299
ultimately we spend money and in 2017

93
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:06,150
we're at eighty six point four billion

94
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:07,680
by 2018 we're at a hundred and fourteen

95
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:11,970
billion and that number has gone up

96
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,970
substantially the total for this year I

97
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:16,350
I don't even know the exact number but I

98
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,529
can tell you it just keeps increasing

99
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:22,099
and this is all what we're spending on

100
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:24,359
right to make things safe or secure

101
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:26,010
which i think is sort of a mistake to

102
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,160
even think about it in that way

103
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:32,789
because if security like is being

104
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,410
secured an end goal is that like

105
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,420
anything we can ever actually achieve

106
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:39,960
like being secure is that really a thing

107
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:42,780
I don't think so

108
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,789
and for those of you who find that

109
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,650
particular question interesting I would

110
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,120
invite you to make sure you see a Jeff

111
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,890
man's talk later today

112
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,930
because he does sort of touch on this

113
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:54,690
and I have an idea for talk that's gonna

114
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,910
go further than that but so the point is

115
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,500
we're spending more money with this idea

116
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:02,190
we're gonna somehow magically be more

117
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:06,060
secure but guess what yeah it's not

118
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:08,940
working instead we see this particular

119
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,120
thing now this is Gershon how many of

120
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,830
you have ever heard chris Roberts speak

121
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,360
yay people who know who Chris is awesome

122
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,620
and of course if you don't know who

123
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,900
Chris is please stick around for the

124
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,960
next talk because that will be Chris so

125
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,549
one of his hot topics for a long time

126
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,479
has been this whole idea of a blue key

127
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,670
box syndrome

128
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,830
the thing with blinky box in from is

129
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:31,770
that people continue to buy blinky boxes

130
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,390
the late the the next iteration of

131
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:35,580
whatever the blinky box is right so

132
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:38,130
whether it's next-gen or machine

133
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,109
language or AI like that's always the

134
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:43,380
latest and greatest terminology being

135
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:47,610
used but the and the whole blinky box

136
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:51,390
that's supposed to keep you safe right

137
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,830
be this easy button and he rails against

138
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:55,050
that he says you know look stop trying

139
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:56,880
to find the one thing that's gonna fix

140
00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:00,990
all of our problems because at the end

141
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,909
of the day it's not going to so we wear

142
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,370
this talking part came from and the

143
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:09,480
reason I mentioned this is I thought G

144
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:12,060
easy button okay so blinky box and how

145
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,760
do we get here how do we get to a point

146
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,020
where we're constantly buying the magic

147
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,599
box that we think is gonna fix

148
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,940
everything why why would we even want to

149
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,940
do that are we so afraid where did all

150
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:26,310
of this come from and so I started

151
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:29,430
looking at fear and as we saw what fear

152
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:31,770
does not do is it does not motivate

153
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:34,200
people for long-term change all right

154
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:36,330
this is really what it does it causes

155
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,920
people to be defensive if there's not

156
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,390
enough fear being used you can you get

157
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,810
complacency people just don't give a

158
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,870


159
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:45,750
they Jets do not care if if you have too

160
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,620
much there can be paralysis where people

161
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,780
just don't know what to do

162
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:51,510
and I find that a lot of folks who are

163
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,859
not in our industry sit in this in one

164
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:55,860
of these two places right there either

165
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,240
like yeah I don't care or I don't care

166
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,270
because there's nothing I can do I'm

167
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,130
screwed anyway you look at it right and

168
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:03,780
and that's not too surprising given the

169
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:09,270
fact that all the messaging they're

170
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:12,510
getting is big stuff that's overactive

171
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:14,609
response it's just not good so where did

172
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:17,789
all of this come from well let's look

173
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:19,860
now this propaganda has nothing to do

174
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:22,200
with computing but has everything with

175
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:26,910
fear and we have seen this time and time

176
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:29,580
again right so this Japanese camp of

177
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:32,030
course Russia can't can't be nice to

178
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:35,099
Russia because everything can go wrong

179
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:37,619
so we've used fear outside of the IT

180
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,270
industry forever so it's not just here

181
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,550
it's been used since the beginning of

182
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:43,770
time and so obviously to some degree it

183
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:46,440
does work but but what like I said what

184
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:50,849
did not do particularly well is it does

185
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:52,710
not change behavior for long term so we

186
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:54,150
remembers the orange book is there

187
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:57,780
anybody who remembers a couple people

188
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:59,460
yep yeah so let's go back in time a

189
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,190
little bit I'm gonna we're gonna do a

190
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,169
little mini history lesson some of you

191
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,940
may already know all the stuff and for

192
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:07,409
those of you I apologize but it really

193
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,570
is a mini history lesson we're not going

194
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:13,010
to spend a lot of time on it but this is

195
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:16,440
sort of the beginnings of computing and

196
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:18,180
security as we know it but most people

197
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,430
probably don't realize this is where it

198
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,169
starts so there's no information

199
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:25,740
security there's no cybersecurity

200
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:27,389
there's just purity and when computing

201
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,729
first starts doing anything that's

202
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:32,940
security related this is really all we

203
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:35,729
see we see its policy its controls it's

204
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:38,430
really very basic and nobody's really

205
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:40,260
afraid of anything because except making

206
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:41,640
sure that the the same things are done

207
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,289
in the way that the government always

208
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,620
makes sure the same things are done

209
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:47,970
right then we have kind of the

210
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,380
beginnings of the Internet and this is

211
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:52,410
going to jump through a huge hoop of

212
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,520
time but we know we have the very

213
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,589
beginnings with our pin

214
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,110
which are your four computers that are

215
00:08:55,589 --> 00:09:00,420
at major universities that all want to

216
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,339
be able to do research and they all get

217
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,839
connected so that effectively they can

218
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:06,270
be backups for each other and that's

219
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,100
really sort of why this all starts and I

220
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,949
give this example I actually give a

221
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,080
piece of this mini lesson to folks in a

222
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,149
support role all the time when I'm

223
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,820
trying to explain to them why Security's

224
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:20,250
like a problem I try to explain to them

225
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,140
that at the early days there was no real

226
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:24,450
security of the internet because you see

227
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,920
the internet was born of this idea that

228
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:28,740
a bunch of researchers were sharing

229
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,660
information why do we need security it's

230
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,390
a bunch of people who just want to make

231
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,189
sure their stuff doesn't go down which

232
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:38,010
opens a lot of eyes most people don't

233
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,839
realize that so not too long after that

234
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,640
we have something called bit net I bring

235
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,720
up bit net for those of you who are not

236
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:49,830
aware the the town where I grew up was

237
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:53,459
part of the SUNY system SUNY Fredonia

238
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:56,040
and that is where one of the places

239
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:57,810
where bit net was so bit net was most of

240
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,079
the SUNY school state university of new

241
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,569
york

242
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:03,120
it also included Yale and a couple of

243
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:04,680
other schools but the I bring this up

244
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,899
because these are some of my early

245
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,160
memories of the internet logging in and

246
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:10,760
tell netting yes

247
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,360
tail netting to other places and

248
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,790
communicating with people in other

249
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,760
schools not too long after that we wind

250
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:19,110
up with this personal computer boom and

251
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:22,370
companies start to use the Internet and

252
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:25,800
this is where we start to see some fear

253
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:27,620
so the very first virus and this is

254
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:32,069
really we see the beginning of the fear

255
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:35,490
we see brain brain comes out of nowhere

256
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:37,709
in theory and it affects a whole bunch

257
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:41,160
of machines now with interesting about

258
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:42,810
brain is that the purpose for brain was

259
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,689
to be this sort of copyright

260
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:48,060
infringement tool yet its manufacturers

261
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:49,350
or makers if you will started getting

262
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,479
all these phone calls that their

263
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:54,060
machines were being wiped by this thing

264
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:58,649
and that was not ideal people were very

265
00:10:54,060 --> 00:11:00,569
upset about that so McAfee who wasn't

266
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:01,920
who he is now who was just sort of

267
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,529
starting to tinker with all of this

268
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,300
stuff thinks hmm I wonder if I can

269
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:07,380
reverse engineer this to fix it for

270
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,359
people and he

271
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,640
that and he puts it on a bulletin board

272
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,790
and he makes it available freely for

273
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,260
everybody that's right for free but this

274
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:19,110
intrigues him and this is kind of the

275
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,760
beginning so within about a year he

276
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:23,700
starts his own company which of course

277
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:26,730
most of you are familiar with by the

278
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:29,580
late 80s semantics and Sophos debut and

279
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:31,230
what I find most interesting is by 89 we

280
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:34,220
have more anti vend

281
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:37,590
antivirus vendors then there are viruses

282
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:39,630
people are afraid and the reason that we

283
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:41,760
have all of these vendors is clearly

284
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:45,030
they can be supported people are buying

285
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,010
their stuff they're afraid so the

286
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:49,110
government the government's afraid their

287
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:51,300
response I find particularly interesting

288
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:54,270
because I mean again look at these fewer

289
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:57,630
words potentially devastating weapon now

290
00:11:54,270 --> 00:12:00,680
these quotes come from an article that

291
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:03,180
was in a torrontés paper a Toronto

292
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:05,520
reporter was asking these government

293
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,989
these US government officials you know

294
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,210
are you worried about viruses what do

295
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,740
you think the problems are and these are

296
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:13,590
the kinds of things they were saying so

297
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:16,560
clearly they were fearful you know on it

298
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:20,970
got right to be afraid because then the

299
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:23,670
Morris worm hits and goes away which

300
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:25,380
1/10 doesn't seem like a lot but back

301
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,930
then there weren't that many computers

302
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:30,330
on the internet so a test was actually

303
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:33,390
fairly substantial right to be work

304
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:34,740
viruses were absolutely a problem so

305
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:39,150
what are the government do in response

306
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:40,970
well for cert now think about this for

307
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:46,490
just a second I'm not going to delve in

308
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:46,490
very first cert was it Carnegie Mellon

309
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,639
institution

310
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:55,250
and I think

311
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:11,960
all right bear with me here

312
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:14,200
so Carnegie Mellon has the first cert

313
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:17,420
established there this is their response

314
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:20,270
now at that point we have these people

315
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:23,770
buying all this antivirus right in by 90

316
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:27,800
1990 the this is the annual cost of

317
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:29,660
malware removal 1.5 billion that's a lot

318
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,270
of money if you consider the fact that

319
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,920
computers weren't the way they are now

320
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:36,680
where they're everywhere and so

321
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:40,430
companies looked at that and said you

322
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:42,500
know I can pay a few bucks a machine or

323
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:45,370
I can hire somebody to deal with this

324
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:47,690
for a fairly small amount of money

325
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:50,630
instead of having to worry about it kind

326
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:52,640
of wholesale right so if I spend a

327
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:55,220
couple salaries or I'm spending five to

328
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,640
ten bucks on a machine this isn't a lot

329
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:59,839
of money

330
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:01,970
I'm afraid enough I'm gonna do it so now

331
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:06,860
we start to get worried about the

332
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:08,720
outside right these books come to light

333
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:11,900
because people are starting to think

334
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,910
about security in a different way we

335
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,560
start to think about Internet security

336
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:18,890
because that's the thing that's coming

337
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:21,380
to be so in 91 we have this practical

338
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:24,920
unix book and then in 94 firewalls in

339
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:31,370
the internet security and what happens

340
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:32,839
in 1993 anybody know what's the big

341
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:41,930
thing that kind of happens between these

342
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:44,240
two so what well sort of but the world

343
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:48,800
wide web becomes a thing mosaic comes

344
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:50,900
into being yeah and now it's everywhere

345
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,849
so coupled with the personal computer

346
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:56,449
boom now everybody's getting on the

347
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:59,150
internet but you know so all the matter

348
00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:03,260
of protection right you can trust us

349
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:04,579
we're McAfee yes so when I was talking

350
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,100
about blinky boxes were they talking

351
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:09,709
about this kind of blinky box you think

352
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:11,810
yeah probably not so these were the

353
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:13,969
beginnings of the blinky boxes now we're

354
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:16,219
really worried about us versus them the

355
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,030
outsiders right so the folks that could

356
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,360
get in

357
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:22,819
and we have the very beginning this deck

358
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,250
seal unfortunately I'll have an image of

359
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:27,860
that but I do have images this is

360
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:30,350
checkpoint and this is Sisko sort of the

361
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,810
the default standards these days when we

362
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:34,580
think of early firewalls but the the

363
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:37,760
deck seal was the first one at first

364
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:40,250
commercial thing and you know it was a

365
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:43,160
door it was open or it was closed it was

366
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:45,350
very basic and that was its purpose was

367
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,910
to keep the outsiders out and the and

368
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:49,330
the insiders from being attacked from

369
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:52,880
something on the outside pretty basic

370
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:55,730
and then you know basically everybody

371
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,160
thought it's virtually fail-safe

372
00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:02,060
protection we've got this firewall

373
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:04,100
nobody can get in and then Mitnick

374
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:06,890
decided I'm gonna hack the

375
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,840
supercomputing Center in San Diego no

376
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:11,240
big deal and of course they had one of

377
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:14,540
these things in place and they he used

378
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:16,340
this he used some spoofing and some

379
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:19,040
sequence prediction attacks and he got

380
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:22,280
in so first we had the virus software

381
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,469
and people what viruses were still

382
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:27,020
happening and then we had the magic

383
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:31,250
blinky box and then somebody got through

384
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:33,620
it so uh today now that we have like all

385
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:36,530
the things right we have our AI and our

386
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,240
ml at our next-gen and all of our magic

387
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:41,660
boxes and all the money in the world is

388
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:46,520
spent on it now what are things any

389
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:49,219
better yeah no we're still seeing the

390
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:53,210
same problem right so what we're seeing

391
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:55,310
here is the fact that even though the

392
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:57,710
actual number of breaches is down the

393
00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:01,400
number of records is significantly up I

394
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:04,910
mean you know 126 percent that that's

395
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:10,310
not good so uh what's the state of the

396
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:10,640
things today yeah that not good very not

397
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,458
good

398
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,860
so beyond that what are some

399
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:20,930
consequences of the fear that you know

400
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:22,669
has basically gripped this industry so

401
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:25,100
let's look at this so we'll talk briefly

402
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:28,459
about FUD how many of you have heard the

403
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:30,820
term Fudd yeah most of you so this whole

404
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:33,500
idea of fear uncertainty of endow

405
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:36,169
ha I would be willing to bet most of you

406
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,930
have heard of in terms of just general

407
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:42,440
marketing and and lies that companies

408
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:43,940
are trying to tell you right but I want

409
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,620
to tell you about the origins of FUD

410
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,660
because the origin of FUD and the

411
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:49,850
technical industry starts with IBM and

412
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,890
they start with this guy gene um Dahl

413
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:53,419
who leaves IBM because he's going to

414
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:55,880
start his own company and he's going to

415
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:58,820
build his own computers now what he does

416
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,340
is he builds a computer that does not

417
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,080
require a fan because of it puts the

418
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:06,980
processing stuff on the outside of the

419
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:09,040
machine so what does IBM do they come

420
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,490
out with all this advertising that says

421
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:14,120
aha

422
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:16,640
do not buy his thing because there is no

423
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:19,729
fan and that would be bad and your

424
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,010
machine will burn up except wait a

425
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:24,920
minute it didn't need a fan so it's not

426
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:27,620
just that lies or miss thing misleading

427
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:29,510
information is being told it's actually

428
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:31,879
providing misinformation it's going out

429
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:34,340
of the way so the Fudd we're seeing

430
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,530
today isn't even necessarily of that

431
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:39,530
nature but I want to yet understand this

432
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:41,629
is kind of where it starts and I really

433
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:45,500
like this quote from rich Smith and I'm

434
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:48,310
not a do advocate per se but I like this

435
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,630
idea that you know our our industry is

436
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:52,639
generating Fudd in order to sell hope

437
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:55,130
because that's really what we're doing

438
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,640
and of course this still persists so I

439
00:18:55,130 --> 00:19:01,280
found this on the interwebs you'll

440
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,050
notice if you look carefully for

441
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,010
internal use only not for distribution

442
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:09,470
and if you read through this

443
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:12,650
it's EMC e that they're slamming and

444
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:15,260
it's the same kind of technique they're

445
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:16,970
talking about what EMC can't do but in

446
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:19,340
reality I'd be willing about if we did

447
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:22,250
some research we determined that they're

448
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:24,530
just going there talking past the

449
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:28,940
product so they're still doing this

450
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:30,860
today we also have this fear Dramat

451
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:35,390
image problem because you know

452
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:38,990
ultimately the media has caused a lot of

453
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:41,480
people to think about us as a hacking

454
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:42,780
community and what we look like and who

455
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,480
we are in a certain

456
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:47,399
and I like this quote again you know I'm

457
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,610
not a huge duel advocate or anything

458
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:53,730
although I we do use their product now I

459
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:57,449
like this particular quote because it

460
00:19:53,730 --> 00:20:00,060
explains this idea that the media has

461
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:02,700
sort of created this mythos that we're

462
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:04,649
now saddled with might look something

463
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:07,890
like this no one's ever seen this before

464
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:10,350
I and every hacker you know wears gloves

465
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:13,920
wears a hoodie like this is what we do

466
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:16,110
right so I do try to explain to people

467
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,660
that the media has unfortunately created

468
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:21,030
that bias that you know really it's this

469
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:23,400
idea that we understand how a computer

470
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:25,290
works instead of necessarily how it's

471
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,990
supposed to work and I had a very

472
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:30,420
interesting conversation that that added

473
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:32,610
something to do with intent here last

474
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:34,830
night having to do with this idea that

475
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:36,990
not only do we understand how things

476
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,980
work and not necessarily just how

477
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:40,650
they're supposed to work but we actually

478
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:44,520
use that knowledge for some purpose and

479
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:47,100
you know usually if you're doing things

480
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:49,170
for the right reasons then you're using

481
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:51,949
that information to help another company

482
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:54,210
or or help somebody in some capacity

483
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:56,670
there's also fear in the development

484
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:59,460
world my husband who's sitting over

485
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:01,200
there he's a developer and we had a long

486
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,080
conversation about you know is this just

487
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,360
in our universe and he said no we're

488
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,730
under the gun we're given very short

489
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:11,010
deadlines they don't teach us any of

490
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:12,660
this stuff about security in school even

491
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:15,870
when you try to learn this stuff sort of

492
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:20,160
outside of school there isn't a whole

493
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:23,669
lot of stuff in any good place to learn

494
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:25,980
it so if this is a real challenge

495
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:27,870
there's a lot of additional effort

496
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,700
that's required in time for code review

497
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:32,040
at the end because it's not baked in

498
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:36,360
from the beginning so where does this

499
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:40,020
leave us well normally consistency we

500
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:42,479
see is a good thing right we normally

501
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,889
think if we do things the same way and

502
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,690
we do them the right way that we're

503
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:47,910
gonna have consistent positive results

504
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:49,590
but in our case what we're seeing are

505
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:52,230
people doing things the wrong way and

506
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:54,000
have consistently poor results we're

507
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:56,120
working against and despite our users

508
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,970
we're by and blankey

509
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,709
taxes we're not training anybody who's

510
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:03,280
doing any programming I mean you can

511
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:08,870
kind of see where this is going right so

512
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:11,120
this is our result not too surprising

513
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:13,459
and I'm sure never and nobody's ever

514
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:18,229
seen this definition ever definition of

515
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:20,540
insanity yeah so but it's worse than

516
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:22,820
that because as much as we are

517
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:24,440
frustrated as an industry because we see

518
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:27,320
things happening over and over and over

519
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:31,940
again it's not just us that are

520
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:37,399
frustrated and it's not just us having

521
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:40,190
this problem fear ultimately is going to

522
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:44,330
turn to anger and anger is going to turn

523
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:51,460
to hate and if you don't believe me take

524
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:53,419
a look at this this is an actual study

525
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:58,490
everyone hates cybersecurity

526
00:22:53,420 --> 00:23:01,520
professionals and it's true because

527
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:04,670
people fear what they do not understand

528
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:09,110
and they get angry because they do not

529
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:13,610
understand they start to have hatred

530
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:17,270
toward us and that's our fault because

531
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:20,840
we don't fix that these are some of the

532
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:23,510
perceptions these folks have they think

533
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:26,000
we're do mongers or were policemen right

534
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:27,500
we are horrific Lee understood as a

535
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,630
community except within our own

536
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,550
community and you know obviously we

537
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:33,140
could go on a tangent about even issues

538
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,940
within our own community but as a

539
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:37,430
general rule outside of our community

540
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:39,350
people don't know what we do if you tell

541
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:41,660
them I'm a hacker I work in a security

542
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:43,699
you know computer security people all

543
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:46,160
visit what do you do what exactly do you

544
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,860
do all that they have no idea and unless

545
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:50,060
you tell people within your organization

546
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,290
why they should care about who you are

547
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:55,010
and what you do they're not going to

548
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:57,710
know so here's some more people have bad

549
00:23:55,010 --> 00:24:00,440
experiences when new rules are

550
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:02,870
implemented you know they think that our

551
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,680
purpose is keep the lights on and all we

552
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:08,969
are is some sort of reactive cost center

553
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:11,250
again these you know real study

554
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:14,760
people actually think these things so

555
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:21,270
it's not too surprising that this

556
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:28,590
definition becomes a thing is that true

557
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:30,450
at all not even remotely right well yeah

558
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:32,490
okay fair fair I don't drink you to

559
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:36,480
halls oh you know I mean you know aside

560
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:39,030
from some water but the the point is

561
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:42,120
that we're not in a good place and so I

562
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:46,320
propose we need to change that paradigm

563
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:49,679
now who has seen this image before ok

564
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:54,659
quite a few of you so what is this image

565
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:56,160
of it's a duck bunny right and how do

566
00:24:54,660 --> 00:25:02,280
you see the duck versus how do you see

567
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:05,220
the bunny squint the point is it's a

568
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:07,410
very sudden shift in perception right if

569
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,880
you look at it one way you see the duck

570
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:11,130
and if you slightly look at it the other

571
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,040
way you see the bunny it's very subtle

572
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:15,660
so what I'm gonna propose here is let's

573
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,250
not stand our heads and try to be like

574
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,990
radically different because we don't

575
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:21,720
need to be radically different we need

576
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:24,990
these subtle changes so this that's

577
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:28,260
where I'm gonna go with this so how are

578
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:31,050
we gonna overcome fear well we're gonna

579
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:33,360
be honest and yet we're going to be very

580
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:34,680
discerning about what we tell people so

581
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,020
when you're having an issue or an

582
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:39,300
incident you don't want to keep all that

583
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,740
information to yourself but there are

584
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:44,639
lots of details you don't necessarily

585
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:46,080
need to tell everybody right so you but

586
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,060
you don't want to say nothing's

587
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,949
happening if something is happening so

588
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:53,129
you have to figure ways to straddle that

589
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:55,920
line you need to provide how empowering

590
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:57,630
messages you know Jason spoke about that

591
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:00,180
earlier for those of you who are at his

592
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:02,670
talk and you want to be an advocate and

593
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:05,010
find others who will advocate for you

594
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:06,960
you know actively encourage those best

595
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:10,650
practices and when you find people who

596
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,810
are doing that as well you want to you

597
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:16,290
know figuratively anyway grab hold of

598
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:21,330
them and say yay we like the way you

599
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:22,649
think because ultimately we like to give

600
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:25,500
negative mess

601
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:27,860
how many of you have phishing campaigns

602
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:31,980
in your office like selfish in campaigns

603
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:33,510
right okay if you provide a report what

604
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:38,270
is in the report that you're giving to

605
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:43,800
management how many people failed okay

606
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:46,139
what does that reinforce negativity why

607
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:49,740
are you not saying 25 percent of our

608
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:54,630
people did really well here let's go for

609
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:57,450
30 or 40 or pie-in-the-sky go for you

610
00:26:54,630 --> 00:27:01,760
know 90 but the point is the messaging

611
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:03,930
we're providing is our own fault and

612
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,240
even when we're talking to management

613
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:09,330
and they're asking questions we're not

614
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,340
telling them hey why don't we think

615
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:14,399
about it this other way let's focus on

616
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:16,350
this positive message that we can try to

617
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,290
get people to do more of because people

618
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:21,899
are will gravitate toward positive

619
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:25,110
messages way better than they will

620
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:27,090
gravitate toward the negative ones we

621
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:29,219
need to get rid of us versus them right

622
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:31,860
we saw some of where this us-versus-them

623
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,210
came from because we have the outside in

624
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,399
the inside and of course we still have

625
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:37,140
that today in traditional culture but

626
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:41,370
what we don't need is us versus them

627
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:43,290
inside and there's a lot of that we as a

628
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:46,110
community really like to be

629
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:48,389
condescending I get it it's easy because

630
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:50,459
we see people and we think oh my

631
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:54,420
goodness yet again this person clicked

632
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:56,610
on something but the reality is we have

633
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:58,290
to teach them and there are times when

634
00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:00,570
there are people we are not going to be

635
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:02,909
able to change their behavior but we

636
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:04,919
have to think about how we're trying to

637
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:07,680
change their behavior and straight-up

638
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:09,720
fear is not effective at long-term

639
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:13,440
change and so we have to be patient

640
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,820
which can be very painful if you promise

641
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,770
to follow through and looking into

642
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:19,139
something please do and get back to them

643
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:20,400
I know I hate it when somebody leaves me

644
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,200
hanging and I want to understand

645
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,880
something and everybody in your

646
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,300
organization feels exactly the same way

647
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:29,190
I guarantee it you know and if you can

648
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:31,290
do these kinds of illuminating things

649
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:32,810
you can help build this community of

650
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:35,129
trust

651
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:35,879
make sure when you're communicating with

652
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:38,099
them it's on

653
00:28:35,879 --> 00:28:41,639
level that people both understand and

654
00:28:38,099 --> 00:28:43,289
can relate to they're not in the

655
00:28:41,639 --> 00:28:44,549
security business they're not usually

656
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:46,859
technical people

657
00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:48,929
the example that I love to give here I

658
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:53,039
worked for an organization where we had

659
00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:55,429
actual rocket scientists these people

660
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:59,639
were brilliant absolutely brilliant

661
00:28:55,429 --> 00:29:02,039
guess what they sucked at using their

662
00:28:59,639 --> 00:29:04,439
computers right but guess what my

663
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:06,839
company didn't pay them to be good at

664
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:10,499
using a computer they paid them for

665
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:13,559
being rocket sciences so you know being

666
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:16,799
pissed off that these folks don't get it

667
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:19,319
is not really fair to them because it's

668
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,509
our job to tell them what they need to

669
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:23,609
know to do their jobs on that side of

670
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:27,149
the world and whether it's in a support

671
00:29:23,609 --> 00:29:30,989
role or security role that's really all

672
00:29:27,149 --> 00:29:33,689
about us teaching them we don't want to

673
00:29:30,989 --> 00:29:38,190
do this this is a very very bad habit

674
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:39,690
that we like to get into we want to

675
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:42,509
replace fear with a healthy skepticism

676
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:45,389
because of course we want people to have

677
00:29:42,509 --> 00:29:47,399
a certain level of fear in the sense

678
00:29:45,389 --> 00:29:50,189
that we want them to see things like

679
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:52,978
phishing messages and not just either

680
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:53,819
not care or be so terrified they don't

681
00:29:52,979 --> 00:29:56,759
know what to do

682
00:29:53,819 --> 00:29:59,639
so I always respond when somebody sends

683
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:01,889
us stuff that says you know is this

684
00:29:59,639 --> 00:30:03,958
phishing or is this bad I will say thank

685
00:30:01,889 --> 00:30:06,928
you for being skeptical and suspicious

686
00:30:03,959 --> 00:30:09,479
it thanks them immediately for having

687
00:30:06,929 --> 00:30:11,729
reported it to us and it lets them know

688
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:13,529
I care that they've sent it to me and

689
00:30:11,729 --> 00:30:16,409
they've done the right thing again I'm

690
00:30:13,529 --> 00:30:18,899
reinforcing that positive behavior so in

691
00:30:16,409 --> 00:30:22,169
general you know we want people to when

692
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:23,939
they're engaging with new ideas we want

693
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:25,649
them to question stuff we want to play

694
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:29,459
devil's advocate this is this whole idea

695
00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:33,658
behind the healthy skepticism and I use

696
00:30:29,459 --> 00:30:36,539
this particular image because in the

697
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:38,669
story that this particular quote comes

698
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:41,429
from Arthur Conan Doyle is talking about

699
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:44,999
the difference between observing and

700
00:30:41,429 --> 00:30:47,909
seeing I'm sure many of you coming in

701
00:30:44,999 --> 00:30:49,480
here came up some stairs somewhere

702
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:52,120
because there's stairs everywhere here

703
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:54,820
right how many of you have been up and

704
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:57,610
down the stairs just between the vendor

705
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:59,710
hall and here at least like a bunch of

706
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:02,769
times since you got here a few time

707
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:04,419
right you saw those stairs what if I

708
00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:08,230
asked you how many stairs how many steps

709
00:31:04,419 --> 00:31:11,260
there were could you tell me yeah I have

710
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:12,429
no clue the point is you saw them but

711
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:14,408
you didn't really observe them and

712
00:31:12,429 --> 00:31:17,769
observe them is taking note of these

713
00:31:14,409 --> 00:31:20,889
extra fine little details and so this in

714
00:31:17,769 --> 00:31:22,630
the story that he is giving it's he

715
00:31:20,889 --> 00:31:24,428
gives an example like this having to do

716
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:26,860
with steps and just this difference

717
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:28,659
between seeing and observing and we see

718
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:30,639
things all the time but we don't take

719
00:31:28,659 --> 00:31:32,679
the time to observe and this whole idea

720
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:34,899
of critical thinking and healthy

721
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:39,039
skepticism involves this idea of

722
00:31:34,899 --> 00:31:40,928
observation so outside of InfoSec

723
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,820
because we need to stop siloing right

724
00:31:40,929 --> 00:31:45,429
it's not us versus them it's all of us

725
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:47,049
we all need the win because the good

726
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:48,850
guys at the end of the day really should

727
00:31:47,049 --> 00:31:51,460
be winning we need to teach them to

728
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:54,090
question stuff on websites the legit

729
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:57,279
Asiya of an email you know daily online

730
00:31:54,090 --> 00:32:01,928
risks in general and then you know

731
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:03,970
outside I'm sorry inside info sack we

732
00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:06,580
need to be skeptical of the materials

733
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:09,010
that are using Fudd and fear to try to

734
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:10,629
sell us stuff don't support the the

735
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:12,730
piece of an industry that's still using

736
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:16,659
this I won't talk to vendors if I don't

737
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:19,059
have to well in general but but

738
00:32:16,659 --> 00:32:21,490
specifically I will go out of my way if

739
00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:23,049
I have a vendor that's trying to sell me

740
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:25,149
something using a fear-based approach

741
00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:26,860
and I'll tell them straight up you talk

742
00:32:25,149 --> 00:32:28,600
to me like this you tell me how I should

743
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:31,510
be afraid I have no interest in

744
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:33,340
listening to you because you know very

745
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:34,690
much like a politician's ad where

746
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,220
they're telling me why I shouldn't vote

747
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:38,590
for the other guy you haven't told me

748
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:41,679
why to vote for you it's the same idea

749
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:44,289
right so speak out against that image

750
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:46,240
you know I guarantee you we're not going

751
00:32:44,289 --> 00:32:48,908
to completely change the universe in

752
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,190
terms of you know folks seeing that

753
00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:53,799
meant that image of the hacker and the

754
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:55,000
term hacker as bad right there's no way

755
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:57,490
we're going to be able to completely

756
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,100
change that but we can educate people

757
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:02,230
and we can teach the folks that we can

758
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,340
teach there are going to be times where

759
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,200
we could get that message

760
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:07,300
cross and we can change that perception

761
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,280
and even even if its own in our own

762
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:11,379
little circle that makes a huge

763
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,149
difference because if we can change our

764
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,440
own little circle then hopefully each

765
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:17,970
one of the people in our little circle

766
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:21,250
can start to send that message out we

767
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:24,880
want to see nuanced learning replacing

768
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:30,850
fear so again this is this very subtle

769
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:34,600
shift and so instead of being afraid and

770
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:37,959
saying we catch users we want to partner

771
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:40,270
with them when I started in the Security

772
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,460
office almost 10 years ago one of the

773
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:44,920
first things that I did we start using

774
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:47,740
language like we are partnering with you

775
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:50,620
in online safety cuz guess what at the

776
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:53,020
time there were three of us and 35,000

777
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:55,360
people on our University no way we can

778
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:57,760
keep everybody safe but we can partner

779
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,979
with you we can work with you to be safe

780
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,440
and we can answer your questions that's

781
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:04,240
what we're there for you know again the

782
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,160
us versus them and then you know this

783
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,070
idea that we focus on who did the right

784
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:10,389
thing instead of who did the wrong thing

785
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:12,550
I'm not gonna spend a whole lot of time

786
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:14,080
on this because well obvious right we

787
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,970
need to get back to the basics we need

788
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,679
to get away from the blinky boxes we

789
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:21,159
need to know where our data is where our

790
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:23,319
devices are remove the easy ways in I

791
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:24,879
mean everybody in this room I'm you

792
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:28,300
probably sick of hearing this stuff but

793
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:32,290
it's still of course applies however do

794
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:35,230
not let the goal of perfection become

795
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:37,360
the enemy of good and we do this a lot

796
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:40,960
well I can't do it all the way so I'm

797
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:42,880
not gonna do it at all no even if you do

798
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,370
it a little it's still better than not

799
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,870
doing anything so you know you can only

800
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:48,279
get one department on board with

801
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:49,569
something awesome you've gotten one

802
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,510
department on board and you know what

803
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:54,190
when that particular division finds

804
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:56,230
you're not like these scary horrible

805
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:58,000
people that they think you are you might

806
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:01,720
actually get buy-in from other divisions

807
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,850
it's crazy that way with an education we

808
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:07,270
need to see these changes for any of you

809
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:11,770
who have any kind of insight or you know

810
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:13,660
light into other places that teach folks

811
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:17,110
whether it's formerly in formal

812
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:20,259
education or you're in you know maybe

813
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:22,030
26 hundreds or other meeting groups we

814
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:25,630
need to start integrating security and

815
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:27,730
everything so you know get involved

816
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:30,400
within other organizations in your

817
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:33,400
community and show them that you can be

818
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,950
secure or more secure and through these

819
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:38,440
methods and you know start from the

820
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:40,180
beginning they should be able to

821
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,490
ultimately a developer should be able to

822
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:44,080
self evaluate and look for problems and

823
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:47,620
communicate security issues to their

824
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:49,060
higher-ups you know my husband actually

825
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:50,859
has become an advocate within his

826
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:53,529
organization because he spent so much

827
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:55,180
time with me now he sees what the the

828
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:57,220
problems are he's gotten involved and

829
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:59,859
he's used to he's used some tools that

830
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:01,480
he's learned about through some of these

831
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:03,340
conferences and taken it back to his job

832
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,590
and said hey gang we've got some

833
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:07,180
problems here and so it's gotten that

834
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:10,060
whole organization to think more about

835
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:12,640
this sort of thing it also means that

836
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:14,830
you know if you're if you're dev folks

837
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,120
understand what they're up against they

838
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:17,410
also know that they don't know

839
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,089
everything and none of us know

840
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:21,640
everything but you have to know where

841
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:23,860
your area of expertise stops and someone

842
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,690
else's might start so it's important to

843
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:29,710
understand this you know when to ask for

844
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:31,390
help all right so how do we move forward

845
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:34,770
with all of that because I did promise

846
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:40,150
you something about moving forward

847
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:42,160
effecting change is hard how many of you

848
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:44,520
have heard oh my god were so hopelessly

849
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:47,470
broken we can't possibly fix anything

850
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:49,690
the you know InfoSec industry is a

851
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:51,430
show Twitter's a firestorm oh my god

852
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:55,690
it's the end of the world anybody or

853
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:58,210
that a few people maybe no never today

854
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:58,810
right yeah we haven't had any Eureka

855
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:01,060
moments

856
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:05,380
we're not magically getting better right

857
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:07,540
why is that well guess what we're old

858
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:09,670
even those of you who aren't that old

859
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:10,870
this industry is old and those of us

860
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:13,090
who've been doing it for a while we've

861
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:14,410
been around a long time and change for

862
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:16,840
people who've been around for a while is

863
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:18,730
not the easiest thing the world anybody

864
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:22,300
who's tried to say oh I'll lose a few

865
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:25,240
pounds eat healthier you know extra I'm

866
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:26,890
gonna exercise I'm gonna make a new

867
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,540
year's resolution I'm gonna exercise

868
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:30,100
three days a week and then like a week

869
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:34,450
into it you're like yeah that was good

870
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:38,200
right we suck at this it's not easy and

871
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:41,770
so making wide sweeping changes even

872
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:45,970
through our own groups is going to be

873
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:47,530
hard but I'll tell you what oh let me

874
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:50,140
let me touch on this really really

875
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:52,300
quickly first so this is a from a book

876
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:54,460
called switch which has to do with

877
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:56,290
making change from the bottom up instead

878
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:58,870
of from the top down and I work in an

879
00:37:56,290 --> 00:38:00,640
organization where I guarantee you the

880
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:02,470
folks at the top are not about to make

881
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,720
significant change and how they think

882
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:07,140
but that doesn't mean change can't

883
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:09,220
happen and so what these quotes

884
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:12,040
basically are trying to point out the

885
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:16,000
fact that if you can find some change

886
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:18,759
that works ultimately you will see

887
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,270
change start to work but it will be slow

888
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:24,300
which doesn't mean it'll be easy but it

889
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:27,460
means it can snowball and it can happen

890
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:29,260
so some food for thought so like I said

891
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:32,020
you know we've been doing this a while

892
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:34,210
we're tough to to change our behaviors

893
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:36,280
but we should still be able to like

894
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:38,500
shift that paradigm slightly right those

895
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,450
were not huge changes for us and that's

896
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:42,970
why I proposed them where I think we can

897
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:46,210
make the biggest difference is in

898
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:48,850
participation and by participation I

899
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:52,510
mean outside of our silos move away from

900
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:55,120
IT and ultimately we need to partner

901
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:57,910
with the next generation the folks that

902
00:38:55,120 --> 00:39:00,700
are doing hacks for kids that's amazing

903
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:03,879
because those are the folks we need to

904
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:06,009
get to right they're malleable they're

905
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:08,650
not less quite set in their ways yet

906
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,910
they most of them are already computer

907
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:11,500
literate they're already playing with

908
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:13,089
gizmos they always already love

909
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,830
tinkering that's why we can have hacks

910
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:16,810
for kids because these kids come in and

911
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:18,700
they're curious they're curious in a way

912
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:20,500
I think a lot of us are but don't have

913
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:23,410
the time to always explore the things

914
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:26,290
we're interested in they're eager eager

915
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:28,990
to teach and or they're eager to learn

916
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:30,910
from those of us who are teaching so

917
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:33,910
absolutely reach out to all of these

918
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:35,440
younger generations wherever you can we

919
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:37,660
need all of these partnerships

920
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,640
everywhere you can find them and I'll

921
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:42,859
tell you a really interesting story

922
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:45,589
about a way that I was able to affect a

923
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:48,200
very tiny partnership one of the folks

924
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:51,050
that I used to do and user support for

925
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:53,450
because that's sort of where I started

926
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:56,480
she and I are friends on Facebook yes I

927
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:58,640
am on the Facebook's and she posted

928
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,990
something about being very frustrated

929
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,420
that she'd got an email that had an

930
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:04,279
attachment in the attachment had a

931
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:06,320
password-protected file which by the way

932
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:08,180
was a legitimate password-protected file

933
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:12,800
this wasn't you know some some garbage

934
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:14,899
she works with some students and those

935
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,360
particular students get grant funds

936
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:19,670
through higher I grant funds through the

937
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:22,100
through the feds and so there's this

938
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:24,080
reporting that she has to do and she had

939
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:25,670
complained on Facebook bitterly about

940
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,920
the fact that she had to open this

941
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:29,360
attachment and she had to put in this

942
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,110
password after she'd already logged in

943
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:36,110
her email and that was redundant why did

944
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:37,460
she have to do this twice right I could

945
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:38,780
have taken the attitude a lot of us do

946
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:40,160
and go oh my god what the hell's wrong

947
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:42,260
with her it's clearly not redundant

948
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:45,109
there's an obvious reason for this right

949
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:47,840
and we probably all know what it is she

950
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:50,150
had no idea so I took the opportunity to

951
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:52,490
educate her and anyone else who happened

952
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:53,930
to be watching that feed and nobody else

953
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:56,689
in that feed I guarantee you had any

954
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:58,629
real technical background and I

955
00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:01,280
explained when you log into your email

956
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:02,000
that password is what protects your

957
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,300
mailbox

958
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,030
but when mail is transmitted it can be

959
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:12,110
seen right and that's not protected and

960
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:14,660
she went oh yeah we understand it's a

961
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:18,020
hassle but now she understands why it's

962
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:21,379
necessary she's less frustrated she's

963
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:23,720
less angry and it took so little and I

964
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:26,420
created a partnership there and so now

965
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:27,919
she's willing to ask me things we find

966
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:32,000
these opportunities in the strangest

967
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:34,580
places but they're so worthwhile so how

968
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,020
do we hand over this baton well we find

969
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:38,870
ways to work with these kids

970
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:41,420
so b-sides is a great example of our

971
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:43,160
besides besides Rochester yes I know I'm

972
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:46,460
from Buffalo but I actually run besides

973
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:48,500
Rochester and besides Rochester partners

974
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,820
with Rochester Institute of Technology

975
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,890
so we have college kids that come in

976
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:54,830
through there things like coderdojo

977
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:56,420
cyber camps I'm involved in the gens

978
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:58,160
higher Bergkamp that we run

979
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:00,380
see the mine obviously I mentioned hacks

980
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,149
for kids you know any kind of mentoring

981
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:06,350
opportunities anything that you can do

982
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:08,330
to get involved is huge because that

983
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:10,490
generation does not need to make the

984
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:12,140
mistakes we've made and we can complain

985
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:14,509
about our mistakes all day long but if

986
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:16,549
we really want to see change we need to

987
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:19,880
teach that next generation how to not

988
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:24,440
make those mistakes so some final

989
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:26,710
thoughts whatever you do make yourself

990
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:28,300
and your office whenever possible a

991
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,890
judgment-free zone

992
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:33,350
yeah those folks don't know what you

993
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:38,210
know guess what not their job to know

994
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:42,170
and that's okay right educate don't

995
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:43,850
adjudicate just teach them learn what

996
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:46,550
they know you'd be amazed what you can

997
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:48,710
learn from other people I mean I learned

998
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:50,480
a bunch about rocket science that I knew

999
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:52,550
nothing about after working with them

1000
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,440
they learned for me I learned from them

1001
00:42:52,550 --> 00:43:00,100
it was a really really neat experience

1002
00:42:54,440 --> 00:43:00,100
and with that any questions

1003
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:13,259
yes okay so the question has to do with

1004
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:15,600
where do I see opportunities to inject

1005
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:17,400
the kind of change in all kinds of weird

1006
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:20,220
places like that that Facebook

1007
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,450
interaction getting getting involved

1008
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:24,959
with these kids in those different

1009
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:26,910
groups if you do some research and you

1010
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,340
find out that you know there's a

1011
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:31,529
coderdojo or a hacks for kids or

1012
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:34,530
anything like that reach out to them

1013
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:36,090
libraries are a fantastic place you can

1014
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:38,400
reach out libraries have stuff for kids

1015
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:40,230
all the time and I'd be very surprised

1016
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,880
of a public library didn't say Oh we'd

1017
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:45,210
love to have you come and do stuff with

1018
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:47,160
the kids you know school systems there's

1019
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:49,980
all different kinds of opportunities and

1020
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:51,509
don't look outside don't fail to look

1021
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:54,360
outside the box for them because they

1022
00:43:51,510 --> 00:44:00,470
can come in the weirdest places to

1023
00:43:54,360 --> 00:44:00,470
educate any other questions yes

1024
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,880
dear

1025
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,640
so the question has to do with whether

1026
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:26,839
or not I see anything that's already

1027
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:29,598
being done in terms of teaching this

1028
00:44:26,839 --> 00:44:31,549
idea of the lack of fear going forward

1029
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:34,190
with these folks is that that sum it up

1030
00:44:31,549 --> 00:44:35,990
okay and no I don't see that I mean I

1031
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:37,640
certainly see it in my own experiences

1032
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:40,669
because I try to be an advocate for that

1033
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:44,089
but I think we need more of that I see

1034
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:48,890
it in in some things I see it in some of

1035
00:44:44,089 --> 00:44:50,000
the group's at DEFCON the the kids can't

1036
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:51,558
remember what that's called but there's

1037
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,869
there's the kids event that goes on

1038
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:56,029
their routes yes I see that in routes

1039
00:44:53,869 --> 00:44:57,500
you know they teach those kids not to be

1040
00:44:56,029 --> 00:45:00,319
afraid of what they're doing and just to

1041
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:02,809
dig in and learn stuff but I don't know

1042
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:04,519
that that that overall message is

1043
00:45:02,809 --> 00:45:06,710
getting out there I think that's part of

1044
00:45:04,519 --> 00:45:09,019
what we need to start doing which is why

1045
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:11,630
I wanted you know to be somebody who

1046
00:45:09,019 --> 00:45:12,709
said hey we should do this so did that

1047
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:17,140
answer your question

1048
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:17,140
any other questions yes

1049
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:35,630
so so the question is do with what do i

1050
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:38,970
what do I see in terms of how to address

1051
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:42,030
the the easy button if you will with

1052
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:45,029
your seaso or an individual consumer to

1053
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:48,270
get away from that easy button I think

1054
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:50,490
that it's really just taking a step back

1055
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:52,590
and explaining to them the bigger

1056
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:54,509
picture they're going to have seen all

1057
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:56,820
the fear messages they're not going to

1058
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:59,250
know where it's come from I think with

1059
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:02,520
the seaso example it's important that

1060
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:05,100
you understand the the business that

1061
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:07,230
they're in I think we spend so much time

1062
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:09,660
being insular NIT in our own universe

1063
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:11,610
that we often lose sight of what the

1064
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:15,750
goal of whatever the company is right so

1065
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:17,850
RC so may or may not be aware of the

1066
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:19,200
connection between the business goals

1067
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:20,750
and the security goals even though

1068
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,649
that's really supposed to be their job

1069
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:25,020
they may have come up through the ranks

1070
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:28,020
and maybe they never had that education

1071
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:29,490
and so I think sometimes we have to

1072
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:32,850
educate ourselves better on what our

1073
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:36,930
organization does where our security

1074
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:38,880
message fits into that and how we how

1075
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:42,330
buying this blinky this next thing

1076
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:45,180
doesn't solve these 27 other problems I

1077
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:47,340
mean I can tell you like we we recently

1078
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:49,919
purchased a piece of hardware but it was

1079
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:52,650
- it was for one very specific purpose

1080
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,240
and we made it very clear this is this

1081
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:57,510
is not going to fix these other things

1082
00:46:54,240 --> 00:47:00,569
it's going to fix this one issue and

1083
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:03,180
it's not the be-all end-all solution but

1084
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:05,220
we think that it will provide value into

1085
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:08,520
how we're securing our environment so

1086
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:11,370
for example we recently added duo to our

1087
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:13,500
environment to factor is huge right it's

1088
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:16,140
but it's not the be-all end-all can I

1089
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:19,800
cannot bad guy get around to factor is

1090
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:21,120
that a thing yeah of course it is and if

1091
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,950
your cease always paying attention

1092
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,660
they'll probably read articles that say

1093
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:27,779
that but then you just point out things

1094
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:30,060
like well that's great but the overhead

1095
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:31,380
of trying to get around that versus the

1096
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:33,630
overhead of I'm just gonna send you out

1097
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:35,490
phishing messages that's a substantial

1098
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:38,910
difference and that's up to us to do the

1099
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:41,720
educating does that help any other

1100
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:41,720
questions yes

1101
00:47:49,549 --> 00:47:57,589
I think you take that information so you

1102
00:47:55,099 --> 00:47:59,630
can't fix these companies right you can

1103
00:47:57,589 --> 00:48:02,419
do your best to avoid the ones that use

1104
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:05,029
the negative speak sort of overall but

1105
00:48:02,419 --> 00:48:06,828
if you're faced with having to look at

1106
00:48:05,029 --> 00:48:09,169
these companies and maybe going with one

1107
00:48:06,829 --> 00:48:11,719
that does use negative speak I would

1108
00:48:09,169 --> 00:48:12,919
take the information you have about that

1109
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:15,859
products and sit down with the

1110
00:48:12,919 --> 00:48:18,319
powers-that-be and explain to them the

1111
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:20,598
reality of it say I know you've read all

1112
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:23,569
this stuff but let me tell you what's

1113
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:25,339
really the truth here this is really for

1114
00:48:23,569 --> 00:48:27,649
our environment these are the threats

1115
00:48:25,339 --> 00:48:31,699
we're seeing okay and they're very real

1116
00:48:27,649 --> 00:48:32,779
threats but we need to not just react we

1117
00:48:31,699 --> 00:48:35,809
need to think this through

1118
00:48:32,779 --> 00:48:37,459
and then you can show them and here are

1119
00:48:35,809 --> 00:48:41,179
you know some articles that talk about

1120
00:48:37,459 --> 00:48:42,890
how this kind of technology can assist

1121
00:48:41,179 --> 00:48:45,409
with this kind of threat and it's all

1122
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:47,058
about that mitigation so it's really

1123
00:48:45,409 --> 00:48:49,009
putting it in context I think for the

1124
00:48:47,059 --> 00:48:50,630
people in your organization and they

1125
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:52,699
aren't going to know that they're going

1126
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:54,499
to know their piece of it this is where

1127
00:48:52,699 --> 00:48:56,839
you trade information so you find out

1128
00:48:54,499 --> 00:48:58,609
from them what's important what are they

1129
00:48:56,839 --> 00:49:00,679
what do they want to understand and you

1130
00:48:58,609 --> 00:49:02,659
help them get there I think that's the

1131
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:05,469
best way to handle it any other

1132
00:49:02,659 --> 00:49:05,469
questions yes

1133
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:20,720
so the question has to do with whether

1134
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:22,640
there are other industries Oh from a

1135
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:24,500
fear based approach to tonight and I

1136
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:28,490
honestly don't know that there are a ton

1137
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:33,140
of other industries that do as heavily

1138
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:36,020
marketing fear stuff as we do I mean I'm

1139
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:39,290
sure there are some what insurance sure

1140
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:40,880
okay yeah excellent example and and I

1141
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:43,970
honestly don't know I don't spend any

1142
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,950
time in that space but I have to think

1143
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:48,379
that over time

1144
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:50,870
their return on investment is going to

1145
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:53,270
be limited in terms of the fear - right

1146
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:55,130
because if I sell you insurance based on

1147
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:58,340
all kinds of fear and then nothing

1148
00:49:55,130 --> 00:50:00,470
happens now we get into a cry wolf

1149
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:03,320
situation which is something in my own

1150
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:07,129
environment that I feel very strongly

1151
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:08,900
about you know is this even an incident

1152
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:11,360
let's not call something an incident

1153
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:13,610
until it's truly an incident otherwise

1154
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:15,710
you get this sort of crazy idea that

1155
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:17,750
everything we do is an incident and they

1156
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:19,310
know what it cares about it anymore so

1157
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:22,000
it's that sort of overarching we use

1158
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:28,390
fear so much that's we stopped caring

1159
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:28,390
any other questions yes

1160
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:41,839
what say that again Oh home security

1161
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,760
systems I still see some marketing with

1162
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:46,640
bad guys breaking into the house with

1163
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:49,790
the gloves and the hats and the ski

1164
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,170
masks but there may be some some newer

1165
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:52,819
marketing that's not like that but

1166
00:50:51,170 --> 00:51:01,670
certainly I still see a fair amount of

1167
00:50:52,819 --> 00:51:03,500
that any other questions all right well

1168
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:05,900
thank you so much for coming I would

1169
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:09,790
encourage you to be that change you want

1170
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:09,790
to see in the world thank you
