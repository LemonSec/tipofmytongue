1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:08,790
anybody have a free beer by the way yet

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:10,650
yes free beer the beers broken down you

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:14,428
just drink out of the keg I think that's

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:17,010
just a gherkin thing but yeah it's not

5
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:19,289
wrong not but these kind of people so

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:23,010
welcome everybody it's afternoon session

7
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:24,779
at gherkin 2019 I'm Ron introducing

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,789
Chris Russell he's going to talk about

9
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:28,560
the past present and future of cyber

10
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:32,279
threats for about next 25 minutes or so

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,500
Chris thank you good afternoon everyone

12
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,920
can everyone hear me OK in the back

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,600
perfect all right so we're gonna start

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,129
off with the past cyber threats little

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,500
history lesson so the threat landscape

16
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:46,339
has evolved over the years starting in

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,230
the 80s and 90s we we saw the first

18
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,640
types of computer viruses infecting what

19
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,480
was at the time was a pretty small

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,789
platform of systems in the world that

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,890
quickly evolved into worm outbreaks in

22
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,649
the in the 2000s where they were much

23
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,930
more able to quickly spread you know

24
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,000
their attack platforms via the the

25
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,770
warming capabilities or mass mailing

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,210
capabilities or techniques used to

27
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,658
spread over the network things of that

28
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:17,189
nature in 2003 we saw that evolved into

29
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:21,150
spam and mass mailers 2004 spyware

30
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:24,990
started at the scene 2005 we saw

31
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,960
intelligent botnets 2007 we saw web

32
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,000
threats coming down so things like

33
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,899
malvert iseman malicious urls malicious

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
web site content etc in 2010 we started

35
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,840
to see target attacks and with advanced

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,939
persistent threats in 2012 with the

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,189
advent of mobile phones and mobile

38
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:50,970
devices we saw mobile attacks start hit

39
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:52,710
landscape in 2015 ransomware so for most

40
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,470
of us when we hear ransomware we think

41
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,990
okay this is a pretty big issue now it's

42
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,270
hard to think that you know even four

43
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,750
years ago ransomware just hit the scene

44
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:07,949
that's how damaging and prevalent it is

45
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:11,038
even today 2016 BC our business email

46
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,800
compromised at the scene 2017 we started

47
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:17,489
to see attacks on IOT and I I

48
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,550
and then 2018 we saw cryptocurrency

49
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,330
mining in 2019 even though the years not

50
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,610
over yet

51
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,470
we've seen a massive resurgent of

52
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:28,800
ransomware more sophisticated ransomware

53
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:30,510
attacks tied in with social engineering

54
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,980
harvesting to make those attacks more

55
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:37,620
effective and prevalent so in 1988 we

56
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:40,170
saw the Morris worm wreak havoc with its

57
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,480
denial of service attack and propagation

58
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,880
mechanisms reportedly crashing 10% of

59
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,470
computers on the Internet at the time it

60
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,870
was one of the first to significantly

61
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:54,680
affect the then nascent backbone of the

62
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:57,120
Internet in 1989 we saw the AIDS trojan

63
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,950
it was arguably the first piece of

64
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,920
ransomware its creators distribute

65
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,060
20,000 floppy disk copies of the Trojan

66
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,339
to attendees of the World Health

67
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:11,220
Organization AIDS Conference in 1990

68
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,590
polymorphic viruses first emerged in the

69
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,510
form of chameleon created by its author

70
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:20,550
by building on the earlier Vienna and

71
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:22,859
cascade viruses capabilities in 1992 the

72
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:25,650
Michelangelo virus creates cybersecurity

73
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:28,130
panic since it was expected to cause

74
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:32,910
significant damage in reality it didn't

75
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:35,340
in 1999 the infamous Melissa macro virus

76
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,900
was released eventually causing over 80

77
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,600
million dollars in damage worldwide

78
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,090
Melissa placed heavy burden on email

79
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:46,470
servers incessantly emailing itself to

80
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:49,460
unwitting recipients in 2000 the I love

81
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:51,630
you or love bug or love letter worm

82
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,760
demonstrates the adverse impact of

83
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:56,160
social engineering enticing victims with

84
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,370
a seemingly heartwarming missive so this

85
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:02,010
was kind of our first social engineering

86
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:05,940
slash malware attack and today still

87
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:08,730
very prevalent in 2003 we started to see

88
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:11,850
backdoors and worms become more endemic

89
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:14,070
as more security flaws were reported do

90
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:16,700
s attacks become large-scale so much so

91
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:19,260
that one worm SQL slammer hits more than

92
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,570
75,000 computers in just 10 minutes the

93
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,940
blaster worm makes headlines when it

94
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:26,960
disrupts some of the government services

95
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,960
in the US state of Maryland

96
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:32,490
two thousand five mobile malware starts

97
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,350
gaining traction against Symbian devices

98
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,390
most are offshoots of the

99
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,850
proof-of-concept cavern that was

100
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,590
released the year before Komori becomes

101
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:42,360
the first mobile phone virus that

102
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:47,190
spreads through multimedia messaging

103
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:49,740
services in 2007 storm worm emerges

104
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:52,260
combining the tactics of a worm a Trojan

105
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,480
and a botnet at its peak that accounts

106
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,890
for 80% of all malware infections

107
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:00,990
becoming one of the most prolific

108
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:04,440
threats of 2007 and 2008 in November of

109
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:06,000
2008 configure a ko-dan add worms its

110
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,860
way into as many as nine million

111
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,570
vulnerable computers spawning several

112
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,180
variants and picking up new tricks in

113
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:13,890
the process most of you probably are

114
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:17,700
well aware this is still very prevalent

115
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:19,140
on many machines worldwide 2008 is when

116
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,010
that first hit the scene it's so it's

117
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:24,990
amazing that it's still out there

118
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:27,090
2010 stock net comes into view it's the

119
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:29,090
first worm to target supervisory control

120
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,289
and data acquisition SCADA systems

121
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:35,640
prompting discussions on securing

122
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:37,260
industrial infrastructure in 2012

123
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,030
targeted attacks and data breaches

124
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,919
become more common the Middle East

125
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:43,200
targeting flame data stealer and wiper

126
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:46,349

127
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:50,700
Nets motifs distract effects the

128
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:52,680
workstations of an oil firm 2013 a rash

129
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,479
of spam emails start delivering the

130
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,550
cryptolocker ransomware one of the first

131
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,919
to scramble the infected systems file

132
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,540
and take them hostage crypto lockers

133
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:05,250
operators reportedly earned millions

134
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:07,440
today it's more like billions 2015 data

135
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,780
breaches become more potent affecting

136
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,460
the healthcare industry the most with

137
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,679
the exposure of more than 90 million

138
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,390
patient records a bevy of zero day

139
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,490
vulnerabilities are dumped and then

140
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:21,930
weaponized in cyber espionage campaigns

141
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,820
2016 by this time business email

142
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,740
compromised schemes have caused over

143
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,630
three billion dollars in global losses

144
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:32,130
more zero-day vulnerabilities are

145
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:33,870
uncovered and closed 2017 cryptocurrency

146
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:36,390

147
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:38,900
Network event in devices connected to

148
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:42,140
home routers

149
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,880
right now so the good more than 48

150
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:47,560
billion threats have been blocked access

151

162
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,990
cyber criminals are casting a wider

163
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,510
fishing net so we all know the first

164
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,460
phase of any attack is going to be

165
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,530
typically an email attack where they're

166
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:31,960
trying to get credentials from a user or

167
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:34,669
get them to go to a malicious site or

168
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,669
execute a malicious file and that's

169
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:38,360
continuing to become more prevalent

170
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:40,610
fishing has been traditionally

171
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,070
associated with email but recent attacks

172
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:45,530
have also been used other modes of

173
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:47,390
communication such as chat SMS voice

174
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:50,299
calls fishing methods have also

175
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:52,400
diversified the use of encrypted sites

176
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:55,670
to go after Apple IDs for example the

177
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,289
use of deceptive Unicode technique for

178
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:59,240
SMS enabled phishing and the use of

179
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:03,440
hijacked email accounts to respond to an

180
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:06,320
existing email thread ransomware related

181
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,969
detections drop a profits to be gained

182
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,070
relative to the effort to be spent and

183
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:12,080
launching an attack remained compelling

184
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,969
so we continue to see interesting if not

185
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,030
new ransomware tactics such as fake

186
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:18,200
software sharing sites and pop-up ads

187
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:20,119
ransomware bundled with legitimate

188
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,280
software ransomware program to send a

189
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,590
copy of itself to an infected users

190
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:28,039
email contacts and want to cry numbers

191
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:29,840
persisted because of the effective the

192
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,780
effectivity of its underlying exploit

193
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,549
eternal blue and because users might

194
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:37,159
have not patched or when able to patch

195
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:40,189
despite the fix had been available for

196
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:42,049
over a year we still see that today many

197
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:45,500
other new variances of ransomware

198
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:47,240
emerged in this year alone Rio for

199
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,420
example was a big one

200
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:53,980
causing many many millions and sometimes

201
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,979
billions of dollars of damage to inter

202
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:58,930
cryptocurrency mining detections and

203
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,580
file as threats have increased even in

204
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:02,520
the underground cryptocurrency centric

205
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,630
tools and services were being advertised

206
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:07,000
cryptocurrency mining malware and

207
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:08,950
cryptocurrency stealing our which

208
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,740
targets wallets and intercepts tyv

209
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:15,310
intercepts the transactions we aren't

210
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:17,500
seeing this as a consistent threat this

211
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:20,079
kind of goes in line with a value of

212
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:22,540
Bitcoin for example that when there's

213
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,279
money to be made we see increasing

214
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:28,719
cryptocurrency mining when the value

215
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:30,939
drops obviously this drops 2009 has seen

216
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,830
more of an increase or re-emergence of

217
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:37,330
ransomware attacks exploitation of patch

218
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,830
vulnerabilities so this is still a big

219
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:41,440
one today and I think everyone in the

220
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:42,670
room can understand that it's very hard

221
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,890
for an enterprise to keep their

222
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:46,900
environments patched a lot of

223
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:50,020
organizations do a good job patching

224
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:52,680
some organizations can't patch some

225
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:54,760
organizations are very slow to patch so

226
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,500
even in the underground cryptocurrency

227
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,660
centric tools and services were being

228
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,160
advertised cryptocurrency mining malware

229
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:04,719
and cryptocurrency stealing malware

230
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,969
which targets these exploits to spread

231
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,190
their infections to to breach the

232
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:10,779
systems and get on there etc so

233
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:13,200
exploitation of plat patch

234
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:20,560
vulnerabilities is still huge even in

235
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:22,089
2019 and has been for many years skate

236
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,760
of honour abilities soar so the

237
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:26,920
vulnerabilities of SCADA systems Stuxnet

238
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:30,010
was one of the first examples of that

239
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:32,110
and it has continued to soar to to this

240
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:35,680
day it is one of the highest growth

241
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:38,260
attack platforms that we see today most

242
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,170
of these we can speculate are from

243
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:44,580
nation-state type actors I'm trying to

244
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:48,160
attack other nation-states it's becoming

245
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:51,250
more a a government type attack platform

246
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:56,560
than even a for-profit or cyber criminal

247
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:58,930
attack platform so revamp threats new

248
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,939
abuses so the moriah based malware

249
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:04,390
started infecting routers I think it was

250
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,740
in 2018 and taking over millions of

251
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:09,550
routers around the world the

252
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:12,070
used for to create botnets - to do

253
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:15,880
denial of service attacks that continues

254
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:17,680
today they also can be used for you know

255
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:24,490
cryptocurrency mining other types of

256
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:27,479
farming etc we saw you know outbound

257
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:30,670
router events from the eternal blue

258
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:33,040
vulnerability that still is the number

259
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:35,290
one outbound router event we see today

260
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:40,260
even though that's been patched now for

261
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:44,650
well over a year so what is the future

262
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:46,960
so we see an increase even more so in

263
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:49,300
social engineering via phishing as state

264
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,950
of Monaco culture declines exploit kit

265
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:54,040
attacks decline cyber criminals will use

266
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:55,330
social engineering even more most of you

267
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,630
are probably familiar with the attack

268
00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:00,850
type where a user in your organization

269
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:03,580
typically a high profile user will get a

270
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:06,490
phishing email or a spear phishing email

271
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:09,460
they're hoping to get the credentials of

272
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:12,030
that user within your organization then

273
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:14,860
they'll elevate that attack with that

274
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:17,980
company credential company email address

275
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,900
to potentially send that over to another

276
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,610
user in the organization that has power

277
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,250
and authority perhaps to transfer a

278
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:29,590
large sums of money it's coming from the

279
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:32,320
perhaps CEO it looks and feels real it

280
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:33,670
may say I need a transfer of fifty

281
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,490
thousand dollars immediately for an

282
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:39,339
emergency capital request they go ahead

283
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:40,990
and send that attack done the only thing

284
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,450
that needed to happen was a spear

285
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:45,370
phishing attack succeeded they gain that

286
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:47,880
users credentials then they were able to

287
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:50,380
send an email to that other user and

288
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,510
they gain fifty thousand dollars and it

289
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,880
can be met in much more cases it's much

290
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:57,130
higher we've seen examples of one

291
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:01,720
organization transfer to half a million

292
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:03,430
dollars via an attack just like that so

293
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:07,630
that doesn't only apply to email it can

294
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:10,599
also apply to you know SMS chats sim

295
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:13,780
jacking a lot of customers that I see

296
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,210
are moving to office 365 using the

297
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:18,310
built-in chat capabilities of office 365

298
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:19,690
the built-in file sharing capabilities

299
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,119
of office 365

300
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:24,670
same attack where users credentials are

301
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,940
harvested can then apply to that entire

302
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:32,439
office 365 workflow causing even more

303
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:34,570
harm sporting events upcoming elections

304
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,250
socio-political developments will be

305
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:39,730
used as premise for social engineering

306
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:41,950
attacks so open source intelligence

307
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,990
gathering this this kind of ties into it

308
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:47,200
the example I just talked about

309
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,910
so everyone today is on social media

310
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,950
usually or maybe on five or six

311
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:53,709
different social medias these thread

312
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:55,210
actors are basically harvesting the

313
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:58,870
information that you're putting out in

314
00:13:55,210 --> 00:14:01,810
the public to better attack you or your

315
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:04,500
organization so that that example I use

316
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:07,719
where they're going to craft a message

317
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,580
from that hijack credential they can

318
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,070
find out a lot about that individual

319
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:15,370
from their social media and then craft

320
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:17,080
an attack that really matches what they

321
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:19,690
would really do so it makes it much more

322
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:26,050
effective so we see even more of that

323
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:27,730
happening now and moving forward and of

324
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:29,170
course artificial intelligence engines

325
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:31,480
are gathering this so it's not just

326
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:34,420
human intelligence there are AI engines

327
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,880
out there gathering this tracking users

328
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:39,400
tracking their their destination their

329
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:44,260
travel etc all that's being used to

330
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:45,880
better attack organizations automation

331
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:48,220
will be a new wrinkle in business

332
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,750
process compromise more aspects of

333
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,240
monitoring and function are conducted to

334
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,800
software or online applications this

335
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,260
will also be used in supply chain

336
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,209
attacks we're seeing a big increase in

337
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,650
supply chain attacks I think the first

338
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:03,430
one most of you will recall was the

339
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:05,949
target breach way back that was a supply

340
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:08,979
chain attack where they compromised the

341
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:11,500
HVAC vendor and used that to get into

342
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:16,330
the larger target network and then from

343
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:18,280
there finish their attack more

344
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:20,440
techniques to blend in so we're going to

345
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:23,079
see more living off the land of tackers

346
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,900
this will obviously increase use of

347
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:28,480
unconventional file extensions less

348
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:30,010
reliance on actual executables as in the

349
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,790
use of fireless components such as

350
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:36,490
powershell scripts and macros PS exec

351
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:38,709
you know no file needed basically just

352
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:41,740
running something that executes and

353
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:44,888
takes advantage you know digital sign

354
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:46,300
malware new activation methods abusive

355
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:49,870
email accounts our online storage

356
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:53,979
services and apps minimally modifying or

357
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:56,680
infecting legitimate system files so

358
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,420
this is a big one 99.99% of exploit

359
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,430
based attacks are using known

360
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,620
vulnerabilities that's very true today

361
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:03,329
and and we see that in the future as

362
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,410
well

363
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:06,699
successful exploit based attacks

364
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:09,010
one-ball vulnerabilities for which

365
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:10,810
patches have been available for weeks or

366
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:14,110
even months but have not been applied

367
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:17,050
yet so that's a big number so most of

368
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:19,740
the attacks we see in 99.99% aren't

369
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:23,019
using zero days aren't using some

370
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:24,940
homebred attack of an exploit that no

371
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:30,820
one knows about these are all known and

372
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:33,310
patchable other techniques remember most

373
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,750
threat actors are lazy worms will be

374
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:37,689
used to infect more our systems

375
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:42,639
including IOT botnet wars destructive

376
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:46,060
attacks and mobile attacks so some

377
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:49,449
advice on how to prevent you need a

378
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:50,949
multi-layered approach because of all

379
00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:53,889
those different types of attacks we

380
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:55,750
talked about you need a solution or

381
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:57,459
solution set within your organization

382
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:02,019
that can cover all those different bases

383
00:16:57,459 --> 00:17:06,639
so at the entry point upon arrival good

384
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:09,250
firewall good micro segmentation example

385
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,429
of I've got a database server that is

386
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:14,890
connected to an app server the only

387
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:17,319
thing the database server is used for is

388
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:19,990
a database for that app server do I do I

389
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:23,349
need to open that database server up to

390
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:25,150
the entire data center no I can micro

391
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:27,698
segment that where okay that that

392
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:30,549
database server can only talk to that

393
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:34,020
application server therefore closing the

394
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:39,040
loop on potential infiltration points

395
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:43,360
host based IPs so the the section we

396
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:46,658
talked about where 99.99% of attacks or

397
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,590
exploits are from known threats so if

398
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:49,419
there's a known

399
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:51,549
threat or a known exploit or a known

400
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:53,320
vulnerability you can't patch it let's

401
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:56,230
say or you don't have time to patch it

402
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,520
use a host-based IPS where the intrusion

403
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:59,500
prevention system is going to identify

404
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,020
the network packets associated with that

405
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:04,929
attack drop the packets the exploit

406
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:09,418
fails to the attacker the system appears

407
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:12,690
to be patched browser exploit prevention

408
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:16,779
device control so Stuxnet for example

409
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:20,470
that was using human intelligence took a

410
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:23,799
USB to the air gapped systems plugged it

411
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:25,690
in loaded the malware using something

412
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:27,789
like device control if they would have

413
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:30,100
said okay all of our USBs are locked

414
00:18:27,789 --> 00:18:32,350
down or the old school method fill them

415
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,360
with epoxy whatever whatever it's

416
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:38,408
necessary the Stuxnet attack would have

417
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:40,299
failed web reputation so phishing

418
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:42,549
attacks where the leveraging malicious

419
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:45,370
URLs etcetera web reputation can detect

420
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:47,080
and prevent that next phase of the

421
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:49,389
attack so they get through the the entry

422
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,879
point they move on to downloading a

423
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:54,120
payload to the disk so typical

424
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,770
anti-malware protection you want to have

425
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,330
multiple layers of detection with your

426
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:00,158
anti-malware solutions so because

427
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:02,830
attacks can come from any variety of

428
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:06,450
ways we recommend a solution that has

429
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:09,580
pre execution machine learning

430
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:10,960
predictive machine learning application

431
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,340
control so if you've got some more

432
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,570
sensitive work while I was in your

433
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:16,330
environment where you want to lock them

434
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:18,340
down so known applications can even run

435
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:22,120
we recommend application control for

436
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:24,820
that variant protection file ever file

437
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:27,219
level signatures so what a lot of people

438
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,658
will call traditional detection file

439
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:32,020
level signatures are still very

440
00:19:28,659 --> 00:19:36,850
important important back to 99.99% of

441
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:38,649
all attacks today are already known and

442
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:40,750
the next phase of your attack would be

443
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:43,418
ok it got through it got on disk it was

444
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:45,880
able to install execute so we want

445
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:48,490
execution based scanning so runtime

446
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,860
protection so runtime machine learning

447
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:54,700
indicator of attack behavioral analysis

448
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:56,020
exploit prevention and then let's say it

449
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,419
got through all of those layers of

450
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:01,210
protection and still is able to run and

451
00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:03,159
execute you need to be able to say ok

452
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:06,309
I'm identifying that this system has

453
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:09,820
been breached how do we do that so we

454
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:11,500
have techniques like web reputation

455
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:15,158
so if something is reaching out to a

456
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,600
command-and-control server host IPS so

457
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:17,950
if something is laterally moving

458
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,469
internally within your infrastructure

459
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:22,570
post IPS can detect and prevent that

460
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:24,130
data loss prevention maybe there

461
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:26,740
exfiltrating sensitive data in your

462
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:31,350
organization data loss print prevention

463
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:33,909
will detect and prevent that as well and

464
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:36,668
then because you've got all these

465
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:38,649
different techniques in a solution we

466
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:41,559
recommend that you you go with something

467
00:20:38,649 --> 00:20:43,750
that has false positive check so don't

468
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:45,428
don't go with a solution that just uses

469
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:47,140
an artificial intelligence engine for

470
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:49,990
example and doesn't cross-reference that

471
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:51,700
too ok I know this is a good file I know

472
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:53,169
this is a good site I don't need to run

473
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,809
this through any of these engines so

474
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:57,250
false positive check isn't very

475
00:20:55,809 --> 00:21:03,580
important use of that equation to keep

476
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:05,350
your enterprise moving forward so this

477
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:07,720
kind of identifies what we just talked

478
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:09,939
about the different layers of protection

479
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,110
the first line of defense web and file

480
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:14,100
reputation exploit prevention

481
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:17,949
application control variant protection

482
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:20,889
filter out the known good filter out the

483
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:23,049
known bad move those on to the next

484
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:25,240
generation engines such as pre execution

485
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:27,760
machine learning less overhead less

486
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:31,720
false positive look for a solution that

487
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,850
has this kind of a structure what's left

488
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,770
take it through the runtime engines

489
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:37,899
behavior analysis runtime machine

490
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:39,429
learning is there anything left we need

491
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:42,279
to scan let's go ahead and send it to a

492
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:44,230
custom sandbox detonate it determine if

493
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:46,270
it's doing anything malicious create a

494
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:47,950
pattern on the fly submit that out to

495
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:51,730
the rest of the organization protecting

496
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:53,440
them and patient zero as well and then

497
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,630
of course you need a solution at the end

498
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,000
of the day nobody's going to be perfect

499
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:59,770
no solutions going to be perfect if

500
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,210
something does breach your organization

501
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:03,850
you still want to know what's happening

502
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:06,070
have a good investigation in response

503
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:08,080
platform where you can identify that

504
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:09,549
you've been breached on day one instead

505
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,699
of maybe six months later or a year

506
00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:11,700
later

507
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:17,120
stay educated so if you're a responsible

508
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:18,709
for the security of your organization or

509
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,719
maintaining your data centers or

510
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:24,590
whatever it may be you need to stay up

511
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,560
on the latest trends latest attacks etc

512
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:29,629
is there a patch for this vulnerability

513
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:32,510
whatever it may be using podcasts blogs

514
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:36,320
research reports threat reports webinars

515
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:38,090
videos news articles etc if you're an

516
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,740
administrator of your organization and

517
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:42,800
you're responsible for employee training

518
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:45,170
put in a good training program with

519
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:48,350
videos classes phishing simulations

520
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:51,200
Phish your users right you you go ahead

521
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:54,260
and and and get get them caught with a

522
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,120
spear phishing attack that's safe ahead

523
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:59,870
of time so that they don't end up

524
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:01,489
getting caught from a malicious actor at

525
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:02,989
the end of the day you can deploy all

526
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:05,600
the layers of protection from a

527
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:07,730
technology perspective and that scenario

528
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,340
that I talked about where if a user

529
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:12,970
gives up their credentials and that

530
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:14,929
threat actor has the keys to the kingdom

531
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:18,170
unless you can detect the data

532
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:22,820
exfiltration you know it's game over so

533
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:25,480
training is an important piece where to

534
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:28,429
invest so gateways we talked about how

535
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,680
messaging and internet browsing are kind

536
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:32,240
of the first line of defense against

537
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:36,650
most threats that's where most threats

538
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:39,380
will start so invest in a messaging and

539
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:41,360
web security solution things to look for

540
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:44,420
in a messaging solution make sure it has

541
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:47,209
a good platform or engine for socially

542
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:50,600
socially engineered attack protection AI

543
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:53,480
and machine learning for detecting okay

544
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,340
it's a known threat but they changed it

545
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,250
a little bit so if knots a new threat

546
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:59,929
with AI and machine learning it can

547
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:01,430
actually see a brand new threat that no

548
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:03,530
one's ever seen in the wild before and

549
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:05,150
say this is close enough to that threat

550
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:07,820
I know about I'm going to flag this as

551
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:09,020
malicious that's a very high level

552
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:11,629
overview of what and what machine

553
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:14,720
learning does embedded URL detection

554
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:16,850
sandbox attachment support for web

555
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,280
security look for web reputation command

556
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:21,740
and control detection exploit detection

557
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:24,620
malicious script it section sandboxing

558
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:25,840
off URLs where to vest on the network

559
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,428
side we

560
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,699
talked about what if everything gets

561
00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:32,919
through what if we're breached breach

562
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,990
detection systems so something that can

563
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:37,270
identify targeted attack behavior such

564
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:39,520
as infiltration lateral movement command

565
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:40,418
and control communications be able to

566
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,918
sandbox

567
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:43,270
you know files that aren't prevalent on

568
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,950
the internet that we want to make sure

569
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:46,929
are safe before we let them through and

570
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:49,570
then of course exfiltration so these are

571
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:50,950
all things that okay something has

572
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:54,070
gotten through or maybe someone brought

573
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:55,510
in a BYOD device and it's infected we

574
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:57,039
want to be able to know that's there

575
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:59,200
before it actually causes a bigger

576
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,330
problem or if we are breach we want to

577
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,850
make sure we minimize the damage before

578
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:05,230
it turns into a bigger situation so

579
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:08,559
breach detection can certainly help

580
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:11,980
there network-based intrusion prevention

581
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:14,049
system RFPs this can provide network

582
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:15,549
based vulnerability shielding so that

583
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:17,350
whole scenario we talked about where we

584
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:19,179
can't patch our datacenter we've got you

585
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:22,240
know maybe Windows Server 2003 is still

586
00:25:19,179 --> 00:25:24,039
running without patches etc network

587
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,659
based IPs can certainly help there

588
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:31,779
machine learning context and visibility

589
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:35,940
where to vest on servers obviously you

590
00:25:31,779 --> 00:25:35,940
want a multi-layered approach and

591
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:42,100
endpoints same basic thing we've covered

592
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:46,210
a lot of these spaces earlier and then

593
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:49,649
that's it thank you very much

594
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:49,650
[Applause]
