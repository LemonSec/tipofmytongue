night apparently here's Rachel thank you

7
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,719
for that amazingly heartfelt wonderful

8
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:52,640
introduction Chris I can feel how much

9
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:52,640
you love me in your soul love you too

10
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,660
welcome everyone because I know you guys

11
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,070
are all excited to hear me talk about

12
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:04,229
unicorns for an hour

13
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:06,630
I've been InfoSec conference that's

14
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:08,159
exactly what we're gonna do for all of

15
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,350
you guys think in like all this really

16
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,420
isn't for me it is you all need to hear

17
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,369
this and it's gonna be hard much like

18
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,220
Amanda's yesterday was hard because our

19
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:19,439
industry is broken it's broken in so

20
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,780
many ways it's broken because of mental

21
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,389
illness because there's no path and

22
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,799
InfoSec because even people that have

23
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,630
been here for 30 years still feel the

24
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,619
struggle and we're gonna talk about the

25
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,600
things that you can do to change that

26
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:32,490
this morning that's me

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,199
they made me take a professional photo

28
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,850
because apparently the one that we're

29
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,470
using on the website with me with like

30
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:42,229
the Bayer filter where nobody can see my

31
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:45,179
face just doesn't fly with a legal in HR

32
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:47,310
my last name spell pronounced jack epoxy

33
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,399
don't worry that's why it's just Rachel

34
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,890
G on everything no one really knows I'm

35
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,380
a manager over at Target managing

36
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,700
penetration testing team currently I've

37
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,130
kind of a wild background we'll go

38
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,119
through that in like five slides I have

39
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,429
16 years of experience

40
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,929
that's an info site the other seven

41
00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:06,210
eight-nine

42
00:02:03,929 --> 00:02:08,128
the other nine because I can math at

43
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,849
this early in the morning are in a

44
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:13,530
variety of weird things but that's what

45
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:16,260
you get when you get InfoSec you get a

46
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:19,739
crazy background my twitter handle

47
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,489
really is soulcrusher 86 is not the

48
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:23,700
euros born

49
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:26,760
that's my level I'm so I'm a level 86

50
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,798
soulcrusher I would tell you guys the

51
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,970
story but I love it so much more when

52
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:34,680
other people tell it because they

53
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:36,480
embellish it oh it's perfect me it may

54
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,540
or may not involve making somebody cry

55
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,310
in the middle of training with their Jim

56
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:44,970
selfies it's amazing find somebody

57
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,230
they'll tell it to you all right Molly

58
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,060
Molly will tell it to you it's amazing

59
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,280
okay so let's talk about white unicorn

60
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,340
so aside from because I wanted to talk

61
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,099
about unicorns for an hour the in Maasai

62
00:02:53,340 --> 00:03:00,180
community has this really nice unique

63
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:01,709
way of degrading the word unicorn how

64
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,940
many people here know what a unicorn is

65
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:08,940
in reference to hiring woo everybody

66
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,870
that actually hires people so a few

67
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,690
years ago

68
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,579
this shift happened in InfoSec where the

69
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:17,579
Job Description started including more

70
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:18,660
and more and more experiences to the

71
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:21,239
point when people would look at a job

72
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:24,329
description to be like I can't fill

73
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,549
every shoe in this job description no

74
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:28,590
one could but they'd be handed them to

75
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:30,690
recruiters and recruiters were like you

76
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,739
got to check every single box or you're

77
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,500
not getting a call back

78
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:35,700
so came known as being a unicorn company

79
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,549
is reaching out looking for a unicorn

80
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:41,250
but ask someone that hires and someone

81
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:42,630
that writes those descriptions there's

82
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,329
so many things because we know that

83
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:48,000
there are so many paths and ways into

84
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:49,200
InfoSec your background can include 20

85
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,109
different things I'm just looking for

86
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,530
some combination of that that shows me

87
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:58,019
that you really want to have that job so

88
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:01,169
instead of being a unicorn and looking

89
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:03,930
at that as being bad everybody here is a

90
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:06,290
unicorn we all have a unique background

91
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:09,439
a unique set of skills we're

92
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:12,319
about how you can take that embrace it

93
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:15,280
and actually be happy with a 20 year

94
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:18,529
career path here actually figure it out

95
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,918
but they're roblox so that's all we can

96
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:25,090
talk about what are the roadblocks why

97
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:29,448
do we know that it's a broken system

98
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:33,380
what can you personally as an individual

99
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:34,910
do to make it easier on yourself and if

100
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,130
you manage anybody if you're in charge

101
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:39,800
in any capacity there are things you can

102
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:44,180
be doing better - we don't want to hear

103
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:46,669
it but it's true and I'm just here to

104
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:50,840
provide the message so let's talk about

105
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:53,359
the roadblocks right the best one is how

106
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,369
do I kids where you are I stand up on

107
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,199
stage and I tell people about the weird

108
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:59,270
things that I find in my job and somehow

109
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,250
they listen to me and at the end I

110
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,570
always get the question that sounds

111
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:05,919
really cool how'd it get to where you

112
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:09,500
are but it's a hard question to answer

113
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,180
there isn't a road map and everyone's

114
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,010
used this slide and I know some of you

115
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,830
have used it because I stole it from

116
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:18,500
presentations online and this flight is

117
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,969
that the path I took to get to where I

118
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,770
am should look like a straight line

119
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:25,750
instead it looks like a messy line and

120
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:30,020
that's great it doesn't really describe

121
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:32,780
anything so this is legitimately my job

122
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:35,419
titles for the last 16 years right you

123
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:37,580
guys can see the connection that's hit

124
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:39,349
us line that's very straight right if I

125
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:43,520
gave you this roadmap you'd be able to

126
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:45,320
get here you get right where I am it's

127
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,609
not like the description of my job works

128
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:52,460
any better you know like that's someone

129
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:54,560
that's a linguist become a penetration

130
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,380
testing manager there's some weird stuff

131
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,479
in there social media monitoring

132
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:02,030
facilitator signals analyst phishing

133
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:07,280
analyst I did IR dissection it Intelli

134
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:10,460
once one time it's not like I can give

135
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,289
you my life story or my resume and

136
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,700
you're gonna be able to get to where I

137
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:18,650
was in fact the amount of choice

138
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:21,800
the amount of twists and turns and leaps

139
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:25,489
of faith and opportunities that got me

140
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,770
here you would choose differently and

141
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:31,250
that's okay but you can still get to my

142
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:33,680
place your path would be different it's

143
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,780
not about how you get there it's about

144
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,950
you getting there but that path doesn't

145
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:41,359
have to hurt it doesn't have to be hard

146
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:45,590
we don't have to make it hard on each

147
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,750
other job hopping is real in our

148
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,400
industry everyone knows if you want to

149
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,320
get make it an InfoSec if you want to

150
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,989
switch what you're doing you've got a

151
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:58,669
tuna for your lifespan at your current

152
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:59,540
company but why why are we accepting

153
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:02,990
this

154
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:05,330
I shouldn't have to change my company

155
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:08,660
because I want to go from Intel to

156
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:11,690
pentesting because I want to go from IR

157
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:16,280
to bread team heck because I just want

158
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:19,370
to move up one level why should I have

159
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:22,909
to completely switch my company I was

160
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:25,580
told like years ago when I was at a very

161
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,720
nice company I'd been there five years I

162
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,099
was like you know I think I'm ready to

163
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,260
move into management I did management in

164
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,880
the military I really like this company

165
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:34,010
I believe in it I want to be the next

166
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:37,430
wave that helps people and I was told oh

167
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:41,630
that's cute go somewhere else for a few

168
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:42,979
years and come back go somewhere else if

169
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:46,909
I leave this door you're not getting me

170
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:49,310
back and I've run into the same people

171
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:52,669
later on oh my god you did amazing

172
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:54,160
things you ready to come back no you

173
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:56,090
didn't believe in me five years ago

174
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,150
you're gonna believe in me in another

175
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:03,440
five years what about a year from now

176
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:08,330
and I bring you this weird crazy idea

177
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:11,469
you don't believe in me then no why do

178
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:16,400
we accept this as just the normal in

179
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:18,590
this community but then we have the

180
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,460
other realm of it right huyn here has

181
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:24,020
been doing it for 20 plus years how

182
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,669
those people have been doing it how many

183
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,190
of you are been doing the same thing

184
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:31,060
same job area same

185
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:34,690
whatever right because you know right

186
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:36,280
this the curse of the experts I don't

187
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,200
need to be a management I'm gonna be an

188
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,659
individual contributor and it's great

189
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,270
you are but then you do it for five

190
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:45,760
maybe ten years you get stuck

191
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:49,030
now you're regulated to a legacy system

192
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,620
oh we can't move you you're the only

193
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:53,550
person that understands this technology

194
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:58,540
because the company changed around you

195
00:08:53,550 --> 00:09:01,750
but you can see that path ends it ends

196
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:05,140
for you everyone can see that and you

197
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:07,210
try so hard and yes you have a long

198
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,430
career and yes you're an expert in that

199
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:12,850
technology and you probably are amazing

200
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:14,680
at your job but the rest of your company

201
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:18,760
isn't gonna lift you up they're not

202
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:22,599
gonna change for you so now we have this

203
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:26,860
weird amalgamation where either you have

204
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:30,130
to change every couple years or you get

205
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:36,700
stuck there are things that you can do

206
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:37,900
better so what can you do right so I'm

207
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,430
not just this sit up here and be like

208
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:43,270
everything's broken

209
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:45,310
good luck oh my god I hate those socks

210
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:47,380
I'm like you're right everything's

211
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:49,660
broken I don't like it either

212
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:52,689
let's revolt and then they're like okay

213
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,890
thanks for your time if you have any

214
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,930
questions let me know I'm like cool

215
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:56,920
winds with winter we gonna revolt what

216
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:59,229
are we gonna change he's like ah nah

217
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:04,030
that's someone else's talking like no

218
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:06,910
fucking you do right opportunities we

219
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:09,339
teach people in college from the very

220
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:11,650
beginning what we tell people when they

221
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:15,420
ask us we tell them all opportunities

222
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:17,770
like 70% your tech skills and 30% luck

223
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:21,370
like just get those tech skills up and

224
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:22,510
those opportunities will come but that's

225
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,330
not how the world works

226
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:27,970
that's how jobs work that's how any

227
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:33,250
industry works it's definitely not how

228
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:36,180
ours works but we lied to each other we

229
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:40,170
say you don't need to have soft skills

230
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,170
you don't even know how to network

231
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:46,110
your tech skills up become an expert at

232
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,240
that system thing your opportunities

233
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:51,149
will fall into place

234
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:54,750
that's how the world works effectively

235
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:58,680
equal parts and we're really really

236
00:10:54,750 --> 00:11:00,810
great at that right half we're really

237
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,510
great assuming our luck will come and

238
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:05,640
our tech skills will be good enough but

239
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:09,720
man are we bad at the people that we

240
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:11,930
know or out our soft skills it's not our

241
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,430
fault everyone's heard the joke right

242
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,969
giving to tech you won't have to talk to

243
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:18,779
people

244
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:20,600
oh you're introverted that's cool just

245
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:24,000
give in to tech you won't ever have to

246
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:27,839
meet anyone new or give the talks or

247
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:31,470
communicates technology is full some of

248
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,990
the biggest communicators but we don't

249
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:37,050
teach it and those of us that are good

250
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:38,220
at it the ones that you've watched for

251
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,500
the last day the ones you're gonna watch

252
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,209
today the ones that got the courage to

253
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,029
stand up on stage and tell you the

254
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:46,579
amazing things that they know those

255
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:50,160
people weren't taught hard to do that

256
00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:52,949
they struggled they struggle with

257
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,110
anxiety you can't see it I'm literally

258
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:57,029
shaking up here on the stage you get

259
00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:01,560
here to my voice you might be able to

260
00:11:57,029 --> 00:12:03,500
see my sweat soon but you can't tell

261
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:07,170
that this gives me anxiety

262
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,880
because I was talked and I took those

263
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:11,670
opportunities but I didn't come from

264
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:15,959
tech industry I came from a different

265
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:18,149
industry I'm so proud to have served in

266
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:19,859
the military but when the best parts

267
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:22,380
about what I did in the military was

268
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,820
that they forced me to stand in front of

269
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,010
people that they were like oh they're

270
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:28,800
like seven ranks above you and if you

271
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:31,680
even mumble and um they're gonna be so

272
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,839
mad at you like not the best way to

273
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,420
learn hope you give a speech in front of

274
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,630
people but definitely training that I've

275
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:45,750
used along the way the opportunity here

276
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:49,380
I didn't apply to be a keynote this was

277
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:52,589
an opportunity back in May for the city

278
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:53,329
I don't know a drop in pink nightmare

279
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:55,790
who run this

280
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:58,638
Chris and Jamie he's worked with Crist

281
00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:00,498
and he moved but in May I was in the

282
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,179
state that he moved to visit my in-laws

283
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:04,149
and I was like I haven't seen you guys

284
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:06,559
in months can we go out and have dinner

285
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:08,269
throughout the dinner and I was like oh

286
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:10,160
I think I'm gonna apply to give a talk

287

291
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:21,679

00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:45,469
yes when someone asks you that and then

302
00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:50,779
before I could change my mighty tweeted

303
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:52,970
it which is lovely and how I know some

304
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:55,999
of you are following my Twitter now I'm

305
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:58,730
sorry anything on there is like swag

306
00:13:55,999 --> 00:14:00,649
from conferences and discussions of me

307
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:04,489
being a basic white girl with some

308
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:10,850
pumpkin spice lattes and ugg boots but

309
00:14:04,489 --> 00:14:14,029
go right ahead follow it if you must but

310
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:15,290
we gotta get better at communicating so

311
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:19,339
maybe you don't give up and get

312
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:22,399
presentations but can you tell someone

313
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:24,529
what your job is do you have the skill

314
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,709
set to speak about the technical things

315
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:31,519
that you do at any level it's a unique

316
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:33,529
skill to take a very technical concept

317
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,779
and break it down into under two minutes

318
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:38,529
and be able to tell somebody that has

319
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:40,779
never seen it before never heard of it

320
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:44,989
what you do

321
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:47,569
do you use Twitter I mean our community

322
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:49,660
thrives on Twitter even Dave said it

323
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:52,160
that's where we get the best Intel from

324
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:55,009
if you want to save communication on

325
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,199
Twitter are you confident and what

326
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:58,819
you're sending how about emails what

327
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,529
company doesn't use emails is there

328
00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:01,180
literally any

329
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:06,430
here that doesn't send you an email on

330
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:08,410
behalf of the job yeah exactly you know

331
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:10,839
the form of communication and yet we

332
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:13,839
don't teach people when they start out

333
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:17,019
how to properly communicate and I'm sure

334
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:19,480
people have had that issue where you're

335
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:20,680
a manager or you've run a team and

336
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,759
something comes back across your desk

337
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,170
here we through the email chain you're

338
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:25,779
like oh my god why would they say it

339
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:27,939
this way like I deal with pen testers

340
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:29,740
who give findings to teens that don't

341
00:15:27,939 --> 00:15:32,079
understand what a vulnerability is are a

342
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,879
pen test or finding and have to give

343
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,498
remediation and re-throw don't be like

344
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:38,079
oh you should have stopped emailing like

345
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:39,309
17 emails ago it just got a call they

346
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,459
obviously have no idea what you're

347
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:45,990
talking about

348
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:50,138
but not one of the 20 people on my team

349
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:54,309
we're taught how to properly convey the

350
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:56,019
ideas in written format so how am I to

351
00:15:54,309 --> 00:16:00,339
get mad at somebody that was never

352
00:15:56,019 --> 00:16:02,910
taught why don't we take the time to do

353
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:05,050
this is it because we know we can do it

354
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:09,790
but just because I can do it doesn't

355
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:13,449
mean you can do it so scale strains the

356
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:16,089
real thing so your company is and pay

357
00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:17,189
for it cool YouTube's a thing you can

358
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:18,339
google it there are free books

359
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:23,290
presentations

360
00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:27,550
I mean Adrian and his team give these

361
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:30,069
presentations out for free online just

362
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:32,920
go study them see the mannerisms of the

363
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:35,860
people that captured your your thought

364
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:40,079
process the people that rendered you

365
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:43,439
speechless for an hour how did they talk

366
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:46,290
how they engaged their audience

367
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:50,439
these are easy things that you can do

368
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:52,740
but no one tells anybody not too long

369
00:16:50,439 --> 00:16:55,899
ago I worked at a career demo on a booth

370
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:57,730
that was for Auto conferences or

371
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:59,889
something like that and I just tweeted

372
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:01,779
out I'm not followed by that many people

373
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:04,179
I don't know that many people but I was

374
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:08,589
like hey if you give presentations what

375
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:12,050
would you give as advice and that thread

376
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:14,569
was like seven hundred responses long

377
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:16,690
everyone wants to help why isn't

378
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:21,200
everyone helping right away

379
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:22,970
you know I I think my background is

380
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:26,060
unique because some of the skills that I

381
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:27,610
have came from weird places right I'm

382
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:30,129
really good at social engineering I

383
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:35,469
convince people of all sorts of things

384
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:37,580
but I didn't learn it in InfoSec right I

385
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:40,070
went through survival training in the

386
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:41,889
military and Parsifal training is like

387
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:47,240
can you talk somebody out of killing you

388
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:48,830
and I was like well let's try it's very

389
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,420
intense

390
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,889
and we're the ones else like oh man

391
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,540
they're just gonna they're gonna kill me

392
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:55,520
tomorrow I just run my mouth too much

393
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,620
you'll be fine

394
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,090
like once I convince somebody as a

395
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,500
hostage like you don't need to kill me

396
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:05,720
give me somebody to give me a job

397
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:07,610
becomes immensely easier right so people

398
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,140
always like all your skills are so good

399
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:12,260
I was like yeah but you don't want to

400
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:14,690
learn the way I did I mean don't get me

401
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:16,070
wrong very grateful for the survival

402
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:20,030
training I had I would not recommend

403
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:21,919
that to anybody it's horrible so invest

404
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:24,440
in yourself invest in that training for

405
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,820
yourself right and once you get better

406
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,330
at communicating you get better at

407
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:30,889
network e-o but networking that's

408
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,810
already into the scary part right I can

409
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:34,190
send an email I can send a tweet but you

410
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:36,320
want me to meet a human face to face

411
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:38,270
well no thank you

412
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,470
and that's because in our mind like if

413
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:41,960
you close your my right now you can

414
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:43,640
imagine networking you're imagining the

415
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,070
same thing that everyone is right

416
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,350
big roundtables everyone in suits you

417
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:49,610
turning to the person besides you give

418
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:52,879
you them your business card shaking

419
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:57,340
their hand maybe telling each other your

420
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:59,420
jobs no actual contents let's try it I

421
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:01,970
want everyone to meet the person in

422
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:06,130
front of or beside them oh I'm not

423
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:06,130
joking go right ahead I will wait

424
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:26,480
all right

425
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,480
all right

426
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:31,850
we're done

427
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:37,928
it's cool I will talk over y'all there's

428
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:41,830
a reason why I wasn't afraid to put this

429
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:42,820
in here all right you guys think it's

430
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,320
gonna be funny that you're just gonna

431
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:46,510
rabble rabble rabble for the next like

432
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,529
half an hour when I saw oh good I will

433
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:52,629
talk over you but do you realize that

434
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:54,279
awkwardness that first initial like two

435
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:57,070
seconds where you're like oh shit she

436
00:19:54,279 --> 00:20:00,370
really gonna make me meet somebody that

437
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:02,649
never goes away I'm gonna tell you right

438
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:04,989
now I am an enthusiastic person

439
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:08,440
naturally bubbly I enjoy meeting new

440
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:12,640
people and it still sucks to network it

441
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:14,590
sucks to know that I have to constantly

442
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,820
meet new people if I want to advance my

443
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:19,529
career it's not that it gets less

444
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,689
awkward

445
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:27,549
you just find new coping mechanisms and

446
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:30,279
the best part is were in InfoSec which

447
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:33,158
means we have a non-traditional way of

448
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:36,909
networking right you're you're here at a

449
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:38,289
conference there's opportunities all of

450
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:42,130
your aesthetics is something you didn't

451
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:44,529
know but until I made that joke you

452
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:46,270
didn't meet them I know some of you guys

453
00:20:44,529 --> 00:20:47,950
have been in here for at least 15

454
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,330
minutes before this talk started and you

455
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,789
were on your phones and not saying

456
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:54,158
anything to a person sitting next to you

457
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:55,929
that's a lost opportunity I was recently

458
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,610
at Derby con and the weird part about

459
00:20:55,929 --> 00:21:01,899
there because there's all these lines

460
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:04,600
that you never know what they go to but

461
00:21:01,899 --> 00:21:06,850
long time ago if you see a line you just

462
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,760
stand in it it's probably gonna be

463
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:12,219
something good at the end right all

464
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,320
right so just standing in line my name

465
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:16,149
my own business eventually got like root

466
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,970
beer floats and the fake badge was cool

467
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:20,529
but behind me in line there's this guy

468
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:22,120
so I call it's my first derby car I was

469
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:26,919
like cool mine too first and last with

470
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:28,418
him like sure what what do you do

471
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:31,330
he's like well I really want to get into

472
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:32,380
IR it's like oh okay cool well what have

473
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:34,360
we done so far it's like I don't know

474
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,950
where to start just so happens my friend

475
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,809
Casey who also sucks at networking was

476
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:41,140
in line with me I was like well have you

477
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:44,230
met Casey Casey's not working and irmi

478
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:44,780
company for 3 years we got to talk in

479
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:48,010
they

480
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:53,210
information he on some example books I

481
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:54,680
have so many stories like that for the

482
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:56,840
closing ceremonies at Derby con there's

483
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,670
a really long line to get in but there's

484
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,409
also these weird breaks where you know

485
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:01,160
fire hazards so people have to not stand

486
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:03,590
from the door

487
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,190
I was like I'm not messing in the back

488
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:06,020
of line

489
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:09,830
so just kept walking like anywhere I was

490
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:10,910
going that's the last part so the very

491
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:13,129
first part of the line with the door

492
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:15,590
there happen to be like this much space

493
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:18,830
at the end of that line I walked up to

494
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:20,419
the group of guys there six of them now

495

496
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,000

00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,990

500
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,710

501
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:32,210

like cool now our friends I'm staying

503
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:37,310
here look we're friends and it was a

504
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,629
joke and like I understand that makes me

505
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,710
a bad person we're cutting in line but

506
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:44,690
it like get better it's just social

507
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:46,160
engineering I think it's talking to them

508
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:48,950
and just like to pass the time I'm like

509
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:52,310
cool what do you do it turns out they

510
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:54,260
are new to pentesting flu huzzah because

511
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:56,899
I am a manager who needs to hire pen

512
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:59,690
testers and while like some of them had

513
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:03,350
jobs because you know we have a deficit

514
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:04,700
and shortage a couple of days and I'm

515
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:07,189
actually interviewing that one of them

516
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,990
next week they didn't know they didn't

517
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:10,490
know me they didn't know that this

518
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:14,810
opportunity was walking up to them

519
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:16,910
neither did I and I understand that this

520
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:18,230
isn't everybody's comfort zone you're

521
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:22,910
not just gonna meet a stranger at a

522
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:25,580
conference but if you take just one one

523
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:27,980
little leap of faith you might actually

524
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:32,300
meet someone pretty cool and it just

525
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:36,350
starts by saying hi so hi everybody I'm

526
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:43,129
Rachel yes

527
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:45,080
a meeting is our thing but I haven't

528
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,160
always been and I like to give talks and

529
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,990
if anyone wants to come talk to me

530
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,250
afterwards I'm not gonna say no but if

531
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,870
you see me talking to two other people

532
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,070
and you stand in line that's weird just

533
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,629
come find me when no one else is around

534
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:55,129
me because I guarantee I'm not gonna

535
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,660
have people talking to me all day you

536
00:23:55,130 --> 00:24:00,920
know if I did I would still have time

537
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:06,530
for you that's an opportunity that you

538
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:10,280
all just had I maybe promise this

539
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:14,810
specific unicorn one to a little girl

540
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:16,879
that came today but I'm still wearing

541
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:19,629
crazy makeup and I'm a big woman and I

542
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:23,210
know that I stand out in the crowd

543
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:25,490
I'm also loud you will hear me laughing

544
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:28,880
because when I laugh a dumb dad jokes I

545
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:31,990
really laugh at them it will be easy

546
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:37,760
plus you all have my Twitter handle

547
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:41,420
reach out on Twitter right and that's

548
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:46,790
how you start you find your community so

549
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:49,540
InfoSec started maybe 30 40 years ago

550
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:52,129
there are amazing books about the starts

551
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:53,750
right cliff soul wrote a book called the

552
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:56,060
Cuckoo's egg about the very first

553
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:58,490
instant response case for anyone that

554
00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:02,450
hasn't read it as he's working at UC

555
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:04,790
Berkeley happened to have to track down

556
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:07,220
this weird like time management

557
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:11,270
accounting issue you know chasing a

558
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:13,700
thread actor all the way to Russia it's

559
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:15,710
a true story it's about technology but

560
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:19,580
it breeds like a spy novel it's amazing

561
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:21,380
right it's in the 70s for those that

562
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:23,570
haven't seen it there's a new novel out

563
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:25,520
called cult of the dead cow about one of

564
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:28,030
the first vulnerability disclosures ever

565
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:31,610
that ever happened because before then

566
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:33,410
no one took them seriously but they

567
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:36,740
realized that this was an important part

568
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:40,000
of our industry and they fought for it

569
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:42,910
and that was 20 years ago back then

570
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,320
InfoSec was a hobby

571
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:46,340
it wasn't even thought of as a job it's

572
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,189
just something they did in their spare

573
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:52,370
time to t know

574
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:55,490
how things work and eventually became a

575
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:57,860
community you got two three four five

576
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:01,100
fifteen of these people together and

577
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:05,240
they start sharing ideas they realize

578
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:08,419
that the same issues existed and now

579
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:11,030
we're in industry but we still refer to

580
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:14,510
as the community it's still set up that

581
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:17,389
way there are thousands of positions in

582
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:19,520
InfoSec the likelihood that straight out

583
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:21,290
of college your very first position is

584
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,300
going to be in the part of the industry

585
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,530
in the part of the community that you're

586
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:30,440
gonna stay in for the rest of your life

587
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:32,030
is pretty much non-existent so you look

588
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,620
at your hobbies you find something that

589
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:35,629
you kind of are interested in you find

590
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:37,040
the community they're out there there's

591
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:39,320
Lister starting with it is no a list

592
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:41,210
service this is like weird email chains

593
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,350
where like half the time you're trolling

594
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,550
each other because you all work at

595
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,659
different companies and the other half

596
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,899
the time you're actually getting stuff

597
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,820
done

598
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:49,580
they're amazing I highly recommend and

599
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:54,200
every single vertical has one you just

600
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:55,520
have to ask around they exist even gets

601
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,850
very specific right I work for a

602
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:01,129
retailer I did information security and

603
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:04,429
Intel for a retailer all the retailers

604
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:05,840
got together and don't let something

605
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:12,700
like you work at a different company

606
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:15,800
stop you right sharing your information

607
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:18,830
only makes the entirety of the internet

608
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:21,200
better I mean unless you're one of those

609
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:22,340
blackhat hackers and then I guess if you

610
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,490
want your information with me that's

611
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:28,570
fine but if you end up arrested like put

612
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:31,190
me in your memoirs I don't know right

613
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:33,740
for those of you that don't really like

614
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:36,470
Twitter there's LinkedIn groups there's

615
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:40,550
meetups I guarantee that someone's

616
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:43,160
talking about InfoSec in your city and

617
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:44,810
of course there's Twitter groups but

618
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,090
when I say stay high I don't mean like

619
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:48,149
slipping some ID ends like it's 4 a.m.

620

00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:40,290
stage that doesn't want to help people

641
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:42,140

specific about what you're asking I

643
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:47,400

Vogue I actually looked this up because

653
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:13,050
I was I thought it was weird and also I

654
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:15,030
would to tell a dumb story that nothing

655
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:19,710
to do with InfoSec much like this entire

656
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:22,110
presentation so the Vogue editor was

657
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:24,030
notorious for not listening to new

658
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:25,530
pitches or any of the editing meetings

659
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:27,540
and so the only way that you can get him

660
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:29,700
a new pitch idea was to trap him in an

661
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:31,139
elevator for the 45 seconds it took to

662
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:34,950
get from the ground floor to the Vogue

663
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:37,650
offices in New York City so all of his

664
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:39,570
writers we get together and they would

665
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:41,460
take turns like taking the elevator ride

666
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:43,620
and quickly explaining it worked into

667
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,970
this weird concept in business that if

668
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:46,320
you can tell me about yourself in two

669
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:50,040
minutes and I'm gonna give you a shot

670
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:53,909
and that's true but that doesn't work

671
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:55,590
for a community like it's cool if you

672
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:57,360
can tell me your background in two

673
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:59,580
minutes but if I told you all my jobs

674
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:03,379
does that tell you anything about what I

675
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:06,689
do it doesn't

676
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:08,610
your job our job titles and InfoSec are

677
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:10,170
ridiculous they're made up half the time

678
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:12,679
they never describe what you actually do

679
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:14,760
it's really hard to get that across

680
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:17,220
so you leave to learn to champion

681
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,510
yourself so thinking about it as like

682
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,220
I'm gonna give you my elevator pitch I'm

683
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:21,930
gonna tell you the top half of my resume

684
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,280
I'm gonna talk really fast you're gonna

685
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,700
really enjoy it and then you're give me

686
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:28,080
a job

687
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:29,430
tell me something cool okay so we're

688
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,570
taking another leap of faith does anyone

689
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:35,040
hear when I tell me something cool that

690
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:36,960
they're doing you have a minute come on

691
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:40,800
it's your shot everyone gets to hear

692
00:30:36,960 --> 00:31:11,670
something cool that you're doing go

693
00:30:40,800 --> 00:31:13,560
ahead okay for those a date here his

694
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:15,510
company helps make these giant domes

695
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,669
that cars use they're writing the

696
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:20,060
scripts that track the cameras within is

697
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:21,540
anybody think that that's kind of cool

698
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:24,870
yeah cool

699
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:28,710
find him afterwards talk to him about

700
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:30,750
this I have a unicorn horn for the

701
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:34,530
person that was brave enough to tell me

702
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:40,310
about themselves give it to a little

703
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:40,310
girl come on man keep unicorns to you

704
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:49,519
so if you were on the people that were

705
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:50,929
really really really upset I didn't have

706
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,409
enough for the audience that's the mercy

707
00:31:50,929 --> 00:31:55,850
you need a tackle to get it all right

708
00:31:53,409 --> 00:31:57,980
all right so how do you like to champion

709
00:31:55,850 --> 00:32:00,320
yourself right you can need the way to

710
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:03,830
speak with passion this is what wrecks

711
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:06,710
people together you need to speak from

712
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:09,080
an area of what you love to do this is

713
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:11,480
my fourth year here my fourth different

714
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:13,340
topic every year I get up here assuming

715
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,710
that no wants to hear me give my talk

716
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:17,209
about anything that I'm doing but I

717
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:20,600
really believe in the things I'm doing

718
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:23,960
and I know that that belief that passion

719
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:25,750
that drive comes out in my stalk and I

720
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:29,570
know that that's what makes me good at

721
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:31,759
presentations but that also also

722
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:34,428
attracts me to other people if I'm

723
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:36,019
sitting down having lunch at a table and

724
00:32:34,429 --> 00:32:37,399
you're just like yeah I kind of did this

725
00:32:36,019 --> 00:32:39,649
thing like you don't want to hear about

726
00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:41,899
it it's dumb like yeah right that sounds

727
00:32:39,649 --> 00:32:43,939
horrible I don't hear about that but

728
00:32:41,899 --> 00:32:45,469
someone's like you know it's not really

729
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:47,269
my job but I've been working on this one

730
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:49,460
really weird thing like the car hacking

731
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:51,860
guys there's will that use that usually

732
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:54,080
runs that and on Twitter he's been

733
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:57,100
talking about hacking into old telephone

734
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,799
systems and elevators so I film again

735
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:02,149
he's like oh how are you I was like well

736
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:04,700
what do you do in elevators this is

737
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:06,350
weird I've seen around Twitter when he

738
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:08,389
launched it's the most beautiful speech

739
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:12,259
about this like weird thing that he just

740
00:33:08,389 --> 00:33:14,809
does in his spare time and for everyone

741
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:17,929
wondering how you get hired that's how

742
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:21,049
you talk I hired for aptitude attitude

743
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:23,600
and willingness to learn I'll hire for

744
00:33:21,049 --> 00:33:26,389
that every time overtop of an amazing

745
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:29,149
resume because that's what I want on my

746
00:33:26,389 --> 00:33:31,820
team and anybody that that hires they

747
00:33:29,149 --> 00:33:34,539
know what to write yes you have it

748
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:36,950
aptitude for the things that we're doing

749
00:33:34,539 --> 00:33:38,389
but we wouldn't be here if we didn't

750
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:41,509
have some sort of aptitude towards

751
00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:46,070
technology or information security it

752
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:47,629
doesn't have to be technical so I used

753
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:51,590
to tell people that I wasn't technical

754
00:33:47,629 --> 00:33:55,369
because I came from an Intel but after

755
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:56,418
like my third technical training my boss

756
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:58,139
is something I wasn't told people that

757
00:33:56,419 --> 00:33:59,520
anymore you

758
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,020
as I still don't see myself as

759
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,870
technically focused because that wasn't

760
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:06,870
my background and there's so many people

761
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:08,250
here that feel the same way but you have

762
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:12,409
an aptitude otherwise you want to be

763
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:17,310
there you wouldn't have applied your

764
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:19,109
attitude are you passionate do I believe

765
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:22,259
you really do want to do this job you

766
00:34:19,109 --> 00:34:26,040
have a willingness to learn you know

767
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:28,200
that Unicorn job description that no one

768
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:30,869
can achieve because you have to both

769
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:33,989
have a PhD in 25 years of experience but

770
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:38,280
it's an entry-level job yeah I don't

771
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:42,928
exist you just have to have a

772
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:45,389
willingness to learn I have a lead which

773
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:47,240
is like a highest level opening and yeah

774
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:49,590
I've met with people that are new

775
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:55,168
because I would do great like I would

776
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:57,300
downgrade a position for somebody that

777
00:34:55,168 --> 00:35:00,299
shows me that they really want to work

778
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,950
for me they went above and beyond maybe

779
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,570
it's not the current area of focus but

780
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:07,339
they went out and they studied and they

781
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:07,340
found that they actually want to do this

782
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:13,379
so if you really want to do something in

783
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:14,940
your career take that leap of faith and

784
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:19,020
apply for the job because if you can

785
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:22,280
speak with passion about that topic you

786
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:24,960
you're gonna get those opportunities I

787
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:27,540
my resume did not call me and find me

788
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,040
for any job that I applied for outside

789
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,930
the military but when I was on a phone

790
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,580
call with those interviewers I spoke

791
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:38,460
with passionate about the idea of

792
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:40,109
learning this new thing right I had some

793
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:42,780
background that could like kind of fit

794
00:35:40,109 --> 00:35:44,819
it's like I wanted to really show that

795
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:46,140
like round peg into like a triangle hole

796
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:51,450
because it wasn't square it wasn't like

797
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:54,868
kind of going in you know but but they

798
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:58,169
took a chance on me because I wanted to

799
00:35:54,869 --> 00:35:59,300
do it that's how you get people that'll

800
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:02,250
take chances on you

801
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:05,220
right but training is also key to

802
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:06,930
development we all know this it's a sore

803
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:08,339
topic I can't tell you how many times I

804
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:09,759
have a discussions about like man I

805
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:12,600
really want to do this one

806
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:16,270
my company will not pay for my training

807
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:18,960
it's like that's true but did you look

808
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:25,440
into any of the free training out there

809
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:25,440
exist there's conferences that are free

810
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:32,350
you can always download the

811
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:34,150

815
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:44,560
and when you find somebody that you want

816
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,180
to talk to you're like man I don't have

817
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,460
the opportunity to network with them

818
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:52,330
face to face just remember Twitter

819
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:53,830
exists email exists everyone puts some

820
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:56,080
way of contacting them on their slides

821
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:56,980
because we're all super narcissistic we

822
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,790
want to talk about the things that we

823
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:03,040
are saying now we're talking about right

824
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:05,980
just find your resource mean figure out

825
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:09,790
your community figure out how they

826
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:12,010
communicate right guys are pen testing I

827
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:14,290
was used to Intel working everything on

828
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:16,060
the list serves found out people just

829
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:20,200
put stuff in like weird github lists out

830
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:23,790
there like okay cool also this is weird

831
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:26,680
but I guess that's how I live now so I

832
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:28,270
pull down these github repositories

833
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,250
where it's literally just less linking

834
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:31,980
back out to other things I should never

835
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:37,590
have been on github in the first place

836
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:40,030
Twitter exists I mean Google it like I

837
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:41,560
feel like every time someone tells me

838
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:43,360
that training so hard like yes it is

839
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,890
Harding yes there are industry standard

840
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,870
trainees out there and yes those

841
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:50,830
certifications in those sans courses

842
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:52,450
those do help you but if you're really

843
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:56,650
passionate about what you do there are

844
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:58,450
other ways to gain your knowledge there

845
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:00,640
are other ways that maybe you don't have

846
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:02,620
the certification that the person going

847
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,000
against the job interview with you has

848
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:05,230
but you know what they're not going to

849
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,090
speak as passionately about something

850
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:08,650
that they just learned in a sans course

851
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:10,780
they you're gonna be able to speak to

852
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:12,640
because you spent two years pulling and

853
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:14,560
scraping and finding all these amazing

854
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:19,900
opportunities that you can get for

855
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:21,990
yourself at your company it exists and

856
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:25,950
if you don't know where to find it

857
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:27,118
ask everybody in this community is more

858
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:31,220
than willing to help that's why we still

859
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:33,360
call it a community we've rarely ever

860
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:34,980
wanted to say that it's an InfoSec

861
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,590
industry unless we're really trying to

862
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:40,290
hire people more like remember we pay

863
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:44,030
you know we call it a community because

864
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:46,050
we want people to feel like they belong

865
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:50,940
we want people to feel like they could

866
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:53,730
just ask and have it answered that's not

867
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:55,500
just us right say if you're thinking

868
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:58,830
like Oh that'd be great but you know who

869
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:01,050
really needs to hear this my sister and

870
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:02,430
you know what there are things that we

871
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:03,000
as people in charge could be doing

872
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:06,060
better too

873
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:09,570
we don't admit it but like honestly

874
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:11,549
we're just letting people flounder and I

875
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:13,170
realize I'm just a manager standing up

876
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:15,420
here probably talking to people that are

877
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:17,240
way above my level and way above my

878
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:20,060
layers of experience but you know what

879
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:23,490
if I don't stand up here and tell you

880
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:25,320
this industry will never change it won't

881
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:27,720
feel like a community will still have

882
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:31,410
job turnovers will still have anger and

883
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:33,270
resentment and it's so small when I

884
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:36,770
became a manager I promised myself that

885
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:39,770
I was gonna do everything in my power to

886
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:41,940
help those that I was in charge of

887
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:45,540
because we need to change our mindsets

888
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:47,580
right we need to stop thinking that I

889
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:51,480
only care about you for the two to four

890
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:54,390
years that you were on my team this is a

891
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,320
small community and if I plan on being

892
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:56,879
here for 20 years

893
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,490
I'm more than likely to run into those

894
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,840
same people again and five years from

895
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:03,868
now when they figured it out for

896
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:05,550
themselves and they realized that there

897
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:07,109
are ways to get what they want don't

898
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,940
want them to look back and see me as

899
00:40:07,109 --> 00:40:12,600
somebody that helped them think about

900
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:16,160
long-term career growth or just that

901
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:23,670
boss that refused to let me go training

902
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:25,350
it's small yes it's growing but we have

903
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:27,450
to stop thinking about how do we get new

904
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:31,140
people in and start taking care of the

905
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:33,930
people we have I was at a major

906
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:36,900
conference last year and on

907
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:39,029
stage does a woman's focus conference

908
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:42,359
but on stage there were women from all

909
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:44,369
these top companies talking for an hour

910
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:46,170
plus about all these amazing programs

911
00:40:44,369 --> 00:40:49,800
they're doing to bring more diverse

912
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:53,270
talent into the industry and yes it was

913
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:56,640
amazing by step and asked one question

914
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:59,670
you have amazing programs to bring

915
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:03,118
people in from college what programs you

916
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:05,520
guys offered to keep talent how are you

917
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,010
fixing your attention rates the answer I

918
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:12,780
got was that's hrs problem no that's

919
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:14,099
your problem it is so many things have

920
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,200
shown that people are more than willing

921
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:18,540
to stay in a job that provides less

922
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,980
money as long as they're with the bosses

923
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:23,819
they feel like cares about them and

924
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:25,859
really wants to see them succeed it has

925
00:41:23,819 --> 00:41:27,690
been proven people are more than willing

926
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:29,279
to kind of stay in that job frame as

927
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:30,900
long as there's someone there that cares

928
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,069
about them because it's so rare to find

929
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:35,250
that and I think it's even rare to find

930
00:41:32,069 --> 00:41:37,740
it within the InfoSec community and it's

931
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:39,559
sad because we have this mentality like

932
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:42,419
I had to struggle to get to where I am

933
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:43,619
why should I you know turn back and lend

934
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:45,150
a hand to those people they should

935
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:46,799
struggle to get here to that's what

936
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:51,420
builds character that's what gives

937
00:41:46,799 --> 00:41:55,410
people experience no that's why we have

938
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:57,720
turnover rates you helping somebody does

939
00:41:55,410 --> 00:42:03,660
not degrade your experience or the

940
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:06,049
struggles that you went through Thank

941
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,049
You Molly

942
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:12,140
so how do you champion career growth

943
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:14,930
right I'm at a company they give me no

944
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:17,839
money for training they give me no time

945
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:21,980
to set up any programs I have nothing to

946
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:24,050
offer my team how how can I possibly do

947
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:25,490
this honestly when your team members

948
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:28,010
come to you and say like hey how am i

949
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:29,899
doing if your response to feedback or

950
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:32,570
development is you're doing great keep

951
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:35,030
doing what you're doing that's offering

952
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:38,030
them nothing they may be a power

953
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:40,340
performer for you they may be everything

954
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:42,710
that you want but they wouldn't ask but

955
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:48,890
they could be doing better if they

956
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:52,580
needed guidance so just provide it for

957
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:55,759
them even if it's just well how do you

958
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:59,660
feel you're it's going are you getting

959
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:01,369
challenged how do you feel your programs

960
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:03,470
going where do you want to see it in the

961
00:43:01,369 --> 00:43:06,080
next year what would you like to be

962
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:07,279
doing the guarantee if you started that

963
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,619
conversation you're going to be

964
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,240
surprised by what you did because if you

965
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:13,760
haven't had those conversations then

966
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:15,020
you're missing you're missing the person

967
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,280
that's been looking at other job

968
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,630
opportunities because they want to

969
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:20,530
change and they feel like you're never

970
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:23,359
gonna give them the opportunity to grow

971
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:24,800
and yes it might suck that they're not

972
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,299
gonna stay on your team but wouldn't it

973
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,010
be better to keep that power performer

974
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:31,460
in your company even if it's not on your

975
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:37,070
team we talked about changing from like

976
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:39,050
IR it's a red team if your IR team loves

977
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:44,240
your it's a response team loves this

978
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:47,930
employee won't they add value to your

979
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:49,368
red team why is it better to send them

980
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:54,379
external than to keep them in the

981
00:43:49,369 --> 00:43:56,690
company so what can you do right you

982
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:59,960
can't force people to allow your team

983
00:43:56,690 --> 00:44:00,890
member to allow your employee to train

984
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:03,770
with them but you know what you can do

985
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:08,480
you can open up your team it starts with

986
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:10,280
one target has a reputation for allowing

987
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,660
like shadowing and cross-training and

988
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,300
stuff like that but when I started they

989
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:17,500
they didn't do it

990
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:19,630
it took years and one team to start and

991
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,920
what a shadow may look like two hours

992
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:22,000
lighting someone sit with your team for

993
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:24,160
two hours to learn what they want to do

994
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,750
I get asked all the time internally

995
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,390
externally like hey I think I want to do

996
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:31,630
penetration testing I'm like cool have

997
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:33,100
you ever seen a penetration test have

998
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:34,390
you sat with a team that's actually

999
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:36,940
doing it are you sure this is what you

1000
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:38,830
want to do because yes being a hacker is

1001
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:41,560
cool but like compliance is a real thing

1002
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:43,240
and you're not hacking into NSA you're

1003
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,740
looking at a web application for the

1004
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,240
tenth year in a row because we have to

1005
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:48,850
check a box for Sox compliance like

1006
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,529
these things are equal and well yes you

1007
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:53,200
do have amazing opportunities but with

1008
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:54,490
70% of your time is spent doing the same

1009
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,480
things over and over and over again I

1010
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:59,310
want to make sure that you're passionate

1011
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:01,570
about this job so come sit with my team

1012
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:02,650
maybe you can only give up two hours of

1013
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:03,550
your time but if you're willing to give

1014
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:07,120
up two hours for me

1015
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:09,820
my team's willing to teach you that's

1016
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:11,350
how you have to structure your team if

1017
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:14,470
someone is willing to give up their time

1018
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:17,680
to learn from you be willing to teach

1019
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:19,990
them cross-training is a thing too right

1020
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,890
not everyone gets to do it but if you

1021
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:22,899
have someone that's actually passionate

1022
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:24,759
let them sit with them for a month let

1023
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:29,380
them cross me and internally let them

1024
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:30,970
have that chance at that internal job we

1025
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:33,580
shouldn't have to constantly send people

1026
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:36,069
externally it doesn't mean they're gonna

1027
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:37,810
leave you know that weird job that they

1028
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:39,940
had that was like IR and detection and

1029
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:41,830
Intel I was doing phishing analysis for

1030
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:44,530
my company and I noticed that every time

1031
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:47,170
I had an external information come in I

1032
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:49,840
would do all of this analysis on I would

1033
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:52,150
hand it off to our IR team and because I

1034
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:53,920
didn't always know the analysts they

1035
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:56,800
would be duplicating work and when I'd

1036
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:59,950
get the case back to look at it some of

1037
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:02,650
it was not there so I said you know wait

1038
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:04,390
I'm gonna sit with IR for a month and I

1039
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:07,150
got trained I used our system so now

1040
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:09,279
when that month was over I went back to

1041
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:11,650
my team and I got the external Intel and

1042
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,320
I did all the research I worked the case

1043
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:16,450
and closed the case I did all of our

1044
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:19,380
response work and then I worked with

1045
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:22,810
detection and I wrote the detection

1046
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:26,050
because if I'm gonna do all the work I

1047
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:26,460
want to make sure that I was able to see

1048
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:30,060
the whole

1049
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:31,349
process and the entirety of the

1050
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:33,000
management that allowed me to do that

1051
00:46:31,349 --> 00:46:37,130
how to take a leap of faith that was it

1052
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:39,599
like just doing it to leave a day later

1053
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:42,390
even if the person that you give the

1054
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:45,510
opportunity to does leave it should make

1055
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:46,830
you feel good to know that you helped

1056
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:50,609
them on the journey that's going to give

1057
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:53,160
them long term career success if that

1058
00:46:50,609 --> 00:46:54,890
success isn't with you it's okay we have

1059
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,970
to stop looking at it as a failure

1060
00:46:54,890 --> 00:47:00,299
retention issues are always gonna be

1061
00:46:56,970 --> 00:47:01,980
here thousands of jobs hundreds of

1062
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:05,430
thousands of openings and that number is

1063
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:07,500
growing we can't fill them all but you

1064
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:08,940
know what you can do make it memorable

1065
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:13,680
that you were the person that helped

1066
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:16,410
them on their career path mentoring all

1067
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,669
right these are things that you should

1068
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:20,629
do in your company but everyone thinks

1069
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:24,420
it's just a manager and a contributor

1070
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:26,040
set people up for developments if the

1071
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:29,040
person that you're talking to needs help

1072
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:29,970
with communication skills think about

1073
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,349
the people that you know that

1074
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:34,459
communicate well and set them up there

1075
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:38,300
it doesn't matter what the levels are

1076
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:41,070
start setting your mentoring Prairies up

1077
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:44,010
for your development and if you are well

1078
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:45,750
as people that have to be a mentor pick

1079
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:46,310
your mentee before it gets assigned to

1080
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:49,770
you

1081
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:51,330
these are easy right if you who are here

1082
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:52,830
and you're a lead or you're at the top

1083
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:55,109
of your game or your subject matter

1084
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:58,740
expert you're going to be a mentor

1085
00:47:55,109 --> 00:48:00,480
that's how that's how company see you so

1086
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:02,330
you pick your mentee it's really easy

1087
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,440
I'm gonna give you as a secret you ready

1088
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:05,700
find somebody who a trust is your

1089
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:08,330
project because the whole reason why you

1090
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:12,930
need a mentee is so that you can move on

1091
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:15,180
if you created a process a project a

1092
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:16,799
program and it's running beautifully at

1093
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:19,740
your company your company wants you to

1094
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:21,810
do that again but you can't if you're

1095
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:23,250
constantly worried about holding on so

1096
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:24,660
tightly to that thing because you don't

1097
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:28,400
know who you're gonna trust with it find

1098
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:30,868
the person to trust yourself find them

1099
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:34,470

1100
00:48:30,869 --> 00:48:38,250
passion aptitude attitude willingness to

1101
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:39,390

something cool if you come up to me

1107
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,240
today you don't start by telling me

1108
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:57,779

penetration testing for a year and I

1116
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:14,910
don't have a background penetration

1117
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:16,950
testing but I still have to have these

1118
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:19,109
conversations on a regular basis and

1119
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:20,250

same area much why don't we you know get

1129

00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:09,240
be the next anybody in information

1139
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:12,330
security because I want you to be the

1140
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:13,740
first you I don't like I saw this person

1141
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:16,110
talking on stage about this amazing

1142
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:19,859
opportunity and now you know everybody

1143
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:21,420
in the industry knows about them because

1144
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:24,120
you're all unicorns that we should be

1145
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:28,700
embracing that because it's not bad that

1146
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:28,700
your background has 20 different things

1147
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:33,660
it's what makes our whole community

1148
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:35,490
unique and weird and definitely

1149
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:39,509
inappropriate at times and the reason

1150
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:41,609
why we all are here so if nothing else I

1151
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:44,780
hope you guys all go through the rest of

1152
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:44,780
your day thinking that your unicorn
