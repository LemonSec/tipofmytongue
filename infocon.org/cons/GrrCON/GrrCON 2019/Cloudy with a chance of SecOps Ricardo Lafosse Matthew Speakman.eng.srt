our own recognizance

29
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:56,180
I have one cat that's it and also I want

30
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,900
all of you to be extra nice and

exuberant

32
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:04,090
this is mr. Matt's first time ever

33
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,090
public speaking outside of work yeah

34
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:10,640
so I'm also make him do most of heavy

35
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:13,810
lifting all right real crate by

36
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:17,479
Morningstar we're a global company about

37
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,950
5,800 employees in 27 countries about a

38
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,780
billion revenue just kind of give

39
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:23,120
perspective that I'm not working a crazy

40
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:24,380
little vacuum with 20 employees that's

41
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,800
pretty much why I put that there

42
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:30,710
why are we here why do we care

43
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,900
this I've been to a lot cloud talks as

44
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:35,239
many of you have been as well allow more

45
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,429
bland repetitive cloud talks and watch

46
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,460
you guys call us bland repetitive as

47
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,930
well which might and that's fine we have

48
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,789
a lot of boots on ground experience we

49
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:47,480
did a giant cloud transformation about

50
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:49,310
two years ago to re-platform most of our

51
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,160
applications by most I mean 30 percent

52
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:54,200
of our applications to be cloud first so

53
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,410
we have a lot of horrible war stories

54
00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:00,020
behind that security education is isn't

55
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:01,940
everything you can bitch and moan until

56
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,469
people take the training cloud this

57
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,200
cloud that but unless you have

58
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:08,240
actionable controls it's really hard to

59
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,750
grab that adoption and in actionable

60
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,830
takeaways I know no wrong button sorry

61
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,350
all right

62
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:18,320
why do you care sec UPS is live in

63
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:20,090
dumpster fires any given time no matter

64
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,909
what you have this beautiful project

65
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:24,919
plan nope you and the whole cloud will

66
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:27,290
eventually be your problem even if it

67
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:30,590
isn't currently I came from DHS where

68
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:33,080
everything's mainframe yes the cloud was

69
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,710
there in small small instances so we're

70
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,080
getting there

71
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:37,549
you came from the Lord yes I do have

72
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,260
them alert with me because some of you

73
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:41,720
may have come from the Lord it's in my

74
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:45,530
bookbag and I also took one of those

75
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,510
weird little cups from the hotel where

76
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:49,250
you put the waffle mix in so I have

77
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:52,969
waffle mix cups that you can put milord

78
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:54,919
in so I got you how many waffles worth

79
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,250
of weren't you drinking it's pretty

80
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:57,560
awesome

81
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,420
alright and we're here help I want this

82
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,280
to be very open if

83
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,050
we're talking about some stuff and you

84
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,219
don't want to wait ten just ready raise

85
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,780
your hand I'll come run down there and

86
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:08,720
you can ask your question so I want this

87
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,880
to be as interaction as possible all

88
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,890
right traditional setups motto I'm not

89
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,860
gonna spend too much time here all of

90
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:17,930
you know the flow you get your alerts go

91
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:21,080
monitoring you do your investigation

92
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:23,090
bla bla bla bla bla this pivots

93
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,570
significantly when you start moving your

94
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:29,450
processes to the cloud and I'm also a

95
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:32,750
big fan of Soundwave cuz he's awesome

96
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:35,180
but anyways we had to retool a lot of

97
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:38,360
our setups processes to be very cloud

98
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:41,930
first I don't know why did the on-prem

99
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,550
and cloudy icons Rumble should have

100
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,070
actually been there I got called out Rea

101
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:48,050
this morning about that but nonetheless

102
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:50,450
loss of visibility in control this is a

103
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,550
cultural change and also a way that you

104
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:55,159
need to retool a lot of your processes

105
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:58,820
using cloud trail is very similar to

106
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,670
using review and syslog files but you

107
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,849
need to learn how to do it differently

108
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,490
serverless

109
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:06,920
is a very big different change for a lot

110
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:09,680
of people when they're moving from print

111
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:12,140
to the cloud your traditional AV agents

112
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,020
are not there or we have DLP it's not

113
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:17,500
there it's quasi ephemeral so being able

114
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,909
to retool for service environments

115
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,410
eventually my first year here I was like

116
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,920
what am I going to have a lambda

117
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,750
function

118
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,820
I can't secure a lambda function and

119
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,860
then starting to learn how to put

120
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,860
controls and governance around lambda

121
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:34,040
functions it's really a key there and

122
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,870
dynamic by design the old-school ACLs

123
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:39,110
where its IP address IP address when you

124
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:41,810
change that from on-prem to account

125
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:43,520
instead of IP address is also a big

126
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,430
learning change specifically on the

127
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,520
networking team whether traditional

128
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:51,500
cider - cider or a host a host is a big

129
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,140
fundamental change that infrastructure

130
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,550
had to go through as well and

131
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:58,250
environmental controls are key outside

132
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:00,500
of your overall environment you need to

133
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:03,050
understand that working in the cloud has

134
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,120
a lot of miss configuration issues that

135
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,580
had caused significant interruptions to

136
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,680
your environment we know all the s3 open

137
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,659
buckets blah blah blah but that's now

138
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,280
part of your responsibility as well and

139
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,440
talking about response

140
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,320
bili working in the cloud is a shared

141
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,900
environment where you work with your

142
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,280
developers your own team and also

143
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:26,030
whatever your cloud provider and were

144
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,979
primarily AWS AWS has their own stack

145
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:29,869
that they take care of and you need to

146
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:33,159
learn how work interact Lee with them

147
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:35,659
specifically doing during IR engagements

148
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:38,750
all right a little bit about our

149
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:39,860
environment we have a crap-ton accounts

150
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:43,309
for no good reason

151
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,930
except AWS told us to do it this way in

152
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:46,880
actuality it helps reduce our blast

153
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:49,430
radius in case one of the accounts does

154
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,650
get popped there are all small enclaves

155
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:53,420
but that also is a pain yes from a

156
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:56,150
licensing perspective which my good

157
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,900
friend here Matt will talk about handful

158
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,480
of EPCs

159
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:01,730
eight regions crap ton of buckets blah

160
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,430
blah blah more importantly or AWS

161
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:07,550
organization we have a master account

162
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:09,199
and then there's a multiple accounts

163
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,640
right below that that's how we govern a

164
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:15,200
lot of our controls and monitoring

165
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,490
across organization and for those that

166
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,430
are not familiar with the shared

167
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:21,589
responsibility model the customer or

168
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:23,959
what we're responsible is in blue and

169
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:25,820
then Amazon takes care of the rest and

170
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,410
being able to understand where those

171
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,180
roles and responsibilities are clearly

172
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:31,520
defined specifically with your

173
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,439
infrastructure folks and also your

174
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,420
security operations folks is really key

175
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,150
we've been on many investigations where

176
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:39,229
oh I don't know what's going on

177
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:41,870
with the knackles

178
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:44,300
and it's a downstream issue on a VP C

179
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:46,040
and I don't know who will call an Amazon

180
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,750
that should never happen you should have

181
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,760
those rules of engagement ironed out and

182
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:55,100
talking about rules of engagement I'm

183
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:56,450
done talking everyone elaborating

184
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,990
further on that shared responsibility

185
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:02,089
model we kind of made our own little bit

186
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:04,700
of a shared responsibility model so in

187
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:06,800
the red here is kind of what we as a sec

188
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,680
ops as an infrastructure team kind of

189
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,709
take care of for our customers which are

190
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,540
now our developers so a lot of the

191
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:16,339
things that we control are like cloud

192
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,230
trail we make sure that's turned on we

193
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:20,180
make sure that it's running we have we

194
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:22,910
control all the VPC and networking the

195
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:26,000
firewall knackles we actually control

196
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:26,430
our ami there's very very very few a.m.

197
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,070
eyes

198
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:32,099
that are not some better not ours out

199
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:34,470
there we control a guard duty we control

200
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:38,640
access to the Amazon account through

201
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:40,860
federated access through a DFS and we we

202
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,439
give our developers two specific roles

203
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,820
that they can login as trying to kind of

204
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,890
model off of like lease privilege right

205
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,660
so we have an operator account and then

206
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:50,960
we have an admin or I'm sorry an

207
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,219
operator role in an admin level role

208
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,530
they kind of controlled the rests they

209
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,670
control all the blue they control they

210
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,140
can build up as many servers as they

211
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:01,860
want I can use as many lambdas as they

212
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:05,580
want there for now in charge of

213
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:09,180
encryption we are working on taking that

214
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:11,610
away from them hopefully and so I just

215
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,650
wanted to kind of show these are kind of

216
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:15,960
the things that we give all of our

217
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:18,000
Amazon accounts all 120 of our Amazon

218
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,590
accounts get these out the door so we

219
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,380
have our Morningstar base image which is

220
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:25,200
actually built monthly we use chef

221
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:27,439
packer and terraform to do that it's

222
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,680
shared to all accounts and all regions

223
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,240
on completion of that build developers

224
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,310
could actually subscribe to an SMS

225
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,960
notification which would actually tell

226
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,699
them hey the latest build is available

227
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,130
and if they're mature enough they could

228
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,330
actually hook into that process and have

229
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:45,210
a scheduled time where they could

230
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:47,340
actually build their application with

231
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:51,240
the new ami without really ever having

232
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:54,270
to do anything that image is has our

233
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,520
configuration tools built built in it

234
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:59,520
has its CIS hardened its patched and

235
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:02,310
it's not dependent on AWS generated keys

236
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:04,530
for authentication which means we don't

237
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:05,849
have to play where's the key anymore we

238
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:09,060
don't have to play which developer lost

239
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:11,250
the key for the networking we kind of

240
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:15,270
control the VP see the subnets and all

241
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:17,070
on Prem connectivity by default the

242
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:19,920
security features that we all enable is

243
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:22,740
we have cloud trail that goes in from

244
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:26,400
all of our team accounts that goes into

245
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:28,560
a central bucket inside of one of our

246
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,780
central accounts so every single

247
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,760
accounts cloud trail blogs going to ask

248
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:35,699
three bucket that we suck up and then we

249
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:38,460
do things with we have their VP C flow

250
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,769
logs we have guard duty logs we have

251
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:43,509
their base knackles

252
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:46,749
and we have again that federated login

253
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:49,220
on top of that we have some reactive

254
00:12:46,749 --> 00:12:51,019
infrastructure monitoring and alerts so

255
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,420
kind of that classic sock that Ricardo

256
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:54,649
was talking about so Oliver like I said

257
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,269
all of our team counts they have our

258
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:59,839
cloud trail goes into their centrally

259
00:12:56,269 --> 00:13:02,029
managed s3 those s3 vlogs or that s3

260
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,369
bucket pumps into Splunk and then those

261
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:06,439
that Splunk instance generates alerts

262
00:13:04,369 --> 00:13:09,649
that then go to our traditional sock to

263
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:10,998
you know manage so someone makes an ami

264
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:12,679
public we don't want that to happen

265
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:14,329
because like I said we have all these

266
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:15,709
things that are proprietary to us we

267
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:18,469
don't want that ami to be out in the

268
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:19,219
public so if we see that get made open

269
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,319
to the public

270
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,549
someone needs to get on the phone and

271
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:25,248
start calling some people make that

272
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:26,869
getaway if people turn off our cloud

273
00:13:25,249 --> 00:13:28,100
trail obviously we're then blind to the

274
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:29,989
account we don't know what's happening

275
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:33,649
so we need to make sure that that's

276
00:13:29,989 --> 00:13:35,389
happening blocked as well root logins we

277
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:39,199
actually take away our root account and

278
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:42,290
throw away the key so if that happens we

279
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,959
definitely want to know about it and

280
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:48,049
that's just I think like a number of the

281
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:50,508
reactive and kind of old-style alerts

282
00:13:48,049 --> 00:13:52,970
that we do but you know we don't really

283
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:54,769
care about that anymore like this this

284
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:57,470
is the cloud now we need to be prepared

285
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:59,029
and we need to stop kind of reacting

286
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:02,179
right we need to be proactive that's old

287
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:04,850
sock so this is our proactive

288
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:07,459
monitoring workflow now this particular

289
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:10,459
workflow is for our AMI scanning and

290
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:11,660
monitoring tool so what we have here is

291
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:13,998
we have a team account and then we have

292
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:16,069
our cloud services account someone in

293
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:17,829
our team account will you know say spin

294
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:21,170
up some random AMI

295
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:22,790
it'll cloud so we'll track that it'll

296
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:25,040
send and fire off a cloud watch event

297
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:27,919
which then goes to an SNS alert which

298
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,169
triggers a lambda that lambda will then

299
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:32,689
analyze that and say hey do I care

300
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:35,149
do I care this happened and if it does

301
00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:38,899
care in this case it definitely does it

302
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:41,209
will then run some stuff functions on

303
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:43,549
the AMI it'll ask that ami hey who are

304
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:47,089
you who is your daddy what does he do

305
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:48,829
what's your parent ami if it's one if

306
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:51,160
it's built off of our parent IMI it

307
00:14:48,829 --> 00:14:55,790
leaves it alone it's cool if it's not

308
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:57,949
then it's going to auto terminate we do

309
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,569
have exceptions that we get that

310
00:14:57,949 --> 00:15:01,099
sometimes there's black boxes that you

311
00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:07,699
have to deploy and you can't always

312
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:12,319
control that but largely that's it we do

313
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:15,109
have code look it works sometimes this

314
00:15:12,319 --> 00:15:17,299
is this is am i scanning still basically

315
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:19,730
we go through our V pcs for every single

316
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:22,309
V PC in an account we get all the

317
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:25,639
instances and then in those instances we

318
00:15:22,309 --> 00:15:29,360
say is this one of the a my images that

319
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:32,660
we expect to see or a parent of I think

320
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,970
that right now we let the last four

321
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:38,419
months of am eyes be valid so you

322
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:39,459
basically have four months to get off of

323
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:41,269
an old am I

324
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:44,388
those am eyes are obviously still

325
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:48,529
patched the old way while they exist but

326
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:51,230
we do not allow an ami to be long livid

327
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:55,579
in the cloud environment that's not the

328
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:57,169
cloudy way another thing that I'm really

329
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:59,508
excited about because this is one of my

330
00:15:57,169 --> 00:16:02,600
biggest qualms about cloud talks is I

331
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:05,449
feel like a lot of cloud talks I've gone

332
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:08,419
to end it in you know the the main point

333
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:10,819
is don't make an s3 bucket public and I

334
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:12,709
hate that because you can tell every

335
00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:14,059
single person that all you want till

336
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:17,239
you're blue in the face they're still

337
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:19,160
going to make that public if security

338
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:23,119
education was all that was necessary

339
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:26,480
half of us would not be employed so same

340
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:28,639
kind of thing as the ami scanning we go

341
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,299
through and say here are all the buckets

342
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:36,169
is it public is there an exception if

343
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:40,579
there is an exception then we use our

344
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:42,619
API to basically find the owner of that

345
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:45,019
account and then we cut a ticket for

346
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:49,059
that person say hey we found this public

347
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:52,579
bucket we turned it off do you need this

348
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:54,049
if they do need it then they say yes and

349
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:55,609
it goes through exception process if

350
00:16:54,049 --> 00:17:00,850
it's approved then we never bother it

351
00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:00,850
again so how does that actually look

352
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:09,349
so if I'm you know Davey developer and I

353
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,240
just need to build instance I don't care

354
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:12,530
what it is I don't care what it's setup

355
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,339
I just need this server and I need it

356
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:17,629
now I don't care I'm not gonna tag it

357
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:21,050
security groups sure let's open it to

358
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:22,670
the Internet why not cool

359
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:24,349
oh this key I probably don't have this

360
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,390
key but let's let's do it let's do it

361
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:27,800
let's just go with it

362
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:29,780
so now we look let's look at this this

363
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:33,409
is how it looks to our developers

364
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:38,840
basically we're building this spinning

365
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:41,990
up still spinning up these things take a

366
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:46,240
little while sometimes still up shutting

367
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:52,690
down what is happening my server uh-oh

368
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:55,580
nasty Graham terminated that's a minute

369
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:58,100
minute after it comes up it's can't even

370
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:01,850
actually barely make a connection before

371
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:03,590
it's gone there's they're nasty Graham

372
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:06,469
hey why are you doing something stupid

373
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:08,540
we know it was you we know this is what

374
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:13,010
you did we know that's what you built

375
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:14,420
and we terminated it successfully here's

376
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:17,120
this documentation that I know you're

377
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:23,930
not going to read don't do it again

378
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:26,570
please but if you do same thing so we

379
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:27,740
have some other ideas that we want to

380
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,480
keep elaborating we're gonna keep

381
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,760
building on this and that's something I

382
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,200
really want to point out it's very weave

383
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:37,580
the way we've made this is it can be

384
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:40,460
very modular so like I said a lot of our

385
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:43,429
right now manual processes we want to

386
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:45,470
make those automated when an ami is made

387
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:46,970
public that's obviously very kind of a

388
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:50,360
sensitive thing for us we want to get

389
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:54,980
that on non-public as fast as possible

390
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:56,750
so that's a huge one for us if someone

391
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:58,730
turns off our cloud trail again we're

392
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:01,550
blind to that account if that cloud

393
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:02,930
trail gets modified and we can't really

394
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,159
take away their permissions to touch

395
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,630
cloud trail because they might have

396
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,390
legitimate reasons to use their own

397
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:10,250
cloud trail so it's a bit of a

398
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,150
double-edged sword there and that kind

399
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,779
of comes back to that shared

400
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:18,169
responsibility model

401
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:19,849
creation of roles and permissions I am

402
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:21,229
is obviously a huge part of Amazon if

403
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:22,999
you've ever been in it we can't take

404
00:19:21,229 --> 00:19:26,359
that away we can't take that away from

405
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:28,009
people and what that means is that they

406
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:31,428
can also create their own roles and

407
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:33,950
permissions to stop or to circumvent our

408
00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:37,549
controls and we've seen it happen a lot

409
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:40,519
oh I tried to put this firewall in it

410
00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:42,549
won't let me well I'll give myself

411
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:46,669
firewall access and then they'll do it

412
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:49,399
so if we can stop that from happening we

413
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:52,669
can stop yelling at people and I don't

414
00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:55,758
know drink more oh my lord now I

415
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:59,389
wouldn't normally talk about costs but

416
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:02,119
when your cost looks like this I think

417
00:19:59,389 --> 00:20:03,529
it's worth talking about so we've looked

418
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:07,939
there a couple vendors who actually do

419
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:09,859
this kind of stuff and vendors can be

420
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:13,789
useful if you're utilizing multiple

421
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:16,189
clouds however when we were looking we

422
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:19,219
found that a lot of their costs were to

423
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:21,889
the tune of $100,000 a year plus a

424
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:24,709
percent of your Amazon monthly spend per

425
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:28,119
account we have a hundred and twenty

426
00:20:24,709 --> 00:20:33,589
accounts that's a lot of cash

427
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:36,439
our solution that's our scanning

428
00:20:33,589 --> 00:20:39,469
solution this runs out of one account

429
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:43,969
and it scans all 120 plus of our

430
00:20:39,469 --> 00:20:46,039
accounts for that much a month so

431
00:20:43,969 --> 00:20:47,690
there's about 152 dollars worth of

432
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:50,359
shared costs that's like you're now a

433
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:52,249
weighted Kinesis already yes a lot of

434
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:53,718
that some of that is kind of just cost

435
00:20:52,249 --> 00:20:57,109
of doing business cost of having an

436
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:58,309
Amazon account some of that is actually

437
00:20:57,109 --> 00:21:00,228
to tribute to the scanner as well that's

438
00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:03,049
why we put as shared then there's direct

439
00:21:00,229 --> 00:21:06,289
sienar costs so lambda two dollars and

440
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:10,668
22 cents a month cloud watch dollar 31

441
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:14,269
month DynamoDB two dollars 83 cents all

442
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:17,119
these things we can move process 20

443
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:20,719
million 20 million a cloud trail events

444
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:22,069
a day 120 counts 20 million cloud cloud

445
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:26,780
trail events a day get processed through

446
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:32,409
this so it runs and it runs a lot

447
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:37,010
but you know 186 a month 100k a year I

448
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:38,810
don't know what 6% of 186 is but doesn't

449
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:43,100
really matter if the flat is 100k a year

450
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:48,379
so you know shared cost 150 to direct

451
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:49,790
cost 30 for final cost 186 getting

452
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,130
emails from your developers when you

453
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:54,129
immediately kill their instances

454
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:54,130
priceless

455
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,560
thank you Matt really appreciate thanks

456
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:03,080
for the overview um just want to provide

457
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:06,770
a high-level summary why we did this is

458
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:09,050
really to identify how as long as you

459
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:11,180
learn what cloud environment and do the

460
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:12,980
investment up front you can build these

461
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:15,950
controls yourself it's not overly

462
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:18,110
complex it's having the time and effort

463
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:20,150
to understand your environment and what

464
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:22,100
your actual scope is those third-party

465
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:23,720
tools are fantastic I'm not going to

466
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,610
knock them they are expensive they

467
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,940
provide pretty graphs but you can do

468
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:30,379
that too and I really want you guys to

469
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:32,540
understand the environment you're

470
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:34,760
walking into and know that you can do

471
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:36,950
this yourself and at a reasonable cost

472
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:40,730
and being T so I have to pay the bill so

473
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:42,770
I absolutely love this and I want Matt

474
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:45,320
to talk a little bit about the education

475
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:47,240
and then we even close out I've said it

476
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,750
before I'll say again you've heard it

477
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,790
before

478
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:52,190
you'll hear it again security education

479
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:53,780
it's obviously important it's number one

480
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:56,180
you know fishing all that good stuff you

481
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:58,010
need to educate your users but as you

482
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:01,400
know they're not going to listen to you

483
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:03,080
and like I said if they did listen we

484
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:06,020
would not be here we would not be this

485
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:08,030
industry that we are so prepare yourself

486
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:10,280
for that you need to be able to actually

487
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:13,280
respond to these things when they don't

488
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:16,280
listen to you preferably in an automated

489
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,350
way we want you to be part of the same

490
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:21,139
environment that your developer is going

491
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:23,090
to be in that's why we that's why I

492
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:25,280
prefer building this ourselves we

493
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:27,679
actually learned so much by doing this

494
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,570
whereas if we just deploy some tool

495
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,340
which and a number of those tools

496
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:34,928
actually pretty much deploy the same

497
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:38,120
kinds of things that we build then like

498
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:39,710
what are you actually learning learning

499
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,320
new tools actually

500
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:43,760
Ricardo told me this yesterday getting

501
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,450
put in front of the new tools isn't

502
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:50,600
growth you don't learn anything by that

503
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:52,820
there's a reason that these things can

504
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:56,990
be kind of handed off and offshored so

505
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:58,039
easily new tools that's nice but getting

506
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:00,529
in there and actually building it

507
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:01,870
yourself that's what's important you

508
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:05,870
know that they're gonna do stupid

509
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:09,860
you need to know how to prepare yourself

510
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:13,039
for that stupid so we're here to

511
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:16,409
help if you have any questions we'd be

512
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:21,589
happy to answer thank you

513
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:21,589
