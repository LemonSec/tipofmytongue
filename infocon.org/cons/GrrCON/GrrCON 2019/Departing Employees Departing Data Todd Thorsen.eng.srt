wanted to be if you didn't want the

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,150
anything track I don't know how you

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,160

you need to get out go now

13
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,870
second thing cell phones make sure

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,100
they're silent I don't care what you

15
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,169
have to do to them to make them silent

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,809
just make them silent I wore boots for a

17
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,820
reason I'll come across yeah just turn

18
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:04,620
them off all right

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,380
so with that we are gonna get our next

20
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:09,720
speaker up here now we are talking about

21
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,149
the threat of departing employees and

22
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,710
the data they've had access to so with

23
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:18,870
that I'm gonna turn it over to Todd

24
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:21,330
Thorson hey everybody this is my first

25
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,340
time at gurken super cool so far so I'll

26
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,070
be back next year maybe not as a

27
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,090
presenter we'll see how today goes let

28
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,689
me I want to give you a little bit of

29
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,789
background on myself so I'm not a sales

30
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:36,119
person I'm actually in security I wear a

31
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:39,210
lot of different hats at code 42 and one

32
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:41,039
of them is running our own tool as part

33
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,779
of our insider threat program so I

34
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:45,479
wanted to talk a little bit about sort

35
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,789
of big picture insider threat and then a

36
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,789
narrower use case which is departing

37
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:52,590
employees and we we picked departing

38
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:53,789
employees as one of the elements to talk

39
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,500
well because it's really something that

40
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:59,600
runs across industry everybody's dealing

41
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,740
with it a lot of cases when

42
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,820
organizations I do I do a lot of

43
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,770
benchmarking so it's hard to

44
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,508
organizations just to better our

45
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,970
security practices get other ideas it's

46
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,770
super helpful but we talk about insider

47
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:14,430
threat and a lot of organizations are

48
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,690
skittish about just that terminology and

49
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,010
the thought of like monitoring their

50
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,800
employees and things like that

51
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:22,470
and they'll usually say hey we hire

52
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,940
awesome people we trust our employees

53
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:27,840
all these and those things are all true

54
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,609
in a code 42 we do the same thing one of

55
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,340
the elements to always think about in

56
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,310
that space though is that not all

57
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,390
insiders are malicious there's

58
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,730
non-malicious we're all humans right

59
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,390
like we all hire people and people make

60
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,959
mistakes

61
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:44,099
and so those mistakes can be costly to

62
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:46,860
organizations so I wanted to kind of

63
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:49,619
frame the discussion and level set with

64
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,319
that before we sort of dive in here the

65
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,299
other thing I'll note is this will be a

66
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,488
much better presentation if you guys

67
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:58,530
have questions or sort of want to

68
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:00,780
interact cuz it believe me I'm gonna get

69
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,489
bored listening to myself for 30 minutes

70
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,610
I'm gonna cruise through these slides

71
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:08,280
pretty quickly so stop me at any point

72
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,720
throw a hand up shout out and then we

73
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,860
can take questions at the end too so

74
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,959
just feel comfortable this is a true

75
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:24,810
statement departing employees do equal

76
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:27,390
departing data I'm gonna try to and the

77
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:30,870
odds are that your organization is

78
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:32,518
suffering from a data loss leak or theft

79
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,879
event and you probably don't even know

80
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:39,420
it because there's a gap in the stack

81
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:42,840
from a technology standpoint and part of

82
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:46,530
this is detection response is lacking

83
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:50,930
for most organizations 90% of insider

84
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:56,459
data loss leak and theft goes undetected

85
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:57,780
until after the fact in the some of the

86
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,239
trends I'll talk about here and we're

87
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,630
sort of building a case as to why this

88
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,700
is kind of a scary situation employees

89
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:08,040
are looking like over half of employees

90
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,440
in the United States are looking for

91
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,858
their next role and half of those

92
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,480
individuals that are looking have been

93
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:15,840
at their current employer for less than

94
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,380
a year

95
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,370
so think about loyalty to organizations

96
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,039
that's probably a thing of the past

97
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,000
right it's sort of moving on what's the

98
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:27,840
next challenge

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,389
and depending on what industry you're

100
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,729
working in some some employees are just

101
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:34,500
targeted that much more if you're

102
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:36,270
working in security you're probably

103
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,550
getting you're getting pinged on

104
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,260
LinkedIn offers like constantly and so

105
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:44,550
that's sort of always churning out there

106
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:46,320
so it's something to think about and

107
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,990
more employees are quitting

108
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,719
employee quits have risen every year for

109
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:54,150
the past decade and totaled 40 million

110
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:58,380
in 2018 so it's a big number it's a big

111
00:04:54,150 --> 00:05:02,359
churn that's out there the other

112
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:06,030
challenge is data portability and

113
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:09,180
exfiltration vectors are increasing

114
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:12,030
right it's becoming more easy to get

115
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,250
data out of organizations just by tools

116
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:20,010
that we're using every day right cloud

117
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:22,410
services web browsers devices and then

118
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:25,560
communications channels slack email like

119
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:27,300
you name it right so we're powering

120
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,330
these individuals that are leaving

121
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,740
organizations with like vectors and

122
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:36,960
things that are very easy to get data

123
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:39,960
out of our organizations so and the fact

124
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:44,370
is that quitters are taking data with

125
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:47,280
them at some alarming rates so 60% of

126
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:51,300
departing employees admit to taking

127
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,159
company data the other 40% are probably

128
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,220
just lying when they talk about this

129
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,740
right everybody I've done it in previous

130
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:02,310
roles right harmless type things but it

131
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:05,310
happens 70 percent of IP theft happens

132
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:07,560
in the 30 days before the employee puts

133
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:10,290
in their resignation so think about that

134
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,060
right they're not gonna take data after

135
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:14,040
they put their two weeks notice in some

136
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,020
do but the time they're gonna do it is

137
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,060
when they're looking for those roles and

138
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,159
they're on LinkedIn and they're prepping

139
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,980
for an interview they want to position

140
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:31,080
themselves in the best possible light

141
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:32,940
that they can for their next role and

142
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,000
this is also true departing employees

143
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:40,050
are the single biggest insider threat to

144
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,050
data loss for organizations what's also

145
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:50,400
true is 24 million people took data from

146
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:53,100
their previous employer in 2018 and the

147
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,429
why is for all the reasons that we just

148
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,290
touched on data is more portable than

149
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,790
it's ever been

150
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:03,090
data loss detection is

151
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:07,700
those gaps in visibility in the security

152
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:10,489
stack employee loyalty is on the decline

153
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:19,289
employee quits are on the rise and

154
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:22,230
quitters take data yet given all of this

155
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:24,210
most companies say we don't have a party

156
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:27,960
an employee workflow or process to

157
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:31,560
manage this and that's something I find

158
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:34,200
too as I mentioned I do a lot of

159
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,080
benchmarking when we talk about insider

160
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,599
threat off-boarding processes and things

161
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,400
like that even the very mature companies

162
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,800
larger organizations that have a mature

163
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,710
security posture the insider threat

164
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,050
space is often overlooked for a variety

165
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:51,000
of reasons

166
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:52,680
so less than 20 percent of large

167
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,140
enterprise companies have a well-defined

168
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,180
Incident Response scenarios for insider

169
00:07:55,140 --> 00:08:00,150
threat so that's something that we

170
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:02,160
learned in our data exposure report and

171
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:04,739
looking through the data or the Verizon

172
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,880
data breach report and certainly

173
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,590
something that I see and have

174
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:14,219
conversations with partners and peers in

175
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:17,640
Minneapolis when I talk about this the

176
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:19,230
reality is that this is damaging and

177
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,960
companies often don't have an idea that

178
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:23,940
quitters took data until the cat's

179
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,890
already out of the bag and it can have

180
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:30,450
some pretty big ramifications depending

181
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:34,470
on what that data is another truth is

182
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:35,819
that prevention fails you're missing a

183
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:38,450
critical layer of protection if that's

184
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:41,400
what you're hanging your hat on I have

185
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:43,950
worked with organizations deploying

186
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:48,569
traditional DLP which you know blocks

187
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:50,510
the reality is that do PD can be a great

188
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:53,670
tool but it's not just a tool it's

189
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:55,800
something that causes a huge resource

190
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,479
impact to deploy and roll out and it can

191
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,099
take months and even years depending on

192
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,580
the size of your organization to get

193
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:06,330
that rolled out you have to employ a

194
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:09,690
number of human resources to build

195
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:11,250
policies to block data and then when

196
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,450
people find a way to get around that

197
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,710
policy you have to come up with

198
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,570
permutations of that

199
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:17,790
see to continue to block and it's a

200
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,710
vicious cycle the other challenge is

201
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,510
that employees that are just trying to

202
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:24,029
get their job done are blocked from

203
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:27,000
doing that so productivity takes a hit

204
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:28,890
people get ticked off and what usually

205
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,930
happens is organizations will spend all

206
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,850
the time all those resources and then

207
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,819
just shut the prevention off this is

208
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:41,010
just too noisy and they can't manage it

209
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:43,380
so it's interesting so the root cause is

210
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:45,630
there's a data visibility gap in the

211
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:50,070
security stack so there's a lot of tools

212
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:51,779
out there for identity prevention

213
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:54,390
there's some tools that cover the

214
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:58,260
detection space there's a really big gap

215
00:09:54,390 --> 00:10:00,120
from detection to recover so response in

216
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:03,149
recover are pretty big gaps for a lot of

217
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:06,839
organizations and that's actually a spot

218
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:11,279
a place where code 42 does really well

219
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:14,640
so it kind of helps to fill that gap so

220
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:19,230
most organizations don't know what data

221
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:21,029
is where who had or has the data when

222
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,760
data is leaving the organization and

223
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:25,020
what data is leaving the organization

224
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:29,130
the other thing that's not on this slide

225
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:30,449
is who are the actors that are taking

226
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,900
that data with them like where's that

227
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:36,660
going

228
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:39,000
so there's a big visibility gap in the

229
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:41,069
fact is when employees steal your

230
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,130
companies are trending in the news on

231
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:47,580
social media chat forums things like

232
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:50,180
that and the damage can be significant

233
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:54,540
it can be certainly reputational damage

234
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:56,219
financial damage legal churn things that

235
00:10:54,540 --> 00:11:03,089
are distracting from what the

236
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:07,200
organization is trying to accomplish one

237
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:09,390
recent case was was McAfee so they had a

238
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,880
couple individuals who were conspiring

239
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:14,730
to take trade secrets with them

240
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,589
and the interesting thing about this is

241
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:19,200
it's not super hard so if we look at who

242
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:21,600
they were they weren't super technically

243
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,070
savvy sales ops finance people I mean

244
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,010
not that they can't be technically savvy

245
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:27,480
but you know it is what it is in the

246
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:30,120
timing wasn't super secretive

247
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,240
figured on the last day they worked the

248
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,680
method that they used to get it out

249
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:39,630
wasn't particularly sophisticated either

250
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:41,399
it was a USB Drive an email in the the

251
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:44,490
hall what they got from a data

252
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:46,320
perspective was a lot of data that was

253
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:50,000
gonna help them out there an extra like

254
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,050
titanium I mean those in those roles so

255
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,209
again that's something that has a

256
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:55,740
reputational hit from McAfee doesn't

257
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:57,089
maintain iam look particularly good and

258
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,800
then you've got all this churn but the

259
00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:02,310
fact is that they were able to get data

260
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:06,319
out of that environment relatively easy

261
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:06,319
using a pretty unsophisticated methods

262
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:19,290
so employee off wording this is what the

263
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:22,740
typical off-boarding process looks like

264
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:25,110
so employee gives notice HR submits a

265
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,399
ticket or writes notice to the manager

266
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,220
what have you

267
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,980
IT and security remove access and

268
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:37,410
systems and the employer turns in laptop

269
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:40,230
and badge on the last day so the big

270
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:42,719
piece that's missing in that process is

271
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:44,790
the data like the visibility piece so

272
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,050
we're removing assets and we're moving

273
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,699
access and things of that nature which

274
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:50,819
is important but the piece that's

275
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:52,589
missing is that is the data so an

276
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:54,029
awkward process could look like this a

277
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:56,130
lot of the same steps on the front end

278
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:58,889
so employee gives notice HR submits a

279
00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:02,519
ticket IT and secure remove access to

280
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:04,410
systems with code 42 the other step that

281
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,750
you do is you add that employee to the

282
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,829
departing employee monitoring queue and

283
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,959
we'll talk a little bit about that in a

284
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:18,779
minute and then they go off through the

285
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:20,939
separation process so we do take a

286
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:23,040
different approach when it comes to data

287
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:26,250
protection in this space and focuses

288
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:30,240
monitoring investigation and supporting

289
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:33,029
response and recovery we collect all of

290
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,889
the endpoint data that employees are

291
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:36,120
handling alright so that's a benefit

292
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:38,130
right the data is just backed up

293
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,930
automatically and so you've got access

294
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:41,820
to it so your security team or your sock

295
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:44,339
team has access to that

296
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:46,320
raishin when they're doing monitoring

297
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:48,690
investigations of high-risk employees

298
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,520
one might be departing employees other

299
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:53,160
scenarios for high-risk employees might

300
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,930
be individuals that are on performance

301
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,219
improvement plans right if you get on a

302
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,959
performance proven plan there's two

303
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,220
paths and one is either I'm gonna turn

304
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,720
it around I'm gonna be a good employee

305
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,720
I'm gonna like kind of get the ship

306
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,030
righted the other path is I'm gonna make

307
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,950
your job manager help for the next 90

308
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:11,100
days and just be a huge pain in the ass

309
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:12,780
I'm not happy I'm susceptible to taking

310
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,450
data but it's other it's individuals

311
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:18,000
that might be involved in M&A activity

312
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:19,790
it could be individuals elevated

313
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,440
privileges access to source code

314
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:24,329
whatever is important trade secrets for

315
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,720
your organization that's what we sort of

316
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:30,390
Center that around and so with code 42

317
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:33,480
again it's collecting it giving that

318
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:37,439
monitoring insight detecting events

319
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:39,390
through alerts and triggers that prompt

320
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,400
investigation because you have all the

321
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:44,460
files you can put context around those

322
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:47,370
actions who is using it why is somebody

323
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:48,780
a marketing handling monthly payroll

324
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,610
spreadsheet and why did they upload it

325
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:52,890
to USB Drive right those are the things

326
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:54,720
that sort of you get insight into as

327
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:57,540
you're going through the investigation

328
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,890
process and then the response piece the

329
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:03,569
point in the right partner is depending

330
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:07,439
on what that activity looks like so

331
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:11,070
we'll run through a quick scenario so

332
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,500
Alex accepts a new job in sales with a

333
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:16,470
competitor of your organization puts his

334
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,180
notice in security adds him to the

335
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:23,970
departing employee monitoring queue in

336
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:26,939
code 42 security reviews what Alex did

337
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:29,460
before he put his notice in so what we

338
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,640
do what my team does is we'll take a 90

339
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:34,050
day look-back and we'll look at

340
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,760
anomalous file activity in that period

341
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,310
of time we'll reach out and do

342
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,600
investigations as needed in this case

343
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:43,349
there wasn't anything that looks

344
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,350
suspicious for that period the next

345
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:48,480
thing that we do once we complete the

346
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:50,640
the look-back is they stay in that

347
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,460
departing employee monitoring queue and

348
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,880
we set file alert activity so it's a

349
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,740
file size

350
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,900
there's a number of factors that we can

351
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,780
alert off of and they stay in that queue

352
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:04,020
until I separate from the organization

353
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:06,459
so in this case three days later

354
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:09,100
security gets an email alert is that

355
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:13,960
Alex added files to Dropbox just a

356
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:15,790
couple of minutes ago so security

357
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,310
because we have the files looks into

358
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:21,939
what Alex put in Dropbox and most of it

359
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:24,969
seemed harmless w9 resume things that

360
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:27,340
are his but one appears to be a customer

361
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:31,060
list and given the fact that he's in

362
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:32,830
sales that's probably a problem so

363
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,599
security has the capability to just

364
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:37,360
restore that file and instantly look at

365
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,860
it put context around the action and

366
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,720
verify that in this case yeah it was

367
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:44,290
some sensitive data that you shouldn't

368
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:47,800
be taking with them so then you have the

369
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:50,349
options of how to handle it in the

370
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:53,380
context of the situation in this case we

371
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:55,060
would reach out to Alex's manager Alex's

372
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,680
manager would sit with them watch him

373
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,449
permanently delete that information from

374
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,099
Dropbox and we're probably gonna shut

375
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:02,860
down and take some additional action on

376
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,810
the back end to limit what he's able to

377
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:10,360
access and things like that as he

378
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:12,099
separates so that's the presentation I'd

379
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:16,359
be happy to take any questions if there

380
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:18,250
are any other people have scenarios they

381
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:20,109
want to mention or talk through I'd be

382
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:30,340
happy to talk through our answer any of

383
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:36,219
those questions yeah so that's a good

384
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:39,129
question so code 42 is an agent that is

385
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,480
on every endpoint device doesn't matter

386
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:42,190
if you're on network or off network we

387
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,100
still have visibility that backup cycle

388
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:51,060
is still happening and so you're you're

389
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:51,060
covered in that scenario as well yes

390
00:17:51,910 --> 00:18:09,020
um that - not today that is a item

391
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:11,629
that's on a roadmap though yeah yes yeah

392
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:14,840
I mean that can be a that can be what we

393
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:18,140
do is Oh - if you think about any bigger

394
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:21,409
picture in that respect is when you get

395
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:23,630
hired at an organization you know

396
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:24,830
there's in some cases an agreement

397
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:26,330
that's put into place you have to go

398
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:28,610
through and acknowledge like acceptable

399
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:31,460
use and things like that so it's

400
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:33,290
important to you know establish kind of

401
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,960
the rules of the road up front and just

402
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:37,790
be open and transparent as you can as to

403
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,720
overdoing any a code 42 everybody knows

404
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:43,730
what our product does so we'll see more

405
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,740
non-malicious type things and when I

406
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:50,420
might think about like insider threat

407
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:52,280
like I always assume positive intent and

408
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,440
I have my team assume positive intent

409
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:57,410
that's important because at the end of

410
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,300
the day the risk you're managing is your

411
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:01,340
employee base right people that you work

412
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,870
with every day you definitely see things

413
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,220
and insider threat that you just can't

414
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,270
unseen you don't ever want to see again

415
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,310
type of a thing

416
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:09,830
but you do want to instill trust so

417
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:11,179
transparency is important and then

418
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:13,370
reiterating like we're not trying to

419
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:14,750
catch you doing something wrong in some

420
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:15,739
cases we're actually trying to protect

421
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,900
you

422
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:19,340
and people make mistakes like that's it

423
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,350
at the end of the day like the majority

424
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:23,750
of what I've seen in the past in this

425
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:26,840
space has been you know people making

426
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:30,760
mistakes that while not malicious can

427
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,760
still be very costly to organizations

428
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,700
okay well I appreciate everybody's time

429
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:40,160
today if you haven't had lunch you can

430
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,130
get back out there so thanks a lot enjoy

431
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:48,989
the rest of the conference

432
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:48,989
