1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,799
oh no they just my IT guys said to tell

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,170
like a two-minute what it's just it's a

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,849
security thing it's unbelievable yeah

4
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:12,150
okay good afternoon everybody welcome

5
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:14,219
back to another fun-filled session Edgar

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,340
con 2019 hopefully you're enjoying your

7
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:19,380
Friday today I have the pleasure of

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,689
introducing Milan Patel he's going to

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,669
talk about an SOC I love these acronyms

10
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:30,710
today it's been great so about life in

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:32,969
your SOC so one thanks thanks guys so

12
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:35,219
this usually takes about 45 minutes but

13
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:38,460
I got 25 so I'm gonna speak New York

14
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,960
fast because that's thrown from so a

15
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,520
little background myself spent the

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,050
number years at the FBI is a field agent

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,789
and then finally the CTO of the cyber

18
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,940
division where I spent a lot of time on

19
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:50,340
instant response and cybercrime you know

20
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,589
investigations like anonymous and Silk

21
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,030
Road when I was a street agent New York

22
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,309
and and then transitioned out of

23
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,140
government a few years ago to help found

24
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:01,440
the company I'm at today which is blue

25
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,460
voyant gonna talk a little bit about and

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,830
I'm sure you guys know this from the

27
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,030
audience I left this slide in I could

28
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,260
have taken it out even though you guys

29
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,320
know some of the stuff but I thought

30
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,520
it'd be fun to to show you guys some

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,649
pictures I took along the way in my

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,380
career on the right-hand side you know I

33
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,369
often tell the story of of the the

34
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,009
picture in the middle there with the guy

35
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:22,920
with the money on him he was a part of a

36
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:25,830
criminal organized crime ring out of

37
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,460
Eastern Europe russian-backed organized

38
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:31,590
crime that had siphoned about two

39
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,470
million credit cards and debit cards out

40
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:37,320
of a well-known multinational bank and

41
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:40,048
that organized crime gang had a deep

42
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,970
website set up that was operating in

43
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:43,890
real time with customer service the

44
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,110
whole nine yards and basically signing

45
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,610
up Russian j1 students kids who came

46
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,250
from Russia to come here to go to school

47
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,750
they would overstay their visas not want

48
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,439
to go back to Russia for obvious reasons

49
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:58,619
and they would turn into skimmers they

50
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,020
would get MSR 206s hotel key cards and

51
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:05,009
then go hit ATMs this guy in the middle

52
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:07,380
there hit 200 ATMs in New York City in

53
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:09,090
the span of about four weeks and

54
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,989
siphoned out like three million dollars

55
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,890
in $20 bills he stuffed that money after

56
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:15,960
paying

57
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,929
sending money we via veteran Western

58
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,370
Union in walls at his house and then

59
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,980
spackled over it

60
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,480
we had actually dig through walls to

61
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,179
find the money on the on the on the the

62
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,920
bottom right hand picture you know I

63
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,660
illustrate this point because you know

64
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,730
things haven't really changed since

65
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,670
those those investigations I was a part

66
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,890
of but what we are seeing is sort of

67
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,230
that organized crime element become very

68
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,670
technically sophisticated and so when we

69
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,739
think about Russian organized crime we

70
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,959
think about other Eastern European

71
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,490
organized crime it was you know more

72
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,230
organization five or six years ago

73
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:51,720
trying to get young kids to do credit

74
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,790
card fraud ATM fraud and what we found

75
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,010
is those same criminal gangs are not

76
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,590
running full-blown operations to build

77
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:01,950
pretty substantial pieces of code

78
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,390
designed to be as a service and today

79
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,980
we're tracking a lot of these guys in

80
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,540
the deep and dark web and we're finding

81
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,030
some amazing ways they're they're

82
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:12,060
maintaining their persistence evading

83
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:15,210
next gen Navy like some of the guys on

84
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:18,570
the other side of the expo hall and and

85
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:20,190
we see it every day in our sock and it's

86
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,470
a it's an interesting place because I

87
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,989
think it's really impacting how socks

88
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:27,120
are supposed to run socks for many years

89
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:29,400
were designed to be very reactive they

90
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,950
processed alerts they triaged they then

91
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,330
sent the alert to the customer or if it

92
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,458
was an internal sock sent it to the

93
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,870
business unit responsible for those

94
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:38,550
group of servers your machines and then

95
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,350
some somebody would manually come by

96
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,430
take a look at it and everybody figure

97
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,019
out they don't know really what's wrong

98
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,239
they're scared and they rebuild a

99
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:47,010
machine and and as you guys know now

100
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,110
you've seen before you know rebuilding

101
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,120
machines on end is very tiresome very

102
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,130
uncomfortable and makes a lot of people

103
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,300
unhappy and so how do you do that more

104
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,940
transparently how do you do more

105
00:03:54,300 --> 00:04:00,150
proactively and and sort of happy to say

106
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:02,010
that the industry is evolving but but

107
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,930
really we're still sort of in this place

108
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:06,239
where most organizations whether you've

109
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,620
outsourced your sock or you've you've

110
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,540
got an internal sock depending on the

111
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,580
size of the organization what we finds

112
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,900
the same problem if you guys have grown

113
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,300
up in friends experience and response

114
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,918
like I have there wasn't a day that went

115
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,959
by that you weren't copying pasting in

116
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:22,140
virustotal you weren't doing you know

117
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,729
basic rudimentary pivot tables and Excel

118
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,090
spreadsheets looking for IP addresses

119
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:28,729
and user agent strings and

120
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:30,200
and doing things manually and so what we

121
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:32,330
found in the space especially in the

122
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,860
mid-market space is these organizations

123
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,570
have realized that you know they're

124
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,790
gonna be attacked there's going to be a

125
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,500
threat to their brand new reputation and

126
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:41,150
how do how to actually impact that

127
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,070
what's happened is a sort of spur to go

128
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,780
buy a bunch of tools so they're buying

129
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,820
CrowdStrike carbon black Splunk and all

130
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,590
these great tools and the tools are

131
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:51,020
great they work well we use all those in

132
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:53,810
our sock at bluevoyage but what we found

133
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,430
is there's no material change except for

134
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,320
more detection some are false positives

135
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,690
and so how do you deal with that how do

136
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,400
you figure out a creative way to bridge

137
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,870
the bridge these tools together in a way

138
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,700
that you can actually track a threat

139
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,710
from from a coming in your environment

140
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,539
it doing its nasty thing and then

141
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,650
leaving and can you show that that

142
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,180
threat that came in to the environment

143
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:13,729
was just an incident rather than a

144
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,500
breach and and and the distinction there

145
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:17,210
is something was stolen corrupted or

146
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,440
damaged where you've got to call outside

147
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:20,239
counsel you've got to call an instant

148
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,630
response team and then you talk about

149
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,430
the tail end of an IR and IR engagement

150
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:27,260
where you doing cleanup forensics

151
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:30,020
there's law firms involved there's

152
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,610
notifications to customers accounts and

153
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,070
partners that you've lost their data and

154
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,690
every state across the country has a

155
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:38,479
unique way of identifying what

156
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:39,979
notification is and with respect to what

157
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,320
happens side of a network some states

158
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:43,640
the mirror the mirror compromise of a

159
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,289
server that had client date on it

160
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,780
requires and triggers notification and

161
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:49,729
so if you've got a database of a million

162
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,530
customers you're making a notification

163
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:53,240
to million customers you can ask Equifax

164
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:56,659
and Target and no Depot what that's

165
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:59,450
really like I can tell you that that the

166
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:01,190
cost of that far outweighed anybody

167
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,990
being on site fixing any machines and

168
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,490
getting things up and running I had the

169
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,510
fortunate or unfortunate pleasure of

170
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,580
being a part of some of those breaches

171
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:09,020
and I can tell you most of it was around

172
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,669
not the fact that they didn't have

173
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,680
technology they all did they all had the

174
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:14,659
next-gen buzzword of every device you

175
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,010
could possibly think of what they had

176
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,260
was product fatigue an alert fatigue

177
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,940
they had too many products too many

178
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,409
tools to monitor and all these tools are

179
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,940
different and approach alerting

180
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:25,280
differently based on thresholds that

181
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:28,370
those platforms are designed to trigger

182
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,869
on and what we end up finding is there's

183
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,150
more there's more tools and more data

184
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,889
than one person can handle let alone a

185
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,630
sock that's built internally or

186
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:37,190
externally and so we don't see a drastic

187
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,110
change in any of this information in the

188
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,969
last few years which is we're

189
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,710
seeing in an amount of time being wasted

190
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,569
on alerts that don't matter

191
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,549
and then alerts that matter not enough

192
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:48,710
time and I can tell you we see this on a

193
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,729
regular basis when we go do IR for

194
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,438
companies I've been briefed where we

195
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:53,930
don't provide any sort of services for

196
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,189
them we see the same thing they'll give

197
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,449
us a list of all the alerts that were

198
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:57,919
generated out of their Splunk

199
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:00,710
environment and Excel spreadsheet and

200
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,900
they'll say we think we may have looked

201
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:04,878
at these but we're not entirely sure and

202
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,948
so you'll find inevitably in those

203
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,439
alerts you will find the telltale sign

204
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:11,360
of a breach or compromise or some sort

205
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,949
of credential theft and so we don't see

206
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,960
a lot of change in these problems around

207
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:17,030
meantime to detect meantime respond and

208
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,729
really that response is more not just

209
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:21,318
response it's really remediation in the

210
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:23,719
industry we sort of confuse these two

211
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:26,240
together when you think about MDR just

212
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:27,710
the terminology you know Gartner sees it

213
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,060
and the industry sees as a response

214
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,638
which is somebody picking up the phone

215
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,930
making a call saying I responded I've

216
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:35,680
told you something is wrong and really

217
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:37,580
that's ten percent of the problem right

218
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,529
that you got the ten percent right

219
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,150
you've notified your customer or your

220
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:43,639
team that there's a problem but the rest

221
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:47,090
of it is what exactly happened what took

222
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:49,520
place and and how to actually rectify

223
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,529
that problem not from just the point of

224
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,969
the detection of ransomware

225
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:54,979
and your next you Navy was able to

226
00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:57,229
identify the encryption and kill it

227
00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:59,060
before it encrypt the entire machine the

228
00:07:57,229 --> 00:08:01,339
challenge really is how do you defeat

229
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,930
the persistence mechanisms and the

230
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:05,479
propagation techniques that these new

231
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:07,580
pieces of malware are using and and

232
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:10,250
really a good example of that this was a

233
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,599
live case from one of our customers you

234
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,919
know we had in this particular instance

235
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,680
next-gen maybe Ronnie we were managing

236
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:17,000
it for them running their policies and

237
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,250
deployed actually the next-gen ad

238
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,830
solution for them rather large company

239
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:25,789
got hit with trick bought and run and

240
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:28,550
Ryu right at the same time and what we

241
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:31,370
found was the AV solution kicked in and

242
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:34,219
stopped the execution of code but what

243
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:36,320
we end up finding was every machine that

244
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:38,690
that payload had touched was trying to

245
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,820
execute this code and so you can imagine

246
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:42,320
you can imagine the number of alerts

247
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,880
being generated out of the same

248
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,769
environment and out of the next Jaime

249
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,380
solution where you've seen hundreds of

250
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:50,779
alerts per hour across thousands of

251
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,600
machines over and over again and what we

252
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:55,029
figured out was it was more than

253
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,370
the race we're trying to encrypt and and

254
00:08:55,029 --> 00:09:01,240
actually be doing his job is the tool

255
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:02,920
had left behind a ton of ways to be

256
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,910
persistent on the network writing over

257
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:10,229
SMB doing discovery lateral movement

258
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:12,160
stopping updates the virus to antivirus

259
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,540
making all these things available

260
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,680
because the bad guys realized look we

261
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,199
really can stop but let's keep the

262
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,569
persistence mechanism in place given

263
00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:21,939
that hopefully one day our malware does

264
00:09:19,569 --> 00:09:23,949
land and we'll have we'll have at least

265
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,839
our payload in there and we can send

266
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:28,870
down new stuff so this pickle of one is

267
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,579
really really interesting because not

268
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:34,930
just it was a you know credential escape

269
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:36,550
can crunch already over SMB using sort

270
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:39,130
of living off the land techniques it

271
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:40,959
went pretty deep into looking at what

272
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,970
you know as you I'm sure you guys know

273
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,969
what scribbly do is but really just a

274
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:48,190
binary cyma Microsoft that allows for

275
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:50,380
deregistration and and a nun

276
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:52,769
registration of controls within within

277
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:57,579
the registry and what we found was

278
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:59,709
squiggly-doo was not only just a part of

279
00:09:57,579 --> 00:10:01,810
this problem we couldn't get it off the

280
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:03,310
machines so we couldn't use next-gen AV

281
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:06,369
to reverse shell into the machines and

282
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:08,410
remove remove this activity we had to

283
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:10,660
start writing custom policies to

284
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:12,430
actually impact this what we did was we

285
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,170
wrote a couple of different policies num

286
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,239
number one was if anything wrote over

287
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:18,579
SMB or tried to make a lot of movement

288
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,430
after SMB and it try to make an external

289
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:23,199
network connection sever that connection

290
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:25,060
don't allow that SMB to happen but if it

291
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:27,069
doesn't actually rise to the level of

292
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,790
creating an external connection go ahead

293
00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:29,439
and let that happen

294
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,880
because if we don't let it happen then

295
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,350
you've got you know disruption to the

296
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,269
network and this was during a day right

297
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:35,380
so the company's up and running there's

298
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:37,000
people running around doing their jobs

299
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,850
and if you start sort of you know

300
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,260
cutting off basic Windows functions

301
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,240
you're gonna start impacting the user

302
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:46,689
base the last thing that cisco wants to

303
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,579
do is have you know a lot of employees

304
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:50,680
upset that they can't get their job done

305
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:52,359
you know they could care less about the

306
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,989
attack themselves but they want to get

307
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:58,899
their job done and so what we found was

308
00:10:54,990 --> 00:11:00,610
not only that it was doing this and and

309
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:02,319
and also doing the registry key changes

310
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,149
at the same time and so we ended up

311
00:11:02,319 --> 00:11:06,579
having to do is write these custom

312
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:08,920
policies to go in and basically

313
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:10,660
stop SMB from making Internet

314
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,329
connections and go in and actually

315
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:16,930
forcefully fix the registry keys to

316
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:18,790
remove remove the the the the the

317
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:20,859
ability for the payload to actually do

318
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:22,839
this and so you know when you think

319
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,490
about sort of what a sock operation is

320
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,500
and what innocent responses this was all

321
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:28,210
done remotely there was no there was no

322
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,250
body there was no team I didn't send

323
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:32,770
anybody on site to do this work this was

324
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,240
all done through the console of the

325
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,980
next-gen AV solution and this is goes

326
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,290
back to my point which is these tools

327
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,670
are great they work really well but you

328
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:41,110
got to know how to use them most

329
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,339
different customers who buy the next-gen

330
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:45,940
tools will come to us and say hey we

331
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:47,590
just bought you know XYZ company tool we

332
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,540
realized we actually don't know how to

333
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:51,310
use it it looked cool when we bought it

334
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,660
and it looked like it was doing his job

335
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,550
because we all these lights go off and

336
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,780
all these all these all these things pop

337
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,829
up and we're like a that's doing his job

338
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,720
you know you go back and everybody

339
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:00,580
because it's thumbs up the reality is is

340
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,290
that they are good tools the challenge

341
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,390
is their detection mechanisms are

342
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,560
somewhat aggressive and so they detected

343
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,240
a lot that things that shouldn't be

344
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,430
detected on that requires whitelisting

345
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,770
and custom policy development but more

346
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:13,959
importantly it is capturing this data

347
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:15,730
but it needs to be forced to go do

348
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,710
something about it so this particular

349
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,810
instance you know the out-of-the-box

350
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:22,570
policy for this next gen IV solution is

351
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:23,589
to go let this binary run to not stop it

352
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,270
because if you stop this binding from

353
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,950
running it's gonna affect it's gonna

354
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:29,380
disrupt the operating system and thereby

355
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:30,760
disrupting disrupting work on the

356
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,530
network and so when you buy these

357
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,020
solutions yeah they're great detecting

358
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:36,339
they've got great policy enforcement but

359
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,290
you gotta know how to use the policy

360
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,490
enforcement to go in and do this and so

361
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,660
when we see things like this this is

362
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:43,270
like by the way a customer had bought

363
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:45,189
this tool had it for six months and then

364
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,750
realized this was this was too much for

365
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:48,070
them and they were thinking about

366
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,320
removing it and going back to a

367
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:51,790
traditional AV platform we came in and

368
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,500
told them absolutely not don't go back

369
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,089
to traditional AV because you're not

370
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,100
gonna have the ability to investigate

371
00:12:55,090 --> 00:13:00,550
and and determine the root cause of

372
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:02,470
those those issues after the fact and so

373
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,880
when we talk about sort of you know

374
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:05,830
really fighting back what are we really

375
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,930
talking about we're really talking about

376
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:09,160
is shifting to sort of a different

377
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:12,579
philosophy right asking more questions

378
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:15,069
up front of your sock operation is it

379
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:17,920
really bad how bad is it what makes it

380
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:18,840
bad could this be legitimate these are

381
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,719
all really important

382
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,860
as we start seeing malware and and the

383
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,510
various payloads getting into

384
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,460
environments designed to live off the

385
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,810
land right so it's basically good stuff

386
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:30,000
behaving badly and how do you actually

387
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:31,619
make sense of that and what we found is

388
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,180
you know over the last few years of

389
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,460
building this capability out we saw that

390
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,420
the questions we're asking are great

391
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,300
questions but they're really hard

392
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:42,599
questions to ask and and to do that at

393
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:45,030
scale is really difficult and so we we

394
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,860
added in orchestration into the platform

395
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:48,240
that allowed us asked all those

396
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,820
questions quickly so I know you can't

397
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,100
see the screen in detail but on the

398
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,510
right hand side is an entire automated

399
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,820
playbook designed to look for gang crap

400
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:58,380
and that's it it's designed to look for

401
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:01,140
the persistence mechanism its

402
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:03,120
propagation and the payload itself and

403
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:05,939
so what you're seeing is a fork when we

404
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,890
determine it's high confidence and vapi

405
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,050
from the platform it's going back into

406
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:12,960
that next-gen AV solution killing the

407
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:14,430
process deleting the the payload and

408
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,810
then quarantine that machine from the

409
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:18,599
network so it can't go spread itself

410
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:20,520
just in case deletion didn't work and

411
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,990
this is all being done with those same

412
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,329
basic questions that were asking before

413
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:26,700
which is you know is it really bad you

414
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:28,170
know how is it bad why is it bad all

415
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,080
these really really tough questions to

416
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:32,939
ask especially when you're talking about

417
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,530
things that are legitimate in an

418
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,690
enterprise that are designed to run like

419
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:39,120
PowerShell and others but being used in

420
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:41,700
a malicious way or masquerading behind

421
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,320
something else and so really what we're

422
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,480
talking about is the ability to do this

423
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,790
at scale do it efficiently and we're

424
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,830
starting to see sauk operations whether

425
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:51,449
you've outsourced it or you're building

426
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:53,010
your own sock some of the largest banks

427
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:54,870
in the world are finally starting to get

428
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:56,460
to a place where they're automating a

429
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:58,590
lot of these tickets particularly on the

430
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:00,930
benign and false positive side which is

431
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:02,850
now cutting down the amount of time it

432
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:04,979
takes for sock analyst to actually do

433
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:07,200
reviews of more important stuff today at

434
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,420
our sock we roughly automate 50% of

435
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,670
tickets so all the false positives and

436
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:13,290
benign indicators are that are that are

437
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,819
created from the network we're actually

438
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:16,050
running through various playbooks in

439
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,850
reaching them with threat intelligence

440
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:19,410
and making the determination is are they

441
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,360
really bad or are they not in that key

442
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,860
distinction between is this an incident

443
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,090
or is this a breach we don't tell you

444
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,980
our customers we can stop you from

445
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,420
incidents because that's not possible no

446
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,950
tools should be able to do that no human

447
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:31,589
should be able to do that but can we

448
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:32,520
give our give our customers a sense of

449
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,170
comfort to know

450
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,270
we are looking for that Delta between

451
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:37,709
what's an incident what's a breach and

452
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,180
that is where the rubber meets the road

453
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:40,410
particularly if you've suffered a breach

454
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,569
and you realize what it takes to

455
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:45,149
actually resolve a breach it's not just

456
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:48,000
forensics as I said it's law firms its

457
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:49,830
IR teams its auditors its examiner's

458
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,170
from federal regulators who come in and

459
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:53,730
ask the questions what did you exactly

460
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:55,410
do here when this breach happened oh

461
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,750
sure it's a response plan and most

462
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:59,310
people's into response plans are

463
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,690
non-existent they don't have one and so

464
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:02,040
what we end up finding if you think

465
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:05,339
about the merchant mercantile exchange

466
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,480
that was breached in Chicago the the

467
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,820
federal regulator went to them it

468
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,290
basically said certiorari our plan shows

469
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,180
what you did when you figure this out

470
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:15,420
and the simple question they asked was

471
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:17,069
when did you find this was bad when was

472
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,569
it really bad and what's the Delta

473
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,350
between when you realize it was bad you

474
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:22,110
did something about it

475
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:23,160
and that Delta was massive because

476
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,600
people are running around trying to

477
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,399
figure out what to do there's IT guys

478
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,510
saying I own this you on this I don't

479
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,790
want to be stuck with it's not my

480
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:31,200
database I didn't configure it I don't I

481
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:33,270
don't know who did what I don't have the

482
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,980
logs that doesn't feed into that doesn't

483
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:36,689
feed into our our smoke environment so

484
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,770
if you asked me to look at it I have no

485
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,810
idea because you never sent me those

486
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:42,930
logs and so we saw a lot of that

487
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:44,489
infighting get generated from not being

488
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:46,859
able to respond appropriately to these

489
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:49,230
problems and really the the the name of

490
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:52,200
the game is trying to find really really

491
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:54,240
creative ways to reduce the amount of

492
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,130
false positives in an environment so you

493
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,170
can then go go concentrate on the more

494
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:59,310
significant stuff that potentially could

495
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:01,829
be a breach where there's a corruption

496
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,569
of data in exfiltration of data of some

497
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:06,059
kind and you really can't do that if

498
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:07,679
you're buried in alerts that look really

499
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:09,389
important but they're really not right

500
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,160
so commodity malware that was stopped by

501
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,329
a next-gen AV is that a problem should

502
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,189
anybody be reviewing that or should you

503
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:15,869
just get it out of the network versus

504
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:17,610
something like this that I showed where

505
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:19,619
it requires some actual additional root

506
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:21,178
cause analysis behind the scenes to make

507
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:23,369
sure it was really out of the network

508
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:25,410
and what we tell people as a sort of you

509
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:28,109
know I guess funny and crude way it's

510
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:29,370
you can hire ADT right to to monitor

511
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:30,149
your house with cameras and they can

512
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,919
come in and tell you where all the

513
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,820
cameras should go but if you're not home

514
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,410
and you're looking at your camera

515
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,750
through your app and somebody Rob's your

516
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:37,920
house you know there's not much going on

517
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,140
there gonna be robbing your house while

518
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,820
you're well you're not home and so what

519
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:44,280
we like to tell folks is it's not enough

520
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,490
to have ADT it's not enough to have just

521
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,320
cameras you've got

522
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:49,990
to think about where the right place is

523
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,790
to put in blocks and put in humans to go

524
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:54,070
affect some of these things that are

525
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:55,389
very manual in nature you know we talk

526
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,889
about AI we talked about machine

527
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:59,710
learning and those are all great things

528
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:01,059
and they will impact cyber security in

529
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:03,250
the coming years but really what we're

530
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:06,399
talking about is this ability to use

531
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:08,230
humans to empower technologies to do a

532
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,090
better job at identifying these issues

533
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:12,130
which typically is what drowns out a

534
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,720
sock if you look at any sock the number

535
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:16,000
of alerts to come in the number of them

536
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,490
are handled under the SLA ticker you

537
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,410
would be shocked on what the SLA says

538
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:23,320
and what the actual what the actual

539
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:25,870
timer says on the real-time response and

540
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,428
so lastly I'll just say in general what

541
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,510
we're talking about is you know these

542
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:30,340
great tools that we see in the

543
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,750
marketplace today you have to have them

544
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,610
they do a really good job of detection

545
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,290
they do a better job behavioral

546
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:37,629
detection and some of the some of the

547
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:38,920
older legacy tools but what we find is

548
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:40,270
that they're scaled back the policies

549
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:44,050
that are written or scaled back which is

550
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:45,400
which is good and bad because you don't

551
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:47,559
want to disrupt the network but the

552
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,720
reality is some humans got to come in

553
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:51,790
and interact with that next-gen tool and

554
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,830
determine what processes we're gonna

555
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:55,030
write what policies we're gonna write

556
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,800
we're going to enforce on the network

557
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:58,240
whether it be black listing white

558
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,159
listing or some combination of both

559
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,530
depending on what you want to do on the

560
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,820
network and so this particular customer

561
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:05,649
that's actually there that's actually

562
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,300
part of their no policy development and

563
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:08,380
we actually went in manually and created

564
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,659
a lot of different things for them and

565
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,650
and we actually learn after that instant

566
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,900
response there were a bunch of other

567
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:16,030
stuff things on the network that that

568
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,470
you know if they were hit a different

569
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,850
way it would have probably impacted them

570
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,830
so we went in and cleaned some of those

571
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:22,178
things up as well which was like you

572
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,559
know batch process is the middle of the

573
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:25,090
night for their financial applications

574
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:26,980
we actually saw that those batch

575
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,300
processes did make any network

576
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,850
connection so we wrote a custom policy

577
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,320
to say if this batch process runs let it

578
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,480
run but if it makes an external network

579
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,760
connection don't let it run things

580
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,770
things of that nature we did for this

581
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,030
customer and we think we've got this

582
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,559
network pretty locked down but again

583
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:43,450
it's never perfect

584
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:45,340
these policies need to be reviewed from

585
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:48,010
time to time and you need an expert to

586
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:50,350
do it so I can give five minutes back

587
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:52,260
I'm actually all done did New York fast

588
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,250
how's that all right

589
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:58,289
thank you guys

590
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:58,289
[Applause]
