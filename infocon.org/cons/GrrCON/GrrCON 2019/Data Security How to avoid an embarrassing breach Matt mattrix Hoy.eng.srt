1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:09,870
also okay good evening

2
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:12,420
gherkin 2019 folks it's my pleasure to

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,849
present mat boy he's gonna be talking to

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,640
you about embarrassing breaches that

5
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:21,300
just sounds well in avoiding

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:24,330
embarrassing breaches he is a fourth

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,789
time fourth time is that right speaker

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,909
at gherkin so I'd like to have you give

9
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:34,179
him a nice Grand Rapids gherkin welcome

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,179
[Applause]

11
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:42,750
all right well let people get settled in

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:48,059
and then in a second we'll get started

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:50,190
so it's going to be hard following the

14
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:52,078
other person who just did the whole gdpr

15
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,019
thing because I'm going to bore you with

16
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,449
data security yet again but this is

17
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:03,719
going to be more of the security section

18
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:07,400
of this so I have been working in

19
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:10,650
InfoSec for quite a long time I've

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:15,540
spoken here before I've keynoted with at

21
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:18,390
geek speed over here and it's been funny

22
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,090
because when geek speed was the keynote

23
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:25,320
speaker here I was his guest speaker

24
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:29,640
last year I was a keynote and geek speed

25
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:31,949
was my guest speaker I in any case those

26
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:36,390
are the ways to go yet get a hold of me

27
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:41,520
and essentially we'll start getting into

28
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:44,729
the talk so this talk is actually the

29
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,640
security bits of data security there's a

30
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:51,060
bit of history of data security and

31
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:54,450
there have been many many changes as to

32
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:59,340
why you hear about breaches in the news

33
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:01,200
almost every day my numbing lis things

34
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:06,570
that people don't actually go ahead and

35
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:09,289
think of when dealing with data is a

36
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:13,230
data security lifecycle the

37
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:13,739
classification of data and what types

38
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,070
are

39
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,990
so prior to actually getting into data

40
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,930
security and becoming a subject matter

41
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:23,790
expert at it I did a lot of incident

42
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,230
response and what happens every time

43
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:29,359
somebody gets popped

44
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:33,500
what were the assets that were lost

45
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:37,560
there are many laws that like the GD P R

46
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:39,990
as well as an EOC CPA which are pretty

47
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,010
much making it as soon as I know that

48
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,520
I've been breached

49
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:47,340
I have to go ahead and report these in

50
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:49,160
ridiculous amounts of times 48 hours a

51
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:53,430
lot of people don't even know which

52
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:57,090
systems were affected in that time let

53
00:02:53,430 --> 00:03:01,800
alone what data was actually lost on the

54
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:05,040
assets so what we're going to talk about

55
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:08,910
is how do I go ahead and solve this

56
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:12,870
through data security some of the people

57
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:15,329
process and technology I'm gonna talk a

58
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:20,270
little bit about the industry standards

59
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:24,660
and some of the locking issues as far as

60
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:27,150
industry standards I'll actually go

61
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,880
ahead and break into some particular

62
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:33,720
threat modeling that some people don't

63
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:37,320
think about when actually dealing with

64
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,300
data security and there are all kinds of

65
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:45,329
things that could possibly come at you

66
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:48,210
and your company from legal to forensics

67
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:52,110
to everything else and we'll get into

68
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:55,280
that and then we'll think about how we

69
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:58,470
want to go ahead and architect things so

70
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:02,970
PCI has pretty much dictated that you

71
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:04,620
must separate certain things we should

72
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:08,940
think about the architecture and when it

73
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:14,010
comes to non-public information as well

74
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:18,690
as anything else that would affect that

75
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:22,200
last talk that you saw on gdpr so why

76
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:26,250
would I need this essentially we have a

77
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,950
lot of laws we have and why DFS which is

78
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,390
a New York

79
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:33,810
Department financial services we have

80
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:37,030
CCPA which is a California version and

81
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:43,660
that thing gdpr which nothing really

82
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:50,049
kind of happened on so who knows what

83
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:54,250
most of these words are can anybody set

84
00:04:50,050 --> 00:05:07,870
we have somebody now you don't have to

85
00:04:54,250 --> 00:05:16,480
know mall but if you know them all yes

86
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:23,890
that is so yes we have winners you both

87
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:27,450
won so yeah we convolute a lot of things

88
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:33,460
by actually using these acronyms and as

89
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:37,570
only a couple people that's pretty much

90
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:40,930
what data security comprises so data

91
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:43,120
rust is essentially what do we do with

92
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:45,640
the data when we save it where is it

93
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,620
saved it's probably saved on some type

94
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:53,800
of sin it's probably saved on a laptop

95
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:56,800
in the event of a breach these are all

96
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,370
the things that are assets that we don't

97
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:03,000
ever even think about that are lost and

98
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:05,290
should we have a breach on the ir side

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,390
what i need to go ahead and figure out

100
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:10,090
is where did we get breached how big was

101
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:13,229
a breach and then where's my data and

102
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:16,510
what types of data do I have

103
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:19,600
so there are preventative technology

104
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:22,440
measures in this acronym jumble which

105
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:26,890
would be DLP for data loss prevention

106
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:30,160
which in itself does not work very well

107
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:33,880
I've been deploying pretty much I've

108
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,340
deployed two types of major major DLP

109
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:40,300
things one of them was formerly known as

110
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:42,280
Vaughn - another one was for my known as

111
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:47,530
web sense and I'll just leave that there

112
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:54,219
and the issue with what happens with DLP

113
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:57,059
is I pretty much don't know whether or

114
00:06:54,220 --> 00:07:00,389
not I have a false positive or I have

115
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:05,530
something that actually is going across

116
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:09,669
the data in motion that is actually

117
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:12,429
leaving my network so data and motion is

118
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:13,628
network level and essentially I'd be

119
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:17,530
sending out an email

120
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:20,800
I'd be going ahead and using onedrive or

121
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:25,448
box or something else but I don't know

122
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:28,300
how it left another technical control

123
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:32,110
you can use that is the hotness of today

124
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:36,099
as UVA which is user behavioral analysis

125
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:38,969
that is another key piece into would

126
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:43,030
this user actually relatively have

127
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:46,449
access to the data and should they have

128
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:52,479
it and what are they doing with it so

129
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:55,000
that will protect DOP UVA and those

130
00:07:52,479 --> 00:08:02,139
things are meant to go ahead and protect

131
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:05,919
the pH I the PII and IP the problem that

132
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:08,490
we have is a lot of us don't know about

133
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:13,568
the history of how we used to do things

134
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:16,330
data security was before they internet

135
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:18,729
we had all this stuff we had ARPANET and

136
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:22,389
then it changed DARPA not and now we

137
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:24,008
have inner internet and Internet changed

138
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:30,340
pretty much everything because

139
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:34,409
everything's in motion so for all you

140
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:39,789
people who have your cissp alphabets

141
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:43,269
we'll go into some history so there are

142
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:48,010
two major major thoughts as to how we go

143
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:50,490
ahead and do things back in 1975 there

144
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:54,080
was the Bema model which is the data

145
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:58,930
always has to be correct which is

146
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:03,260
a read up and write down so basically

147
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:08,089
anybody who had access to a system could

148
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:11,329
always read up but only the people who

149
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:14,630
were the trusted people could write to

150
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:17,019
this and modify a document so it was

151
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:20,029
basically to prevent somebody from

152
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:22,910
putting in things that were either

153
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:29,089
incorrect or additional things that

154
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:34,819
weren't relevant to documents the

155
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:37,519
opposite of this is word the bailout

156
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:40,250
Pedulla model and essentially it is

157
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:44,300
write up and read down the whole idea of

158
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:48,260
write up is you could take anyone from a

159
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:50,029
military potential and they could be low

160
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:52,550
ranks and they could write everything

161
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:57,140
but only in general or somebody up above

162
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:59,810
would be able to to read down so the

163
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:02,420
value of the data was hey I need to go

164
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:04,790
ahead and have access to all of it but I

165
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:09,229
can only access it at a certain level

166
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:12,709
and that was basically an opposing view

167
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:15,320
which said I don't want this data to

168
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:19,040
ever leave if you do not have access to

169
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:21,170
this because you don't have rights this

170
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,449
was essentially the evolution of what

171
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:28,699
became our back role based access

172
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:33,130
control which we'll hear I hadn't yet -

173
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:33,130
which is multi-level security

174
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:42,370
essentially back in the Cold War days we

175
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:46,310
had systems that were actually built to

176
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:50,060
process information have classifications

177
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:54,619
and only certain people would be able to

178
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:56,510
access the particular data when we

179
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,310
designed an architect that the actual

180
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,079
machine

181
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:02,420
everything would be compartmentalized

182
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:05,479
and at a database level so if you did

183
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:08,130
not have access to the database level of

184
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,959
the OS you basic

185
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:15,730
don't have access because you're not

186
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:17,619
allowed to they also went ahead as to go

187
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:21,580
ahead and protect what is known as di u

188
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:23,649
data in use so that Spectre and meltdown

189
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:27,880
would never ever been a thing in the

190
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:30,670
environment so the only platform that

191
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:35,050
does this today is the iSeries which was

192
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:42,760
formerly known as the ass 400 which this

193
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:46,990
guy knows about so who knows what the

194
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:52,360
green bar paper used to look like the

195
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:54,970
big print ends so back in the day before

196
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:59,410
Hadoop before we would go ahead and take

197
00:11:54,970 --> 00:12:02,350
data and make data Lakes data pools how

198
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:05,649
did you get your data you actually had

199
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:07,360
to go ahead and request the data through

200
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:10,779
a data custodian who would pretty much

201
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,060
go yeah I need your management and

202
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:17,220
somebody else on another level to go

203
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,219
ahead and give me that information

204
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,810
essentially we used to have data

205
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:25,540
custodians who would actually give you

206
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:27,369
your printout of the data you requested

207
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:30,010
if you were cleared to go ahead and have

208
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:34,649
it we used to actually have a data

209
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:37,689
custodian who actually did backups now

210
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:40,450
we never used to think about backups but

211
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:44,829
who all knows about the ransomware going

212
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:48,730
around these days everybody and the

213
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:51,069
problem with backups is the sole job of

214
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:53,260
a data custodian was to go ahead and

215
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:57,520
actually do the backups and make sure

216
00:12:53,260 --> 00:13:00,250
the damn things worked the other thing

217
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:03,850
is is they needed to make sure that the

218
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:06,940
most up-to-date data was actually what

219
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:09,130
it said it was imagine not having your

220
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:12,399
correct bank account balance just

221
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:14,410
because data is corrupted but we don't

222
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:18,490
do it anymore and we don't really have

223
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:21,420
data custodian roles as much I have seen

224
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:23,870
this start to reverse with all the

225
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:27,709
other additional laws that are coming in

226
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:31,800
like the ones I mentioned before GDP are

227
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:34,740
CCPA and NY DFS but the thing of it is

228
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:37,859
is now we just get dumpster fires

229
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:42,630
because we throw all the data into every

230
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:44,730
storage area network and essentially we

231
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:47,220
decide that we're gonna make data lakes

232
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:52,590
but we don't know what the data is let's

233
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:55,170
just throw everything everywhere because

234
00:13:52,590 --> 00:14:01,470
we have so much access to so much data

235
00:13:55,170 --> 00:14:03,599
that the that essentially lets just give

236
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:09,120
API rights to everything

237
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:12,870
let's go ahead and take centralized data

238
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,160
and dump it all into one one Lake and we

239
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:17,670
don't even know what we're putting in

240
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:20,430
there at times there have been several

241
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:22,229
instances where people have pretty much

242
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:25,920
been embarrassed because they thought

243
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:29,160
that a private s3 bucket that had

244
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:32,689
sensitive data in it was actually public

245
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:38,010
there has been a lot better work done as

246
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:40,800
far as the s3 buckets in which by

247
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:43,380
default they've gone ahead and pretty

248
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:48,089
much made it so that it's not public by

249
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:52,430
default anymore as I was talking about

250
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:56,630
we had a lot of things changing we have

251
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:59,219
internet we have cloud we have laptop

252
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:01,770
devices mobile devices the data is

253
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:05,550
pretty much everywhere and we probably

254
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:09,829
have no idea what the important is what

255
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:13,829
the importance is of the data let alone

256
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:17,720
where it is all the way to the ability

257
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:25,020
to go ahead and take a SD micro card and

258
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:29,400
shove 128 gigs of data in it so no

259
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:31,860
that's not actually the CIA when we look

260
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:35,110
at data we need need to go ahead and

261
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:39,130
look at the actual triad of everything

262
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:40,930
which is confidentiality which means do

263
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:43,720
I have this lockdown are the proper

264
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:47,410
people who are going to have access to

265
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:49,120
this actually have access to this we

266
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:52,930
need to make sure that the data is

267
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,670
accurate through our integrity and we

268
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:58,870
need to make sure that the data is

269
00:15:54,670 --> 00:16:01,689
available when you actually need it once

270
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:04,210
again that used to be actually the realm

271
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:12,250
of a data custodian but we actually

272
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:15,550
don't have those guys anymore so let's

273
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:19,060
go ahead and talk about a data security

274
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:22,359
lifecycle that is what a data security

275
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:26,380
lifecycle should look like most of us do

276
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:30,130
pretty much only probably mostly the

277
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:36,640
four of them to create the store the use

278
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:40,900
and share as far as archiving those go

279
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:44,650
to actual policies that usually aren't

280
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:48,310
done but let's talk about the

281
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:50,980
destruction of data how many people here

282
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:54,040
are guilty of having the PDF files or

283
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:56,710
the PST files from four years ago when

284
00:16:54,040 --> 00:17:02,260
you are allowed to actually have PST

285
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:05,440
files yeah and that becomes the semi

286
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:08,379
treasure trove of information that was

287
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:15,010
dumped when they got access to all those

288
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:19,060
emails so the last item which is in the

289
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:22,000
teal is destroyed so almost every

290
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:25,389
company actually has a policy saying we

291
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,260
will retain this data for X amount but

292
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:33,220
if you actually have people who hoard

293
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:36,870
data like emails and PST which usually

294
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:40,690
isn't allowed anymore by default anymore

295
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:43,919
that's the most commonly overlooked item

296
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:47,050
is did we go ahead and destroy that data

297
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,490
because once again you can't actually

298
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:51,010
hack or ax

299
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:58,360
feel something that doesn't exist data

300
00:17:51,010 --> 00:18:01,870
not there you can't have it so to us in

301
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:04,510
security data hoarders are dangerous so

302
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:07,419
data hoarders would be people who do

303
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:11,820
their own backup on non-encrypted hard

304
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:17,350
drives you take that thumbnail size USB

305
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:20,169
and essentially they introduce danger to

306
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:27,189
your organization once again you can't

307
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:30,610
steal one ain't there so here are the

308
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:33,880
funny actual incidents that I've

309
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:36,820
actually encountered there was our data

310
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,950
company or I actually ended up having to

311
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:42,700
go ahead and understand their business

312
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:45,190
and unfortunately this was actually a

313
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:48,400
weird one war I couldn't actually go

314
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:51,340
ahead and have them destroy data so they

315
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:55,150
had to go ahead and keep it because it's

316
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:58,959
all R&D and the funny thing is it is of

317
00:18:55,150 --> 00:19:01,780
this is essentially you have like 20

318
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,970
years worth R&D but that R&D is still

319
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:09,730
actually relevant so I can't really go

320
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:14,460
ahead and destroy it for most times when

321
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:17,200
I go ahead and look into an organization

322
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:19,870
they don't have plans to go ahead and

323
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,730
actually protect that data so I honestly

324
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:24,399
need to keep this for years and years

325
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:26,429
and years and years but I actually I'm

326
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,410
not doing anything to go ahead and

327
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:32,080
devalue the data to anyone who want to

328
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:36,179
go ahead and steal it so there are a

329
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:40,000
couple ways that I can devalue the data

330
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:44,320
so that if somebody does exfil it off my

331
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,770
network I can either encrypt it or I can

332
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,020
use some type of rights management to it

333
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:53,290
and pretty much if I have any of those

334
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:55,300
things in place once again you got

335
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:57,690
nothing because the data is pretty much

336
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,690
useless

337
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:07,750
so in that circle that I showed you

338
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:09,820
previously backups are now more

339
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:15,510
important than they actually ever were

340
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:18,309
before with the advent of ransomware so

341
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:21,400
how many of you think you could actually

342
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:23,070
recover if everything was encrypted

343
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,659
today

344
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:30,539
excluding your backups how many actually

345
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:35,190
test a backup and ensure that it works

346
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:38,049
yeah only less than half the room that's

347
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:41,490
kind of scary how many of them actually

348
00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:44,770
are encrypted when you do the backups

349
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:47,320
awesome these people actually know their

350
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:52,210
stuff all right

351
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:54,279
so essentially you can't actually be hit

352
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:58,419
by ransomware and you can't be ransomed

353
00:20:54,279 --> 00:21:01,240
if I know my backups work and if I lose

354
00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:03,690
my backups which is always a fun

355
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:08,110
exercise because that mountain place

356
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:10,120
misplaced a few things they can't really

357
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:12,699
do anything with it if you actually took

358
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:18,100
due care and made sure that you actually

359
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:20,740
encrypted everything so those are very

360
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:25,360
important and we're going to move on to

361
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:28,360
my next favorite thing so in the

362
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:33,490
deficiencies of looking at DOP or the

363
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:37,049
other mechanisms that I haven't place to

364
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:40,059
go ahead and stop data from getting lost

365
00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:45,520
how many people have actually gone ahead

366
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:49,809
and tried to do data discovery here how

367
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:52,270
successful were you and actually getting

368
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:55,629
things besides social security numbers

369
00:21:52,270 --> 00:22:00,490
and credit card numbers or things that

370
00:21:55,630 --> 00:22:06,909
didn't have a loon an algorithm not so

371
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:10,190
much right so unfortunately we don't

372
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:14,540
have the magical things that

373
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:18,850
actually make lives easier so we can go

374
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:21,950
ahead and look at I've got things to do

375
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:24,980
discovery to go ahead and scan all the

376
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:27,950
things on my sand and network but

377
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:30,950
usually these things have way too many

378
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:34,670
false positives for me to even go ahead

379
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:40,180
and look at so sad scan like 20

380
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:40,180
terabytes of data I probably have about

381
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:45,830
15 terabytes where the hits and if I'm

382
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:50,960
looking at the data that actually came

383
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:54,760
in and saying it's got non-identifiable

384
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:58,120
personal information it's got

385
00:22:54,760 --> 00:23:00,860
intellectual property in it it's got

386
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:03,739
other things that the company would deem

387
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:08,840
sensitive it's not going to detect it at

388
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:12,380
all so this is where I would highly

389
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:15,020
suggest that you go ahead and think

390
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:16,700
about it it's like which comes first the

391
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:19,430
chicken or the egg the data is going to

392
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:21,950
be created and it's gonna be created

393
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:24,350
there's no stopping that what could we

394
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:27,830
go ahead and do to actually go ahead and

395
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:30,260
keep tabs on it well we can go ahead and

396
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:34,520
start classifying it but what does that

397
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:37,100
actually go ahead and buy me the thing

398
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:39,379
of it is is what it actually does and

399
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:45,530
goes ahead and buys me if I start

400
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:47,540
classifying data today is that these are

401
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:50,200
called machine learning and AI and

402
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:53,510
things that are supposed to go find it

403
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:56,810
by actually putting metadata tagging and

404
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:59,540
classifying this stuff I actually might

405
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:02,570
have a chance of actually teaching the

406
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:04,129
machines who learn what is not a false

407
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:07,100
positive and that's been the biggest

408
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:11,000
problem I'm trying to go find data

409
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:13,699
within your organization so when should

410
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,180
I classify data every time I touch a

411
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:19,490
document every time I create a document

412
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:24,670
this is going to end up helping the

413
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:28,910
other detection methods to actually work

414
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:33,320
so data is essentially like water and a

415
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:38,900
drop a file that's easy we can pretty

416
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:41,810
much solve that today but what are we

417
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:45,020
gonna do when you've got petabytes where

418
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:51,440
the data where do you even go ahead and

419
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:54,950
start that's a difficulty so by starting

420
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:59,780
data classification you have to start

421
00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:03,620
somewhere so uncreation

422
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:06,410
on modification that's one of the things

423
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:08,419
that you have to go ahead and do so that

424
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:10,880
you can teach the machine learning and

425
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:14,810
AI from any product to actually have a

426
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:18,470
chance to go ahead and find it when you

427
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:21,470
actually classify the data class when

428
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:23,900
you actually classify data essentially

429
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:28,520
you're giving yourself half a chance in

430
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:31,120
the fact that oh I know what a good item

431
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:33,379
looks like as far as I classified it

432
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:37,699
let's go ahead and look for some more of

433
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:40,040
that so when you actually take time to

434
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:44,480
go ahead and implement a classification

435
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:48,409
and metadata tagging you can go ahead

436
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:52,700
and pretty much get the benefit from

437
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:56,450
knowing what is in my backups when I do

438
00:25:52,700 --> 00:26:00,020
discovery that metadata tagging will

439
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:03,350
find that data much faster if I have a

440
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:05,780
incident such as a breach I would have

441
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:11,300
to go ahead and know what my inventory

442
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:14,450
is and by having the pre classified data

443
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:17,030
and if I knew a segment was attacked I

444
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:20,750
can pretty much meet that requirement

445
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:22,100
hey this segment got hit here's all the

446
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:25,610
data that was important

447
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:27,830
this has PII and actually fulfill any of

448
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:31,550
the breached notifications that I'm

449
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:33,409
gonna be on the hook for it's also going

450
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:35,659
to improve the data loss prevention

451
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:36,560
capabilities because I'm not actually

452
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:40,040
going to look

453
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:43,460
at raw data I'm going to look at raw

454
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:46,280
data and run that pass through a

455
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:48,800
signature model to go look for that data

456
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:54,050
but I'll also go ahead and try and look

457
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:56,000
for the tag so essentially if somebody

458
00:26:54,050 --> 00:27:00,290
had bothered to go ahead and tag it as

459
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,140
confidential or confidential with MPI or

460
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:06,980
any of those other tags that can help me

461
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:09,920
find the data it's essentially not going

462
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:11,210
to go ahead and let it through this also

463
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:14,660
helps when you're using rights

464
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:18,320
management so that you can go ahead and

465
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:21,550
actually start walking down and

466
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,300
encrypting things as soon as they become

467
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:26,659
confidential and you don't want these

468
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:29,330
things to leave it also gives you a

469
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:37,070
situational awareness as to how much

470
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:40,040
stuff I'm putting on a sand so we'll go

471
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:43,550
into other parts of data we have

472
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:45,200
different types of data we have

473
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:47,060
structured data which is usually the

474
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,970
easiest to deal with because they're all

475
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:54,700
in databases but where do we have the

476
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:58,190
most issues the unstructured data and

477
00:27:54,700 --> 00:28:03,170
where do I have the most difficult

478
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:08,960
issues as far as finding items for my

479
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:11,090
DLP to detect for my assets and to

480
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:16,520
actually have a clue where anything is

481
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:20,449
and what's important so any of the

482
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:22,340
Microsoft Office files most of those can

483
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:24,920
be detected very easily if you're

484
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:26,780
looking for PCI information in an excel

485
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,850
file we have the power of lune

486
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:31,250
algorithms to go ahead and actually

487
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:34,250
detect those but what about everything

488
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:37,970
else account numbers that actually don't

489
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:41,090
go ahead and use Luna algorithms for

490
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:43,520
banks those are going to be very unique

491
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:46,280
and most of the time the best shot you

492
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,740
have at detecting anything leaving your

493
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:50,129
network or getting stored on a network

494
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:52,650
is using

495
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:56,610
exact data matching which you have to

496
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:58,560
tell it I'm looking for this data exact

497
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:00,719
data matching actually works pretty darn

498
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:03,600
well except for when you get into the

499
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:07,170
millions or above in record volume

500
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,850
because every time you're going to going

501
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:10,980
to look for the account number and a

502
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:13,439
first name and last name it becomes

503
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:15,360
rather intensive and the fact that I

504
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,160
have to actually do the search for it

505
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,070
and you're never ever going to finish

506
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:22,740
your discovery if you actually have over

507
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:25,110
millions of accounts to go ahead and

508
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:28,890
find those if I go ahead and classify

509
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:31,229
this and as metadata tags I can rely on

510
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:36,990
the metadata tags to go ahead and at

511
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:40,410
least go this is probably important so

512
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:44,580
in solving this we have to look at this

513
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:48,420
in a sense of people and process and

514
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:51,300
technology so in order to go ahead and

515
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:55,520
actually implement a program to go ahead

516
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:57,780
and get this data security together

517
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:01,020
gonna have to have those stakeholders

518
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:05,010
are gonna get you your budget where I

519
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:07,530
see data security fail mostly is there

520
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:10,080
are no policies and standards that are

521
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:14,580
enforceable in regards to actually

522
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:18,929
handling the data because as a person in

523
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:24,689
a sock I found a thing it notified me in

524
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:27,510
DLP that Jane Doe was copying the stuff

525
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:30,540
to USB but I can't do anything with it

526
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:33,120
because I never had the proper policies

527
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:37,770
or standards to go ahead and actually do

528
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:39,629
that it's also a branch in the incident

529
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:44,960
handling which is if I see this stuff

530
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:49,410
move I'd better do something about it so

531
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:51,900
essentially we're gonna need everybody

532
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:57,390
in an organization to go ahead and use

533
00:30:51,900 --> 00:31:00,870
data classification so what typically

534
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:03,480
works is to get pilot groups to go ahead

535
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:05,520
and start using these tags

536
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,340
and then rolling them out in an

537
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:12,000
organization from group to group to

538
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:14,780
group the difficulty we have with data

539
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,180
classification tools that are being used

540
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:20,389
is they don't work if people don't use

541
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:23,370
them and a lot of people are going to

542
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:25,020
not use them at first we have to go

543
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:29,850
ahead and make sure that the people want

544
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:33,180
to use those particular tools to

545
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:36,600
classify data you're going to have to

546
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:39,960
educate your people and that should be a

547
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:43,850
part of pretty much everything else

548
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:47,310
pretty much people are educated today on

549
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:50,129
what a phishing attack looks like but

550
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:55,830
hardly anybody here I don't think has

551
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:58,590
actually had a class on mandatory or

552
00:31:55,830 --> 00:32:01,949
otherwise as to what the sensitive data

553
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:04,949
look like to the company so if you don't

554
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:09,050
know about it we're not gonna win

555
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:09,050
because we didn't educate people so

556
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:16,550
process is going to be making sure those

557
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:19,260
standards and policies are put together

558
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:22,379
we are going to have to go ahead and use

559
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:24,240
and take the effort to educate people so

560
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:27,470
that they understand that data

561
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:31,260
classification is just as important as

562
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:34,560
those phishing campaigns that we educate

563
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:36,150
everybody else about we're probably

564
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:39,720
going to have to go ahead and also

565
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:43,820
educate folks about what the policies

566
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:47,940
are possibly go ahead and actually have

567
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:51,330
violations in which somebody's going to

568
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:55,380
have to be held accountable or purposely

569
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:57,960
knowing that they broke a policy that

570
00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:00,090
was in the company this one actually

571
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,730
gets pretty tough because you have to

572
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:07,020
have all those things in place before

573
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:10,740
and unfortunately nobody really does

574
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:14,090
things unless you're working with the

575
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:16,260
classified data in a government type

576
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:18,570
environment

577
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:21,840
I've never ever seen issues in

578
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:30,020
government but I definitely see a lot of

579
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:34,230
issues in private industries so

580
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:37,200
essentially I would say out of all the

581
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:41,210
things we want to actually rely and

582
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:45,780
educate our people as to what the

583
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:50,790
ramifications are for mishandling or

584
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:54,570
misusing data and essentially we have

585
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:58,020
that technology that I was talking about

586
00:33:54,570 --> 00:34:02,689
like the classification and metadata

587
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:07,470
tagging tools the data discovery tools

588
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:10,168
DLP and jazz be pretty much all those

589
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:12,480
things are there but none of these

590
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:15,899
things work when you leave these things

591
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,210
in monitor mode don't tune them don't do

592
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:21,629
anything with it we've had talks about

593
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:24,119
seams before or it's like it seems

594
00:34:21,629 --> 00:34:27,710
catching everything but nobody actually

595
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:31,379
did anything we've had talks about IPS

596
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:32,970
or none of it was set the block you're

597
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:35,129
gonna actually have to invest in

598
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:37,529
blocking you're gonna actually have to

599
00:34:35,129 --> 00:34:39,118
invest in enforcement and you're

600
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:41,879
actually going to have to go ahead and

601
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,980
invest in tuning your technology if

602
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:47,839
you're going to implement it or don't

603
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,840
even bother to implement it at all

604
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:58,290
so there are industry standards for data

605
00:34:53,820 --> 00:35:02,190
security and one of them is the CMMI did

606
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:06,600
a maturity model that thing is totally

607
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:08,640
rough it's very very long and I don't

608
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:12,210
recommend it unless you're dealing with

609
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,980
a very mature organization but if you

610
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:17,850
need to go ahead and understand what

611
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:20,580
good and perfect should look like for

612
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:25,140
data security and what data security

613
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:28,380
maturity will look like the CMMI does a

614
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:30,120
pretty good job but once again it's

615
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:34,050
pretty much like a net

616
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:35,759
or anything else unless the organization

617
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:38,490
is willing to go ahead and buy in and

618
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:45,000
invest it gets super tough to go ahead

619
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:48,810
and actually put together so let's go

620
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:54,200
ahead and move into a few tabletop

621
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:54,200
exercises and this is going to be fun

622
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:05,730
what could go wrong well I've got legal

623
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:10,610
and it's not displaying hold on I have

624
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:10,610
to exit out of PowerPoint for a second

625
00:36:37,809 --> 00:36:40,990
all right

626
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:59,070
yeah there's my street so what most

627
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:01,410
people don't actually go ahead and think

628
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:04,050
about is nobody's actually bothered to

629
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:06,920
go ahead and do a tabletop exercise as

630
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:10,080
to how data matters in their in their

631
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:12,330
organization so what are the possible

632
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:15,060
threats that I can absolutely have I

633
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:17,310
could have a mass acts filtration in a

634
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:20,430
data breach or all my databases are

635
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:24,470
showing and everything else what does it

636
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:32,160
actually go ahead and affect and

637
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:35,339
essentially I put the CMMI diem MREs in

638
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,149
there so what I have that I can go ahead

639
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:41,790
and stop it

640
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:45,960
I can put in a discovery DOP endpoint

641
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:51,930
network so who's gonna actually steal

642
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:55,590
this essentially anybody who has access

643
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:58,200
to it and can get to it so how can I

644
00:37:55,590 --> 00:38:00,600
reduce this well I want to go ahead and

645
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:03,810
actually know what my assets are spend

646
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:06,210
the time to do discovery spend the time

647
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:08,660
to actually do ahead and go ahead and do

648
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:11,610
some of the data classification and

649
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:15,000
essentially make sure that I know where

650
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:17,520
my assets are we can go ahead and

651
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:24,120
actually take a look at this as a

652
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:26,310
holistic enterprise and once again if I

653
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:29,310
were to go ahead and classify my data I

654
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:34,950
can enable those other security tools to

655
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:38,000
do their job in a much easier rate what

656
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:40,620
can I do in the the actual data center I

657
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,920
can actually reduce my risk by making

658
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:47,540
sure these backups work in addition to

659
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:50,750
that I can go ahead and reduce my risk

660
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:55,200
by actually taking architecture and

661
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:59,640
treating non-public information or pH I

662
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:01,620
information as well as I would PCI

663
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:04,250
information that actually has to be

664
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:07,160
segmented

665
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:09,410
what can I go ahead and do in the cloud

666
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:12,859
once again I can go ahead and make sure

667
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:16,160
that I'm categorizing these things as

668
00:39:12,859 --> 00:39:18,080
far as making sure I do discovery scans

669
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:22,430
and everything else that I'm supposed to

670
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:26,930
be doing so that I understand where my

671
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:28,910
data went if I classify it your Cosby's

672
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:32,210
probably going to have a whole heck of a

673
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:35,420
lot easier time looking at putting

674
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:37,930
rights management into where your data

675
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:41,420
is going and identifying it

676
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:45,230
most of the Cosby's actually now work

677
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:48,410
with the to data to major data

678
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:53,359
classification programs out there that

679
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:55,839
are pretty effective let's get back into

680
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,840
the side

681
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,078
all right

682
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:36,579
so once again the last thing that we can

683
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:40,280
go ahead and do is think about actually

684
00:40:36,579 --> 00:40:40,990
architecting these things we've as an

685
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:45,619
industry

686
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:50,629
implemented PCI segmented architecture

687
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:52,780
items or PCI data because people don't

688
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:54,980
want to pay those extra percentage rates

689
00:40:52,780 --> 00:41:00,650
well what if we were to actually go

690
00:40:54,980 --> 00:41:03,980
ahead and take thi data know where it is

691
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:07,550
air-gap it and segment it what if we

692
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:10,609
were to go ahead and take the non-public

693
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:13,550
personally identification personally

694
00:41:10,609 --> 00:41:16,430
identifiable information and actually go

695
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:19,250
ahead and air-gapped that it's not too

696
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:21,589
far off in which we could go ahead and

697
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:24,980
do such a thing because we already know

698
00:41:21,589 --> 00:41:26,660
how to do it for PCI so if I knew that I

699
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:29,990
was in an industry that had to deal with

700
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:34,520
pH I or something else why would I not

701
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:37,308
want to go ahead and put my data that's

702
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:42,920
actually worth something in a non

703
00:41:37,309 --> 00:41:45,109
protected environment so you can go

704
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:48,170
ahead and implement mandatory access

705
00:41:45,109 --> 00:41:53,420
controls in which you can only access

706
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:56,809
things via Citrix farms or VDI farms you

707
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:59,000
can go ahead and make sure that when

708
00:41:56,809 --> 00:42:01,069
somebody is going to access the good

709
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,119
stuff you're going to implement

710
00:42:01,069 --> 00:42:06,799
multi-factor authentication in there

711
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:10,069
you're gonna want to go ahead and at

712
00:42:06,799 --> 00:42:13,430
least design it so that you would

713
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:15,859
protect it as you would PCI data because

714
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:18,160
you know where your data is so by

715
00:42:15,859 --> 00:42:20,808
starting with the creation of data

716
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:23,930
classifying it bothering the classifying

717
00:42:20,809 --> 00:42:26,089
it bothering to classify it and actually

718
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:28,040
knowing where it is you can then start

719
00:42:26,089 --> 00:42:31,099
actually thinking about how do I want to

720
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:36,490
architect my systems to go ahead and

721
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:39,520
protect all that particular data so

722
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:45,240
those are things that

723
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:55,230
we definitely can do much better and

724
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:55,229
somehow I lost slide

725
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:26,800
your second alright so slides are not

726
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:26,799
working it seems to be stuck there we go

727
00:43:36,569 --> 00:43:39,919
back to architecture

728
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:51,310
no it's not

729
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:07,060
sorry about that guys so I'll go ahead

730
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,710
and talk about the architecture there

731
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:15,790
are things that I can go ahead and do to

732
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:18,900
actually go ahead and solve things and

733
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:21,160
by building my particular architecture

734
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,450
what can I do I can go ahead and

735
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:26,109
actually leave some of these things

736
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:28,149
exposed to purposely do this use

737
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:31,090
something like honey docks to go ahead

738
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:34,780
and find out where my shares are that

739
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:37,110
shouldn't actually be out there I can go

740
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:40,080
ahead and implement rights management

741
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:43,420
which are going to encrypt the

742
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:46,619
particular documents and make sure that

743
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:52,660
any of the X field data is worthless I

744
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:54,880
could do full file level encryption and

745
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:58,540
we can go ahead and make sure that we

746
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:02,590
actually protect it using row base

747
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:06,160
access controls in which if I have

748
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:10,030
sensitive data I basically don't allow

749
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:12,490
you to access it one of the things we

750
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:16,660
don't do very well is when we put

751
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:18,459
together LDAP and AD we forget about

752
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:20,950
what the groups were meant to be and

753
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:23,380
then the groups end up expanding to be

754
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:25,000
way too big and then you have people

755
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:28,720
with permissions that they ought not

756
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,320
have so when thinking about this your

757
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:35,529
iam program is going to be super

758
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:38,700
important as to protecting your data as

759
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:41,590
well because if you actually have your

760
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:43,960
identity access management together then

761
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:45,609
they shouldn't be seen these things on

762
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:51,010
shares they shouldn't be seen these

763
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:55,470
things anywhere else so you need to go

764
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:57,609
ahead and understand your your

765
00:45:55,470 --> 00:46:01,180
environment you need to understand where

766
00:45:57,609 --> 00:46:03,369
the data actually lives and we should

767
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:05,618
think about this as a risk-based thing

768
00:46:03,369 --> 00:46:09,730
if I have important intellectual

769
00:46:05,619 --> 00:46:13,150
property if I have sensitive data it

770
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:15,579
should particularly leave the area

771
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:18,160
we've done this in PCI we can do with

772
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:19,869
data but we're going to actually have to

773
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:25,328
go ahead and define what data is

774
00:46:19,869 --> 00:46:27,730
actually sensitive essentially you

775
00:46:25,329 --> 00:46:30,609
should always be testing to see if

776
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:33,490
you're able to exfiltrate the data

777
00:46:30,609 --> 00:46:38,109
against your DLP systems or other

778
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:39,160
preventive controls encryption the key

779
00:46:38,109 --> 00:46:41,640
should be managed

780
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:45,578
you should be expiring everything else

781
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:54,549
and this is basically the end I'll see

782
00:46:45,579 --> 00:46:57,660
you all at Z's question done I'm

783
00:46:54,549 --> 00:47:01,470
actually trying to be agnostic about it

784
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:06,609
most of the ones do it but once again as

785
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:09,549
far as doing data discovery the issue I

786
00:47:06,609 --> 00:47:12,420
have is once again training the data

787
00:47:09,549 --> 00:47:16,210
discovery to do things by implementing

788
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:18,460
data classification and actually

789
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:22,660
starting to learn them edit metadata

790
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:24,940
tags that I put in I can then train the

791
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:27,160
discovery to get a look at all the

792
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:29,680
metadata tags and see if they're

793
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:32,109
actually matching and then once I learn

794
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,598
the metadata tags plus I learn the

795
00:47:32,109 --> 00:47:39,130
contents of everything that I actually

796
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:41,020
have a decent type of discovery that's

797
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:43,420
what I find the biggest problem is is

798
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:48,220
false positives especially when you have

799
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:51,099
years and years and years of stuff so

800
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:55,750
that goes back to the file the drop of

801
00:47:51,099 --> 00:47:58,299
water where I have one thing that's easy

802
00:47:55,750 --> 00:48:01,289
what I do want to have tens of thousands

803
00:47:58,299 --> 00:48:01,288
or tens of millions
