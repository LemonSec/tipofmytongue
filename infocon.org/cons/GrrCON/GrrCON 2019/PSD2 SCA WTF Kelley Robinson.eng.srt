1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:06,629
morning everybody happy gherkin to you

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,460
happy Thursday apparently there's free

3
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:09,959
beer pretty soon right this is the first

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,670
time I've ever been to conference it has

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,210
free beer so hopefully you'll take good

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:19,320
advantage of that this speaker that we

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,490
have is Kelly Robinson she is she's got

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,430
a really cool title I love this

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,689
developer evangelist I want to be known

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,430
as one of those so she's gonna talk

11
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:27,630
about lots of fun acronyms as we've been

12
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,580
trying to figure out for a little while

13
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:36,239
here so Kelly thanks for being here

14
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:38,309
thank you for having me don't worry

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:43,019
you'll get way more enthused after I

16
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:45,239
start talking about you missions so for

17
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,430
today I figured nobody could get enough

18
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,730
of gdpr so I want to introduce another

19
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:53,489
four-letter acronym or you know I set up

20
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,660
your morning's so we're going to be

21
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:56,519
talking about the second payment

22
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,589
services directive which is European

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,989
climate regulation and specifically the

24
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:06,830
language around strong customer

25
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:06,830
authentication and thinking mean okay

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:14,159
okay I will do that I don't wander too

27
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,830
far cool so much like gdpr a lot of this

28
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,430
regulation is going to be applicable to

29
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,710
companies outside of the EU and so this

30
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,540
is still going to affect your US company

31
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,399
so even if you don't operate in Europe

32
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,509
right now a lot of this content is still

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,710
going to be relevant we're gonna be

34
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:30,329
talking about some authentication

35
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,490
strategies that are relevant for both

36
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:35,820
authorizing payments but authorizing

37
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:38,429
other sensitive actions as well so my

38
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,169
name is Kelly Robinson I work at Twilio

39
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,229
how many people have heard of Twilio a

40
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,630
few of you so we make communications API

41
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,189
so anytime you like need to call your

42
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,960
uber driver you're actually calling a

43
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:51,329
Twilio number then routes to your bird

44
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,009
driver that appointment notification

45
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:55,320
from your dentist is probably coming

46
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,820
through a service like us so I work

47
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,589
specifically on Twilio x' account

48
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,750
security products so Twilio acquired

49
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,490
of--they about five years ago so we have

50
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,250
api's for things like two-factor

51
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,509
authentication and phone verification

52
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:08,429
and I specifically work as a developer

53
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,169
evangelist on the developer experience

54
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,940
side of that so that includes

55
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,160
maintaining things like our third-party

56
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,560
helper libraries and Lane

57
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,270
DK's I write a lot of sample code and

58
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,760
sample projects to help developers

59
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,710
implement our projects and that also

60
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,329
includes documentation and developer

61
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:25,850
education and so I do spend a decent

62
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,290
amount of my time kind of advocating for

63
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,150
authentication and identity best

64
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:32,359
practices to developers that don't spend

65
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:34,190
a lot of time thinking about security so

66
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,020
I have some experience being on the

67
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:39,410
education side of educating developers

68
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:41,030
on security best practices so let's

69
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:44,060
start by kind of talking about the size

70
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:46,880
of this problem account takeover so once

71
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:49,100
hacker gets access to your account and

72
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:52,220
you know gets into your account and can

73
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:54,769
do nefarious things with whatever you

74
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:56,870
that account has access to this is a big

75
00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:00,440
problem so it peaked at about five

76
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:03,110
billion dollars in 2012 there dropped

77
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,790
off in 2015 when chip-and-pin was

78
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:07,850
introduced in the u.s. this is us

79
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:09,470
specific but you know this has gone back

80
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,930
up and so in the last couple of years

81
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:14,330
it's spiked again and in 2018 80 no

82
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:16,880
fraud cost about four billion dollars

83
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:19,070
and so that's kind of where even though

84
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,840
this is us specific data you know this

85
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,970
is a problem everywhere hackers are

86
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,170
getting into accounts as we know and so

87
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:27,440
this is something that we want to

88
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:29,839
protect that the session and login is no

89
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,590
longer quite enough to protect the

90
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,320
end-user from getting their payments or

91
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:39,260
monetary I fight actions that are

92
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,579
sensitive and I have to be causing you

93
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,859
know reparations and that kind of thing

94
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,180
and so that's a big part of the reason

95
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,160
that we're trying to find more ways to

96
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,959
secure these types of payments and

97
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,209
that's where the regulation comes in

98
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:52,730
behind this and so this is payment

99
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:55,610
services directive two there was a

100
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:57,649
payment services directive one so the

101
00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:00,230
original payment services directive was

102
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:03,230
back in 2007 so this was 12 years ago

103
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:06,290
and the goals behind this were a lot of

104
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:07,910
unifying European payments and so this

105
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,190
was things like a single market for EU

106
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:12,290
payments making cross-border payments a

107
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:14,480
lot easier so if you've heard of

108
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:15,829
companies like transferwise they do a

109
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,810
really cool thing where they allow you

110
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:19,640
to exchange money across currencies and

111
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:23,240
behind the scenes they're actually doing

112
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,830
currency exchanges in or transactions

113
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,449
between peers in

114
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,250
same currency and just kind of like

115
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:30,650
floating all of that money between a

116
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,949
pool of users so that if I want to give

117
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,969
somebody euros they're actually transit

118
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:37,490
transacting that with other people that

119
00:04:34,969 --> 00:04:39,680
want to have gift somebody else heroes

120
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,419
so they're trying to minimize the amount

121
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,879
of like actual currency exchange that

122
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:45,409
happens they also wanted a fuel

123
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:47,599
innovations in the payments and the

124
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:48,979
finance industry and that happens if

125
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:50,780
some of these companies like pay safe

126
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:52,580
and transfer wise and Clara are examples

127
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,530
of companies that were able to exist

128
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,990
after the original payment services

129
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:59,059
directive came into effect in Europe in

130
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:01,159
2007 and so as you can imagine

131
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,259
traditional banks hate this right

132
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:04,849
because all of a sudden they have all

133
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:07,310
these new competitors that are able to

134
00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:09,020
operate in ways that they previously

135
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,940
couldn't because the regulations didn't

136
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,039
allow them to so with the right

137
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:15,469
authorization now companies can become a

138
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,900
payment institution and do things like

139
00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:20,270
basically act as a bank and act as a

140
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:23,270
mediator between payments and act as a

141
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,889
mediator for e-commerce transactions and

142
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:27,139
checkouts and login and that kind of

143
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:29,599
thing so like I said traditional banks

144
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:31,669
hated this but you know European

145
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:33,830
regulators decided that this was worth

146
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:36,770
it to kind of democratize the finance

147
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:38,690
industry in Europe and that brings us to

148
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:42,139
PSV - so this was legislation that was

149
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:44,150
introduced in 2015 and that's updated a

150
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:47,240
lot of the regulations on the original

151
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:49,729
PSD but mainly what it did is it started

152
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,650
applying to and talking a lot of

153
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:54,139
language around card-not-present or

154
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:56,060
online transactions as you can imagine

155
00:05:54,139 --> 00:06:01,460
there's a lot of different security

156
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:03,830
considerations if you're having the

157
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,508
credit card physically with you so you

158
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:08,568
no longer have access to things like a

159
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:10,669
chip this is something that Europe was

160
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:13,250
ahead of the curve with they introduced

161
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:15,948
chips before the US did that was more

162
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:17,419
widely accepted there but online they

163
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:19,099
wanted to kind of get ahead of this and

164
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:21,049
make sure that online transactions were

165
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:23,240
being protected in the same way physical

166
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:26,900
transactions were and there's three main

167
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,069
pillars - PSD - so the first is probably

168
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,589
the thing that gets talked about the

169
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:33,289
most is this whole idea of open ap is

170
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:35,569
and open banking and so the idea here is

171
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:38,209
that a lot of banking institutions now

172
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:38,950
have to open up all the data so that

173
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:40,960
other piece

174
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:43,120
can access that so things like

175
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,400
transaction data it can be anonymized

176
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,040
obviously but you have to be making it

177
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,500
able for people to access their own data

178
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:53,200
and do things and build companies around

179
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,450
that again traditional financial

180
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,340
institutions hated this but it has also

181
00:06:55,450 --> 00:07:00,550
opened up the way for people to add a

182
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:03,250
lot of more interesting and useful to

183
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:06,100
lis and on top of the kind of old-school

184
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,420
banking that we had in Europe not gonna

185
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,850
be talking to town about open banking

186
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:11,290
today the second pillar is about data

187
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:14,170
encryption and so that's just kind of

188
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:16,570
how the data is stored and transit and

189
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:18,070
at rest and the thing that we are going

190
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:20,250
to be talking about today is this idea

191
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,540
and enforcement around strong customer

192
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,590
authentication and so that's the third

193
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:26,050
pillar that we're going to be getting

194
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:28,330
into so you're like cool Kelly this is

195
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:31,690
like legislation from 2015 why are we

196
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:34,479
still talking about this well I this is

197
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:36,700
you know somewhat dated legislation but

198
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,680
they're still looming deadlines and so

199
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:41,440
in 2019 this idea of strong customer

200
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:46,360
authentication for purchases over $30 is

201
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,680
a newly enforced regulation that banks

202
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,090
are going to have to and payment

203
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,970
institutions are going to have to start

204
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:53,739
doing so if you do any business in

205
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:56,800
Europe that involves payments any

206
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,510
payment over 30 euros all the sudden has

207
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,430
to have this idea of strong customer

208
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:02,650
authentication which is essentially

209
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:06,340
multi-factor authentication for payments

210
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:07,810
applied to the payment transaction and

211
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:10,000
this applies in three different cases

212
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:11,830
and so it's not just when the person is

213
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,570
making the payment that's option B

214
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,550
they're initiates the electronic payment

215
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:17,620
transaction so that would be like a

216
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:20,650
money transfer payment but it also

217
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:22,600
applies when there is accesses payment

218
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,760
account online and so that would be like

219
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,800
a login that could be like accessing a

220
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:29,200
statement page or something like that

221
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,870
and then the third way that when this

222
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,760
applies is when it carries out any kind

223
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,740
of risky action through a remote Channel

224
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,059
and so this can be interpreted as

225
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,340
something like adding a new payment

226
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:40,929
recipient or changing the address on

227
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,880
file or changing the credit card that

228
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:45,400
you have stored on your account or

229
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,620
something like that so SCA applies in

230
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,959
all of those cases and what does this

231
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:52,120
really mean so much like the MFA that we

232
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,589
might be familiar with for login

233
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,589
the authentication factors that are

234
00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:58,210
available have to be you have to use two

235
00:08:56,589 --> 00:09:00,040
of these three types of factors where a

236
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,480
factor can either be something you know

237
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,730
a knowledge factor this is something

238
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,650
like a password or a pin something that

239
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:07,210
you have a possession factor this is

240
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:10,420
something like a mobile phone or a

241
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:12,460
physical key or something that you are

242
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:15,069
an inherence factor this is biometric

243
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,260
data face ID touch ID retina scans that

244
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:19,870
kind of thing

245
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:21,520
and this already happens in the world of

246
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:23,800
physical payments so I've mentioned this

247
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,089
before we have this idea of chip and pin

248
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,890
that's something that you have the

249
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:29,290
actual card and something that you know

250
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:31,180
the father you know the four six digit

251
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:34,029
PIN that you're implementing adding when

252
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:36,520
you get a debit card transaction or

253
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:39,040
check out at a Mart with that with you

254
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:41,170
have the card physically available but

255
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,480
on top of that they wanted to make this

256
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:45,579
apply to online transactions and so the

257
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,330
legislation in this at the beginning

258
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:50,589
September 14th of this year

259
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:53,710
non-compliant payments for SC and the EU

260
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:55,690
would be declined and so this is like

261
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:57,640
wow okay we're getting towards the end

262
00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:02,260
of October how many of you have like

263
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:05,890
heard of this one person one and a half

264
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:07,870
people cool so even people in Europe

265
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:09,910
hadn't really heard of this and so that

266
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:12,160
deadline like came and they were like oh

267
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:16,300
 this is not actually going to

268
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:18,819
happen so in June three months before

269
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,709
the deadline of this and like if you've

270
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,390
worked with engineers you know that

271
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:24,430
things like this can't be built

272
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:25,990
overnight and it's unlikely that

273
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,479
especially when you're dealing with

274
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:30,370
payment transactions that is going to be

275
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,130
even built in three months so in June of

276
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:35,890
this year the European Banking Authority

277
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:38,260
issued this opinion which is basically

278
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:39,279
their guidance towards how to do this it

279
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,260
was like oh crap

280
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,850
no one's actually prepared for this

281
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,620
estimates were that if they were

282
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:47,110
actually going to enforce this in

283
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:49,810
September it was going to cost the EU

284
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:52,120
like 57 billion dollars in lost

285
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:55,020
transactions and so this was going to be

286
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:57,940
a huge deal a lot of economic value lost

287
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:59,829
not only like 40% of companies were even

288
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:02,740
remotely prepared for this in the you

289
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:03,660
even back in the summer and so in their

290
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,910
opinion they were like

291
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:08,790
okay you can get a little bit more time

292
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:11,730
this is the official guidance limited

293
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:13,589
additional time back in June and so the

294
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:16,200
UK and Ireland yes this does still apply

295
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:18,810
to the UK given whatever is happening

296
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,180
with brexit they are still this still

297
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:22,349
applies to the UK but the UK and Ireland

298
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:26,099
said they were going to take it another

299
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:27,600
18 months to enforce this Germany issued

300
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,850
like they were also going to take a

301
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,230
delay a vague amount of time

302
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,240
Hungary said that they were gonna take

303
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,410
another 12 months and that's kind of one

304
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,060
of the interesting things about this

305
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,800
legislation is that the EU and the

306
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,839
European Banking Authority issues these

307
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,300
opinions but they're leaving it up to

308
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:45,480
the individual countries to decide how

309
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:47,459
to enforce the legislation and so

310
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,290
there's you know even though the EU is

311
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,240
kind of this like economic body for the

312
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:53,310
region and the goals of this are largely

313
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,250
around making sure that people have a

314
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:57,930
lot of consistency there is still some

315
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:01,620
inconsistency with the enforcement side

316
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:04,410
of this but fascinatingly last week they

317
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:06,770
issued another opinion that basically

318
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:08,610
said you guys have to enforce this by

319
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:10,470
the end of 2020

320
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:12,350
and so they have basically like another

321
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:15,720
year they've got a little bit more than

322
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:17,580
like 13 months to get this done and

323
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,740
hopefully most people will be ready in

324
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:21,180
that time so a lot of the stuff that I'm

325
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,190
talking about you might be hearing a lot

326
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,839
more about in the next year still

327
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:27,120
because people are still working on

328
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,740
doing this and making sure that this is

329
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,610
something that they can be compliant

330
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:35,220
with before this new deadline and the

331
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:37,050
delay is good because implementing

332
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,390
strong customer authentication isn't

333
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:41,069
quite as straightforward as adding mfa

334
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:43,170
to payments I mean now that's a

335
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:45,480
straightforward problem either but there

336
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:48,000
are specific requirements like this idea

337
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,590
of dynamic linking and dynamic linking

338
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,540
means that the authorization or the

339
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:54,240
effect occation has to be tied to the

340
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,770
individual payment and there are four

341
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,450
requirements for this that we'll walk

342
00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:00,660
through but this is an example of a

343
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:02,730
dynamic linking transaction it basically

344
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:05,100
has to include the information in the

345
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:07,290
message to user and so you see here that

346
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,480
this has two important things this has

347
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:12,120
you know the one-time password in this

348
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,220
code or in this message but it also has

349
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,380
the company that you're paying to the

350
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:19,839
payee in this case flourish and Blatz

351
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,730
is what this being authorized you're

352
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:26,470
paying to Gilderoy Lockhart and that's

353
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:28,209
713 euros so the goal here for the first

354
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,949
requirement for dynamic linking is to

355
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:31,149
ensure that the user is confident that

356
00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:33,910
they are authenticating the right

357
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:36,430
transaction so the payers made aware of

358
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:38,649
the amount in the payment transaction

359
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:42,609
and the payee so that was what we saw in

360
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:44,500
the last page the goal for the next

361
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,690
requirement the authentication code

362
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,639
generated is specific to the amount of

363
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,949
the payment transaction you don't

364
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,470
actually need to derive that code from

365
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:55,269
the transaction details you could do

366
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,579
that but you just need to maintain a

367
00:13:55,269 --> 00:14:00,040
reference so you could basically have a

368
00:13:57,579 --> 00:14:03,130
UUID for every transaction or every

369
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:05,050
authorization that's being issued but it

370
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:06,519
has to be unique to each payment

371
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:10,359
transaction in the details of that

372
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:12,399
transaction the next requirement is that

373
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,899
codes can be generated via multiple

374
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,970
channels so you can generate this via

375
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:18,459
SMS you could generate this be a push

376
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:19,660
authentication you can generate this for

377
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:22,420
the same payment through multiple

378
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:25,209
channels but as soon as you authorize or

379
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:27,579
accept one of those channels the other

380
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:29,138
one is immediately invalid so you can't

381
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:31,779
just like kind of leave that out there

382
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:34,480
to make because that could open yourself

383
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:36,010
up to risk and fraud so multiple codes

384
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,100
can be generated but only one can be

385
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:40,660
accepted and finally if anything about

386
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,240
the transaction changes you have to

387
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:45,490
invalidate outstanding codes and so you

388
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,230
can't leave codes out there if the

389
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,790
amount of the payment changes if the

390
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:53,079
person that you're paying to changes

391
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:58,599
that all has to be invalidated if any of

392
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:59,979
one of those details is updated cool so

393
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,870
there are a couple of exemptions for

394
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,579
this this isn't going to apply to every

395
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,139
single payment and this is where it

396
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:08,349
starts to get tricky and where payment

397
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:10,569
providers are starting to really build

398
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:11,889
solutions around this to make sure that

399
00:15:10,569 --> 00:15:14,259
you don't have to go through all this

400
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:16,480
logic so most importantly anything under

401
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:18,850
30 euros is exempt they're only worried

402
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,699
about higher value transactions lower

403
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:23,800
risk transactions are also exempt and

404
00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:26,229
this is based on the payment service

405
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,149
providers fraud rates and so for example

406
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:30,760
if you have fraud rates under point zero

407
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:33,220
1 percent as a payment service provider

408
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,680
so like the banking institution you can

409
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,810
exempt payments up to 500 euros but that

410
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,638
has to be specific to your payment

411
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,839
institution and so that's like for the

412
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:43,959
payment institution that doesn't matter

413
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:45,459
for the the end-user this is also exempt

414
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:48,250
for recurring payments so if you have

415
00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:50,619
things like you know your magazine

416
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:52,149
subscription or even like your electric

417
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,610
bill so it can either be fixed

418
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:56,050
subscriptions or variable so your

419
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:58,660
electric bill might be different every

420
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:00,760
month but you have already authorized a

421
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,410
recurring payment for that you don't

422
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,240
have to do this kind of like MFA on

423
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:06,760
every transaction every month when they

424
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,350
try to charge you again and then this

425
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,120
also exempts over the phone payments

426
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:11,529
there's a few other exemptions here but

427
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,449
these are kind of the ones that are most

428
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:17,050
commonly asked about so I kind of wanted

429
00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:18,939
to highlight those cool so there's a few

430
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:20,889
ways that you can implement us strong

431
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,449
customer authentication and the options

432
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:25,930
here are largely similar to your options

433
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:28,750
for MFA for login with the exception of

434
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:32,859
3d secure who's familiar with 3d secure

435
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:34,779
so this is a payment it's verified by

436
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,930
Visa MasterCard secure code they're like

437
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:41,860
branded versions of this whole

438
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:43,660
underlying payment security and so these

439
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,130
are things that right now you might not

440
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,540
notice because they're kind of happening

441
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,519
in the background and this is where like

442
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,319
the authorization is happening of your

443
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:53,319
card and so they're looking at like the

444
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:54,939
risk of who you are and the payment that

445
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:56,620
is going through and this is how they

446
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,880
try to determine whether or not this is

447
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,940
like a fraudulent payment that's

448
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:03,100
happening online so this is MMF a that's

449
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,390
implemented by the credit card providers

450
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,699
and so if you're already using one of

451
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:08,140
them if you're already using 3d secure

452
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:10,089
which you're you know your e-commerce

453
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:11,679
platform might already be they might

454
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:14,260
already have a solution in place for

455
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,390
this there's a second version most

456
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:18,579
people are still on version one of 3d

457
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:20,380
secure the second version is coming out

458
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,599
is going to use a lot more information

459
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:25,809
about device data for mobile payments

460
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:27,849
and do risk analysis and adaptive off

461
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:30,190
and so this will say like you know if

462
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:32,080
we're not too concerned about this

463
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:34,000
person if you know they always get their

464
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,939
Starbucks for $4 every morning like we

465
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,740
don't need to like actually you know

466
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:41,650
care about adding additional security to

467
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:43,630
this but you know that $500 payment for

468
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:46,390
whatever we want might want to make sure

469
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:49,390
that we issue an additional check or add

470
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:53,169
a token check or one-time password at

471
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:55,799
that point but unfortunately here even

472
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:59,049
though you might be able to bypass that

473
00:17:55,799 --> 00:18:00,668
based on risk profiles of 3d secure you

474
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:02,799
still have to go through the

475
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:04,960
multi-factor authentication process for

476
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:08,200
non-exempt strong a customer

477
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,120
authentication payments in Europe you'll

478
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,549
pay for this as part of your credit card

479
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,959
processing fees and I don't really know

480
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,370
how much that costs but I've seen it

481
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,909
quoted anywhere between twenty and fifty

482
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:20,199
cents a transaction another option that

483
00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:23,080
you have is kind of like building this

484
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:26,049
yourself you can do this with SMS much

485
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,668
like you could for 2fa for login this

486
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:30,480
ends up being the option that a lot of

487
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:32,650
people use because it's so low friction

488
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,070
and it doesn't require that an end user

489
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:37,690
download your app so implementation was

490
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:40,360
left up to the individual governments to

491
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:42,700
interpret and enforce like I said so I'm

492
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,320
like this is officially compliant

493
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:47,049
according to the European Banking

494
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,210
Authority but like I've heard that like

495
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:51,940
French regulators might not be accepting

496
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:54,280
SMS and the reasons for that is SMS is

497
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:55,540
insecure and so this is something that

498
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,240
like even though it adds additional

499
00:18:55,540 --> 00:19:01,210
security like SMS for to FAS so better

500
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,040
than no 2fa at all like you have

501
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:04,600
vulnerabilities with the SMS channel

502
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,668
there's a lot of ways that you're not

503
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,439
actually sure that that is validating

504
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:08,860
that possession factor of like the sim

505
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,500
card

506
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:13,059
the idea behind SMS is a second factors

507
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,280
that it's validating possession of the

508
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:16,899
SIM card or maybe the device but in

509
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,500
reality it doesn't really do that like

510
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:23,470
people can log into the web portal their

511
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,760
text messages often sim swapping which

512
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,890
is done through social engineering

513
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:30,190
basically convincing or bribing a

514
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:31,750
Verizon agent to issue my SIM card to

515
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,640
you that's this thing that's we see

516
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,350
happening a lot mostly for people that

517
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,260
brag about how many Bitcoin they own on

518
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:40,020
Twitter but there's also vulnerabilities

519
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:43,450
that are a little bit more technical as

520
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:46,050
ss7 as a protocols signaling system 7

521
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:48,820
that basically allows you to do

522
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:52,000
impersonate a carrier and get try and

523
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:53,710
get text messages forwarded to you if

524
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,390
you successfully impersonate a carrier

525
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,160
because like telephony systems don't

526
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:58,620
really have any

527
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,210
security around this there's no signing

528
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,530
that's happening there's no cryptography

529
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:03,450
that's happening behind the scenes for

530
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:06,420
this so there's a lot of insecurities

531
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:07,740
with SMS and so different governments

532
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,210
are trying to decide whether or not this

533
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:12,090
is actually something that they want to

534
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:15,270
accept as of right now it is officially

535
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:17,970
accepted but your mileage may vary

536
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:19,470
transactional TOTP is something that we

537
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:22,020
built that of--they so this is cool

538
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,340
because like soft tokens or TOTP that

539
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,740
you would get with something like Google

540
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:28,709
Authenticator this does work offline

541
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:31,170
this is based on the RFC it's an open

542
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:33,240
standard which is pretty cool but then

543
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:36,060
when you have this kind of a open

544
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:39,000
standard it is more secure than SMS but

545
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:40,320
it is a proprietary solution another

546
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,210
option that you have is push

547
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,800
authentication this is great because

548
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,970
we've pushed authentication you might be

549
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,180
familiar with this if you've ever used

550
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:49,680
duo this has the add action context

551
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,840
built-in that's really easy to include

552
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,640
the dynamic linking this is really low

553
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,800
friction which people like but sometimes

554
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,650
is like low friction not enough security

555
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:01,290
who knows this is also a proprietary

556
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:03,480
solution you could build this in to your

557
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:06,600
own application but it would require a

558
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,890
little bit more dev work and then I just

559
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,629
want to finish up with a couple of

560
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:12,830
comments on how this is going to affect

561
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:14,850
US companies so this will apply to

562
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:17,610
transactions were both the business and

563
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:19,800
the end users and the card holders Bank

564
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:22,379
are located in the European Economic

565
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,629
Area and so if that's true to any of you

566
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:26,580
that you know will apply but you know

567
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:28,380
ROI for implementing this kind of thing

568
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,000
might be worth it for mitigating the

569
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,910
amount of that account takeover fraud

570
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,260
that you have on your on your businesses

571
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:35,940
and so you might want to do that

572
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,860
analysis if you already have ways to

573
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:39,480
support something like a second factor

574
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:41,280
for login you might be able to add this

575
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,900
to payments as well there's a lot of

576
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,000
skepticism while they're open banking

577
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,740
will ever come to the US but Congress

578
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,410
has talked about it and so this is

579
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,520
something that they're thinking about

580
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:52,560
and other countries are adding laws

581
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,660
around this to this kind of regulation

582
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,610
has already been in India for over five

583
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:59,160
years Australia is introducing

584
00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:00,840
regulation for this in 2020 and Brazil

585
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,150
and Singapore are talking about it right

586
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:06,000
now so this is going to apply in places

587
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:07,740
other than just the EU and so if you're

588
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,760
doing business outside of the US you

589
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,590
know something that you want to keep

590
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,960
your

591
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:13,730
I on and then like I mentioned before

592
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,050
you could use something like this for

593
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:17,300
authorizations from more than just

594
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:19,669
logins taking advantage of the second

595
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,740
factor for sensitive actions like

596
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:24,410
account changes password resets you know

597
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:26,240
that kind of thing if you already have a

598
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:27,920
session involved you might be able to

599
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,070
trust somebody to just authorize with

600
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,330
the second factor and as you're

601
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:34,429
implementing this you definitely want to

602
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:37,429
keep the user experience in mind because

603
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:39,650
security is friction and friction equals

604
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:42,740
abandoned cards right if you're using

605
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:44,900
this in an e-commerce situation time is

606
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:46,850
money and you don't want to have users

607
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,320
getting frustrated and leaving and

608
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:49,909
abandoning their carts behind because

609
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,909
they're waiting for our code to come

610
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:55,700
through so circumstances differ offer

611
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:58,250
additional options depending on what the

612
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,750
circumstances maybe offer retries to

613
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,160
customers to keep them happy let them

614
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:03,320
know what's happening so that they don't

615
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,930
get too frustrated waiting for this to

616
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,159
be approved and it's funny because one

617
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,690
of the original goals of payment

618
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,460
services directive was to speed up

619
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:13,130
payments but that was like cross-border

620
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:14,720
payments in 2007 our idea of fast

621
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:18,590
payments was a lot different back in

622
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,640
2007 that it is in 2019 a couple of

623
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:22,340
other things that you want to consider

624
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,690
before we wrap up here does your payment

625
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,250
service provider already offer a

626
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:27,530
solution here if you're using something

627
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:29,030
like Shopify or stripe under the hood

628
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,830
there's a good chance that they have

629
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:34,520
already built this into consideration

630
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:36,530
because they already have solutions for

631
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,030
this for their customers so you might

632
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:39,800
not need to build this yourself but you

633
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:41,600
might want to check if you're not

634
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,919
dealing directly with consumers so if

635
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,689
you have any kind of like hospitality

636
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,880
business travel booking that kind of

637
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:48,080
thing there are exemptions available for

638
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,970
that that you might want to look into

639
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,530
and then just like do you process

640
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,700
payments immediately if you're doing a

641
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,440
you know what kind of a traditional

642
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,970
e-commerce checkout that might be a

643
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,680
little bit easier to get that kind of

644
00:23:55,970 --> 00:24:00,080
multi-factor authentication code on the

645
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,150
spot but what if you're a rental car

646
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,980
agency that needs to authorize a fuel

647
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:06,080
charge for when the car is returned like

648
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,880
if you don't have that kind of upfront

649
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,960
knowledge of how much you need to

650
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,590
authorize there's some additional

651
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,820
considerations that you'll need to make

652
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:15,379
here are a bunch of additional resources

653
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,270
I'm going to post these slides after

654
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:19,550
this obviously this is a ton of

655
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:21,590
information and I'm while you are all

656
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:22,590
now experts in European payment

657
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:24,300
regulation

658
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:26,459
I expect that you might need to follow

659
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:28,260
up on some of this I hope that I've

660
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,120
given you kind of an idea of what to

661
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,590
expect with the regulation going forward
