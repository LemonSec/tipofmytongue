00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,140
need to stay unblocked that means no

12
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,940
standing in the doorways to watch the

13
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,739
talk we have all these comfortable seats

14
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,720
here therefore you use them

15
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:06,310
second cell phones you know the drill

16
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,009
turn them off silence them I don't care

17
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:13,180
I wore boots today for one purpose don't

18
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:16,330
make me use it cool you get it awesome

19
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:19,720
so you guys are in ballroom see this is

20
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:22,270
the anything track if that's not where

21
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,530
you want it to be you got two seconds to

22
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:27,970
run out that door before we close and

23
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:30,340
lock you in not really alright so we are

24
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,619
talking all about malware and ransomware

25
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:35,740
and how this stuff is getting monetized

26
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:39,899
by those threat actors and so with that

27
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,899
I am gonna turn it over to Jared Phipps

28
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,420
[Applause]

29
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,069
if you're still doing at the end then

30
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,289
I'll be happy

31
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:51,910
so Jared Phipps I currently work for

32
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:53,649
Sentinel one but I wanted to start a

33
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,970
little bit maybe more about the

34
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:59,170
background kind of how I got into

35
00:01:54,970 --> 00:02:00,399
security so I started working in college

36
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,569
for the you know I went to the

37
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,810
University of Arizona and I started

38
00:02:01,569 --> 00:02:07,690
working for the University of Arizona

39
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:09,009
kind of free tuitions nice right and so

40
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,270
when I was there I started working on

41
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:12,130
like web crawlers and things like that

42
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,780
and kind of like accidentally indexed

43
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:16,510
some major web portals and things like

44
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,740
that and and got some nasty grams so

45
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:21,549
that's where I kind of got into this

46
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:23,590
this inside of hey you know cyber is

47
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,120
kind of cool so I was kind of fun and so

48
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:29,650
I decided to go on the Air Force after

49
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,360
college and I joined Air Force in 2001

50
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,849
and my first assignment was off at Air

51
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,860
Force Base now off at Air Force Base is

52
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:38,500
in Omaha Nebraska actually Bellevue just

53
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,060
south of Omaha but they have this place

54
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,340
this thing on there called Stratcom has

55
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,739
anybody ever heard of Stratcom we have

56
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,030
some folks in here kind of important

57
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:48,220
things are run out of store

58
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,840
komm like you know the nuclear command

59
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:53,290
and control for United States nuclear

60
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,959
arsenal so I get to off it and I'm a

61
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:58,060
brand-new brand-new officer taking over

62
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:02,050
some squadrons and the first job I get

63
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:04,300
is to manage a squadron that writes the

64
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,500
code for the emergency access messages

65
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,390
so anybody here seen Hunt for Red

66
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,560
October

67
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,670
old-school movies alright that little

68
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,260
ticker tape that comes out of the

69
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,809
submarine with the with the messages

70
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,190
from DC that says do whatever yeah so

71
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,400
that was our unit that wrote that code

72
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:22,390
so I'm sitting at my apartment on a

73
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,500
weekend looking at some code that we're

74
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,109
doing for our code review check-ins

75
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,610
thinking to myself I probably shouldn't

76
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:30,220
be looking at this code in my apartment

77
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,840
on a weekend maybe nuclear command

78
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,209
control code shouldn't be accessible

79
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,500
like this so that's that's why I kind of

80
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:37,959
started thinking about security so I

81
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,640
started working on a program there to

82
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:41,140
put some you know check-in and revision

83
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,390
controls around the software programs

84
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,940
and then from there ends up going down

85
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,738
to the into the overall base networking

86
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,840
and long story short ended up going down

87
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:51,549
to San Antonio Texas where I still live

88
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,010
today and I got to do some really cool

89
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:55,780
stuff down in San Antonio so I'll just

90
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,489
summarize that and my time in the Air

91
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,920
Force I got to work on both offensive

92
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:03,250
programs and defensive programs I spent

93
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,320
all of 2007 in Iraq so I'm not sure how

94
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,209
many people actually done cyber

95
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,280
operations from a deployed perspective

96
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:10,810
it's kind of unique and not nearly as

97
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,500
cool as you think it is but I'll let you

98
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:15,820
think it is because that works for me

99
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,620
and then you know after that I decided

100
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,570
hey I've done my tours I've done my duty

101
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,250
I'm gonna go ahead and get out and so I

102
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:25,690
ended up working at mitre for a couple

103
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:28,150
of years again sounds cool was was a lot

104
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,560
of paperwork and whatnot but it's been a

105
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:33,789
couple years at mitre before coming over

106
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:35,140
under the vendor side so I want to kind

107
00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:36,490
of give that background because as I'm

108
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,010
going through a lot of this I'm gonna

109
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,600
give some perspectives it's important to

110
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,789
note that everything I'm saying there's

111
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,590
there's sightings for on open

112
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:46,030
publications and open source and I'll

113
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,500
tell you where they're coming from or

114
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,030
they're coming from Senate one research

115
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,229
none of this is from my prior background

116
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,570
for those of you that want to come and

117
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:55,479
arrest me for divulging classified

118
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:58,659
there is no classified being divulged so

119
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:59,409
if we're looking let's start talking at

120
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:00,729
a macro level

121
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:03,339
first and we'll start talking about some

122
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:05,229
of the trends I remember the good old

123
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:06,819
days when it used to be a worm and there

124
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:08,558
was a file and he just disconnect your

125
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:09,669
machines and run the cleaner utility and

126
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:11,019
was kind of a pain in the butt because

127
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:13,209
you crawled onto some desks every now

128
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:17,169
and then but it was pretty easy to keep

129
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:19,419
things clean number one trend that's

130
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:21,339
been going on it started in probably

131
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:26,669
late 2017 but we've seen it increasing

132
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:26,669
in 2017 or 2018 indefinitely in 2019

133
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:32,259
adversaries across the board are

134
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:35,199
avoiding static file objects as much as

135
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:38,589
possible and so if we're looking at the

136
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,599
trends of the target attack at types you

137
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:42,459
can see that there has just been a slow

138
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:44,378
so I wouldn't say slow but it's a very

139
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:44,849
steady increase as I'm looking on the

140
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:48,219
left

141
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:51,519
we're basically almost 100 percent rise

142
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:52,929
in the tendency to use files attacks so

143
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,389
what am I talking about by fireless

144
00:05:52,929 --> 00:05:56,739
attacks because that's the buzzword

145
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:59,439
everybody talks about but nobody really

146
00:05:56,739 --> 00:06:01,179
says anything I'm talking about anything

147
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,829
that I can do if I can do some sort of

148
00:06:01,179 --> 00:06:04,479
remote exploitation and I can do post

149
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:07,360
exploitation without having to drop

150
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,998
malware on if I can attack you directly

151
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,919
on PowerShell and that is the preferred

152
00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:13,990
file less attack method at the moment is

153
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,369
a direct connection into PowerShell if I

154
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,779
can invoke something directly into

155
00:06:15,369 --> 00:06:18,459
memory that establishes that connection

156
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:20,949
and lets me have some sort of access to

157
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:23,829
the box that's ideal because now I'm

158
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:25,689
issuing commands command at a time or

159
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:26,979
I'm running a script to issue commands

160
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:28,599
command at a time from the Machine

161
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:30,399
perspective is essentially the same and

162
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:33,699
there's no file getting scanned and no

163
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:35,679
file being run through an AV system so

164
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:38,199
it's it's interesting you can see a sort

165
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:41,049
of the the PowerShell trend lines a

166
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:44,129
couple notes on this I'm pulling this

167
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:47,319
from our data sets and the data sets are

168
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:48,669
from deployed installs and so most of

169
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:50,379
these are running on Prevention's so

170
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:53,589
these are not successful attacks these

171
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:55,659
are attacks we're shutting down so the

172
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:58,239
number of attacks that are attempting to

173
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:59,589
use PowerShell are quite a bit higher

174
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:02,349
than actually being able to be

175
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:03,339
successful here so those these trends

176
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:05,829
are interesting but again you're getting

177
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:08,050
it from a vendor perspective I will say

178
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:09,219
that the whole time I was in the DoD I

179
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,599
always thought like the vendor community

180
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:12,729
had it figured out because they didn't

181
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:13,120
have any sort of collection restrictions

182
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:15,490
and

183
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,020
have all this sort of spying on US

184
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,090
citizens concerns that we always had to

185
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,650
worry about they were well organized

186
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,940
they were well-funded and then I get out

187
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,020
into the industry side and I find out

188
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,210
that really thinks the government's got

189
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:27,039
it all figured out infinite pockets they

190
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:29,320
can spy on anybody they want to they

191
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,280
have all these magical boxes the reality

192
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,570
is we're all sit in the room looking

193
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,989
each other's like who's got the answer

194
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:41,409
right so the answer is in mass there's a

195
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:44,979
lot of data out there so if I'm breaking

196
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:47,110
down attack types if I show this slide

197
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:48,599
even three or four years ago it would

198
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:51,130
have been 80 percent plus Windows

199
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,220
there's a strong trend now moving away

200
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:57,340
towards Windows there's a lot of Linux

201
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:59,139
attacks going on right now and they're I

202
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:02,138
would categorize those in the Linux side

203
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:03,760
largely in crypto miners but more

204
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:05,530
importantly either the staging in the

205
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,840
host they need the infrastructure to run

206
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:09,280
the attacking from and I'll get into

207
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,460
this in a bit but the cybercrime is

208
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,799
really split into almost like a business

209
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,030
supporting a business so you have the

210
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,770
folks that are actually going out there

211
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,789
and conducting the campaigns and you

212
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,229
have the folks that are building the

213
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:22,479
infrastructure for the campaign's to be

214
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:23,740
ran against so the groups that really

215
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,300
care about going after Linux

216
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:28,650
infrastructure the groups are building

217
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:31,960
the campaigns to let people launch with

218
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:33,819
Mac OS pretty standard and I've kind of

219
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,360
dropped this down for you to see the the

220
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:39,130
threat

221
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:41,080
attacks as we've seen so the most common

222
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:42,760
and the most popular one and the

223
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,760
noisiest one out there is emo Ted I'm

224
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:49,600
going to focus mostly on Imhotep today I

225
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,730
would describe emo Tet is like the SEC

226
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,080
m4 for hackers right it's a it's a

227
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,970
Trojan at less than remote command

228
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,589
control and update and it's really a

229
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,000
service now being provided for others so

230
00:08:56,589 --> 00:09:07,240
it's not a surprise that we're going to

231
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:11,620
see a ton of Imhotep ok I I love threat

232
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:13,470
intelligence as much to anybody else but

233
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:17,080
we need to use threat intelligence

234
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:18,790
properly as much as we can use it as a

235
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,430
hygiene layer for proactive protection

236
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:22,780
and that and that means let's block on

237
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,979
known malicious stuff that's coming

238
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,660
through from threat intelligence let's

239
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,420
do that

240
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,969
but what I

241
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,229
seen from both the government side and

242
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,790
the commercial side

243
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,709
that I've been involved with is an

244
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:36,079
over-reliance on threat intelligence and

245
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:39,160
so I want to kind of show you why I make

246
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:41,689
that claim so what you're looking at is

247
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,430
you're seeing here the total number of

248
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:46,730
detections compared to reputation

249
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:47,870
services I would name them but I'm kind

250
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,089
of afraid to but you all use them

251
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:51,290
there's very few out there and it's one

252
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,449
common one that everybody uses so you

253
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:55,519
know what I'm talking about so if I look

254
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:58,219
at that at the point that a sentinel one

255
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,389
agent and then and for those of you who

256
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,699
don't know what Sentinel one does it's

257
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:04,100
behavioral and AI detection so we're not

258
00:10:01,699 --> 00:10:08,029
using signatures for detection so at the

259
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:10,010
moment we make a detection then what you

260
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:11,870
can see right here is 73% of the time

261
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:14,540
we've made that detection at that moment

262
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:18,320
in time the reputation service cloud is

263
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,519
completely unaware of that threat 20% of

264
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,680
the time it's able to determine it's

265
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,690
malicious 2% of the time it's actually

266
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,209
saying no that's not malicious that's

267
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:28,940
benign and that is actually the holy

268
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:30,260
grail for attackers by the way and the

269
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,529
remainder of that time that 5% is

270
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:35,060
suspicious so I want to break this down

271
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:37,070
further so let's look about portable

272
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:39,410
executable so the dot exe is the MSI is

273
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:42,079
DLL is things of that nature so if I

274
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:44,600
look at that then 77% of the time that I

275
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:47,300
submit an executable or a portable

276
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,640
executable to a cloud-based threat

277
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:52,880
intelligence reputation service it is

278
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:54,319
unknown and so this is the one that was

279
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,820
surprising to me because this should be

280
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,740
the low-hanging fruit this is where the

281
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,380
reputation services should be helping us

282
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,839
and they do help us I'm not saying by

283
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:04,100
any means we don't leverage them but

284
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:06,290
what I am saying let's be cautious that

285
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:10,760
we're having an over overconfidence

286
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:15,949
because of having them but to this piece

287
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:18,079
here documents so as we delve into email

288
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:20,660
10 some of these other things PDFs and

289
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:24,079
macro embedded documents is the

290
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,500
preferred method of transport so right

291
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,010
here

292
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:29,329
96% of the time I'm not sure you can

293
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:31,550
really read that especially if you're in

294
00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:33,319
the back so that tiny purple writing I'm

295
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:37,160
a tiny purple background you're welcome

296
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:38,089
for that that says 96 percent so 96

297
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,250
percent of the time that we've

298
00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:43,310
identified a malicious

299
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:45,800
document it is completely unknown to the

300
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:48,170
threat intelligence services now the key

301
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,880
point to this is if you are in the

302
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,870
adversary side and you're running these

303
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,939
campaigns

304
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:55,580
you only need a 24 hour window to run

305
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,620
your campaign so this is the only number

306
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:00,080
that matters so if you're from a

307
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,340
campaign operator perspective you now

308
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,470
know the way that you want to operate

309
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:08,030
your campaign and that's going to be

310
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:11,510
through documents so holistically the

311
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:13,490
the point I'm trying to make is we can

312
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:16,430
leverage the threat intelligence from a

313
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:18,230
protection and Prevention standpoint to

314
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:20,359
block the known commodity or what I

315
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:22,370
would what I would term as the residual

316
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,760
attacks that are that are continuing to

317
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:27,620
propagate these would be like hey at the

318
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,060
end of world war two we dropped a bunch

319
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,610
of bombs and there was unexploded

320
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,560
ordnance the residual attacks would be

321
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:36,140
the unexploded cyber ordnance still

322
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,849
floating around in cyberspace threat

323
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,319
until is fantastic for blocking that and

324
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:40,880
that's about 90% of noise you see

325
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:46,880
because a lot of these folks just pick

326
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:48,950
up and reuse so if we look at detection

327
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:54,620
classifications holistically across the

328
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:56,839
install base over all executables are

329
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,370
responsible for about 80% of the

330
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:01,070
detections on average and that's that's

331
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:04,250
we've seen that purple bar so this tells

332
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:06,860
you that there is just a ton of noise in

333
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,080
the cyber space that is not new that

334
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,240
shouldn't be earth-shattering to anyone

335
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:14,060
and I'll have some stories about that

336
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:16,040
the documents and the file list attacks

337
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,560
they have the smallest share on the top

338
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,910
so the smallest amount of noise the

339
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,589
smallest amount of alerts is what's

340
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,910
causing the greatest amount of damage so

341
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:24,620
I don't think that's gonna be

342
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:27,380
earth-shattering or shocking to anyone

343
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:29,270
but here's a quantifiable metrics driven

344
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:34,820
way to have that conversation based on

345
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:37,790
what we can see so question nation state

346
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:41,589
cyber crime one of the same different

347
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:46,819
what do you guys think one of the same

348
00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:51,560
completely different okay is there any

349
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:54,649
hybrid between the two do you think okay

350
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,910
so the greatest hybrid which in my

351
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:57,649
opinion and I'm giving you this from my

352
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:59,240
perspective is actually North Korea

353
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:01,459
which has been dubbed a few different

354
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,220
things I'm gonna base all my terminology

355
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:06,589
on miter attack one because I used to

356
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,569
work at mitre and I like mitre but more

357
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:10,279
importantly because we as an industry

358
00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:11,959
need to get better at having a common

359
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:14,149
vernacular as we start to address these

360
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:16,160
things even if you run through the mitre

361
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:18,290
attack listings on there now multiple

362
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,420
these apt actor sets are the same group

363
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:23,660
and they've simply gotten labels and apt

364
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:26,360
because a different tool setting so

365
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:28,610
North Korea is probably the only strong

366
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:32,360
example I can give you of nation state

367
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:35,839
sponsored cyber criminal activity not

368
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,910
espionage but criminal and largely is

369
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,589
categorized in to apt actor sets there's

370
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:42,079
arguments for a third i'll contend that

371
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:45,709
that third is actually a subset just an

372
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:48,589
existing unit of 38 so apt 38 is a

373
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:53,388
cybercrime side apt 37 is the cyber

374
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:55,370
government side so North Korea has a

375
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:59,389
cyber unit that surprises a lot of

376
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:01,279
people we think of them as sort of

377
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:03,110
backwater I know a lot of people were

378
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,550
really surprised and they got introduced

379
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,399
in North Korea when the Sony stuff went

380
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:10,790
down but they have been out there for

381
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:12,649
quite a while on the on the commercial

382
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:15,819
side on the cybercrime side there's a

383
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:18,620
very real reason it exists and they

384
00:15:15,819 --> 00:15:20,809
initially spun off their cyber crime

385
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:23,059
unit out of their governmental

386
00:15:20,809 --> 00:15:24,649
organization after US sanctions imposed

387
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:27,079
and made it difficult to get money into

388
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:28,220
the regime and so the cyber crime unit

389
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:32,719
started doing some very sophisticated

390
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:34,250
attacks targeting banks in the region so

391
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,439
if you can compromise banks like the

392
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,839
Bangladesh Bank and you can and you can

393
00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:40,160
compromise the Swift servers the banking

394
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,319
servers are responsible some of the

395
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,000
transactions then you can actually order

396
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:45,979
up transactions from various

397
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,360
organizations so that was one of the

398
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,100
first attacks that they had was from the

399
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,959
Bangladesh central bank to the Federal

400
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,360
Reserve they ordered up a billion

401
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:56,029
dollars they got away with about 81

402
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,949
million okay so if you're North Korea

403
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:59,959
that's 81 million of cash infusion that

404
00:15:57,949 --> 00:16:01,719
comes at a really perfect time when

405
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:04,170
you're dealing with economic sanctions

406
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,490
overall they've definitely cleared 100

407
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,870
they probably clear close to 200 million

408
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,040
during those banking timeframes and

409
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:09,900
definitely one of the ways that they

410
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,000
were able to get around the economic

411
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:14,220
sanctions that happened so that was a

412
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,660
2016 timeframe since then we've seen

413
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,900
them do a couple of other interesting

414
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:21,810
things they've still maintained their

415
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:23,189
focus on Swift if you are in the banking

416
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:25,199
or the crediting and industry and you're

417
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,990
worried about that their average dwell

418
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:31,320
time in 2016 was around 190 days they're

419
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:33,690
down to around 120 130 days they're

420
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,610
gonna go into an organization and they

421
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:37,590
will definitely focus on getting access

422
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:39,330
to credentialed accounts and then all of

423
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:40,680
their discovery and a lot of propagation

424
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:43,380
that is done is through credentialed

425
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:45,120
accounts it's a very methodical process

426
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,860
and it's very difficult to detect

427
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,050
they're not

428
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,900
news flash they're not doing their

429
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:53,250
connections from North Korea

430
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,540
there's two internet connections in

431
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:57,150
North Korea they're not coming from

432
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:58,709
North Korea so I'd like to have this

433
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,000
little gift video because everybody's

434
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:01,530
seen this this is the North Korea at

435
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,780
night right so how does the peninsula it

436
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:05,490
has like zero lights in it hitting up

437
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:09,510
and lighting up in the cyber campaign so

438
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:10,829
well so as a communist country it

439
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:12,569
shouldn't be a surprise that they model

440
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:16,260
the training regime in a very soviet-era

441
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:17,579
style and this is really as you would

442
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,230
expect to be done and so instead of in

443
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:21,300
the athletic program this was a mirrored

444
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:22,980
from a cyber program they find kids who

445
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,050
have a great aptitude at mathematics and

446
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,640
those are selected down selected and

447
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:28,440
those group can attend a specific class

448
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,840
of middle schools so their secondary

449
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:33,300
middle school education those that are

450
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,669
top performers in those schools then are

451
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,450
eligible to attend one of the two

452
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:38,760
universities

453
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:41,040
okay so you've here's building this

454
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,200
funnel of natural aptitude talent and

455
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,330
kind of funneling it down once you

456
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,340
graduate from those schools then you're

457
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,510
able to join the military services and

458
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,550
you'll be joining the reconnaissance

459
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:52,140
general Bureau so it's their version of

460
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:54,450
the I of the intelligence community that

461
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,520
we have in the u.s. so you're joining

462
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:59,670
that community those with top propensity

463
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,230
in the whole person perspective which

464
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:03,810
means not just mathematics in the cyber

465
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:05,310
but also loyal to the regime the

466
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:06,810
leadership that kind of structure those

467
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,879
folks that demonstrate the greatest

468
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:10,440
propensity are then eligible to go to

469
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,780
Shang Yang for the further follow-on

470
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,400
training it's about a two-hour train

471
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,050
ride on a bullet train from the North

472
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,670
Korea border over to that city and

473
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,020
that's where they get their advanced

474
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:22,520
side

475
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:23,870
training now once you've earned the

476
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,879
trust you've had the training and you've

477
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:28,520
had the skill set then the North Korea's

478
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,380
regime is to transfer you out of China

479
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:34,129
into one of the countries that elects

480
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:35,390
you except individuals and so when

481
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,680
you're transferred out you'll be going

482
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,840
to the countries listed here Indonesia

483
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:41,480
Kenya the new shocker for most people

484
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,370
it's New Zealand when you're able to go

485
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,900
to those countries you're not just

486
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:46,129
showing up you're gonna show up and

487
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,600
you're gonna establish a business or

488
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:51,020
you're gonna show up applying for a job

489
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,370
so recommendation is don't hire anyone

490
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:55,970
from North Korea to work on your IT

491
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:59,239
stuff if we laughs but it actually is

492
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:01,610
happening and it's happening a lot so

493
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,200
once in place then they're being managed

494
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:05,179
organized and structured under the

495
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,660
reconnaissance general Bureau so while

496
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:10,220
we look at it as a PT 38 and a PT 37 it

497
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:14,080
is all coming from the same command

498
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:22,640
control structure within North Korea

499
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:24,439
okay so in terms of Outlook we we've had

500
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,270
some interesting things they have

501
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,210
historically focused on banking and the

502
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:30,410
Swift servers in the last couple years

503
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,570
we've had a massive rise of

504
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:34,010
cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency is

505
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,990
very appealing to North Korea for a lot

506
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:38,960
of reasons among them the difficulties

507
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:42,680
associated with sanctions and so what

508
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,420
we've seen now is initially attacks from

509
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:47,060
North Korea targeting into South Korea

510
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:49,310
and Southeast Asia but actually

511
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,240
targeting owners of Manero and Bitcoin

512
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,590
so they went

513
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,370
let's just hope hack the Bitcoin

514
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:56,870
directly I'm not sure that was the

515
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:57,889
smartest decision initially but they ran

516
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:01,669
some of those campaigns especially

517
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:04,640
across South Korea and that was

518
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:06,560
interesting but early 2019 we started to

519
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,420
see actually North Korea decide let's

520
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,850
just get in on the ransomware game

521
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:12,560
itself meaning why do I just set up

522
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:14,209
these structures like I've seen fin 6

523
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,129
and others do very successfully and

524
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:20,540
bring the money back directly to the

525
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:21,800
regime apt 37 however is the

526
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,700
reconnaissance Bureau organization

527
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,659
they're not going to change their

528
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,920
structure at least I don't anticipate

529
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,240
they change their structures they're

530
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,280
gonna maintain their focus on South

531
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,020
Korea intelligence gathering and unto

532
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,549
the United States so if we can deface or

533
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:36,019
to focus the United States embarrassed

534
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:37,759
governments that's a plus so what

535
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:41,119
stepping outside of that one where it's

536
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:44,659
nation sponsored then you move in to

537
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:46,340
this sort of gray zone so running for

538
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:48,649
the minor tack list here's the the

539
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:51,860
primary organizations that actually deal

540
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:54,860
with cyber crimes cyber theft and in

541
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:58,008
that space if you're going through this

542
00:20:54,860 --> 00:21:02,029
list you'll notice that most of these

543
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:03,710
are attributed to Russia what I will say

544
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:06,499
when people are attributing to Russia

545
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:08,450
what they should be saying is they are

546
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:11,359
seeing Russian language characters or

547
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:12,919
Russian speaking influences on the folks

548
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:15,139
that are writing or operating the code

549
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:17,950
bases that does not mean that it's

550
00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:21,049
endorsed in any way by Russia other than

551
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:22,820
allowing it to operate so sort of the

552
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:24,200
attitude is as long as you don't mess

553
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,489
around with our banks as long as you

554
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,869
don't mess around with our companies

555
00:21:25,489 --> 00:21:28,879
we're gonna kind of turn a blind eye to

556
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:30,769
what you're doing that's that's the

557
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:32,330
mentality so a lot of these

558
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:33,529
organizations you have the technical

559
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:36,739
skill set you have the internet

560
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:39,710
availability they're able to build some

561
00:21:36,739 --> 00:21:41,119
pretty sizable businesses the grand crab

562
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,619
authors are claiming that they made a

563
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:44,149
billion dollars in about a year I don't

564
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:45,559
think it was a billion the kind of tout

565
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:47,479
and overestimate everything they do

566
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:48,619
let's say four hundred million five

567
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,330
hundred million that's still a lot of

568
00:21:48,619 --> 00:21:53,178
money to make for probably a small group

569
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:56,029
of folks but if you look at this I would

570
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:58,609
say that ten six is one of the ones that

571
00:21:56,029 --> 00:22:00,679
I find the most intriguing they've

572
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:02,539
really focused for a long time on

573
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:03,919
point-of-sale attacking the

574
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:06,019
point-of-sale systems and credit card

575
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,029
resale but they have always been able to

576
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:09,710
operate like a business I'm very

577
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:12,830
confident that organization brings in

578
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:14,690
over a billion dollars a year these

579
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:16,639
these organizations operate very much

580
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:19,549
almost like a franchise with a CEO

581
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:21,889
structure jobs and roles defined and

582
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:25,100
they're pretty substantial in size so

583
00:22:21,889 --> 00:22:26,570
cybercrime like you would expect a mafia

584
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:29,418
structure organization very similar in

585
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:31,639
that fashion the result though is that

586
00:22:29,419 --> 00:22:34,279
you've had such a strong steady influx

587
00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:36,889
of cash that over time groups have been

588
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:39,559
able to peel off and focus on what

589
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:42,529
they're really good expertise is so the

590
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:44,690
e motet development right you see them

591
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:49,150
focus on building this

592
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:49,150
to host and manage the malware campaigns

593
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:54,560
fin 7 is one of the interesting ones

594
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,600
because they have some ties to muddy

595
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,760
water which has been associated with

596
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,350
Iranian groups I don't really think I

597
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,240
have enough to say at this point in time

598
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:03,679
to give any sort of government UN's one

599
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,940
way or the other on that so I'm going to

600
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,960
let that one lie other than to say that

601
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:11,390
that one's definitely not Russian

602
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:13,640
RTM is I guess the craziest of the group

603
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:15,560
because the russian-speaking going after

604
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,910
Russian banks like why poke the bear

605
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,169
when you live in the Bear Den and that's

606
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:26,780
what they're doing we'll see how that

607
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:29,120
plays out and then ta 505 so in ta 505

608
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,590
and 2019 I started using and Ramat and

609
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,780
flawed army to build like a

610
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:34,730
full-featured rat and they're they're

611
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:38,300
entering the round somewhere game and

612
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:39,530
mass now so the common the common trend

613
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:42,879
here which probably shouldn't be a

614
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:44,870
surprise to anybody is ransomware

615
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,470
has anybody dealt with ransomware

616
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:49,870
themselves yet yeah like if you look

617
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:55,460
around the room you're not alone so

618
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:58,310
don't feel like you are so why the rise

619
00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:00,670
and ransomware the easy answer is

620
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:02,720
because it's an easy way to monetize it

621
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:03,880
but we need to understand a little bit

622
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,620
more behind it

623
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,970
number one is actually the speed in

624
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:10,310
which the entire campaign can be

625
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:11,420
conducted if you're looking at how North

626
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:13,639
Korea has been doing it where it's

627
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:15,290
taking them basically six months they're

628
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,730
pulling in a large amount of money but

629
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:19,129
it's taking them six months to get there

630
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:21,440
if I can as a small group of individuals

631
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:23,810
make 500 million dollars in 12 months

632
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,400
without the complexities or the risks

633
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:27,590
associated from pulling 81 million

634
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,900
dollars from a single actor that's

635
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:32,449
probably the route I'm gonna go because

636
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,590
I can hit people all over the world it's

637
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:35,450
gonna be really hard to track me down

638
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:37,970
and I can do it really really quickly as

639
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:41,090
a matter of days weeks and we'll walk

640
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:43,730
through some of the time frames here the

641
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:45,770
payout is faster and this is the thing

642
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:48,910
people are transferring you the money

643
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:51,170
because they have to because their

644
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:53,630
operations are shut down and they are

645
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:56,060
under a time to rest so that the payouts

646
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:58,070
happen a lot faster and so what you're

647
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,720
seeing is a focus

648
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:01,929
on smash-and-grab I need more

649
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,520
smash-and-grab faster-faster-faster

650
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:07,700
so the the the entire speed of attack

651
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:09,590
the ability to automate as much of the

652
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,300
attack as possible is what the focus is

653
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,740
and when we look at email we're gonna

654
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:15,820
see they back to actually helping and

655
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:18,410
build the automation focus is in place

656
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:21,110
but then you run into this other perfect

657
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:23,210
holy grail where there needed to be a

658
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:25,520
way to get paid and that's where

659
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:29,030
cryptocurrency steps in place

660
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,860
Bitcoin obviously is the first one South

661
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:33,290
Korea entering that Bitcoin space

662
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:35,270
legitimize that as as a currency like

663
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:37,340
when a nation-state is involving and

664
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:39,170
transacting on that currency that gives

665
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:41,360
it a stability and if you're in cyber

666
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:42,710
crime that's enough stability for you

667
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,149
like you're not looking for it to be

668
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:46,280
backed by the US government right

669
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:47,480
anything will do that legitimizes it

670
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:50,840
takes a bit of the risk out and now you

671
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,980
can transact it's also eliminated a lot

672
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:55,550
of the need from you'll so if you're

673
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:56,570
looking back say ten years ago when we

674
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,669
would see some of these attacks

675
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:00,649
happening people are targeting banks

676
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:02,300
they're pulling and issuing ATM cards

677
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:03,650
then you're passing those ATM numbers

678
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,240
and people all over the world are

679
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:06,890
printing them out physically running up

680
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,870
ATMs draining them as they drive across

681
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:10,130
town then you've got to split the cost

682
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,510
with those mules you've got to figure

683
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:14,930
out a lot of that money like that's a

684
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:16,940
pain over here I can just get paid

685
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:19,280
cryptocurrency and go like it's so much

686
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,900
cleaner I'm eliminating who I have to

687
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,850
split money with I'm eliminating them

688
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:26,570
turning on me of the cops find them it's

689
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:29,090
just it just takes so much risk down but

690
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:32,090
finally is payment so what they've

691
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:34,459
learned is ransomware works they do it

692
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:37,610
they'll get paid and they're gonna get

693
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:39,680
paid because there's contracts that

694
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:42,409
obligate them to get paid and here's

695
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,780
what I mean by that everybody out there

696
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:46,730
it seems today has a cyber insurance

697
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:49,430
policy or a rider on their cyber

698
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:51,020
insurance policy and I'm not throwing

699
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:53,210
the cyber insurance industry under the

700
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:56,000
bus because it is their job to pay out

701
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:57,860
on contracts which they write but what

702
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,650
I'm saying is if cryptocurrency wasn't

703
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:02,060
here and cyber insurance wasn't here I

704
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,440
don't think he would see the payout

705
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:05,870
levels that you say on around somewhere

706
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,880
today he just wouldn't have this volume

707
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:09,469
of payouts happening but because this

708
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,790
holy grail kind of lined up and

709
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,600
everything just all the stars aligned

710
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:14,299
it's me

711
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,370
very very easy so I'll walk you through

712
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:18,500
the process you're an organization you

713
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:20,418
get hit with ransomware and it's a non

714
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,549
recoverable event you can call up your

715
00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:24,650
broker and you call and make the claim

716
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:27,168
with your insurance in most cases they

717
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:29,059
will send out an IR firm to deal with

718
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:31,309
this event for you the IR firm will

719
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:34,160
actually carry a Bitcoin wallet they

720
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:35,360
will negotiate a ransom come up to a

721
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,520
terms with around somewhere over what

722
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,350
that ransom should be then they will

723
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,210
send a couple of encrypted files for

724
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:42,709
proof of life the attacker will send the

725
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:44,090
decrypted files back proving that they

726
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:47,809
have a key that encrypts those files

727
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:50,139
they'll transfer the exchange of the of

728
00:27:47,809 --> 00:27:52,190
the the Bitcoin for the Decrypter tools

729
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:55,070
Decrypter tools will take anywhere from

730
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:57,200
12 to 36 hours to run they'll run with

731
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:58,399
different varying degrees of confidence

732
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,230
but chances are you gonna get a good

733
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,179
chunk of your data back you can restore

734
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:04,429
your business so the insurance industry

735
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:05,539
knows that if they don't do this they

736
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:07,460
could be held liable for breach of

737
00:28:05,539 --> 00:28:09,890
contract for not helping businesses get

738
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,330
restored when they're supposed to be so

739
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:14,059
with this there's a very very

740
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:17,480
substantial amount of work as in

741
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:19,370
probably 40 cases 50 cases 60 cases a

742
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,220
day going out if some of these insurers

743
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:23,959
and we have dozens of these insurers so

744
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:26,000
what's I think most people are not aware

745
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,309
of is the volume and scale at which

746
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,260
ransomware is going on like people are

747
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:31,840
completely clueless at the scale and

748
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:34,940
volume that this is happening and this

749
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,439
is because it's not a reportable event

750
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:42,890
you do not have to disclose it there is

751
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:45,080
no data breach so the data breach is an

752
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:49,090
incident that results in the confirmed

753
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:51,470
disclosure of data right on a ransomware

754
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:53,480
educates bucketed into the incident pile

755
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:59,240
there is no disclosed information the

756
00:28:53,480 --> 00:29:02,200
majority's cases so if we look at 2019

757
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:04,880
on the DVR report we're expecting around

758
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,799
20,000 breaches and 40,000 incidents so

759
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,799
a 40 or 20x multiple I think is actually

760
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:13,070
higher than that myself a breach is

761
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:14,720
around 8 million each yet the cost of

762
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:17,030
ransomware when you look at business

763
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,760
disruption plus the I arm firm cost plus

764
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:22,158
the ransom costs or exceeding 75 billion

765
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,379
so we spend all of our time talking

766
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:28,840
about a fraction of the

767
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:31,750
and that's that's a concern to me so

768
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:34,539
let's talk a motet because this is the

769
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:37,450
the godfather that's enabling this

770
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:39,870
ransomware epidemic to go so mealybugs

771
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:42,460
started this stuff off in early 2014

772
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:43,959
originally in a banking Trojan and most

773
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,460
of these organizations in cybercrime

774
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:49,929
were I was focused on banking prior

775
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:51,850
anyways so to evade detection x' they

776
00:29:49,929 --> 00:29:53,289
got really really good very early on of

777
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:55,449
being polymorphic and being self

778
00:29:53,289 --> 00:29:57,730
propagating and they got some good good

779
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:59,740
technology there to exist in an

780
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:01,960
organization and maintain an update

781
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:03,250
itself now it didn't take long before

782
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,039
they figured out that they could

783
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:09,130
modularize the approach and load attack

784
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:11,470
modules into the existing infrastructure

785
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:13,360
and then that led them to realize hey

786
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:16,120
there's an option for us to make money

787
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,889
by enabling other people to use us as a

788
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:21,219
transport service or enablement service

789
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:22,720
up for their attacks so what a motet is

790
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:25,210
really really good at they're really

791
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,250
really good at the evading core standard

792
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:30,490
defenses think of your firewalls in your

793
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:31,590
abs like they've spent the last 10 years

794
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:33,429
getting really good at this stuff

795
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:35,500
because they were doing these types of

796
00:30:33,429 --> 00:30:37,059
things before 2014 all right so this

797
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,010
there's building on a decade plus an

798
00:30:37,059 --> 00:30:40,360
experience and now they're able to roll

799
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:43,510
out tools that are very effective at

800
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:45,309
this they have two really really large

801
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:47,110
botnets epic one and epic two available

802
00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:50,500
for the disposal which helps them manage

803
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:52,209
that infrastructure really nicely and

804
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:55,150
then you've seen them now starting to

805
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:56,950
move on to modularize or improve their

806
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:58,960
business offering which means I can have

807
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:00,100
some spam modules built in so your box

808
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,720
get hits with a motet it'll

809
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,459
automatically pull up your context list

810
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,350
try to figure out a send a custom

811
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:06,700
crafted email spam email so that the

812
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:08,469
attacker doesn't have to do it for you

813
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:11,080
these are options you can now go in and

814
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:12,280
turn on and then it has some built-in

815
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,658
password cracking module which is

816
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,070
actually really not good most people are

817
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:16,870
still dropping tried X or something else

818
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:19,240
with it but they're trying to work on

819
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:21,189
that so you're seeing that a motet is

820
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,840
not really concerned about what that

821
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:24,659
post exploitation is going to be they're

822
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:27,158
really concerned about enabling

823
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:28,900
consistent access once you've got an

824
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:32,010
email chat hit and that's where they're

825
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,010
going to spend their money in their time

826
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:36,758
so among the among the things I do it

827
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:40,330
sense in a one I manage our Incident

828
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:42,690
Response program and so we partner with

829
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:45,908
a lot of ir firms that go out and

830
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:48,909
respond or we've actually done some of

831
00:31:45,909 --> 00:31:50,860
these incidents with them so this one

832
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:52,389
I'm gonna give you because this was the

833
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:55,240
second one I got to deal with when I

834
00:31:52,389 --> 00:31:57,399
joined Sentinel one and I I don't know

835
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,039
what it is about attacks but they always

836
00:31:57,399 --> 00:32:02,289
happen in December like in December of

837
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:04,450
2016 and 2017 I got called on on

838
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:05,740
Christmas Eve December 24th both years

839
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:07,570
like I don't know what it is about

840
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:09,159
December 24th but I'm terrified to

841
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:10,480
answer the phone now so at least this

842
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:13,019
year it came early I was grateful for

843
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,340
the hatha night right it started early

844
00:32:13,019 --> 00:32:17,320
so this company it kind of came into

845
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:19,240
work it's a manufacturing company that

846
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,009
had the standard it's got a firewall

847
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:23,440
didn't have an IPS kind of had that

848
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:25,480
unified firewall IPS the new combo thing

849
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:29,110
and then it had some legacy AV installed

850
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:30,850
and it was fully compliant so I know we

851
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,979
have this side topic of compliance and

852
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:35,110
security aren't the same thing

853
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:36,490
absolutely true here's proof of that so

854
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:38,080
fully compliant but they wake up and

855
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:41,230
they walk into work and 18 sites are

856
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:44,049
completely encrypted so what do I mean

857
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:45,940
by that well their ERP system was

858
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:47,620
encrypted their exchange servers were

859
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:49,049
encrypted and none of them were offline

860
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:52,239
by the way so they were all encrypted

861
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:54,190
payroll system they weren't using a

862
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,820
cloud-based payroll system they couldn't

863
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:58,840
make payroll their ESX hosts their ESX

864
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,789
hosts were actually running their

865
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,740
manufacturing process in their plants so

866
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:04,919
their ability to manufacture their

867
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:07,419
product and get it out the door stopped

868
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:10,029
so quite literally the company came to a

869
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:12,220
standstill on December 12th on December

870
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:14,039
14th the ir firm that the insurance

871
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:17,769
company had provided engaged with them

872
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:21,990
and they had an initial $850,000 ransom

873
00:33:17,769 --> 00:33:24,460
demand from the attacker on the 21st

874
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:26,980
that firm was kicked out because the

875
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:29,740
business still wasn't operational okay

876
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:31,960
so they engaged in new ir firm this

877
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:33,909
happens to be the firm that Sentinel one

878
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:36,220
supports and so this is where we kind of

879
00:33:33,909 --> 00:33:37,899
got involved into the game so on the

880
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:40,090
22nd

881
00:33:37,899 --> 00:33:42,549
we had deployed Sentinel one on 5,000

882
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:43,949
systems they had like 4800 so I just say

883
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:46,770
5,000

884
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:48,690
and we got there ERP payroll and their

885
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:51,300
net app systems so they they were able

886
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:52,380
to get a payroll processed for the 23rd

887
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,639
although I didn't show up for all

888
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,960
employees but at least some of them got

889
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,210
paid before Christmas and that was a

890
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,590
really big issue this business almost

891
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:01,640
went out of business by the way and this

892
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:04,260
isn't a small company it's 5,000 people

893
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:06,120
so so what was happening why did the

894
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:09,719
first insurance I our firm fail why the

895
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:14,040
second one went so fantastic technique

896
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:18,120
the decryption tool absolutely decrypted

897
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:19,710
the box then it dropped the next one and

898
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:22,730
it dropped it with a new key and a new

899
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:24,810
encryption and a new ransom negotiation

900
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:26,400
very very fortunately for this

901
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:31,020
organization and this almost never

902
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:32,310
happens a an organization I'll just

903
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,630
leave it at that was able to provide

904
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:37,110
them the decryption key so they didn't

905
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:39,540
actually pay ransom on either case but

906
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:42,330
this comes out to a great point of if

907
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:43,889
you hit with ransomware and you decrypt

908
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:46,199
the box do not

909
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:48,359
reinstall the same protection product

910
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:52,770
that failed the first time because this

911
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:54,419
kind of fell again just FYI so the only

912
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:55,949
difference was the second firm came in

913
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:57,779
and they dropped Sentinel one in which

914
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:59,370
was able to identify that the ransomware

915
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:01,800
decryptor tool they'd gotten wasn't

916
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:03,150
indeed actually dropping a second Trojan

917
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,730
and restarting the whole process and

918
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:07,350
that was what the issue was

919
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:11,820
so by December 23rd company is fully

920
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:13,110
functioning and running again so I think

921
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,910
I think that's a pretty interesting

922
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:16,560
story because we're talking in

923
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:18,600
traditional senses of dwell times of

924
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,820
100-plus days and that leads us to a

925
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,350
comfort level of hey I can handle

926
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:24,930
detection in a couple hours or a couple

927
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:27,870
days and I can handle responses in a 72

928
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:31,410
hour time frame what I'm telling you is

929
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:32,970
that models done like it may work great

930
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:34,980
on the apt side still and it's very

931
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:36,600
valid for the apt side but all of you

932
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,760
are more risk from a cyber crime than an

933
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:43,710
apt side or a nation-state apt I should

934
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:44,340
clarify now the second study this is my

935
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,660
favorite one

936
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:48,720
don't read too far ahead because you'll

937
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:51,270
miss the fun so this one happened in

938
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,799
March we had a company call us up and

939
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,940
they said hey we've got actually as a

940
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,830
partner of ours called something said

941
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:58,069
hey one of our clients they have to

942
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:59,480
confirm D motet in fact

943
00:35:58,069 --> 00:36:01,609
we've done a good job of training our

944
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,660
customers like hey emo Ted is precursor

945
00:36:01,609 --> 00:36:03,920
to ransomware events here's the

946
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,569
timelines they typically come endurance

947
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,950
was saying hey you're always telling us

948
00:36:05,569 --> 00:36:08,839
some stuff happens really fast

949
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:10,160
whatever gonna do my answers well let's

950
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:12,500
put Sentinel 1 on there and then we'll

951
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,750
figure everything out after and so we

952
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:18,230
agreed to put Seminole 1 on there while

953
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:19,940
they were doing that so like my team or

954
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:21,710
some of our support team like we and

955
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,980
mass we had people working 24 hours a

956
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:25,880
day

957
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:28,430
we dropped 42,000 agents in in 38 hours

958
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:30,220
like that's a lot of work fYI if you

959
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:33,410
haven't done that that's a lot of work

960
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:35,899
but the ransom never hit we're proud of

961
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:37,399
ourselves were like alright and then we

962
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,809
call in one of our companies who's an ir

963
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,309
partner of ours to go in and actually do

964
00:36:38,809 --> 00:36:41,299
the IR and find out what's the scope

965
00:36:40,309 --> 00:36:45,319
what's the engagements what's the

966
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:46,819
limitation and mike is a good friend of

967
00:36:45,319 --> 00:36:49,190
mine a tire firm I call him up after day

968
00:36:46,819 --> 00:36:50,420
one on my case how bad did it get how

969
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:52,790
close were we getting the hit he's like

970
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:53,750
there's nothing there it's like what do

971
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,130
you mean there's nothing there like

972
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:57,740
there was to emote infections or had to

973
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:59,960
be something else coming he's like no

974
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:03,709
there was nothing there let me let me

975
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:05,630
get some more long story short they

976
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:07,339
going in there they're doing their

977
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:08,450
hunting Sentinel one has an EDR product

978
00:37:07,339 --> 00:37:10,819
so we can go and give you visibility

979
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:12,529
everywhere so they're doing you know

980
00:37:10,819 --> 00:37:13,759
they're scoping out the environment

981
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:17,059
they're finding out everywhere

982
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,740
everything has been when you have and

983
00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:20,329
let's look at the dates here on the 14th

984
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:22,578
of March the CISO was walked out of the

985
00:37:20,329 --> 00:37:24,049
building essentially a precursor to

986
00:37:22,579 --> 00:37:26,230
being fired but literally walked out of

987
00:37:24,049 --> 00:37:29,569
the building and put on terminal leave

988
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:32,240
what happened is one of the employees of

989
00:37:29,569 --> 00:37:33,950
the CISO was rather ambitious they

990
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,808
wanted to implement some security

991
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:36,919
programs and the Cisco's telling him I

992
00:37:35,809 --> 00:37:39,799
don't have the budget to implement your

993
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:42,530
programs so to embarrass the CISO he was

994
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:45,619
going to stage an emo Ted attack to show

995
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:47,780
how vulnerable the company was so he

996
00:37:45,619 --> 00:37:49,819
staged the attack got the massive

997
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:51,710
response in and the Cisco got fired

998
00:37:49,819 --> 00:37:53,690
everything's going exactly as he wanted

999
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:55,609
to go until the IR firm comes in and

1000
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:57,260
tracks it down and figures out this was

1001
00:37:55,609 --> 00:37:59,660
only installed on two machines and you

1002
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:00,920
logged into both machines within five

1003
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,319
seconds of being installed and oh by the

1004
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:05,329
way you're the one that installed it so

1005
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:07,040
long story short employees not in jail

1006
00:38:05,329 --> 00:38:08,349
because he signed some stuff with the

1007
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,750
company but it's not an employee anymore

1008
00:38:08,349 --> 00:38:19,000
CISO is reinstated

1009
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:20,650
and insider threats real so this is the

1010
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,740
world we live in and security like it's

1011
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:25,840
a muddled mess sometimes and it's really

1012
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:30,879
hard to understand what all we're

1013
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:32,800
looking at so again I've seen and I've

1014
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,150
pulled this off of a series of blogs you

1015
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,550
just some of the things I hear half of

1016
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:38,740
ransomware victims pay the ransom and I

1017
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:41,230
our firms to do that I think it's a lot

1018
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:42,879
more than half I think it's way higher

1019
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:44,830
than half but this is what I hear this

1020
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,830
is what I read online

1021
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:50,890
in my experience unless there's some way

1022
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:53,710
of having that key provided the firms

1023
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:55,810
are gonna pay in that now on a publicly

1024
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:58,000
disclosed one where they don't have a

1025
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:59,710
cyber insurance policy then it's

1026
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,140
probably closer to half but if there's a

1027
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:03,730
cyber insurance policy in case then the

1028
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:05,230
business wants to be back online they

1029
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:06,550
have a legal contract to get back online

1030
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:09,910
there's an avenue to do it so they're

1031
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:12,730
gonna do it only a quarter of them get

1032
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:16,390
all dated back it's a realtor story

1033
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:18,010
eighty percent yes and no those

1034
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:19,600
decrypter tools do a really good job

1035
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:21,010
they're not going to decrypt a hundred

1036
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,230
percent of the files in the box but

1037
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:25,990
typically they're decrypting all of the

1038
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:27,010
data files what's really annoying is

1039
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:28,479
when they've encrypted some sort of

1040
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:29,650
system process file and they can't

1041
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,180
decrypt that one then you've got to go

1042
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:32,710
like piecemeal and hunt on the different

1043
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:35,140
websites to try to find and reinstall

1044
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:37,120
that and half the time it's just cleaner

1045
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:38,589
to build a new server in that case but

1046
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,910
those are usually around some custom

1047
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:42,220
application server that you end up

1048
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:44,529
dealing with that world so by and large

1049
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:46,299
it's in their interest to make sure you

1050
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:47,980
get your files back or people would stop

1051
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,330
paying and then that would that would

1052
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,470
kill themselves so they do they do have

1053
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:53,200
worked pretty hard to make sure you can

1054
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:55,240
get paid there's been an increase of

1055
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,129
200% and ransomware claims from 2018 to

1056
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:00,450
2019 year over year I would definitely

1057
00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:02,830
agree with that it may even be higher I

1058
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:04,930
will tell you that this last poll is for

1059
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:07,090
me that the ir firms we see are seeing

1060
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:09,069
customers offline for about three and a

1061
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:10,660
half days I mean in many cases they

1062
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:12,550
can't operate their business or they're

1063
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,930
under impairment from the attack for

1064
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:15,400
about three and a half days the

1065
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:16,299
insurance companies and the brokers are

1066
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,930
working with their telling them it's

1067
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:22,390
around 10 to 14 days so the speed is

1068
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:24,020
definitely the game all right so let's

1069
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:26,680
talk a little bit about speed then

1070
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:29,570
so let's say that one of your users

1071
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:31,279
clicks on a malicious word document that

1072
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:32,810
malicious Word document has a macro

1073
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:36,320
embedded side of it and evoke Imhotep

1074
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:39,920
what's going to happen so this is it so

1075
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:41,450
the Imhotep piece is the blue and across

1076
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,700
ten runs it's going to take an average

1077
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:46,370
of 22 seconds for that Imhotep to run

1078
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:50,810
and drop then you have whatever that

1079
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:53,180
dropper is gonna be Mac right whatever

1080
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:55,100
the ransomware is gonna be often times

1081
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:56,540
though the initial drop dropper isn't

1082
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:58,430
really gonna depend on the organization

1083
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:02,810
coming isn't gonna necessarily be the

1084
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:07,190
ransomware itself the holy grill is

1085
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:08,960
clean accessible user accounts so if you

1086
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:10,520
have a lead on a security shop and they

1087
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,900
don't have any defenses in place and you

1088
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,130
feel like you have no defenses in place

1089
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,570
and they're gonna go in there and

1090
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:16,820
they're gonna try to be going after user

1091
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:18,830
accounts there's actually a built-in

1092
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:21,290
module in Imhotep now that actually

1093
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:23,509
scans the network looking for default

1094
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:25,730
like admin admin passwords on network

1095
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:27,380
appliance and devices once they find

1096
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:29,540
though this report those back and then

1097
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:31,310
you put a monitor tap on those and now

1098
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,450
you're looking for user creds getting

1099
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:35,270
into boxes trying to do privilege

1100
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:36,980
escalation and get domain creds once you

1101
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:38,120
have the main creds then you can take

1102
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:40,520
your time to hunt around and figure out

1103
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:42,440
what you want the manufacturing company

1104
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:45,200
I was talking to that's what happened to

1105
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:46,700
them they had a 72 hour dwell time

1106
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,589
before the ransomware was launched the

1107
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:51,049
ransomware was launched as the attackers

1108
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:52,400
were walking out the door what they did

1109
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,920
with those domain creds is they went

1110
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,260
into the email servers they found

1111
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:59,240
legitimate business conversations they

1112
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:01,190
replied emails to their business

1113
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,049
partners as part of ongoing legitimate

1114
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:04,850
business operations with attachments

1115
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:06,140
relevant to the conversation that got

1116
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:08,360
their business partners infected with

1117
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:10,040
the same ransomware and and that's what

1118
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,440
they use the time for it could have been

1119
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:16,540
used for way way worse but they just

1120
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,540
care about time smash-and-grab move on

1121
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:20,900
so I'll describe that as code on code

1122
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,680
warfare or at least that's the era we're

1123
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:24,530
entering into

1124
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:26,899
it's no longer enough no matter how good

1125
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:29,000
we are have cyber operations and how

1126
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,950
good we are shutting things down we are

1127
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,380
moving to a code on code warfare which

1128
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:34,660
means I need adaptive code to respond to

1129
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:38,069
adaptive code

1130
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:40,450
so if I'm looking at this 149 seconds

1131
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:42,308
this is how inside of a behavioral

1132
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:45,069
system like Sentinel 1 I can track those

1133
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:48,970
actions across 149 seconds what I'm

1134
00:42:45,069 --> 00:42:50,680
seeing and what I'm looking for so I've

1135
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:52,000
got a quick little I was gonna try to do

1136
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:56,019
this thing live but I'm just not going

1137
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,339
to trust my phone at the moment so I

1138
00:42:56,019 --> 00:42:58,569
will play you the video because this is

1139
00:42:57,339 --> 00:43:01,210
what I didn't Japan so sorry for the

1140
00:42:58,569 --> 00:43:04,990
Japanese at the beginning here maybe I

1141
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:07,380
should put at the beginning so what I've

1142
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:10,089
done is I've taken a word document and

1143
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:12,009
I've embedded a macro into this word

1144
00:43:10,089 --> 00:43:14,769
document and then I'm using this alodia

1145
00:43:12,009 --> 00:43:16,539
motet and I just grabbed this is one of

1146
00:43:14,769 --> 00:43:18,250
the emo tats so it's pretty funny

1147
00:43:16,539 --> 00:43:19,660
because one day it drops Maktub and

1148
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:22,049
another day it drops something else but

1149
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:25,618
it is dropping something and it's live

1150
00:43:22,049 --> 00:43:28,269
so you can see when it kicks off that

1151
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:29,440
okay I'm gonna come in and I'm using

1152
00:43:28,269 --> 00:43:30,609
Senate one products I have access to

1153
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,500
this to just show me what's going on

1154
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:34,990
here but now I've got visibility of what

1155
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:39,569
this this actual attack is doing and let

1156
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:44,200
me get down to the attack storyline okay

1157
00:43:39,569 --> 00:43:45,400
so I want to get right before that okay

1158
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,078
so you can see right here that here's

1159
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,029
the Windward it's got the macro embedded

1160
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:50,650
the initial connection happening out is

1161
00:43:49,029 --> 00:43:52,299
the PowerShell connections we see and

1162
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:53,859
then the power shells are great because

1163
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:56,470
allows you to spawn off multiple things

1164
00:43:53,859 --> 00:43:59,009
simultaneously as needed so I can go

1165
00:43:56,470 --> 00:44:01,089
back and I can actually start to get my

1166
00:43:59,009 --> 00:44:02,829
console holes for my interactive shell

1167
00:44:01,089 --> 00:44:05,950
but I can also mess with things like

1168
00:44:02,829 --> 00:44:08,740
Group Policy update and VSS updates

1169
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:10,750
things like that I'm gonna skip ahead a

1170
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:14,140
little bit if I look at the raw data

1171
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:16,539
report from that type of attack you can

1172
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:18,430
literally walk step by step so we have

1173
00:44:16,539 --> 00:44:19,690
just tons and tons of these systems

1174
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:21,490
we'll just run and detonate and watch

1175
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:24,579
these things go across that's how we can

1176
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:26,109
create what we can confirm to be an

1177
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:27,910
attack chain sequence associated with

1178
00:44:26,109 --> 00:44:29,859
the motet or any other variants when you

1179
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:31,058
have this across you know hundreds of

1180
00:44:29,859 --> 00:44:34,420
thousands or tens of thousands of

1181
00:44:31,059 --> 00:44:36,039
endpoints it's very very helpful if you

1182
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:37,450
look back on the end point that this was

1183
00:44:36,039 --> 00:44:38,950
hit in this particular case that dropped

1184
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:40,720
Maktub you can see there's the Maktub

1185
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:42,038
which in what Maktub is going to do is

1186
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,959
is going to go into your documents and

1187
00:44:42,039 --> 00:44:45,190
it's gonna crypt your documents so you

1188
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,119
can see right here that these files are

1189
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:49,369
encrypted

1190
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:53,150
and so I'm gonna give you a quick couple

1191
00:44:49,369 --> 00:44:56,509
seconds to talk about code on code

1192
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:59,479
warfare again just moves a little too

1193
00:44:56,509 --> 00:45:01,489
fast for me if you look across the top

1194
00:44:59,479 --> 00:45:03,859
here you'll see that I have the standard

1195
00:45:01,489 --> 00:45:06,199
kill quarantine options that I would in

1196
00:45:03,859 --> 00:45:07,609
a traditional a/v product but what I

1197
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:10,099
want to focus a bit more is this

1198
00:45:07,609 --> 00:45:11,869
remediate and roll back options so what

1199
00:45:10,099 --> 00:45:13,969
I'm saying is code on code warfare I

1200
00:45:11,869 --> 00:45:16,430
need machines to be autonomous or I need

1201
00:45:13,969 --> 00:45:17,569
machines to be self defending and this

1202
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:18,828
is one of the biggest draws for me to

1203
00:45:17,569 --> 00:45:21,288
come to Sentinel 1 actually was this

1204
00:45:18,829 --> 00:45:23,689
mentality and and how it works so in

1205
00:45:21,289 --> 00:45:25,369
this particular case since I allowed the

1206
00:45:23,689 --> 00:45:26,420
box to get decrypted I'm just gonna come

1207
00:45:25,369 --> 00:45:30,829
and send a one i'ma hit a rollback

1208
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:32,029
option and when you come into the into

1209
00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:32,900
the Machine you'll see it as it kills

1210
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:34,609
what it's going to do is it's gonna

1211
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:36,229
first kill the active running processes

1212
00:45:34,609 --> 00:45:37,969
it's gonna work left to right across

1213
00:45:36,229 --> 00:45:40,189
that chain so this big banner here

1214
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:42,109
represents the running process someone's

1215
00:45:40,189 --> 00:45:43,459
gonna kill that process now it's going

1216
00:45:42,109 --> 00:45:45,288
in behind the scenes and you can't see

1217
00:45:43,459 --> 00:45:47,390
anything it's undoing any of the

1218
00:45:45,289 --> 00:45:48,349
registry modifications then it's going

1219
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:49,699
to go through and it's going to update

1220
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:50,869
the scheduled tasks and remove the

1221
00:45:49,699 --> 00:45:52,699
scheduled tasks that were put in for

1222
00:45:50,869 --> 00:45:54,769
persistence mechanisms then it's going

1223
00:45:52,699 --> 00:45:56,209
to go into the VSS stores that had an

1224
00:45:54,769 --> 00:45:57,709
anti tamper around and it's gonna figure

1225
00:45:56,209 --> 00:46:00,019
out which files are modify it restores

1226
00:45:57,709 --> 00:46:04,848
the files for the users this entire

1227
00:46:00,019 --> 00:46:08,660
video is like 2 minutes and 23 seconds

1228
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:13,569
so that entire attack defense cycle was

1229
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:15,920
2 minutes like like top to bottom so

1230
00:46:13,569 --> 00:46:18,589
that's kind of what I'm proposing now is

1231
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,910
we need to start looking at how fast

1232
00:46:18,589 --> 00:46:21,380
they're operating and get ourselves

1233
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:25,759
positioned to be able to operate that

1234
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:28,189
quickly as well here's a real time frame

1235
00:46:25,759 --> 00:46:32,359
and you'll see here that one took three

1236
00:46:28,189 --> 00:46:33,649
seconds not the 22 okay so the the speed

1237
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:34,670
and then and this is probably the

1238
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:35,869
biggest trend that I keep going back to

1239
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:36,859
you over and over the speed in the

1240
00:46:35,869 --> 00:46:41,209
attack that's happening is happening

1241
00:46:36,859 --> 00:46:43,880
faster now I like miter attack quite a

1242
00:46:41,209 --> 00:46:45,140
bit I think this is Finn's 6 but they

1243
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,369
have an attack navigator by the way if

1244
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:49,009
you're not familiar with this really

1245
00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:52,400
really cool but it's also important to

1246
00:46:49,009 --> 00:46:53,719
understand how to use miter attack this

1247
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,130
is where vendors get themselves a bad

1248
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:56,869
name and every single vendor that

1249
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:58,219
participated in this put out a paper

1250
00:46:56,869 --> 00:47:00,140
explaining why they were the best ones

1251
00:46:58,219 --> 00:47:02,030
at this miter is

1252
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:03,440
not an actual comparative analysis

1253
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:07,040
testing so it's never meant to be that

1254
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:09,530
interestingly enough what it is is it's

1255
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,970
a TTP so historically down in San

1256
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:14,000
Antonio there's an organization called

1257
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:16,850
the 23rd squadron and they would build

1258
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,410
TTP's of adversarial methods what you're

1259
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:20,330
trying to understand is how do cyber

1260
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:21,980
operators operate so you can

1261
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:23,990
behaviorally start to make an

1262
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:26,120
attribution to who they are most

1263
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:28,160
attribution done today is done by

1264
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:29,420
reverse engineering the code looking at

1265
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,129
the character sets what are the natural

1266
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:33,470
language processing and then you look at

1267
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:34,760
sort of the communications that you may

1268
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:35,870
have had back and forth with it with

1269
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:37,610
someone and then you're going to make a

1270
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:40,069
conclusion oh this is Russian because of

1271
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:42,320
X Y or Z what were what we're now doing

1272
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:44,330
is taking that and expanding it into the

1273
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,800
methodologies over time across the

1274
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:47,299
larger data set of companies and

1275
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,380
organizations instead of just within the

1276
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,700
federal government or just within the

1277
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:51,740
military now we can do it across all

1278
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:53,390
commercial organizations so if you're

1279
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:55,160
doing within six for example you know

1280
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:56,330
that these are the types of techniques

1281
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:59,390
in these tactic columns that they're

1282
00:47:56,330 --> 00:48:00,890
gonna run through and use the problem we

1283
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:03,259
make with defenders is that some of

1284
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:05,210
these techniques are very very

1285
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:07,940
legitimate like PowerShell anybody use

1286
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:09,410
PowerShell in your organization yeah so

1287
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:10,970
what are you gonna do if you have a

1288
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:13,730
product that generates an alert every

1289
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:15,919
single time PowerShell is used well

1290
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:18,590
you're probably gonna be like I'm

1291
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,060
turning that alert off right that's what

1292
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:22,220
I did back in the day it's what

1293
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:23,810
everybody's gonna do and then you end up

1294
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:27,259
creating a black hole because now you

1295
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:30,230
don't see that so what I'm saying is in

1296
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:32,120
order to have an autonomous code on code

1297
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:34,040
defense system we need to be able to be

1298
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:36,319
contextually aware and this is what

1299
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:37,970
mitre had called the tainted concept and

1300
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:40,190
they're gonna rename it to real inking

1301
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:41,810
here in the next iteration but you want

1302
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:43,850
to understand that PowerShell was

1303
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:45,650
invoked but how it was invoked in the

1304
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:47,810
context prior as well as his post

1305
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:49,100
activities to determine whether or not

1306
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:52,460
that's something that's malicious to be

1307
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:54,740
done this is what an analyst will do by

1308
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:57,650
doing an EGR query and the city in there

1309
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:59,689
and studying it the problem is is taking

1310
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:01,370
two or three seconds for rake in these

1311
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:03,800
other mount ransomware is to operate and

1312
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:06,370
execute you don't have the time to do

1313
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,370
that studying

1314
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:15,220
so coming from a military background I

1315
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:18,070
like to think of things in terms of fog

1316
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:19,779
of war if you're in a warfare

1317
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:21,190
environment is chaotic it's noisy

1318
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:22,570
there's events going off all the time

1319
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:23,950
there's good people there's bad people

1320
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:25,150
you definitely don't want to be shot by

1321
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:30,460
your friends especially when your

1322
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:32,410
friends have the bigger bullets and so

1323
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:33,700
if you look at what Brian Krebs was

1324
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:36,430
talked about he put this one out after

1325
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:39,819
the Marriot breach the paradigm were in

1326
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:42,279
today is that the adversary only has to

1327
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:43,540
get through once they don't get arrested

1328
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:45,640
they don't get shot they don't get

1329
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:47,110
anything for attacking you they do it

1330
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:50,440
all day long and they only have to be

1331
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:52,450
right one time all right

1332
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:56,170
you have to be right 100% of the time

1333
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:58,720
and this has been a struggle up to this

1334
00:49:56,170 --> 00:50:01,450
point when the attacks were meant to be

1335
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:03,040
low and slow now that we're moving to a

1336
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:03,850
smash-and-grab maja nowhere frankly they

1337
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,460
don't even care

1338
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:08,290
then I mean care that their that their

1339
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:10,030
attacks may be fingerprinted and

1340
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:12,580
available in 24 hours like that's that's

1341
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:14,140
a huge window for them so now we need to

1342
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:17,290
do is figure out how do we move into

1343
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:20,859
this environment of code on code warfare

1344
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:23,110
how do I operate autonomously and so let

1345
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:24,970
me think of it this way everything

1346
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:29,080
that's known threats I have a legacy

1347
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:31,480
stack we used to call that hold defense

1348
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:34,720
on depth which we then recount into

1349
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:36,010
expense in depth and I come from the

1350
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,799
organizations that helped build that

1351
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:40,030
model we still have to have that varied

1352
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,130
infrastructure we need to have the

1353
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:44,770
multiple views of things but we

1354
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:46,630
definitely need a better connectivity

1355
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:47,620
tissue between these types of products

1356
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:49,240
and that's where you see the security

1357
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:52,000
orchestration market coming across which

1358
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:54,310
I'm I'm definitely a big fan of that the

1359
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,110
problem is just buying it and putting it

1360
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:57,790
in place isn't enough it has to be put

1361
00:50:56,110 --> 00:51:00,880
in place with the play books that are

1362
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:03,820
actually effective nobody is either

1363
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:06,610
confident in their play books to let

1364
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:08,050
them run completely autonomously or they

1365
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:09,550
don't have buy-in from the business to

1366
00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:11,350
support them and that's the bigger

1367
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:13,150
challenge so we as security

1368
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:16,360
professionals need to get better at

1369
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:18,910
providing c-level context about what the

1370
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:21,270
lack of our orchestrated responses are

1371
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:21,270
causing

1372
00:51:22,259 --> 00:51:28,509
and this might be the way we need to

1373
00:51:25,419 --> 00:51:30,910
start thinking about this as a society

1374
00:51:28,509 --> 00:51:32,559
we're very familiar with automated

1375
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:33,969
actions being taken on our behalf

1376
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:38,109
especially when it comes thing to like

1377
00:51:33,969 --> 00:51:39,789
planes or cars so if I look at things

1378
00:51:38,109 --> 00:51:42,640
like forward collision warning and the

1379
00:51:39,789 --> 00:51:44,380
decreases of risks right and then I go

1380
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:46,509
to a CFO and I say I want to buy all

1381
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:49,329
vehicles going forward that have forward

1382
00:51:46,509 --> 00:51:51,039
wishing forward collision warning on

1383
00:51:49,329 --> 00:51:53,499
them because this is going to reduce my

1384
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:56,049
rates by this that's gonna get a great

1385
00:51:53,499 --> 00:51:58,390
sign from a CFO and if I come and I say

1386
00:51:56,049 --> 00:52:00,489
and I add Auto break to that now my

1387
00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:02,709
front to rear crashes are decreased 50%

1388
00:52:00,489 --> 00:52:03,969
then the CFO could walk in and look at

1389
00:52:02,709 --> 00:52:05,589
that organization and go man I could cut

1390
00:52:03,969 --> 00:52:07,329
back 50% of the axis we had last year

1391
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:08,558
that could have saved me X amount it

1392
00:52:07,329 --> 00:52:09,939
could have saved me this lawsuit it

1393
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:11,380
could save this endangerment of life

1394
00:52:09,939 --> 00:52:13,839
whatever that may be there's a

1395
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:15,489
quantifiable term to that what we're

1396
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:21,400
struggling with on our side right now is

1397
00:52:15,489 --> 00:52:24,640
the ability to have that conversation so

1398
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:26,169
I'm gonna skip those and let me let me

1399
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,788
kind of say that maybe this is an

1400
00:52:26,169 --> 00:52:29,109
initial attempt to how we can

1401
00:52:27,789 --> 00:52:30,179
characterize this and have this type of

1402
00:52:29,109 --> 00:52:34,119
conversation

1403
00:52:30,179 --> 00:52:36,579
your legacy stack this is the e motet

1404
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:38,799
stack running on it today when you have

1405
00:52:36,579 --> 00:52:40,239
a truly autonomous system this is a

1406
00:52:38,799 --> 00:52:41,859
sentinel one that can operate truly

1407
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:44,169
autonomously from both a prevention and

1408
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:46,929
a restoration side frame this is that

1409
00:52:44,169 --> 00:52:48,969
that risk mitigation factor so you can

1410
00:52:46,929 --> 00:52:50,829
show a side-by-side comparison of pre

1411
00:52:48,969 --> 00:52:52,479
and post and what impact that has on

1412
00:52:50,829 --> 00:52:53,499
risk associated with the ransomware

1413
00:52:52,479 --> 00:52:56,499
payouts that you've seen across the

1414
00:52:53,499 --> 00:52:58,029
industry because computers operating at

1415
00:52:56,499 --> 00:53:00,428
computer speed against computers gonna

1416
00:52:58,029 --> 00:53:03,390
be faster than me and my friends a

1417
00:53:00,429 --> 00:53:05,380
sentinel one doing that kind of stuff so

1418
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:07,929
again I want to leave some time at the

1419
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:09,159
end for questions would absolutely love

1420
00:53:07,929 --> 00:53:10,719
to connect with anybody so here's my

1421
00:53:09,159 --> 00:53:12,159
contact information just please don't

1422
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:14,140
call me at 4:30 in the morning like I

1423
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:15,489
just caught today but outside of that

1424
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:16,598
anybody have questions or comments or

1425
00:53:15,489 --> 00:53:18,069
you think you'd like to dig in on

1426
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:20,619
actually I'm going to encourage you guys

1427
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:22,890
if you have questions to catch Jarrod

1428
00:53:20,619 --> 00:53:25,569
after this we are actually out of time

1429
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:26,710
so if you could please put your hands

1430
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:35,650
together for Jared

1431
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:35,650
[Applause]
