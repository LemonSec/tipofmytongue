1
00:00:03,589 --> 00:00:11,429
hello hello hello I there's like one

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,620
person that's awake that's awesome I

3
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,120
mean okay we're getting late in the day

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,189
I get it but you guys are almost there

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,350
you've made it all this way just a

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,740
couple more talks so I'm gonna try this

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,279
again

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,900
how you guys doing better it's still

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,730
like you guys like way up here this

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,830
morning and now our like way down here

11
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,500
that's usually the opposite on day two

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,120
everybody's hungover the second day so a

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,730
couple housekeeping things really

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,129
quickly first of all you are in ballroom

15
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,980
see this is the anything track if that's

16
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:42,660
not where you want it to be seriously

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,169
you've been here for two or a day and a

18
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,309
half how are you that confused still

19
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,879
maybe that's where the alcohol went I

20
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:50,160
don't know

21
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,800
second thing do not stand in my fire

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,690
exits we get in trouble if you do that

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,070
so you're in or you're out just don't

24
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,829
block the fire exits we got plenty of

25
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,020
seating for everybody come on in sit on

26
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:04,140
down finally cellphones

27
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,189
turn them off or silence them or do

28
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,939
whatever you have to do to make sure

29
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:10,350
they don't make noise don't go browsing

30
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:11,820
videos on Twitter or YouTube in the

31
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,619
middle of this because your phone will

32
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,169
make noise even if it's on silent

33
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,909
make sure it's quiet I wore boots for a

34
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,030
reason I don't want to have to stomp

35
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,770
anybody fair enough cool all right so

36
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,439
our next talk we are talking all about

37
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,289
the importance of having visibility into

38
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,050
your IT assets and with that I am going

39
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:36,800
to turn it over to Brian Burke

40
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:36,800
[Applause]

41
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:47,900
how's everyone doing good so this is IT

42
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:49,700
asset inventory sometimes we go by AI

43
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,470
even though you know you guys might

44
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,590
think of AI as something different well

45
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:56,690
this is loud anyway so today it's the

46
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:59,440
afternoon session I know we're all super

47
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:01,910
excited to hear about asset inventory

48
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,820
you know it's not hacking how many

49
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:08,869
people in here are hackers like that's

50
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:09,560
their full-time job anyone know that red

51
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:13,250
team blue team

52
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:16,600
okay how many people just do it on the

53
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:18,620
side anyone do it just for fun yeah

54
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:23,269
anyone do it cuz they don't like their

55
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:25,400
neighbors yeah it's all good when the

56
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:27,550
neighborhood has open Wi-Fi and yeah

57
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,010
their dog goes they're not good to you

58
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:34,640
anyway so it like she said if you guys

59
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:36,230
have your phones are on silent like I

60
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,450
don't care it's the end of the day use

61
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,140
your phones but she might she might not

62
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:42,190
like it

63
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:44,720
she's bigger than I am she'll hurt you

64
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,609
if you have to stand up and stretch do

65
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,959
it this is not the most interesting

66
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,340
stuff here we'll try to make it

67
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,650
interesting we'll try to relate it as

68
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:58,340
best we can to this hacking conference

69
00:02:51,650 --> 00:03:00,920
okay uh what else my background so I've

70
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,930
been unlike the person before me I've

71
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:06,649
been in the IT industry longer than he's

72
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:10,160
probably been alive so I've worked with

73
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:12,019
many different customers I've been you

74
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,060
know start out in doing programming I've

75
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:16,250
done system admin I've done security

76
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,410
I've done you know all sorts of stuff

77
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:21,049
and I've worked with many different

78
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:23,780
types of people so I've worked with you

79
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:26,450
know the accounting clerks up to CEOs

80
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:29,209
and everybody in between and what I

81
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:31,940
found out is that the people that I've

82
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:34,549
worked with they're not the brightest

83
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:37,459
right that's what makes our job easy as

84
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:38,900
hackers it's easy to pretend you're

85
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:41,780
someone you're not you can walk into

86
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,609
another company and pretend you're

87
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:48,310
someone and have them sit down and log

88
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:48,310
in for you that's that's easy

89
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,620
also have you guys have any questions

90
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,840
you don't have to wait till the end you

91
00:03:54,620 --> 00:04:01,010
know feel free to raise your hand it'll

92
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,090
keep us a little bit more lively sorry I

93
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:06,560
don't have any beer to keep it more

94
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:08,030
lively right now so anyway asset

95
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,650
inventory you know it's gonna start with

96
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:13,520
visibility we want to see what's out

97
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:15,470
there on our network right we sometimes

98
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,540
see about it through the threats we

99
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:19,100
learn about these new assets that we

100
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:22,430
have that we didn't know about through

101
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,020
threats the cloud security vulnerability

102
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,490
program our compliance maybe our

103
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:29,210
compliance people are the ones that are

104
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:30,520
shown us the wanna cry virus that was

105
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:34,370
out there the hack that was out there

106
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:36,020
years back how many of those XP anybody

107
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,930
would get hit with it anyone want a

108
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:41,599
sight to it someone okay who someone

109
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:44,210
brave but anyway so those hit mostly XP

110
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,700
in 2003 systems right how many of those

111
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:48,409
were not known if we knew about those

112
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,280
systems ahead of time could we have done

113
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,080
anything about them

114
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,489
maybe maybe we could have had the vendor

115
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:57,729
update on maybe we could have shut him

116
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:57,730
off ahead of time since they were so old

117
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:06,290
all right anyone in here allow just

118
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,240
their general population at their

119
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:11,570
companies to download anything they want

120
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,490
on their company assets there's gotta be

121
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:18,920
some some great people they're gonna

122
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:21,380
answer to that so out of those who

123
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,970
installed out of those who raised their

124
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:28,190
hands how many know exactly what's on

125
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:32,600
your company assets what software okay

126
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:34,130
it what I found is when you start

127
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,130
allowing your your users to download

128
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:39,020
anything and everything it's really

129
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:40,880
tough to find that information so once

130
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:45,260
you start bringing in a program like

131
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:47,270
your asset inventory people are really

132
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,320
shocked to see what's out there so when

133
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,539
you start bringing in one of these

134
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,030
programs you know to see what's out

135
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:57,610
there is one thing and then you got to

136
00:05:53,030 --> 00:06:00,969
find out who owns it so here's a example

137
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:03,450
so I have a clerk over here

138
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:06,670
this person does accounting so this

139
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:09,120
co-worker of mine Wesley does accounting

140
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:12,370
and they want to become an iOS developer

141
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,340
so on their side time they download all

142
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:17,860
these programs Wesley was smart enough

143
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:20,109
to do it in a kind of a cluster on his

144
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,180
machine so it's not really seen maybe

145
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:29,470
our asset inventory didn't see that at

146
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:31,570
the time so what kind of freeware and

147
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,790
shareware was downloaded on the machine

148
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:36,250
what kind of you know bad stuff is out

149
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:42,940
there if we don't know about it then we

150
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:44,890
can't do anything about it right so once

151
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,080
we do find out about it what's gonna

152
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:49,630
happen once it's found out maybe we

153
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,270
found out from compliance and we get a

154
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:55,659
fine from HIPPA where our Sox compliance

155
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:57,940
or whatever we have maybe it's not that

156
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:02,470
bad and we can just you know get rid of

157
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:05,860
this stuff okay

158
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:07,990
ZDNet did a study and they found 30% of

159
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:12,280
the DoD all their software they didn't

160
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:15,550
know about so that's a big hit they can

161
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:18,429
have there's probably some people in

162
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:21,580
here from there but so I read this the

163
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:23,020
other day and 30% of the software you

164
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,789
know that's a big hit like if you don't

165
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:27,280
know about all your different assets out

166
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:30,370
there and all the pieces of software on

167
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:33,099
it and you get microsoft says Annie up

168
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:36,490
and you know may not have money for all

169
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:38,650
that extra stuff okay and then the other

170
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,230
day that they just came out and said

171
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:43,120
they were going to change the ballistic

172
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:45,700
missiles to not use those eight inch

173
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,010
discs so most people in here probably

174
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:50,530
well there's a good mix of people in

175
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,789
here wide range of Ages but the eight

176
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:54,340
inch discs cuz I don't know how many

177
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:56,650
people use them back I was even before

178
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,960
my time I use the five and a quarter and

179
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:01,710
you know it can store a little bit over

180
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,710
mag so

181
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:12,818
all right so let's take let's take that

182
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:15,519
accounting clerks computer again right

183
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:17,889
so on that computer

184
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:27,489
maybe it's end of life software do we

185
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:30,309
know about it all right so once we find

186
00:08:27,489 --> 00:08:33,610
that software on this machine do we know

187
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:34,959
who the owner is the hardest part of any

188
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,579
of this stuff is finding out who the

189
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:40,718
owner is you have to do a lot of

190
00:08:36,578 --> 00:08:42,519
homework right does everyone know who

191
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,550
owns every piece of software in the

192
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:48,069
company probably not but the one time

193
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:50,019
you have to learn about who owns it

194
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:55,719
you know you wish you had that

195
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:57,639
information okay so a lot of times these

196
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,310
things can hook up with your Active

197
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:01,779
Directory your HR resources so if we can

198
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:03,939
pull that information and from those

199
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:05,819
different sources that's what we want to

200
00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:08,290
do we want to have it kept up to date

201
00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:10,810
it's not a one day activity where you

202
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:12,819
just find this person over here and say

203
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:15,160
this this user owns this piece of

204
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:17,829
software it's something that you have to

205
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,920
keep up-to-date with so it's not just

206
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:22,750
leave it in the corner and it let it run

207
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:31,750
you got to keep it here and feeding for

208
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:34,689
it okay and the other thing this asset

209
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:36,100
inventory can do for you is a lot of

210
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:38,380
times we don't have budget for stuff you

211
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,800
find new piece of software or a new tool

212
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:43,660
we don't have the budget for it right

213
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,699
perhaps we're spending a lot of money on

214
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:47,829
this person's computer who's doing iOS

215
00:09:45,699 --> 00:09:50,529
developments that really doesn't need it

216
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:52,540
with an asset inventory we can scan it

217
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:54,279
and see maybe we're paying to mint too

218
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:56,889
much for our licenses for our Microsoft

219
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:59,620
licenses or whatever we can find out how

220
00:09:56,889 --> 00:10:08,259
much we are actually paying or how many

221
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:09,879
we actually use okay so today's

222
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:12,519
environments are a lot different than in

223
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:15,430
the past right we have stuff in the

224
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:16,700
cloud you got your Amazon your Google

225
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:18,920
Cloud

226
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,720
a lot of stuffs up there we have stuff

227
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,760
on premise you have your workstations

228
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:27,800
servers everything on premise you got

229
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:31,069
mobile devices IOT of your printer is

230
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:33,709
your cameras everything on the wire that

231
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:35,120
hits we need to know about all for

232
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,630
everything you guys need to know about

233
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,460
it

234
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:41,689
to make sure your environments secure

235
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:44,000
you know maybe our facilities people

236
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:46,010
bought a new IOT camera great

237
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,380
you know maybe they need it but we want

238
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:49,819
to make sure that that vendor is vetted

239
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,380
we want to make sure that they stay in

240
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,060
business maybe they bought some cheap

241
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:55,640
one from you know for a hundred bucks

242
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:57,920
from Best Buy and you know it does a job

243
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,710
but it's got a lot of vulnerabilities

244
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,260
and there's some bad stuff in it so we

245
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:05,180
want to know about stuff out there so

246
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:15,230
that your other teams can then do their

247
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:17,540
jobs with it right so once we have that

248
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,250
software again what are we gonna do with

249
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:23,000
it we need to make sure all the teams

250
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:25,820
talk and and utilize this piece of the

251
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,880
asset inventory what about for example

252
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:31,250
you know I have my coworker Wesley and

253
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,470
he goes to his grandmother's house and

254
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:35,210
she's got an iPad and maybe grandma

255
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,610
looks a little different today she's got

256
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:39,830
she's got a fuzzy tail and some sharp

257
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:42,110
teeth and you know long snout so

258
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:44,960
grandma's not really great grandma she

259
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:46,970
now has jailbroken her mobile device and

260
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,460
got all sorts of spyware and crazy stuff

261
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:51,140
is is my coworker now gonna be able to

262
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,150
access all his corporate information on

263
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:55,699
that device are we scanning that device

264
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:59,030
do we know about it probably not but

265
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,890
should we maybe I mean we can't scan

266
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:02,480
everything but we should know about

267
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:10,010
these devices and how people are getting

268
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:12,830
into the network no laughs at the shiny

269
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:15,640
grandmother big bad wolf come on it's

270
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,640
really tight here

271
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:22,370
all right so how many people out here

272
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:24,160
currently have a solution for asset

273
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:26,210
inventory of some sort

274
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,250
yeah I mean most of you should be

275
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,990
raising your hand how many of those

276
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:34,610
people have multiple solution

277
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:36,830
of acid inventory right so the problem

278
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:39,410
that we see out there you have so many

279
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:41,570
different solutions maybe you have a

280
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:43,370
CMDB that holds some information you

281
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:46,430
have an acid inventory maybe I have old

282
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:48,830
access database that I have maybe they

283
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:52,729
all have decent data in them but they

284
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:54,560
all need to kind of talk right we need

285
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,630
to pick someone who's going to be the

286
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,890
winner and they all need to talk and

287
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:59,720
share this information if you want to

288
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:03,650
keep that Access database out there fine

289
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:07,010
but write some code write some API code

290
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:17,209
to share that data so that you can have

291
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:18,890
it all in one central place okay as well

292
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:22,880
as keep it up-to-date obviously we want

293
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:24,560
to make sure it's always up to date all

294
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,660
right some of the type of sensors that

295
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:31,790
you can have out there to find this data

296
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:35,810
so so you can have physical scanners the

297
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:37,760
old-school actual pieces of hardware not

298
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:40,219
too many places are using this anymore

299
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:44,060
it goes more towards the virtual

300
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:51,950
scanners which can be stored in the

301
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:55,849
cloud or on Prem so cloud scanners so at

302
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:57,590
your companies or somewhere like on

303
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:00,080
Amazon or somewhere else it could be

304
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:01,490
stored up there and looking down in so

305
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,140
that will give you north-south traffic

306
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:08,600
as far as what information you can see

307
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:11,060
agents so we all have agents some people

308
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,580
like them some don't you know I further

309
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:17,000
turn agent over load today or and

310
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:19,400
yesterday so every vendor seems to have

311
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,620
agents and you can get too much out

312
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:25,340
there so some some people like them some

313
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:27,560
don't passive scanners so these will sit

314
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:31,640
in line and you can just scan everything

315
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:34,489
on the on the wire so whether a Xerox

316
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,840
printer or something like that is is you

317
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:39,470
know sending data through your network

318
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:42,860
we can then see it that IP camera we can

319
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:43,760
see that and the last ones API so we

320
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,470
have

321
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,210
API connections you're gonna have API

322
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:53,840
connections to your back end to your

323
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:55,730
CMDB to Active Directory okay so we can

324
00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:03,440
pick up that information if we're

325
00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:06,080
storing it in those all right so what

326
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,360
we're finding also is is that we're

327
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,840
getting so much volume so let's say we

328
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:14,150
have a thousand assets at our company

329
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:16,280
from those thousand assets you know this

330
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:18,530
one machine has these different pieces

331
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:21,260
of software on it it has this much

332
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:24,110
memory we're seeing all this different

333
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:28,939
data come in and it's crazy the amount

334
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:31,640
so and then you have you know how it's

335
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:34,640
coming in so in this case you see you

336
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:38,810
see Skype Skype Pop was bought by

337
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:41,569
Microsoft or communicator to link so we

338
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:42,949
need to get that data normalized right

339
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:45,290
we want to see it in a nice clear

340
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:49,340
consistent page so we want to see maybe

341
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:51,890
all the stuff from Microsoft or you know

342
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:54,500
maybe it comes in as different levels of

343
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:58,160
Microsoft anyone in here do certificate

344
00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:00,200
stuff and have to deal with you know

345
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,510
like Microsoft's another one example of

346
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:06,110
it but everyone does it so Microsoft has

347
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:08,510
I don't know how many different signing

348
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:11,540
certificates that are from Microsoft

349
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:14,240
Microsoft comma Inc Microsoft comma Inc

350
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:17,420
period same thing we have to kind of

351
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,610
normalize that and show in this case all

352
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:23,540
the different stuff from Microsoft all

353
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:28,700
the different pieces of software do it

354
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:31,550
on time alright so another pretty

355
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:34,250
picture of like all the data come in and

356
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:37,699
it's just fragmented it's you know one

357
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:42,050
ugly picture and then our AI program

358
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:47,450
needs to kind of clean it up so here's

359
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:49,430
some old data an old slide from you know

360
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:52,610
some of the raw data coming in so in

361
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:55,550
this case you got a Sun system it's

362
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:58,000
running a spark and Hyperion is the

363
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,000
piece of software

364
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:16,830
there we go so anyway here it is kind of

365
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:19,950
normalized and made a little bit cleaner

366
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:22,139
so from the AI system you can see a lot

367
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:24,390
more from it so you know if we want to

368
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:27,060
see everything that's Oracle loans you

369
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:29,640
know we can then see and and then drill

370
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:33,750
down and see what is or cloned we can

371
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:36,480
see what's in this case end of life and

372
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:38,520
then you know get it to the team that

373
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:43,110
needs to correct that so if it is end of

374
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:44,760
life but sorry if it is end of life then

375
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:49,350
we want to make sure it's getting to the

376
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:50,700
right team to upgrade that server and

377
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:52,260
that's where we need to know the owner

378
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,970
of it right if we don't know the owner

379
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:57,420
of the server you know we're kind of

380
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:59,490
tossing our hands and who here shut down

381
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:01,890
a server to see who yells does anybody

382
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:04,140
yell if you shut down the server if

383
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:06,960
nobody else then fine we're good let's

384
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,820
keep it down there's no problem but if

385
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,450
the user start yelling then yeah you got

386
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:14,129
to get it up and running so hopefully

387
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,840
hopefully the company that you're

388
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:18,270
working with has some updated server

389
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,480
software that you can you know get that

390
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:26,270
server back up and to a more modern

391
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:28,890
piece of hardware and software so that's

392
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:33,720
nobody can you guys can't hack at it

393
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:35,070
right and then just one example in this

394
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,460
case service now I don't work for

395
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:41,399
ServiceNow but you know here's a link so

396
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:42,780
that your asset inventory and you know

397
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,940
you want them to be able to talk if

398
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:57,500
you're using ServiceNow you know utilize

399
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:57,500
that and that said any questions yeah

400
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:15,580
say that again so I was talking more

401
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:17,820
like generic acid inventory but in this

402
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:21,699
in that case it's two separate modules

403
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:41,260
yeah I was trying to keep it as generic

404
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:42,880
as possible right good question so he

405
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:45,520
asked if you should just rely on one

406
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,110
tool like if you have SCCM in your

407
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,480
environment should you just rely on that

408
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:53,620
so my question my answer is kind of it

409
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:55,840
depends so if you enjoy the data with

410
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:57,850
SCCM and it provides everything you need

411
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,040
then yes definitely just use that one

412
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:02,770
tool if it if you need to add up other

413
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:05,710
stuff to it if it if you can't do the

414
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:08,350
owner to it then you might need another

415
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:11,620
tool in addition to that and kind of

416
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:13,240
again share that information so API or

417
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:15,370
something or some sort of development

418
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:26,560
tool where you can sync that to with

419
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:28,209
whatever else you use and yeah yeah

420
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:32,850
again I was trying to just do generic

421
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:34,060
asset inventory but in our case it is

422
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:38,230
yeah

423
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:39,700
looking over at that the cloud space if

424
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:41,530
you use in a different asset inventory

425
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,660
you definitely want to you know look at

426
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:46,000
the cloud space because working with

427
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:47,470
customers what they end up doing is you

428
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,310
know the two hands aren't talking just

429
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:53,710
like a tree customer we have our cloud

430
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:55,600
and you know I didn't know we were using

431
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:57,550
this much in the cloud and I don't know

432
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,219
we had this many servers out here so

433
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:02,560
it's great if we can get a look into the

434
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:06,280
cloud and see what what our cloud team

435
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:09,100
is doing ahead of time before we get you

436
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,879
know some in the news like unfortunately

437
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,879
other customers

438
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:31,210
so he asked if if security teams are the

439
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:36,490
ones driving for asset inventory I would

440
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:38,620
say yes because you know again without

441
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:40,630
having a good asset inventory we can't

442
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:46,060
we don't know what we need to patch or

443
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:48,610
what we need to fix out there I think as

444
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:50,530
security people we want to see every all

445
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:55,389
of our stuff out there in the field

446
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:56,800
whether it's IOT or mobile devices or we

447
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,120
want to know about everything so then we

448
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:06,940
can put our tools on there to make sure

449
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:17,639
that they're protected yeah say one more

450
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:21,670
time sorry yeah yeah so the containers

451
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:23,620
and the docker containers so yeah it's

452
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:26,560
just like anything in the cloud and you

453
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:29,100
know we want to know about it but you

454
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:32,050
know if if they're bringing in new

455
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:33,429
containers like every hour you know it's

456
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:36,460
not necessarily something we need to

457
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:39,880
scan or know about like exactly but we

458
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:42,490
need to know what they're doing you know

459
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,560
if it's more rigid and they're rolling

460
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:46,030
out some cloud stuff and it's sitting

461
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,649
there for a week a month you know

462
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:51,760
obviously that stuff we want to make

463
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:59,400
sure our tools aren't on to protect yep

464
00:22:51,760 --> 00:23:01,750
good question anything else

465
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:08,250
thanks for your time

466
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:08,250
[Applause]
