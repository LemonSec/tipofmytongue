1
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,380
all right so I got a feeling people are

2
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,170
gonna keep swell yeah I know I'm I'm a

3
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,910
bigmouth I don't even need the Celestia

4
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:37,149
talks I haven't even used it but this

5
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:40,420
way it's recorded all right so good

6
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:43,210
afternoon now gurke on it is afternoon

7
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,829
holy you've made it this far everybody

8
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,810
in this room I'm guessing already ate

9
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,370
lunch because everybody else who is in

10
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,340
here is out there eating lunch that's

11
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:53,500
our story we're sticking to it all right

12
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,690
a couple housekeeping things don't block

13
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:59,830
the fire exits I think we're okay right

14
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:02,050
now cell phones turn them off silence

15
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,850
you know the drill I wore boots today

16
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,880
specifically for this purpose don't make

17
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:09,100
me come out there and use them on you

18
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:11,530
all right they're almost awake we're

19
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:14,650
getting there all right so we are

20
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,330
talking blinky badges all the cool stuff

21
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,040
anybody's ever wanted to make one of

22
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:20,110
their own or you're just curious what

23
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,390
the heck goes into making these awesome

24
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:25,900
little toys we get at cons and

25
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:27,399
everywhere else Hey the Ishwar Spurs

26
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,200
here he's gonna talk to you all about it

27
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:38,620
so with that Dave I'm turning it over to

28
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:41,410
you thank you so if you haven't eaten

29
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,780
yet thank you for going through the the

30
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,519
hunger pains I feel yet I haven't eaten

31
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,560
yet either it's good for you though too

32
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,680
fast a little bit and then we can party

33
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,090
after this so here before you today to

34
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,700
talk about some stuff that I've been

35
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,890
working on over the past few years I've

36
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,380
helped participate in making about five

37
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:01,839
different badges whether or I'm

38
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:03,310
designing or I'm kind of just sitting

39
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,209
there and watching people and learning

40
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:10,690
and in any combination thereof so who in

41
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:13,750
the room actually is sat down and said

42
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:16,540
I'm gonna make a badge and made the

43
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:21,488
badge and finished it one person you did

44
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:22,930
I I know you did Phil so you did and was

45
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:23,229
it like the easiest thing you've ever

46
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,380
done

47
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:27,849
oh hell no right so that's really kind

48
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,650
of part of this talk so there's

49
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,270
so many different components so many

50
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:34,840
different facets of things that are

51
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:36,190
going on into this process that when I'm

52
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,140
having these conversations with other

53
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,969
fellow makers you know they're you know

54
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,020
other people want to do this too but

55
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,880
they kind of really don't know where to

56
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,349
begin or they have these great ideas and

57
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,840
they're not capable to write code or

58
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:49,510
whatever their personal hurdles might be

59
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,190
and I it just seemed like a main sense

60
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:54,340
to kind of talk about this so this way

61
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:56,530
if you are one of those people hopefully

62
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:59,469
after this talk except for that

63
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,510
gentleman who is leaving is inspired to

64
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:03,820
continue with the process or maybe get

65
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,740
started with one or you know reach out

66
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:09,480
to other people that might have the

67
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:14,020
skills that you're you need help with

68
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:17,500
thank you for joining so first off my

69
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:21,159
name is up there it is not pronounced

70
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,260
heel lands you know the name comes from

71
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:27,370
my childhood playing Dungeons & Dragons

72
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:29,830
and to the extent of my creativity this

73
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:32,620
is the concatenated version of the name

74
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,180
to accommodate AOL never one or night

75
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,180
but this is the name that I originally

76
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:40,420
gave myself again limited creativity at

77
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:43,450
the age of 14 I played a cleric but for

78
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:45,670
shorthand reasons I just go by heel at

79
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:48,550
these events my real name is Dave

80
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:51,040
Schwartz Berg it's no secret I work for

81
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:53,860
Cisco Systems as a technical solutions

82
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,750
architect and yes that is just about

83
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,020
more fun than it sounds getting to play

84
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:01,830
with all of cisco security tools

85
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:05,979
including duo wolf what's up buddy so

86
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:08,650
it's a great job lot of fun and I have

87
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:10,330
Cisco on the slides because they support

88
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:13,270
my speaking at events to folks like

89
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:17,560
yourselves let's talk a little history

90
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:18,969
first so when this whole badge life kind

91
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,520
of crazy that's been going on for the

92
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:23,890
past few years where did it come from

93
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,140
so on the very very far left you see the

94
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:31,840
badge that drew Joe grant put together

95
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:32,560
for Def Con 14 2006 anybody you want to

96
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:38,560
call me out on that

97
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:41,290
I think it's 2005 ok my facts are wrong

98
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,680
or you are but one of those two are

99
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:45,040
correct

100
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:48,120
so 2006 2005 Joe grant comes out with

101
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,930
this badge with this kind of idea of

102
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,949
wanting people to get excited about

103
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,180
doing some kind of hardware hacking

104
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:54,100
alright so they put some blinky lights

105
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,389
on the badge some other components so

106
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,880
you can do some other fun stuff very

107
00:06:55,389 --> 00:07:01,240
simple but also very effective because

108
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:04,600
over time this kind of little spark that

109
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:07,479
got flem flame or flyff and turns into

110
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,580
this big you know burning sort of

111
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:11,590
dumpster fire but not dumpster fire

112
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,870
depending on your perspective which is

113
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:17,799
again why I have the controversial stuff

114
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:19,090
on this talk at the end then I don't

115
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,770
know if you guys are familiar with DC

116
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:25,270
darknet and Smitty halibut so the badges

117
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:28,419
to the right starting with the yellow

118
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:30,400
ones Smitty read these books called

119
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:33,039
demon or daemon however you want to

120
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,380
pronounce it and in there is a dark net

121
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,199
and he came up with this fun idea of

122
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:39,520
making these little yellow badges and

123
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,160
kind of left him around the hardware

124
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,198
hacking village and it was your way into

125
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,300
the dark net he made about a hundred of

126
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:47,770
them didn't realize what he did but he

127
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,599
got a lot of people really excited about

128
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:51,490
the kind of custom hardware and getting

129
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,979
involved with hardware hacking and that

130
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:56,949
kind of again springboarded into the

131
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:58,419
next version you know so on and so forth

132
00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:00,220
they created more this is a picture he

133
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:01,810
took for me because I couldn't find the

134
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,789
older versions I found the newer ones

135
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,650
but I was like you got any old photos

136
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:06,460
and he like went on and told me the

137
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,070
whole story

138
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,960
which then turned into some brief

139
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:13,930
memoirs that he put in like a twitch

140
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,940
stream so or tweet stream or on Twitter

141
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:18,849
so if you look for you could see like

142
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:21,039
the history of what he was creating and

143
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:23,560
what he was trying to do but is a fun

144
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,449
kind of thing but really turned into

145
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,639
also again with Joe grande

146
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:29,650
into what we call today is badge life so

147
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:30,880
these are the close up of the one of

148
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,650
these badges

149
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,419
I pretty much have just about all the

150
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:36,279
darknet badges except the first one

151
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:39,218
they're really cool if you can get your

152
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:40,450
hands on some of the older ones put them

153
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:42,969
together yourself they're really meant

154
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:45,010
to like get people excited what about

155
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:46,750
wanting to do hardware hacking and and

156
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:49,150
it did for me so the one on the left on

157
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:51,380
the middle in this picture was the one

158
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:54,770
the first one that I was able to get

159
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:56,930
and back like when I was like 18 at high

160
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:58,640
school I'm like I want to become an

161
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:02,060
electrical engineer so I can fix DVD

162
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,920
players that is my future yeah wasn't

163
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:07,400
funny back then sir it was quite serious

164
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,290
so after a couple years of that and then

165
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,910
really like designs probably a better

166
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,319
place to go and then said heck with that

167
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,730
I'm gonna become an accountant and

168
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,260
eventually got into IT and now

169
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,480
information security so that's kind of

170
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:20,480
like the past 30 years of my life or so

171
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:25,120
in a very brief like one sentence but

172
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:28,400
the point is that badge kind of like

173
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:32,000
rekindle that my passion for tech and

174
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,560
hardware so doing that one thing and

175
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,110
kind of like taking me back to when I

176
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,630
was a teenager and I think that was

177
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:41,480
maybe five years ago six years ago I

178
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:43,550
think was like six years ago it's kind

179
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,740
of funny how these little things can

180
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:47,089
then take you somewhere else that you

181
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,360
had no idea where you were gonna go and

182
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:54,710
that's where I'm going with this and

183
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:57,800
there's some links so quick kind of like

184
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:59,690
the the cool wall so this is uh so

185
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:04,630
anyone see this tweet anyone who's wall

186
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:04,630
this is yes sciatic nerd

187
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:09,880
perfect and how do you know that sir I

188
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:16,040
actually tested this presentation out on

189
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:19,339
him so thank you for that Steve

190
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:21,530
so yeah so Jason collects these badges

191
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,060
he's like you know mr. Def Con so he

192
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:25,189
wants to collect these badges support

193
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,900
the community here's some of our

194
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:29,750
creations you can see the arrows we've

195
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:31,730
created one badge that was like a cypher

196
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:34,250
disc there over at our table there in

197
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:37,610
the exhibitor hall one one bad job we

198
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:39,470
created was a card game so going analog

199
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:42,140
so two different kinds of analog badges

200
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:43,730
do your badges need to be digital no you

201
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:47,360
could still make a really cool badge

202
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:48,800
that's not digital that's analog and and

203
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,750
people will still love it you know you

204
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,420
can't you don't have to be you know

205
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:56,180
within like the herd think differently

206
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:58,160
be different and I got some other like

207
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:00,920
wisdom pieces of wisdom for you later

208
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,530
but there's in the the red box is the

209
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:08,750
current badge that's the kids badge and

210
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:10,910
here's the organizers badge in front I

211
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:13,040
don't know if you guys if you're not too

212
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,750
familiar with badge life culture one of

213
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,270
the things that we do every year is we

214
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:19,430
do have like a meet-up we get together

215
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:20,960
kind of swap badges sell badges talk

216
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:23,359
about like how we designed it and stuff

217
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,640
and then somebody takes a picture and

218
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,110
you might see it in like hack a day or

219
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,360
something like that so so if you go to

220
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:31,460
hack a day you'll see I think this photo

221
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,460
or like kind of like a bird's eye view

222
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:37,070
almost like a fisheye lens on it and we

223
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,720
are right here in the corner we I just

224
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:40,160
kind of put it down walked away but yeah

225
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,690
it was kind of cool that we're like

226
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,850
right there with all those other

227
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:45,850
fantastic and amazing and fun designs

228
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:53,719
it's not rocket science people this is

229
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:56,270
something that I again depending on your

230
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,460
level of education and your tenacity and

231
00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:00,230
you know your real hacker mentality is

232
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,450
is this something for everybody I think

233
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:04,100
it's possible I didn't think I'd be

234
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,950
standing here today talking about some

235
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,990
badges that we created for the events

236
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:11,570
this year and some other things but it

237
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:12,830
was it's just like anything else if you

238
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,630
really put your mind to it you're gonna

239
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:16,220
be able to do it you've got to have the

240
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:18,490
passion that helps you with the drive

241
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:21,620
but also when you have limitations like

242
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:23,450
I could kind of write code I don't think

243
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,850
of myself as a developer but I wrote the

244
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:27,500
code on the badge twice so according to

245
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:29,570
my friend I guess I'm now a developer

246
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,750
but I don't I necessarily agree with

247
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:36,140
that but I kind of had some skills from

248
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:39,350
earlier in my education which I then use

249
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:40,699
like almost 30 years later because I had

250
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:42,170
the foundational knowledge it's just

251
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,880
kind of learning and pushing yourself

252
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:45,860
and and then doing what you need to do

253
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:49,210
to get it done basically don't quit

254
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:51,500
right there is a way to get there so

255
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:55,280
personal like kind of message to you on

256
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:57,530
this is even if you like oh you know I

257
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:00,680
have this creative juices and I really

258
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:02,900
don't know what to do with them talk to

259
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,060
somebody talk to somebody who's done it

260
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,470
they can help you get started and that's

261
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,030
kind of also with this talk is for kind

262
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:10,190
of whoever can't be here today or is

263
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,420
having lunch kind of help you guys get a

264
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:14,120
little bit more motivated and inspired

265
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:16,339
to move forward now part of the like

266
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,260
what Joe gran was doing

267
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:21,260
if you went to Def Con this year and you

268
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:23,420
went to his opening badge talk and how

269
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:26,090
it was really important to get more and

270
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:27,819
more people into hardware hacking you

271
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:30,710
know these are some of the reasons right

272
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:33,230
so here's a one type of a hardware

273
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:38,480
hacking attack it doesn't say there does

274
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:43,430
anybody know which one this is you might

275
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:46,010
get this all right it's row hammer so

276
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:47,599
it's a little older but it's kind of

277
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:49,069
like some of the things that came out

278
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,470
we're like yeah now hardware is being

279
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,790
attacked pretty much more frequently I

280
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:57,680
think you'll know this one because of

281
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:58,880
the iconography like meltdown but those

282
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,599
are the links to the papers if you want

283
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,220
to read them they're actually pretty

284
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,840
interesting no I did not read them them

285
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,130
an entirety but I kind of skimmed

286
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,440
through and was like how these people

287
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:08,930
are really smart and I wish I was but

288
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:12,280
that's the point you teach yourself you

289
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:15,260
keep going forward you never stop so

290
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,910
let's look at this badge really quick

291
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:19,790
kind of how we kind of covered some

292
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:21,829
history and some other problems so the

293
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:24,020
tyro badge that was created so it hack

294
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:26,480
for kids we've got the kids they're

295
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:29,150
known as Tyros they're learning that's

296
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,510
what that word means the chaperones we

297
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:34,730
call pones a little fun thing for us the

298
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:37,220
volunteers we call admins and the

299
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:39,440
organizers called the badges just called

300
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:42,110
leet set of uber or somebody did that I

301
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,580
didn't name these things so I don't

302
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,060
think of myself as leet that's why I'm

303
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,910
saying that

304
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:49,369
so the tyro badge for the kids and for

305
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:53,810
the adults is the white one the admin is

306
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:55,640
red and the organizer badge which is

307
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,709
what I like to call it is as the black

308
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:01,810
one so that's the one you see here and

309
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:05,600
here's the tyro badge or the board now

310
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:07,339
there's not any real difference on them

311
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,080
so the event that we did in Chicago this

312
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,880
year I did make them a little different

313
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,350
to put different puzzles and it's kind

314
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,820
of easier when you have like a couple of

315
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,800
badges and that kind of makes it fun so

316
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:17,600
if you're designing something where

317
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,270
people are interacting with people with

318
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,370
badges the colorization of the badge

319
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:24,439
does help tremendously because then

320
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:25,730
people kind of know who to go to or who

321
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,620
not to go to if they've already done

322
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,970
something versus having badges that

323
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,529
scroll something and you're like that I

324
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,629
get that

325
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:32,589
get that and it just makes things a

326
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:33,970
little bit more clunky and awkward

327
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:36,959
awkward for people if you're going to

328
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:39,370
turn it into a puzzle or challenge so

329
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,050
but the new version of the badge or I

330
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,759
call like the DEFCON version of the

331
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,680
badge is really for just about anyone in

332
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:46,300
anything and it has a virtual escape

333
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,300
room on it which is really pretty cool

334
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:51,279
so we had an actual physical escape room

335
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:53,979
at hack for kids this year which had

336
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:56,199
them have to apply the different things

337
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:57,699
that they learn usually at an event so

338
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:59,258
like if you've done lock-picking here

339
00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:01,809
they do lock-picking at a hack for kids

340
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:03,689
or they will do that tomorrow if they're

341
00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:05,740
also you do anything with maybe

342
00:16:03,689 --> 00:16:08,740
electrical engineering right snap

343
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:10,720
circuits they had to assemble a radio so

344
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:13,209
kind of like hidden or locked away in

345
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,879
one part of the room was a schematic and

346
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:17,349
then another part were pieces and then

347
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:18,939
they eventually had to figure out oh I

348
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:20,439
need to build this and when they build

349
00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:23,139
this they're listening to a broadcast

350
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:24,370
coming from a Raspberry Pi which had

351
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:26,499
instructions for another part of the

352
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:29,589
puzzle so lots of layers applying the

353
00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:31,300
skills lot of fun stuff and they had 25

354
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:33,100
minutes there were some crypto puzzles

355
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,079
too there was a suitcase that was locked

356
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,959
that they had to kind of get through and

357
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:40,029
only one team finished it which some of

358
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:41,649
them got close but maybe we made it a

359
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:43,689
little too hard or maybe we need to

360
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:46,180
focus more on teaching them the skills

361
00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:48,250
but they all had fun and that's the big

362
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:50,888
part of it is having fun so that's the

363
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:53,019
badges so badges have some other fun

364
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:54,670
features if you want to see one or play

365
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:56,500
with one we still have some over there

366
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:58,209
in the exhibitor hall you can kind of

367
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,589
check it out it's got pong running I

368
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:02,529
don't know if it's still running now but

369
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:04,600
I have found a demo of pong which old

370
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:07,780
video game on new hardware that's really

371
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:09,369
kind of fun the hardware is also I don't

372
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:11,740
know guys familiar like an ESP 32 I

373
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:13,629
don't I wasn't planning on getting too

374
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:17,289
deep into the hardware but we have so

375
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:19,689
many different LED like IO ports so that

376
00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:22,059
we have our pins we we had to put like

377
00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:24,730
an LED driver so we go from the ESP to

378
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:26,408
the LED driver to the lights so that

379
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,089
that tends to be a little complicated if

380
00:17:26,409 --> 00:17:30,940
you're new to this thing but we also

381
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:33,490
have just regular plain old like

382
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:35,620
monochrome like red and white lights so

383
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:37,840
that's a lot easier to get to but it's a

384
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:41,289
fun thing built in Wi-Fi built in

385
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,730
Bluetooth a lot of fun stuff to do just

386
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:43,270
if you want to kind of get started so

387
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,290
for the kid

388
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,480
it's kind of like they can leave it as

389
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:48,399
is or they can go to github and look at

390
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,380
the code and learn and then completely

391
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,550
wipe it and make it their own that was

392
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,440
really the intent so when they leave

393
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:57,220
they had some kind of hacking platform

394
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:59,140
for them in addition to the fun game so

395
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,760
kind of explained this part already part

396
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:03,310
of the next generation it's really

397
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:06,100
important for us to get youths and even

398
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:07,629
adults exposed to these things so kind

399
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,730
of get their passion going and their

400
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:11,470
fires fanned just like I was talking

401
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:15,460
about a little bit earlier um

402
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:21,790
if somebody is doing this for and here's

403
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:24,490
the Pikachu so twinkle twinkle I feel

404
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:27,659
he's really big as the artistic part of

405
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:29,920
creating the add-ons or there sa OS

406
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,810
special add-ons as a kid president I'm

407
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,420
not going to use the other official word

408
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:36,669
but it's a special add-on our essay oh

409
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:39,900
and he's really does some amazing things

410
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:42,970
with the different substrates and

411
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,980
avoiding things like light diffusion or

412
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:47,440
controlling light like this particular

413
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:50,380
and on this it's kind of robably hard to

414
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:53,320
see this gift add on when it's

415
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,940
illuminated you know the earlier

416
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,200
versions there was light bleed in two

417
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,690
different areas and he didn't want that

418
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:02,380
so I think he went with three a three

419
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:04,570
layer board with some copper in between

420
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,400
to control the light bleed and if I

421
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:08,020
apologize if it's a four layer somebody

422
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,910
will correct me put it in the the

423
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:12,310
comments or the notes to say you know

424
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,700
fool it's four layers not three or vice

425
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:15,010
versa

426
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,900
I forgot I had a couple drinks last

427
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:18,490
night but those brain cells are now dead

428
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,250
but this is really cool this kind of

429
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:25,000
shows you his passion about making the

430
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:27,370
electronics do what he wants them to do

431
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,110
from a visual standpoint right so it

432
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:31,030
doesn't have to be a badge that you

433
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:32,770
could cereal in and have a whole virtual

434
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:34,570
world that you can kind of go and hack

435
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:36,490
into it could be something that's just

436
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:37,570
visually appealing like my next design

437
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:39,460
I'm thinking something that's much more

438
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,929
visual and maybe using like an

439
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:45,090
accelerometer which would be kind of fun

440
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:48,730
so that's that's that the other things

441
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:51,040
see if I can get this to work so we got

442
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:54,100
Captain Kirk so that's there on the

443
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:56,840
badge this is the phaser so this was the

444
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,399
prototype of the phaser it used red LED

445
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,649
but I wanted it to be a blue LED to

446
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,270
match the actual phaser from the series

447
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:05,659
of the if you watch Star Trek back and

448
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:07,100
like you know in the 70s it was blue but

449
00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:09,200
you couldn't get blue LEDs back there

450
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:11,418
bless you but your boards were that

451
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,159
color green right so I went with the

452
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:15,529
nostalgic green but with the new blue

453
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:18,559
board the new blue LEDs which you could

454
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:21,020
see down here and then you know the fun

455
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,340
one with pong and what you have before

456
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:24,830
you so this is more for the benefit of

457
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:26,480
the people in the video kind of see the

458
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:29,178
video of what you guys see physically in

459
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,880
front of you it's a lot of fun I mean

460
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:34,850
it's that feeling of just doing the

461
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:36,919
Captain Kirk face and finding a picture

462
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:38,990
of him and putting it into GIMP and I'll

463
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:41,059
talk more about the tools and cleaning

464
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:43,250
it up and then making it black and white

465
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:45,770
and then putting it into ink screen and

466
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:47,779
then trying to get it vectorized right

467
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:50,029
from raster graphics to vector graphics

468
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:52,610
and then putting it to Kai CAD and doing

469
00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:53,809
all of that it's a lot of steps and yeah

470
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,668
it could be frustrating and there's a

471
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:59,649
lot of tools to learn but when you

472
00:20:55,669 --> 00:21:03,200
complete your project that feeling of

473
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:04,820
self accomplishment and how proud and

474
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,200
the how proud you feel of just kind of

475
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:11,059
getting over those knowledge hurdles of

476
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,529
you know where before like I never used

477
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:14,059
Kai CAD like that was the first thing

478
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:16,340
I've ever created in kai CAD was the

479
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:21,440
Kirk face I was using other tools and

480
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:24,080
like Fritzing but the Kirk had simple

481
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,700
blinky eyes but at the same time it's

482
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,809
kind of like that coming of age and then

483
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:31,730
now I could do more because I've

484
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:34,549
overcome that first obstacle so no keep

485
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:36,169
it blinking moving on so where do we go

486
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:38,418
from here okay so now that we've kind of

487
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:41,059
laid the foundation of what you could do

488
00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:43,940
and where you are mentally with the

489
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:46,250
entire process how do you go forward and

490
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,440
actually do this now you know hats off

491
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:50,480
to anyone who started it even if you

492
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,640
haven't finished it you started it and

493
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,260
and that's really an important thing too

494
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,850
because just getting something started

495
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:58,669
you could find people that would help

496
00:21:55,850 --> 00:22:00,350
you finish you know this this badge I

497
00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:03,380
had somebody help me do the electrical

498
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:06,408
engineering design great guy the one the

499
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:08,949
guy he created the goon badge the

500
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:11,329
boombox badge I'm actually wearing

501
00:22:08,949 --> 00:22:13,339
coppy kid Mike thank you I was actually

502
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:15,109
thinking of his company in an MK factor

503
00:22:13,339 --> 00:22:18,019
which is on it but yes thank you copy

504
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:19,789
kid Mike great work great person to work

505
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:21,889
with and he helped us with the

506
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:23,389
electrical engineering and I kind of

507
00:22:21,889 --> 00:22:25,668
worked on the other stuff and I'll get

508
00:22:23,389 --> 00:22:27,649
to that a little bit more but you need

509
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:29,659
to figure out like what level of quality

510
00:22:27,649 --> 00:22:31,339
do you want you need to know not just

511
00:22:29,659 --> 00:22:32,539
okay we're gonna start but when do we

512
00:22:31,339 --> 00:22:33,948
need to start you got a look at your

513
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:35,299
project and kind of go backwards I'm

514
00:22:33,949 --> 00:22:38,629
gonna get into these in a bit more depth

515
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:39,949
I'll get to that later you know why are

516
00:22:38,629 --> 00:22:41,629
you doing this what is your purpose what

517
00:22:39,949 --> 00:22:42,829
is your end goal if you're just saying

518
00:22:41,629 --> 00:22:44,689
well I don't know I just want to make

519
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:47,029
something you got to think about it a

520
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:48,589
little bit more again I mentioned some

521
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:50,059
tools but you've got to find tools that

522
00:22:48,589 --> 00:22:51,708
you're comfortable with but sometimes

523
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:54,649
like when I was gonna go and learn

524
00:22:51,709 --> 00:22:57,499
Fritzing in the badge life slack channel

525
00:22:54,649 --> 00:22:59,748
they're like no no go and learn cai cad

526
00:22:57,499 --> 00:23:01,369
you'll you'll realize yeah those look

527
00:22:59,749 --> 00:23:03,769
steeper learning curve but later on

528
00:23:01,369 --> 00:23:05,718
you'll really appreciate it and I listen

529
00:23:03,769 --> 00:23:09,109
to them and I see that now

530
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:10,669
and also how's this gonna be funded so

531
00:23:09,109 --> 00:23:13,458
it's not that inexpensive like little

532
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:14,779
little things smaller things you could

533
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:17,809
print up where I'll just speak

534
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:19,279
specifically the the phaser I think when

535
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:20,809
it was all said and done probably cost

536
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:23,809
us around three or four hundred dollars

537
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:25,279
to produce about 50 which doesn't really

538
00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:26,359
sound that expensive I mean but you

539
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:28,369
could still kind of buy a laptop

540
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:30,289
nowadays for about that much money so

541
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:32,779
from electronic standpoint it sounds

542
00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:35,959
pretty expensive you got to decide you

543
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:37,969
know what you're willing to spend so

544
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:40,190
when you pick your team who do you want

545
00:23:37,969 --> 00:23:41,709
on your team the guy with the right hook

546
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:43,669
of the one receiving the right hook

547
00:23:41,709 --> 00:23:45,649
sometimes you might be the one receiving

548
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:47,269
the right hook but don't let that get

549
00:23:45,649 --> 00:23:49,908
you down I got a better laugh at this in

550
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:52,579
Canada with these Toronto teams I wonder

551
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:54,529
why I guess I got to know my audience a

552
00:23:52,579 --> 00:23:56,839
little better you should've had some

553
00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:58,249
Michigan teams up there so who do you

554
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:59,779
want to have on your team you know you

555
00:23:58,249 --> 00:24:01,249
want to get the heavy hitters but if

556
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:02,959
you're thinking like I want that and not

557
00:24:01,249 --> 00:24:05,719
X or team I know they're gonna help me

558
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:07,669
that's a team of five and they're all

559
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:10,069
super busy and cups some of them I think

560
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:11,599
own a business it's gonna be hard but

561
00:24:10,069 --> 00:24:15,259
then you also don't want somebody who's

562
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:16,729
like apologize if this offends anyone

563
00:24:15,259 --> 00:24:18,139
well I've never really done this before

564
00:24:16,729 --> 00:24:20,599
and I want to get started and I want to

565
00:24:18,139 --> 00:24:21,659
do it because then they're gonna be slow

566
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:23,070
to start and

567
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,260
you're gonna be relying on them but they

568
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:26,580
really aren't too sure what to do find

569
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,840
someone in the middle I'm kind of like

570
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:30,570
that guy I'm kinda in the middle I'm

571
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,699
like past the well I wasn't really sure

572
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:34,409
had to do this to our first electronic

573
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,480
badge somebody did it I kind of gave him

574
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,830
the yard told him what we wanted and he

575
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,620
did a lot of the work and I learned from

576
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:45,840
him but the other badge is a lot of that

577
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:47,790
was me except for this one you got to

578
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,060
keep the time to you got to take the

579
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:52,500
time to do this so find your team

580
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:54,030
communicate set up a way that you could

581
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,200
talk on a regular cadence it's

582
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:59,790
incredibly important to keep the

583
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:04,530
communication going I'll move on from

584
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:06,420
there you're also level of quality scope

585
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:08,490
creep is a huge problem when it comes to

586
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:12,080
these things and you probably heard this

587
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:14,840
before yes my puns are koala t when you

588
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,520
say like here's the ten features we want

589
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:20,129
but here's the three features we must

590
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,590
have you know you've got to focus on the

591
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:24,330
must-haves first because as I'm like

592
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,949
yeah we're gonna do Wi-Fi we can do auto

593
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:27,270
updating on the badge and we can do all

594
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:29,040
these other really fun and cool things

595
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:33,570
but if we don't get what the core

596
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:36,420
purpose of the badge is done first then

597
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:38,700
you have nothing right and and I look at

598
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:42,990
it as what motivates me which pushes me

599
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:44,370
is I feel responsible to the recipients

600
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:47,970
of the badge so the person that has the

601
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:50,129
badge I feel like I'm obligated to give

602
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:51,960
them a good experience is it the best

603
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:54,830
experience you'll ever have I can try

604
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,810
for that but I know I'm not that good I

605
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:59,250
realize that but I want them to learn I

606
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:01,440
want them to have fun and I want them to

607
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:03,930
have like a takeaway and that's my

608
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,150
responsibility my obligation so I said

609
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:07,940
we got to do that first all the other

610
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:10,140
cool things all the other fun things

611
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:12,630
that's gonna have to come later and you

612
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:15,390
got to have that same mindset of you

613
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:17,100
could build it for you but you might be

614
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:20,190
the only one who appreciates it I'm

615
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:22,010
building these for you guys and that's

616
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:25,770
my mentality when it comes to this so I

617
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:27,360
recommend that as well now getting

618
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:28,710
started like you kind of sit down you

619
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,629
define you know your features and

620
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:32,130
everything and you kind of like where to

621
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,790
begin and it could be like a really long

622
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:35,950
winding road

623
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:38,649
this is like in some mountain range I

624
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:41,410
think in Germany or somewhere that part

625
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:43,660
of the world and and you might just feel

626
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:46,720
like you're going back and forth but

627
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:47,770
you've got to have time milestones some

628
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,810
of this might sound like basic project

629
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:51,700
management cuz it kind of really is but

630
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:53,919
you don't want to just talk about

631
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,450
features and get yourself excited and

632
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:58,600
get other people excited and then never

633
00:26:55,450 --> 00:27:00,690
start and sometimes you need to look at

634
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,189
when you're going to start something

635
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:04,900
when do you need to have it ready by and

636
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:07,570
if you don't know what the road at the

637
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:10,060
very end looks like getting started in

638
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:12,700
that road it's just gonna be kind of

639
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:14,649
like it doesn't really exist at least in

640
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:17,890
my opinion so when you say like this

641
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:19,960
badge had to be done it was by like May

642
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:22,060
1st I said because our event was May 18

643
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,830
and we needed time to flash them when

644
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:25,990
you're flashing about two or three

645
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:28,030
hundred badges it takes time it could

646
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:29,440
take four or five minutes or more you

647
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,700
can run into problems you might run into

648
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,170
a hardware she'd do I want to sit there

649
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,430
and troubleshoot the heart issue or

650
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:34,900
throw it to the side put a little

651
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:36,850
marking on it on a piece of paper and

652
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:40,210
say I'll get to that issue later you

653
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:42,340
know led else display whatever it might

654
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:45,370
be and just keep going forward and going

655
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:47,649
forward and going forward so you need to

656
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:51,899
have that date when you absolutely need

657
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:55,140
to have stuff done by add two weeks and

658
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:57,550
then every other point where you have

659
00:27:55,140 --> 00:28:00,430
features or it's kind of like a

660
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:01,980
milestone step figure out how much time

661
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:05,140
you think you're going to need and then

662
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:08,200
once you've added all that together just

663
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:12,670
add on an extra month and if anything

664
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:14,590
slips because it will then you have a

665
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:15,640
window you've baked in a window but if

666
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,899
you're like well we think this will take

667
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,400
three months so we're gonna get started

668
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:21,540
three months before when we actually

669
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:24,490
have it you will not be ready on time

670
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:25,750
one person in badge life and that was

671
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:28,810
their first badge that created it was a

672
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:31,000
young man I'm not gonna name him but

673
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:32,770
he's a great guy and everything and not

674
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,650
want to name him just because there's

675
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:38,010
none necessary he worked on a project

676
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:41,170
and he did it pretty much all himself

677
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:44,170
but he got the badges stuck in in

678
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:46,480
customs of China they never showed up on

679
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:48,460
time for Def Con

680
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,020
I was one of the people that backed his

681
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:52,360
Kickstarter so I was like really excited

682
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:54,580
to have it at Def Con and then they

683
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:59,250
showed up at my doorstep two months

684
00:28:54,580 --> 00:29:03,370
later after Def Con now I say you know

685
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:05,620
stuff happens I think and you know if

686
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:07,360
he's watching this not being judgey but

687
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:09,549
you maybe put a little too much on

688
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,219
himself you know but I also hats off to

689
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:14,320
that because it's a big project you know

690
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:15,580
a lot of things happen and you need to

691
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,189
be flexible you need to have the time

692
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:19,990
and you know it's a lesson learned for

693
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:21,790
him but he produced it he finished it

694
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:24,059
there are some people unfortunately they

695
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:27,428
could not finish the badges and

696
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:29,340
sometimes people made comments publicly

697
00:29:27,429 --> 00:29:32,410
the badge life people are not trying to

698
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:34,990
have you you know support them and then

699
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:36,730
not deliver things happen so when you

700
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:38,620
you know decide to get it funded through

701
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:41,950
a Kickstarter or at Indy or something

702
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:43,989
think about how the recipient feels if

703
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:45,429
they don't have it and you really want

704
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,390
to make sure that you deliver which is

705
00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:47,140
kind of a slide I'm getting a little

706
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:50,860
head of myself

707
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:52,419
delivery is incredibly important but you

708
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:55,330
got a bacon the time that's kind of the

709
00:29:52,419 --> 00:29:57,280
message here bacon enough time we had

710
00:29:55,330 --> 00:30:00,460
issues with this board and another

711
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:02,500
personal story with this one trying to

712
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:04,210
set up the prototype it would take me I

713
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,460
had three prototype boards would take me

714
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:09,100
four hours just to get one soldered up

715
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:11,530
and then I had bridging which is when

716
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:13,540
your solder kind of connects and some

717
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:15,549
other issues and with the ESP 32 it was

718
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:17,049
like bridging under the chip so I

719
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:19,000
couldn't like see under there and trying

720
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:21,668
to remove it you destroy the substrate

721
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,770
so I kind of had one left I sent it to

722
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:25,540
comp you kid Mike he looked at and he

723
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:26,350
goes oh look you're not like connecting

724
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,360
I'm like how do you see that he goes

725
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:30,760
well I'm using a microscope I was a

726
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,889
magnifying glass I got 50 year-old eye

727
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:35,559
so I couldn't see that stuff guess what

728
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:37,809
I did I bought a microscope $135

729
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:39,370
investment and I use it all the time I

730
00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:41,590
feel like I have Superman vision now

731
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:43,959
because I just said it to my focus not

732
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:45,879
like with the glasses on and I see

733
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,919
everything so little things like that

734
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,200
can make a huge difference but we lost

735
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,480
time he found errors on the board I

736
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,850
already gave the approval to start

737
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,679
producing the board's in China never do

738
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:58,000
that you want to make sure your

739
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:00,100
prototypes working because we were

740
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,050
running out of time and

741
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:04,570
I was able to stop what they were doing

742
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:06,280
in China in time too like they save like

743
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:08,770
the materials and then they were able to

744
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:11,740
fix one of the two physical errors that

745
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:14,050
we had like yeah I mean that's a lesson

746
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:16,300
learned for me but again I was trying to

747
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:17,800
stick to my timelines you got to figure

748
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,510
out you know you want to take that risk

749
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,370
it could have been a very expensive risk

750
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:26,500
but I wanted to make sure we had things

751
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:27,429
moving along again going back to why are

752
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,620
you doing this what are your objectives

753
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:30,790
try not to over engineer I think I'm

754
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,479
spending way too much time on some of

755
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,050
these slides I'm gonna go a little

756
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,720
faster

757
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:35,980
try not to wait oh I mean I love Rube

758
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,100
Goldberg machines I think they're

759
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:41,620
hilarious I've built a few but your bad

760
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:44,679
should not be one simplicity is

761
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:46,629
definitely key and usability if it's

762
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,280
just in your mind you're like yeah I'm

763
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:50,200
gonna have all these buttons and I want

764
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,610
to do all this other stuff for you it

765
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,890
might be easy to use but for other

766
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:56,169
people they're gonna look at it and

767
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:59,320
they'll sigh inside and say I have no

768
00:31:56,170 --> 00:32:04,090
idea what to do with this thing yeah it

769
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:05,320
looks cool but I can't because you

770
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:09,040
you've kind of put it to a position

771
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:10,060
where now you set the bar too high but

772
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,760
if that's your objective then that's

773
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:15,909
fine if that is your objective just try

774
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:19,450
not to over engineer it tools that you

775
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:21,040
could use some people use paint because

776
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:23,470
you can create a nice vectorized bitmap

777
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:26,530
with paint go for it if that's what you

778
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:31,110
want to use some people use Adobe I tend

779
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:31,110
to go with things like GIMP and Inkscape

780
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:35,920
[Music]

781
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:37,209
fruit website if you see like the

782
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,130
graphics with the lines and the

783
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:40,720
different colors that are wires that's

784
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:42,370
like Fritzing which is great for

785
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,740
somebody to learn but if you actually

786
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:46,899
want to produce something that you want

787
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,720
to have like the different colored

788
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:51,490
solder mask and the silk and have a

789
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,520
different colored substrate and maybe

790
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:56,920
even have exposed copper it's harder to

791
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:59,139
do that with Fritzing then then it would

792
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:01,660
be with Chi CAD but again Chi CAD has a

793
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:03,610
steeper learning curve because it has so

794
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:05,350
many capabilities and then you just

795
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:07,090
produce your Gerber's send them Gerber

796
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:09,250
files of the files that you give the

797
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:11,090
people that make the board so they they

798
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:12,950
understand where things go and

799
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:15,760
um where to cut it and drill it and

800
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:18,290
other other really important things

801
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,910
there's also Eagle Eagle has been around

802
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:22,580
a long time it's also now than another

803
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:25,490
popular one that people use I just

804
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:27,620
wanted to put that up there how you

805
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:30,860
gonna get a paid for what fine sponsor

806
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:33,469
is gherkin right here right here

807
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:36,379
cipher con also right on the side it's

808
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:37,400
there's no um I'm gonna say there's no

809
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:39,350
shame but I don't even think it's shame

810
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,730
if you don't have the money to do this

811
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,679
and you know you're having an event or

812
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:44,570
something it's okay to ask other people

813
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,760
because they might really want to

814
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:48,409
support your mission your cause and they

815
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:51,410
might want to be a part of your creation

816
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:53,360
I know for example like CG Silver's he

817
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:54,680
loves the fact that we have his logo on

818
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,229
the badge and we were able to do that

819
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:59,090
because we have a big display but if you

820
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:00,020
don't have a display or you know may not

821
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:02,540
work out for you because of the

822
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:05,690
real-estate reasons find a way to get

823
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:07,460
sponsors to help one person

824
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:09,860
Johnny Christmas gave me something like

825
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:11,570
really good advice was we were at cypher

826
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:13,070
con he's like your display is so big in

827
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:15,410
your Kickstarter you should put

828
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:18,380
something so that sponsors can like sign

829
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:19,609
up right there at the Kickstarter or a

830
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:23,270
Kickstarter we had three thousand

831
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:26,420
dollars in sponsor money alone yeah so

832
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:28,370
it pays and it's absolutely it was a

833
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:31,730
great suggestion thank you again Johnny

834
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:33,949
and it works out how you want to sell

835
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:36,290
them kind of to you right you can go to

836
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:38,330
Shopify we use that online you could

837
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:40,190
sell them on tindy a lot of the makers

838
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:42,590
also love to go to tindy cuz that's

839
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:44,389
where the buyers are right there also on

840
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:45,800
Kickstarter but how do they know when

841
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:47,870
you're on Kickstarter you gotta use

842
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,100
social media you got to get out there so

843
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:51,560
I'm gonna move on I have more to talk

844
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:53,719
about this but I'm gonna jump ahead now

845
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,980
that you kind of you know you're you're

846
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:56,929
thinking about what you want to do and

847
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:58,340
get started now you've got to work on

848
00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:00,379
your circuit board design how are you

849
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:02,450
gonna do assembly and then who's gonna

850
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:04,580
do the coding if it's not you let's get

851
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:06,890
into that a little deeper so this is the

852
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:08,420
schematic for this board and again it's

853
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:11,660
up on github

854
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:13,250
again thank you Compu kid Mike so you

855
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,720
need somebody that understands how all

856
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,190
these things connect together so you

857
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,450
want to figure out like what tool you're

858
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,620
gonna use for the circuit board design

859
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:21,290
right so if you said okay we're gonna

860
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:23,339
use kike a great so now you go forward

861
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:25,470
and what's it gonna do like

862
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:28,140
when you had your specs before and said

863
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:31,169
we needed to do these three things is it

864
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:32,879
going to be a chip like in ESP 32 or is

865
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:35,040
it going to be separate chips like

866
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,740
separate Wi-Fi controller separate like

867
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,180
Bluetooth or ZigBee or xB or something

868
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,649
you've got to figure out what those

869
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,480
components are and that's kind of the

870
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:44,130
stage right here is before you could

871
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,980
connect the things what parts are you

872
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:51,630
going to use and on the right here is

873
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:53,880
also the like kind of the layout of the

874
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:56,400
board so it's a zoom in of the forearm

875
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,470
where I call it the arm pad where we had

876
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,910
some LEDs behind that as well and you

877
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:02,220
can kind of see where the traces go

878
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:03,569
where the silkscreen is gonna be you

879
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:07,680
guys know what the silkscreen is right

880
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:09,450
and the solder mask all that stuff so

881
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,879
getting your board design and setup

882
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:14,310
again how much time do you think you

883
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,930
need to do the board design if someone's

884
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:17,549
like if it's really super complicated

885
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:21,600
and it's gonna take I'll get it done in

886
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:24,570
two weeks like is that realistic maybe

887
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:26,460
say take three take four but maybe no

888
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:29,280
more than four you really got to kind of

889
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:32,070
set up the boundaries on this also in

890
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,690
assembly and production I wanted to go

891
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:35,010
local now

892
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:36,870
I wanted to start to build a

893
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:39,060
relationship with somebody I live in the

894
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:40,609
Chicago suburbs these guys accelerate

895
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:44,940
assemblies are in Elk Grove Village I

896
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:49,170
like the idea of when I have the parts I

897
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:49,790
could drive them over why it saves me

898
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:52,710
time

899
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:55,620
wait but you're doing it right but if I

900
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:57,570
go to ship it I could ship it overnight

901
00:36:55,620 --> 00:37:00,029
and it costs a lot of money but if I

902
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:02,490
ship it regular and maybe today that's

903
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:04,800
two days of time lost well then just

904
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:07,950
plan ahead sometimes things don't always

905
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,840
work that way so when we heard about the

906
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:12,210
tariffs going up with the components I

907
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:14,370
bought a lot of parts before the

908
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:16,860
beginning of the new year to save about

909
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:19,830
25 percent of the cost because of the

910
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:21,540
tariffs so I had I don't know I think

911
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:23,759
was like $4,000 with the parts like

912
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:25,740
sitting in my house until we were ready

913
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,150
to get to assembly and my wife's like

914
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,850
when are we gonna do with this stuff and

915
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:31,170
I'm like well we'll get there you'll see

916
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:32,730
but when we got there and she's like oh

917
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:35,340
I get it now because she's not very

918
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:36,930
technical but she kind of like you know

919
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,550
she's very good support

920
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:40,980
all these crazy things that I like to do

921
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:43,530
but accelerated assembly I also got to

922
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:45,390
check out their facility so if you're

923
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:47,640
going like one of the other companies at

924
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:50,400
a remote you don't get to see like

925
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:53,279
solder waves like they had this in there

926
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,170
this giant machine with molten solder so

927
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,720
the board's kind of go over it and it

928
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:59,700
gets like bathed in solder and then it

929
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:02,490
comes no one else thinks that's cool

930
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:04,890
it's like molten solder not just like a

931
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:06,569
drop like an ocean of it I mean it was

932
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:07,980
really cool and you get to see the

933
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:09,870
pick-and-place machine which is like up

934
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:11,700
there like it's just these robotic arms

935
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:13,230
moving super fast grabbing and putting

936
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:15,540
everything accurately and then after

937
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:17,880
having spent over four hours trying to

938
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:20,130
do this by hand you appreciate the

939
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,990
assembly another thing to think about

940
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:24,120
how are you going to do the assembly if

941
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:25,589
it's a small quantity maybe you could do

942
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,960
it by hand but if it's a high quantity

943
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:29,370
you're gonna have to say well we might

944
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,730
have to just pay the extra a little bit

945
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:34,560
of money to save the time and this was

946
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:35,610
another time-saving thing you know cost

947
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,670
benefit analysis

948
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:41,040
you gotta weigh it in but I like I said

949
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:42,630
I want to build a relationship that

950
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,800
pictures it's a picture to show you like

951
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:45,810
you could be sitting there and soldering

952
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,880
yourself so when you're right in the

953
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:50,100
code what platform do you want to use if

954
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:52,080
you're you're you know you like Eclipse

955
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,980
and you're comfortable with that IDE go

956
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,600
for it

957
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:57,150
you could write all your code in like

958
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,920
C++ or you can write it and maybe Python

959
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:00,630
there's like micro Python and other

960
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:04,260
other tools and platforms you could use

961
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:06,570
I went with what I knew Arduino IDE and

962
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:08,670
it worked well with this chip all right

963
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:09,870
so it kind of made sense for me and it

964
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:11,370
was easy because if I made a change I

965
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:14,790
could just flash it again flash it again

966
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:16,440
flash it again at war you could just use

967
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:18,330
a text editor and then there's they

968
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,740
typically whoever makes the chip

969
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:20,790
typically has some kind of tools or

970
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,799
there might be some open-source tool

971
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:24,540
where you can then after you've compiled

972
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,820
your bytecode then write it to the chip

973
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:29,940
sometimes it requires assembly language

974
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:33,350
it's kind of a dying art who here here

975
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:33,350
still writes code in assembly language

976
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:40,350
right yo I'm not surprised at you Phil

977
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:43,920
who could read assembly language sort of

978
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:45,089
but who wants to sit out in like JMP and

979
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,950
then I don't know where we're gonna go

980
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:49,120
from there it's just wherever wherever

981
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:51,490
we need to go

982
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,630
now once you've got your your badge and

983
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:54,100
you've got your timelines you got to

984
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:55,990
start working on also think about how

985
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,490
you're gonna promote it and you could

986
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:58,629
use social media there's different

987
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:01,689
options there of course we'll get into

988
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:04,090
that keeping track of your expenses so

989
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:06,700
my original so I started when I was 18

990
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:08,800
in electrical engineering then I went to

991
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,669
school for accounting so I'm really kind

992
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,370
of an accountant

993
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:14,230
that's a techie nerd that then said

994
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:16,630
accounting for the birds I'm now gonna

995
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:18,940
go and into technology full-time so

996
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:20,590
fortunately I have that training there

997
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:23,080
are some people who are brilliant in

998
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:25,120
technology but they don't get like you

999
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,470
know debit is left credit is right and

1000
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,690
when if something goes in something

1001
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:31,149
comes out it has to always balance and

1002
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:32,500
if you don't know where it goes it goes

1003
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,920
somewhere you just got to figure out

1004
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,570
where it goes

1005
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,030
maybe retained earnings or owner equity

1006
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:38,560
so having somebody like you know you

1007
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:41,020
don't need an accountant with just the

1008
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:43,120
bookkeeping tremendously important

1009
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:44,320
because if it's a hobby that starts to

1010
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,600
turn into something where you become

1011
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,850
profitable you need to figure out like

1012
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:51,279
am I gonna have to pay taxes on this I

1013
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:52,660
may so I really need good accounting

1014
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,930
because I don't want to pay more taxes

1015
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:58,000
than I need and then delivery another

1016
00:40:55,930 --> 00:41:01,000
one I gave you one delivery example I

1017
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,030
can go on with more but I did hear a

1018
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,540
story of a friend who had I think three

1019
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:07,150
badges

1020
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:10,270
you know the friend is I had to had

1021
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:12,370
three badges or so and they that this

1022
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:14,380
got lost like they were delivered they

1023
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:15,430
weren't there when he showed up and some

1024
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,690
of the makers were really cool because

1025
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:18,730
they had extras and they were able to

1026
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:20,140
replace it but others like I'm sorry

1027
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:22,270
they're all gone there's nothing I can

1028
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:24,640
do all right so there is a risk from the

1029
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:26,950
buy side as well as from somebody who's

1030
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,480
building a badge kind of covered a lot

1031
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:30,310
of this stuff right social media you

1032
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,590
guys know to use it Kickstarter is good

1033
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:34,660
selling on tindy also helps but

1034
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:36,910
promoting that badge incredibly

1035
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:40,359
important because once you have

1036
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:41,830
something what you want to do is if

1037
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,630
you're planning to sell them to raise

1038
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:45,340
money to support your cause or you just

1039
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:46,900
want to have them because you're gonna

1040
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:48,730
you know give them to people like kids

1041
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:50,140
or something but you want people to know

1042
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:52,300
about it you want people to be excited

1043
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:54,609
about it and one person that I think did

1044
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:59,530
a really fantastic job with promoting it

1045
00:41:54,610 --> 00:42:00,310
is if you guys saw the the multipass

1046
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:03,490
badge

1047
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:05,620
the Fifth Element he was building his

1048
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:08,049
prototype and taking like really kind of

1049
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:10,060
close up shots and putting them out on

1050
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:11,950
Twitter and social media and saying hey

1051
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:13,299
here's something that I'm working on and

1052
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:15,189
people like ooh that looks cool what are

1053
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:17,650
you doing and then when he released it

1054
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:22,030
I think his Kickstarter was done in like

1055
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:25,500
what 12 hours 12 hours hit his goal and

1056
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:28,900
was like I'm done that is pretty awesome

1057
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:31,210
so hats off to him Romulan bee is his

1058
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:33,570
handle so hats off to him like he did a

1059
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:36,700
really good job with that

1060
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:39,130
accounting use the tools that work for

1061
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:41,290
you you can use QuickBooks which I have

1062
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:42,340
if you really want to get into it kind

1063
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:45,279
of gets a little expensive

1064
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:47,800
Zoho books a little less expensive but

1065
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,900
it's online its cloud-based I mean

1066
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:52,330
QuickBooks is also an online version as

1067
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:54,220
well kind of go with what works for you

1068
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:54,790
if you're looking for something that's

1069
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:57,430
simple

1070
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:58,630
Zoho books is pretty good if you're like

1071
00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:02,169
you know I don't have any money for any

1072
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:05,320
of this you can go to some you know

1073
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:07,330
office supply store and buy some

1074
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:10,960
columnar pads and just kind of like

1075
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:14,200
write it down purchases for X and then

1076
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,550
the you know cash is deducted and assets

1077
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:18,879
or whatever you're gonna put it to is

1078
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:21,040
now increased you do manually but keep

1079
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,530
good records when you come to the

1080
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,080
delivery you know this was a Canadian

1081
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:27,940
post one but yeah so again know your

1082
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:30,250
audience I forgot to change the mailbox

1083
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:32,410
you could just send it off regular mail

1084
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:33,700
which is one thing that we did you want

1085
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:36,100
to deliver you want to be able to

1086
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:38,109
whether you're delivering in person or

1087
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:40,000
you're shipping it through you know

1088
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:42,310
Amazon Prime air or how are you getting

1089
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,560
it to them I gave you a couple stories

1090
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:46,960
already if you're not going to deliver

1091
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,100
what's gonna even unfortunately happen

1092
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,320
is you're gonna have people that are not

1093
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:52,690
gonna trust you and the more anymore so

1094
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:55,870
people might love your work but if you

1095
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:57,820
can't get it to them they're never ever

1096
00:43:55,870 --> 00:44:00,730
gonna come back to you so very very

1097
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:02,650
important or they might even trash talk

1098
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:04,360
you on the internet you know on some

1099
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:06,040
social media site or something and you

1100
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:07,120
don't want that either because now you

1101
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,470
got to go through that mess and

1102
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,540
sometimes it's just easy to refund the

1103
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:11,890
money to people bless you sometimes just

1104
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:13,390
like hair here's your money back I'm not

1105
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:15,000
trying to rob you just trying to

1106
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:18,029
pay for this fun thing I'm trying to do

1107
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,980
no harm no foul let's make it right okay

1108
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:23,770
take the high road

1109
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:25,870
post-production I got a few minutes left

1110
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:27,160
I'm gonna come a little faster but I

1111
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:30,220
think we've covered most of this which

1112
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:33,009
is really good so well when you reflect

1113
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:35,319
bring your team together maybe if you

1114
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:37,870
want do a survey like a survey monkey or

1115
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:39,910
something with your your people who

1116
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:41,380
supported your Kickstarter or however

1117
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:42,819
they may have bought it just say what

1118
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:44,530
did you think what worked for you what

1119
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:47,200
didn't work what would you have liked to

1120
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:48,550
have seen one of the weird things that I

1121
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,379
get is with the badge because it had

1122
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:51,760
like a little film on it and so many

1123
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:52,840
times people like my badge is broke and

1124
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,010
there's a line here I'm like well no

1125
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:56,470
that's a line to let you know that

1126
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:59,110
there's a tab you can remove so maybe a

1127
00:44:56,470 --> 00:45:00,339
little like better usability and how am

1128
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:01,600
I kind of delivering it to people and

1129
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:03,430
just let them know by the way there's a

1130
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:05,589
tab here you need to remove your display

1131
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:08,259
is not broken or just little things like

1132
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:10,540
that can also when they're when you're

1133
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:12,610
asking them for feedback it certainly

1134
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:14,740
shows that you care and that you are

1135
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:16,720
trying to make things better and and the

1136
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:19,959
experiences for them right like we said

1137
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,830
before you're gonna have some damaged

1138
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,810
goods

1139
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:24,130
things are just sometimes they mean it's

1140
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:25,810
electronic sometimes they don't just

1141
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:28,090
solder up right I've seen some things

1142
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:30,940
while I was flashing and testing some

1143
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:32,500
what LEDs they just did not go on am I

1144
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:34,210
gonna take the time to sit there with a

1145
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:38,440
microscope and try and figure it out and

1146
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:41,050
reflow and and reposition if you got a

1147
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:42,460
short time frame like a deadline this is

1148
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:44,260
looming and coming up on you quickly

1149
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:46,240
that's not the best use of your time

1150
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:48,040
so when everything's done like when

1151
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,939
after gherkins done and I kind of get

1152
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:51,040
all the accounting and everything

1153
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:52,900
cleaned up I'm gonna be sitting down and

1154
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:55,300
looking at the 20 some-odd badges that

1155
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:58,240
had some issue somewhere couldn't flash

1156
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:59,680
it to the usb whatever it is take them

1157
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,600
apart a little bit and then try again

1158
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,160
and see if they could be usable because

1159
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:05,200
at the end of the day like I don't want

1160
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:07,029
to keep all I want to keep a couple but

1161
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,160
I really don't want to have like you

1162
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:11,290
know 50 badges sitting in my garage for

1163
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:12,549
the next ten years it doesn't serve a

1164
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:15,270
purpose I want it in the hands of

1165
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:17,680
somebody who's gonna learn from using it

1166
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:19,870
and then when you're done like part of

1167
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,910
the reflection think about like next

1168
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:24,700
project are we gonna have an X project

1169
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:26,770
was this painful was it painful did you

1170
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:29,149
do another project afterwards

1171
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:31,220
trying to look it's great right so you

1172
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:33,020
decided okay it's kind of like type 2

1173
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:35,419
fun you guys familiar with type 1 type 2

1174
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:36,740
fun type 1 fun is fun in the moment like

1175
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:40,460
right now that you're having listening

1176
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:42,200
to my talk type 2 fun is when you leave

1177
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:43,790
and you think about the talk you like

1178
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:45,470
man that was really good talk or

1179
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:47,599
building a badge when you're done you

1180
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:49,399
like you know it kind of kind of hurt

1181
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:50,750
some way along the process but you know

1182
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,760
at the end I really feel good about

1183
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:55,490
right and I really want to do it again

1184
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:57,140
that was actually kind of fun so some

1185
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:59,029
people like you know boxing you know in

1186
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:01,609
the ring it's not type 1 fun but when

1187
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:03,980
you win it's type 2 fun so things like

1188
00:47:01,609 --> 00:47:06,140
that so think about that next project

1189
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:08,660
again in your feedback survey from your

1190
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:11,660
your customers or your people are using

1191
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:13,190
the badge ask them what would you have

1192
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:14,598
liked to have seen like what could have

1193
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:16,940
been something that would have maybe

1194
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:19,760
taken this badge to the next level or

1195
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:21,740
would you want like less visual more

1196
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,630
visual more challenges less challenges

1197
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:25,310
more visual whatever it is because again

1198
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:27,230
you're making it for them so think about

1199
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:28,849
that next project and then in a

1200
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:34,119
realistic time frame how much more time

1201
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:36,109
do we have 5 minutes ok I'm nearly done

1202
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:37,730
when you're thinking about that next

1203
00:47:36,109 --> 00:47:38,660
project also think about like when is it

1204
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:40,190
a good time to start

1205
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:42,560
I've already started thinking about my

1206
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:44,180
next projects and one I want to make

1207
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,619
more visual I think I mentioned it

1208
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:46,848
before with like an accelerometer and

1209
00:47:45,619 --> 00:47:49,430
some graphics and we could see if we can

1210
00:47:46,849 --> 00:47:51,980
do that I also want to make some others

1211
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:53,839
that can do other different things you

1212
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:56,240
know I'm not going to talk about it just

1213
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:59,089
yet but you want to keep keep doing this

1214
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:01,700
um one of the things I just kind of

1215
00:47:59,089 --> 00:48:04,160
forgot to mention when you are doing

1216
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:06,379
these projects and you are thinking

1217
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:10,819
about your next one who are you

1218
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:12,440
competing with yourself if you're like

1219
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:16,070
you know and not X or they make

1220
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:18,349
beautiful educational wonderful badges

1221
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:20,540
but it's a team of 5 and if it's you and

1222
00:48:18,349 --> 00:48:23,599
maybe one other person you can't really

1223
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:25,220
compete with them so don't spend your

1224
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,240
time and your energy doing something

1225
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:28,098
like that because you're just going to

1226
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,319
kind of feel discouraged compete with

1227
00:48:28,099 --> 00:48:32,630
yourself so look at what you've done and

1228
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:34,490
what can you do that you've never done

1229
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:35,750
before so like I've never used an

1230
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:37,368
accelerometer so I think that would

1231
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:38,869
actually be kind of fun and then have it

1232
00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:39,470
change like a graphic or something when

1233
00:48:38,869 --> 00:48:42,260
when the

1234
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:43,759
moves to give it like a 3d effect we'll

1235
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:45,830
see if I can get that pull that off but

1236
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,930
I've never done that and if I can do

1237
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:50,029
that I'll feel really proud of myself

1238
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:51,500
I know sciatic nerve will feel pretty

1239
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:53,960
proud of me too and I think it might

1240
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:56,060
just stop there but just you want to

1241
00:48:53,960 --> 00:49:00,080
have fun and and just challenge yourself

1242
00:48:56,060 --> 00:49:02,540
compete with yourself now you're gonna

1243
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,619
get some negativity especially if you're

1244
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:07,820
gonna make it very public and very

1245
00:49:03,619 --> 00:49:09,410
visual or visible to people being calm

1246
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:13,040
remaining positive is incredibly

1247
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:14,629
important one if if you get to start to

1248
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:17,359
get discouraged people gonna pick up on

1249
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:19,490
it and then they may or may not have

1250
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:21,680
again faith in you for your next project

1251
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:23,209
but people like positive people right

1252
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,759
like who wants to be around like Eeyore

1253
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:28,400
all day maybe not it's kind of cute once

1254
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,650
in a while but for the most part no so

1255
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,660
keep positive you know make think of

1256
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:34,760
this thing is like your Zen project

1257
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:37,000
something that is is kind of lifting you

1258
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:40,130
up into enlightenment as best as you can

1259
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:43,040
remember to communicate if you have to

1260
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:45,170
communicate here like leonidas I mean

1261
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,490
you know he's like here is his team is

1262
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:48,349
dead they're on the ground he's got a

1263
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:51,770
few arrows in his chest it looks like

1264
00:49:48,349 --> 00:49:54,589
the end is near especially if you're

1265
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:56,509
doing a Kickstarter your backers want to

1266
00:49:54,589 --> 00:49:57,950
know they want to know what's going on I

1267
00:49:56,510 --> 00:50:00,140
think I sent out maybe seven or eight

1268
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:01,790
communications just about things because

1269
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:03,470
they feel like they're a part of the

1270
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:05,839
process they feel like they're

1271
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:08,270
supporting your project that they should

1272
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:10,339
know what's going on positive or

1273
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:12,080
negative again I said keep it positive

1274
00:50:10,339 --> 00:50:15,109
but if like hey we're having delays

1275
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:17,330
because of something with China customs

1276
00:50:15,109 --> 00:50:18,830
or we found like a part is not really

1277
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:20,630
working and we're kind of re-engineering

1278
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:22,790
it they want to know because they're

1279
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:24,080
expecting a deliverable again delivery

1280
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:24,800
and if they see there's a delay they'll

1281
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,690
be like okay

1282
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:29,000
most people are pretty reasonable you

1283
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:30,710
just need to communicate it's gonna wrap

1284
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,230
up two minutes

1285
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:35,390
I might not really talk about this too

1286
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:38,210
much but somebody brought up like again

1287
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:40,310
like environmental concerns you know

1288
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:42,349
what I don't know how this is gonna

1289
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:43,759
affect the environment to be honest but

1290
00:50:42,349 --> 00:50:45,619
when you think about how many badges we

1291
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,660
created and all the other electronics

1292
00:50:45,619 --> 00:50:50,570
that are being created it's a fairly

1293
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:53,279
small footprint compared to a global
