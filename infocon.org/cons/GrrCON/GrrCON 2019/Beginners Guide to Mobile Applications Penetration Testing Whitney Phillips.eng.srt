00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,730
reason if I hear that phone I will come

24
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,879
challenged me on this so far I can

25
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,960

it's pretty busy here man

33
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:24,990
alright so my talk is on mobile

34
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:25,470
application penetration testing so Who

35
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,250
am I

36
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:32,400
well I'm Whitney Phillips a little bit

37
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:35,909
about myself I started as a help desk

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,680
specialist oh my side didn't my slide

39
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:39,689
switch this was supposed to be before

40
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,899
that I've been an IT and information

41
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:46,100
security for eight years I started off

42
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:49,950
at helpdesk and then I moved to Network

43
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:53,669
administration after that I was in

44
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:57,509
security operations and then application

45
00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:03,960
security and then finally I'm a mobile

46
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:07,140
at pentester yeah so why are we here

47
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,649
well when I had started a year ago at my

48
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:13,860
company I really started to enjoy do

49
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:15,900
doing mobile app testing so I thought

50
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:20,640
why not give a talk on it because it's

51
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:25,230
something that I think I could give good

52
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,000
knowledge to you guys so today's talk is

53
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:30,030
just going to be a high-level overview

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,340
of the tools that I use day in and day

55
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:34,709
out because each tool that I'm gonna

56
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,620
present to you you could do a whole

57
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:39,840
presentation on it's they have so much

58
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,819
information but I'm gonna give you links

59
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,709
and just ideas of what to use on it and

60
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:47,488
then you can go ahead and take it from

61
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:50,849
there so this is me my first day at work

62
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:54,780
this is my coworker in the back right

63
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:58,200
there dealing with my so yep

64
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,220
alright so let's get started first what

65
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,920
you're going to need is you're going to

66
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,140
need hardware so with mobile app testing

67
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,390
you obviously gonna need a device so

68
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:09,450
we're gonna start with one a rude

69
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:12,899
Android device this is the only slide I

70
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:14,399
have for this because each Android that

71
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,180
you have is gonna be a completely

72
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,250
different route so you'll have to just

73
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,620
go ahead and do your google foo and get

74
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:27,919
the right route process but then after

75
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:30,720
that you'll be good my next thing is

76
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:35,310
genymotion so genymotion

77
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,169
is an android emulator mainly the design

78
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:40,500
for developers but it's really great for

79
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:44,669
pen testers because if you can see I can

80
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:50,000
spool up as many Android devices as I

81
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:52,739
want and you can do whatever oh s or

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,190
maybe you want a Google pixel running

83
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:59,489
8.1 or 8.0 and then you can just kill

84
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,660
the kill it off and restart fresh if

85
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:03,449
that one doesn't work with what you're

86
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:06,448
trying to test with it don't believe

87
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:09,269
it's free but you do get a 30-day trial

88
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:13,079
and as many fake emails as you can make

89
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:17,250
you can totally you know have as much

90
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:20,519
time with it as you want so yay for fake

91
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:23,760
emails so this is another photo of the

92
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,810
genymotion on the right hand side is

93
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,250
what you're Emily

94
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,980
would look like so it looks just like a

95
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:31,170
phone but it's on your laptop and then I

96
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:33,000
put this picture up here because this is

97
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:36,840
one of like the great features that it

98
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,610
has it dumps logs of the phone so you

99
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,080
don't have to do it all manually and you

100
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:44,040
can just pick out what you want to look

101
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:48,690
at so kind of easier than going through

102
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:50,760
the routed way of the phone so we're

103
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:52,860
done with Android next we're gonna go

104
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:56,960
onto iOS so you're gonna want a

105
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:59,640
jailbroken iPhone now there's several

106
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,099
jailbreaks out right now the one I'm

107
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,050
most familiar with is good old Elektra

108
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:08,010
because I'm running on a really old

109
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:09,660
phone super easy to jailbreak but you

110
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,070
know we have to throw it up there who

111
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:16,919
knows you might have it eleven point

112
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:21,690
three or eleven point Oh next is a

113
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:24,060
chimera so it's only very specific to

114
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:28,800
iOS twelve to twelve point two and

115
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:32,400
twelve point four rule of thumb if a

116
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:35,520
jailbreak comes out and you know you

117
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,080
have a an iPhone device that you want to

118
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,690
jailbreak you jailbreak it that day

119
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,859
because you might not get you might not

120
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,560
get the chance to the next day to

121
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,300
jailbreak so just throwing that out

122
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,039
there and then this last one just came

123
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,190
out checkmate

124
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:53,820
so this is utilizing a permanent

125
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:57,060
unfashionable bootrom exploit for a bot

126
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:59,789
like millions of iOS devices obviously

127
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:04,650
it works on eleven generations of iPhone

128
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:06,479
from 4s to X so a little disclaimer like

129
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:09,179
if you go to their website they will

130
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:13,770
tell you to back up your because it

131
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:16,260
might kill your phone so I'm not you

132
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,039
know we should always back up we'll just

133
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:20,280
put it that way

134
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:22,530
just back up your so you got your

135
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,150
device right alright so we're ready to

136
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:28,469
test this app well how do you get the

137
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:31,979
app well obtaining it now we can do it

138
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:33,659
the legit way right again Google Play

139
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:35,820
that's gonna be kind of hard if you're

140
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:37,169
trying to be sneaky about it you're

141
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,800
gonna want to make a fake account and

142
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:41,460
then your negative

143
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,930
your phone and have here or you could be

144
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,698
a real account if you want your stuff

145
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,680
out there doesn't matter

146
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:48,810
Apple store lets you make fake accounts

147
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,030
I just think you have to put a real

148
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:52,550
address or something but I mean your

149
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:55,830
best friend's address should be fine

150
00:06:52,550 --> 00:07:02,520
pretty sure it's fine this is the legit

151
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:05,370
way the not so legit way I love going to

152
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:08,389
the site is apk pure this just lets you

153
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:12,270
go download the apk for fun for free

154
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:14,159
nothing no issues I mean you might want

155
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:16,758
to check if it's safe I'm sure it's fine

156
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:20,370
I'm sure it's fine but I like this site

157
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:22,500
and then iPhone I mean I just have my

158
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:24,509
fake Apple account so that's that's how

159
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,120
I do it but I looked up some links

160
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:30,800
through you guys great area for iPhone

161
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,629
do it with you want I don't know if it's

162
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,930
you know I don't know if they're legit

163
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:41,300
or not so go ahead and try it that's

164
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:44,130
kind of an ass thing to do but uh yeah

165
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:50,190
so that's how you're gonna obtain your

166
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:53,550
apks and your IPAs next we're gonna move

167
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:56,460
on to after you've got your IPA what do

168
00:07:53,550 --> 00:08:00,719
you do with it or your apk huh yeah you

169
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:05,068
drink your IPA for sure for sure I would

170
00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:08,159
love an IPA rate alright next well you

171
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:11,069
got software so now we're gonna focus on

172
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:14,879
building that toolkit so what kind of

173
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:18,240
tools are we gonna use for this first

174
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:21,659
off we're gonna go with Frida

175
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:26,990
so Frida is used for dynamic analysis

176
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:30,319
for Android iOS and windows apps this

177
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:33,029
like I said this one you have literally

178
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,820
there's like whole talks at DEFCON with

179
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:38,760
this one like it's it like you have to

180
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,500
be focused in on Frida which is this way

181
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,539
I forget how to use it every time I come

182
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,570
back to it but what it does is it allows

183
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:47,980
you to set up hooks for targets so you

184
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,840
can modify certain parameters

185
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,540
and changed the way the value comes out

186
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:56,710
and changed how the app runs I watched

187
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:58,240
one talk at Def Con and he changed one

188
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:03,720
of the apps to do a completely different

189
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:08,050
function after upon startup so it's free

190
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:11,880
open-source the guy is really easy to

191
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:16,030
talk to - so you can ask him questions

192
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:19,660
so coming off of Frida and using the

193
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:21,970
frita framework it's freedom this is one

194
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:26,380
of my favorite it's because I love

195
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:32,650
running memory dump some phones what

196
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:34,360
what it does is you can pull all the

197
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:37,300
memory dump off the phone and then you

198
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:41,170
start looking for like secret treasures

199
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:44,859
and stuff so it can be used on Windows

200
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:47,410
and Linux and Mac OS as the work

201
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:51,820
computer and then you can do dumps on

202
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:53,939
iOS Android and Windows apps so again

203
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:57,010
what are we looking for in freedom

204
00:09:53,940 --> 00:10:03,190
credentials user names passwords pass

205
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:05,200
phrases private keys email addresses so

206
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:09,280
like URLs that you can't find in the amp

207
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:13,180
but they leave it leave it out there IP

208
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:15,310
addresses and schemes so I don't know

209
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,979
it's a good one sometimes like you'll

210
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:23,979
find like dumb stuff developers stay in

211
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:25,510
there like random things yeah so one

212
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:30,760
more tool from Frieda that I like to use

213
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:35,189
is Frida iOS dump this pulls a decrypted

214
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,189
IPA from your jailbroken phone so

215
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:40,720
basically after that you've got that

216
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:42,820
decrypted IPA then you can use it to

217
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,360
manipulate it and reload it into your

218
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:50,400
phone to see if anything's changed and

219
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,400
it's always nice to have a decrypted IPA

220
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,260
[Music]

221
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:05,360
alright next we have mob SF so mild SF

222
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:09,110
all-in-one automated mobile application

223
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:12,530
pen testing tool I love it you can use

224
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:17,420
it for apks and IPAs it kind of gives a

225
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:18,470
nice overview on how the app is so if

226
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,569
you can see right here

227
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:22,850
it gives you an app score I just use

228
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,870
Twitter so I just pulled Twitter's apk I

229
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:28,780
don't know I'll probably get sued for

230
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:31,940
this yeah so it gives you hashes and

231
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:35,540
right here like the actual name of the

232
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:40,570
app after that once you scroll down a

233
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:43,790
little bit it gives you fun stuff like

234
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:47,210
dangerous status like unknown provisions

235
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:49,760
from Android and well we know it wants

236
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:52,330
permissions to the internet for sure and

237
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:56,810
it wants to control your vibrator I

238
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:59,690
don't know why but yeah reading contact

239
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:02,569
data so yeah so we get this and then you

240
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:06,950
get like all this other fun stuff it's

241
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:08,390
really cool and so that that tool is you

242
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:10,520
can get it on github and then you

243
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:13,730
install it and then run it on your

244
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:17,199
command line and go to the website that

245
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:22,210
gives you but I like it it also gives me

246
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:27,170
locations inside the apk to look for

247
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:30,110
questionable stuff some yeah mob SF good

248
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:31,969
tool now we're going to talk about herb

249
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:35,270
suite we all know we should all know

250
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:43,850
burps we mainly I use this to reinforce

251
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:45,410
what traffic the app is using next we

252
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:48,200
have Wireshark

253
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:51,219
again capturing traffic you want to know

254
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:55,970
if that device or that app is running

255
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:58,960
HTTP HTTP what IP address is it's going

256
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:03,170
to so you want to check check for that

257
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:07,450
so how do we run Wireshark on your

258
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:09,699
device for the iPhone for an iOS device

259
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:12,640
what you're gonna do is get your UDID

260
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:14,790
number from iTunes and you're gonna run

261
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:20,110
this command with your phone connected

262
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:22,030
this our Vict l - s and your UDID and

263
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:24,250
then what that will do is connect your

264
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:26,290
device and then from there you can run a

265
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,990
pseudo TCP dump and it's gonna pull a

266
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:32,170
dump of your Apolo capture and then

267
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:34,380
you'll pop it into Wireshark I'm sure my

268
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:37,270
coworker doesn't like how I do that but

269
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:43,380
it's fine he's just in the crowd I'm

270
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:45,819
making his face red - so with Android I

271
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,920
have to do it the jank yes way I

272
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:51,070
literally take my PS sense box and like

273
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:54,430
set up wire capture and make make sure

274
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:57,040
nothing's on the network and then

275
00:13:54,430 --> 00:14:02,739
capture my traffic that way or make your

276
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:06,010
laptop a hotspot I did find this with

277
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:08,290
480 B so maybe it worked I don't know I

278
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:10,870
haven't had time to try it but it will

279
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:16,750
be something to do once I get back to

280
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:21,540
work using these commands so I'll go

281
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:24,130
over a TB in a few minutes after that

282
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:27,400
kind of another housekeeping here a lot

283
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:29,740
of good text editor I use sublime just

284
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:35,290
so I can easily sift through that

285
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:39,880
information all right so where do I get

286
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:42,430
a TB Android SDK toolkit so that gives

287
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:45,040
me my ADB tools and I want to install

288
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:47,170
for my film and that's got fastboot and

289
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,480
system trace but the only one I

290
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:54,790
primarily use and I can speak about is

291
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:57,280
ADB so what is ADB ADB is the Android

292
00:14:54,790 --> 00:15:00,430
debug bridge so what that does is that

293
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:04,480
allows you to connect your device by adb

294
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:06,969
shell you can sideload your APK so when

295
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,890
we went to apk pier and we have that we

296
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:13,030
can side load it and we'll avoid the

297
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:17,860
whole Google conversation we can pull

298
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:21,459
from device to PC and we can push from

299
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:26,770
PC to device with this command so

300
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:29,529
definitely a fun tool to have utilized

301
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:31,329
adb shell a lot so a lot of times you're

302
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:35,529
gonna find the information about your

303
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:37,600
app in the data data folder so being

304
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:40,180
able to have that root access and then

305
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,750
shell in and get that deep dive into the

306
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:45,670
phone into that app folder you might be

307
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:50,610
able to find like databases that they

308
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:50,610
have stored or different credentials

309
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:58,149
next is a TV log hat this is like my

310
00:15:54,070 --> 00:16:00,730
favorite so a TV log camp it's a command

311
00:15:58,149 --> 00:16:03,870
line tool that dumps a log of system

312
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:07,660
messages so what does that mean it's

313
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:10,420
includes like stack traces that the

314
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:12,880
device throws or any error messages that

315
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:18,520
you might have written in that app the

316
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:20,950
fun part about that is the developer

317
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:24,880
might leave like a certain logging on so

318
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:27,640
then you can find like usernames IP

319
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:33,070
addresses error messages that they might

320
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:34,990
want not want to have seen so I guess I

321
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:40,420
could I don't know if you can see that

322
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:42,910
it's like a little list of the adb

323
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:45,849
logcat so we have activity manager as I

324
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:49,480
window a manager it's just like a little

325
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:55,240
thing I pulled from my phone but then

326
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:57,520
this is the logging characters so we

327
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,890
want to really focus on that warning and

328
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:04,260
even debug for Shirley but warning and

329
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:12,730
error yeah so yeah it helps you find

330
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:17,849
treasures last on this Android but I

331
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:22,959
have android apk tool so this is it can

332
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:26,339
decode your apk and then you're allowed

333
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,339
to rebuild it afterwards

334
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:35,180
basically we use it to decode then like

335
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:37,909
mess around with the app logging and see

336
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:41,270
we can make it run different or give us

337
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:51,170
different error messages afterwards so

338
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:53,510
another fun tool okay alright so after

339
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:57,620
that we got passionfruit iOS passion

340
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:59,300
fruit so this you'll connect your device

341
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:03,050
you'll go to your app and what we'll do

342
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:05,120
is I like it because it's good the

343
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:07,310
different like your file locations or

344
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,290
where the application is stored at and

345
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:13,490
then from there I get on like files ax

346
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:18,560
and dig through and strip out all the

347
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:20,600
information I need but let's let the

348
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:23,480
front page that it gives it is crappy

349
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,820
though because it will just bomb out on

350
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:29,390
you for no reason and I'm pretty sure

351
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:31,760
it's called like crappy iOS analyzer or

352
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:34,780
something so it really stands up to its

353
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:37,580
name another so then I'll give you your

354
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:40,370
folders right here but a lot of times

355
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:41,899
you're not gonna like you don't get a

356
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,419
lot of access to that so that's why I

357
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:47,480
use the that's why I connect to it

358
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:50,330
through its SSH and take all that

359
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:53,930
information off of there but it gives me

360
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:56,659
a location to look for it also runs

361
00:18:53,930 --> 00:19:02,620
Objective C classes and methods and you

362
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:06,520
can see how that's done and then also

363
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:08,929
keychains cookies and user defaults so

364
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,340
it can give you some good information or

365
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:12,170
sometimes it just doesn't give you

366
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:15,290
anything so you have to just go through

367
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:18,920
and see what you can use or utilize it

368
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:21,680
for your next steps alright so after we

369
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:25,540
have all that we need to focus on some

370
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:33,650
decompiling so these are 2d compilers

371
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:35,270
that we use all basically all the

372
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:37,490
compilers are going to act different

373
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,690
with your different apps we're looking

374
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:44,420
for all kinds of sensitive information

375
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:48,680
to API or all's API keys secrets hard

376
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:55,030
coded passwords in the app so J Dex

377
00:19:48,680 --> 00:20:00,500
CFR or two and then we also have

378
00:19:55,030 --> 00:20:04,910
giedrius look at that spooky dragon

379
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:06,950
thing so d gujja is it NSA app be

380
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:09,200
careful you're downloading an S they

381
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:13,520
have I mean it's really good

382
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:20,870
decompiler so it's a major supports

383
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:23,120
Windows Mac OS and Linux and it's such a

384
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:24,709
beast like this is another one of those

385
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,449
that you could literally I think there's

386
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:30,680
a whole workshop at Def Con for Diedre

387
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:32,360
so if you have the heart to spend time

388
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:40,520
and live in it

389
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:42,229
I don't but that's just me alright so so

390
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,600
what are we even looking for like we got

391
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:48,890
this all set up what are we looking for

392
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:54,290
in these apps our main thing is our

393
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:59,600
secret keys dumb things like creds lewd

394
00:20:54,290 --> 00:21:03,710
comments like just a random like things

395
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:06,560
developers will put in their apps the

396
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:09,170
URLs your eyes IP addresses and email

397
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:12,020
addresses and we can use those to then

398
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:16,040
research that app a little bit more and

399
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:17,840
basically you know I found this IP

400
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:20,480
address so I'm gonna go show it and see

401
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,399
exactly what's going on or well I found

402
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,750
his the email address let's just send

403
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,940
them some weird and see if they

404
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:30,950
respond back yeah that kind of stuff so

405
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:34,880
so with that so I've got all that

406
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:39,410
information I also have some training

407
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:45,170
material too so this is one of the books

408
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:51,860
that I use right here to also I guess

409
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:54,170
beefed up my application pen testing and

410
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:59,179
then we have hacking and securing iOS

411
00:21:54,170 --> 00:22:02,360
applications stealing the data another

412
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:04,429
book I use this guy

413
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:08,090
I don't know who this guy is my kick-ass

414
00:22:04,429 --> 00:22:11,269
boss so he schooled us one time with her

415
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:15,580
but his book he's like hey this part in

416
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:17,960
my book says no when we were doing a

417
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:21,699
testing so yeah

418
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:24,320
check that one out this one right here

419
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:27,279
basically everything I told you is in

420
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,918
this book and it's for free

421
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:39,799
so yeah mobile security testing guide

422
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:42,440
check it out and then I have this guy

423
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:45,350
it's in that mobile testing but our dear

424
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:47,630
friend clappy monkey Mike Kemp is

425
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:50,120
featured in this so I thought I would

426
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:51,980
leave it in my slides for you guys to

427
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:57,229
see just pick it up so you can have a

428
00:22:51,980 --> 00:23:01,690
little memento of him but with that I am

429
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:01,690
done do you guys have any questions any

430
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:11,590
commercial I were I use a lot of open

431
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,590
source

432
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,899
you

433
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:23,130
they're companies like good on open

434
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,419
source so I think I like using open

435
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:26,610
source because then you're not tied down

436
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:28,200
to a company and when you're trying to

437
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:44,909
be sneaky and stuff then they don't know

438
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:48,020
what so so some of them know the phone

439
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:50,370
doesn't have to be rooted but I mean to

440
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:52,139
get the full effect of what you're

441
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:54,350
searching for you're gonna want that

442
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:57,299
rooted phone

443
00:23:54,350 --> 00:24:02,870
ludis comment like my coworker is gonna

444
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:05,460
be high ghetto Android that's yeah like

445
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:09,658
alright what are you talking about and

446
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:14,460
then I saw one the I think something

447
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:17,070
like the quick Sly Fox I think it's all

448
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:19,289
like thing alphabets or whatever I found

449
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:21,059
that one time just you're like scrolling

450
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:21,960
through these long lists and you're like

451
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:24,030
what help

452
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:44,490
why release b-but what are they talking

453
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:46,139
about some would think so yeah if you

454
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:48,600
want to tell so the questions that you

455
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:52,230
want to do you need a test for both

456
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:54,360
Android and iOS yeah because they I have

457
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:58,530
done audits for both Android and iOS and

458
00:24:54,360 --> 00:25:01,850
they do act differently so yeah you

459
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:13,440
would want to run tests on both of them

460
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:16,168
some back there oh no I haven't broken

461
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:22,020
into anything crazy lately mine's pretty

462
00:25:16,169 --> 00:25:24,840
tame right now so nothing too crazy back

463
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:28,340
there or way back there I'll get you

464
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:34,389
afterwards how about that

465
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:34,389
all right maybe l7 questions right here

466
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:49,490
no um so I haven't found any malware so

467
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:52,340
like when you're going and grabbing like

468
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:54,740
sketchy apks that's mainly we want to

469
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:56,209
make sure that there's no like bad ap

470
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:58,970
caid's out there that somebody can

471
00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:02,720
download I haven't found any out in the

472
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:05,840
wild yet that were bad so but mainly

473
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,360
what would do is just do like a pull-up

474
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,220
hash of the good known one and then pull

475
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:17,469
the hash of the bad one and compare them

476
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:17,470
so okay over there

477
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:24,500
so I've been pretty like strict on

478
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:26,660
hardware but then my coworker opened me

479
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:29,570
up to the emulator and I'm I haven't

480
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:32,230
tested yet I have it on my well I did

481
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:35,090
have a laptop I have it on my laptop so

482
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:38,180
the only thing nice about that is if it

483
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:41,020
doesn't work then you can just spool up

484
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:44,030
something else and try it in that so

485
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:45,590
yeah I think that might be the route I

486
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:53,210
want to go but sometimes it's nice to

487
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:57,370
still have that hardware available we're
