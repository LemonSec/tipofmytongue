talking your usual stories of pen

24
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:48,880

Adam Compton today we're gonna be

34
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,959
talking about pin test fails it's a

35
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:25,360
little bit of a different topic you

36
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,920
typically at conferences or what have

37
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,110
you you talk you hear people talk about

38
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,450
all the awesome things they've done all

39
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:33,430
the great new tools they've created all

40
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:35,739
the new exploits that they just velop

41
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,990
I'm not talking about that I'm talking

42
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:41,349
about the tines during a pen testers

43
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:43,150
career that they things don't go right

44
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:46,988
and it's their fault

45
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:48,940
I'll always heard not always I hear a

46
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:50,170
lot of pen testers complain that oh the

47
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,090
customer didn't get me the information

48
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,679
the customer didn't do this it's not

49
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,870
always the customers fault sometimes

50
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,620
we're just idiots and we make bad

51
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:01,210
choices and make bad decisions so we're

52
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,180
gonna be talking about a few of those

53
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:06,299
today

54
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,159
from my own career from colleagues of

55
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:11,340
mine friends of mine sharing their

56
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,409
stories with me all the information is

57
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,939
accurate with its in front of company

58
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:17,400
names things of that if I happen to

59
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:18,810
mention any oh probably something like a

60
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,329
c'mere something like that it's just

61
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:24,269
generic just to protect the guilty and

62
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:25,549
the innocent alike so let's go ahead and

63
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:28,709
get started here

64
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:31,950
Who am I my name is Adam Compton I've

65
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:36,720

66
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:38,909
two decades now been husband been a

67
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,659
father for about nine years

68
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:44,940
brothers son all that stuff I started

69
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:47,010
out my career as a pen tester slash

70
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,290
programmer over the course of it I've

71
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,989
also done some research done various

72
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:55,138
other aspects of InfoSec as well pretty

73
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:55,470
much every aspect of pen testing or what

74
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:57,030
have you

75
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,579
whether it's web app stuff like that

76
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:02,430
it's all been fun I always loved pen

77
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:05,519
testing internal networks the most it's

78
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,650
just a more entertaining to me and yes I

79
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,530
am a hillbilly from Eastern Kentucky so

80
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:13,049
and know this isn't just for show these

81
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,970
are actually ones I wear doing the yard

82
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:18,418
and things of that nature so they're

83
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,829
comfortable yeah I can't help it if

84
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:21,570
you're gonna be up on stage you want to

85
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:26,130
be comfortable and this is comfortable

86
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:28,740
so alright so tell you a little bit more

87
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:31,680
about my history here a little bit when

88
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,210
I first started out in pentesting I just

89
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,120
came out of college I'd done an

90
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:39,239
internship but then when I went to the

91
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,470
company that was going to that provided

92
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,169
me the opportunity to take that

93
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,449
internship to a full-time job I arrived

94
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:48,419
and they told me that that position no

95
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:50,190
longer existed because that office no

96
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:52,260
longer existed this is a rather large

97
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:54,000
organization fifty thousand employee

98
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,400
sort of thing and they said well you

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,440
have basically one week you can set here

100
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,510
in the human resources until you find a

101
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,479
new office at which point you either go

102
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:05,159
to that office or you tender your

103
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:07,169
resignation basically because you don't

104
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:09,599
have an office then so I had to quickly

105
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:11,820
sit around and I found an office that

106
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:14,370
I'll frump in testing I'm like a that's

107
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,930
great I've never done that before and I

108
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,330
went straight into it at this

109
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:20,990
point my entire college career and all

110
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:24,840
that was coding developments I was a

111
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:26,669
computer science major so so I went into

112
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,489
pen testing first thing I did is I went

113
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:30,448
into the office at hide everybody

114
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:34,530
meet-and-greet they said that's your

115
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:37,199
desk right there that big stack of ultra

116
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:39,840
fives or to one spark book author it was

117
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:44,520
a unique shop a ho stack of that that's

118
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,320
gonna be your lab build a lab yep that

119
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,630
was my introduction they're like okay so

120
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,500
I set to work first week or so I built

121
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,630
my lab up

122
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,970
figured out what I was doing learning

123
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:56,610
the system and aspect of it building up

124
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:59,130
the network and then then they hated me

125
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:00,930
the their document talking about here's

126
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,479
the kind of techniques we new tools we

127
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:05,460
do and play around with it I did this

128
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:07,650
for another week or so and then they

129
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:10,289
started having having me work in tandem

130
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:12,539
with other co-workers doing pen test it

131
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:14,639
was all fun and dandy until the first

132
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,110
time they told me you know what you're

133
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,259
gonna be working on an engagement by

134
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:20,490
yourself well me and another new person

135
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:22,199
was gonna work on engagement together

136
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:27,690
that's great

137
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:29,880
get to show how awesome I am and well it

138
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:33,419
was great it was an external engagement

139
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,969
I decided to kick off in map scan on

140
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:38,669
their target space this was a Friday

141
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:40,289
like at four o'clock wasn't paying

142
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:45,448
attention keep in mind this was around

143
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:50,820
like 1999-2000 era so I kicked off the

144
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:52,590
scan we went home about 5:00 in the

145
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:56,969
morning the next morning I get a call

146
00:06:52,590 --> 00:07:01,650
from my boss he's asking me why are we

147
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:04,979
scanning X Y Z car manufacturer I don't

148
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:07,830
know why are we apparently my in map

149
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:10,409
scan was scanning a wrong octet

150
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:12,479
somewhere did not know why we ran into

151
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:14,070
the office stopped all the scans and

152
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,830
started doing a little triage trying to

153
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:18,960
figure out what had happened this is

154
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:21,900
purely due to me not understanding that

155
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:25,500
tools I was using because I was new and

156
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:28,349
all that well at this time in map had

157
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,820
this great capability of it wanted to

158
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:31,469
help you out if it

159
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,880
thought that you had an issue with your

160
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:35,490
command-line things of that nature to a

161
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,800
certain degree well this was a resort

162
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:42,150
result of the customer had given us a

163
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:44,940
massive long list of IP ranges ip's the

164
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:47,219
target and either it didn't have it or I

165
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,440
wasn't aware if it had the input list

166
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:52,200
feature at the time so is all in the

167
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,140
command line it was like 4,000 character

168
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:58,260
long command line and UNIX decided to

169
00:07:55,140 --> 00:08:02,039
truncate at some point through there and

170
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:06,180
it truncated that last octet to instead

171
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:08,580
of be like 237 dot whatever just 2.2 in

172
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,230
map sees this it says oh you left off

173
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:15,650
the rest of that let me fill that in for

174
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:21,690
you filled it in as a slash 24 for me

175
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:23,640
that is not my target so I mean stirrers

176
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:25,260
for these that was an easy one bitterly

177
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,710
doing thing wasn't being malicious just

178
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:30,719
doing a scan just so happens that like I

179
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,919
said turn-of-the-century there there was

180
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,360
actually a customer out there that was

181
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,520
actually monitoring if they were being

182
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,860
port scan for some reason great for them

183
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,510
but we got a call from them asking why

184
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:43,289
we were scanning them come to find out

185
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:45,720
this was the case talked to them in into

186
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:47,400
the story was the custom the auto

187
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,860
manufacturer caught back to us and said

188
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,750
we understand the mistake it was all an

189
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,500
accident by the way did you find

190
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:56,700
anything

191
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:58,410
well I know we weren't that far along in

192
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,600
the scanning but thank you for asking

193
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,339
but yeah so I think they ended up

194
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,230
contacting them later to figure out if

195
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,390
they wanted to have an engagement done

196
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,590
or something I'm not sure but yeah it's

197
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,990
just one of those things that I was very

198
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:12,510
new I thought I knew what was going on

199
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:14,880
and I still made a mistake because I eat

200
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,350
both things is I didn't understand the

201
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,900
tool and I didn't understand the

202
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,280
operating system as well as I did as to

203
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:23,640
the fact that it was going to truncate

204
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:25,500
it but yeah those kind of issues happen

205
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,939
more times than you want to admit not

206
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,610
necessarily that one but these kind of

207
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:32,540
just dumb little mistakes we all make

208
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:34,770
them I've made them a lot I know

209
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,870
speaking of not understanding at all

210
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:39,120
there was this other scenario oh by the

211
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:40,350
way the slides really have nothing to do

212
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,260
with what I'm talking about other then

213
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:46,920
it talks about failures and mistakes so

214
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,980
a while back there was a tool came out I

215
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,740
don't know a couple years back called

216
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:56,040
Cisco smart install tool yeah

217
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:58,890
smart install exploit tool siet great

218
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:02,939
tool love it worked very well you point

219
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:05,880
it at a Cisco device it connects in it

220
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:08,490
written it manipulates it to say allow

221
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,810
me to download your config things of

222
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,370
that nature there's a lot of other

223
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:14,420
features in there - you can have it

224
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:16,920
modified a new config delete a config

225
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:19,140
download a config test whether this tool

226
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,599
will work against a number of different

227
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,189
features in there well we were going to

228
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,630
be using this just to download the

229
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,030
config and see what was in there's

230
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:30,090
downloads the running config got on a

231
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:32,220
customer site we grabbed the tool we ran

232
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:34,710
it ran it against I don't know a good

233
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,470
half dozen into their core routers there

234
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:38,610
to download it just to see what they had

235
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,980
downloads it no problem we have the

236
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:44,700
running config in front of us we pull

237
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:49,350
out the passwords or the hashes crack

238
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:51,450
them I was good we go home sometime the

239
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:53,820
next week the customer calls us in a

240
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:57,000
panic saying what did you do to our

241
00:10:53,820 --> 00:11:04,530
routers what do you mean there configs

242
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:07,350
are missing we didn't do it well come to

243
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:09,600
find out well the thing is well he said

244
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,190
well I don't believe we did that but by

245
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,570
the way we do have copies of your old

246
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:14,550
running configs here if you'd like to

247
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:17,130
have those we provide that bag and

248
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:19,560
everybody is this grunt old but happy

249
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:22,560
and in further review we kept looking

250
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:25,469
into it the version of siet that we were

251
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,510
using had been reported as having a

252
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:30,000
serious flaw in it

253
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:32,220
in that when it would download the

254
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,610
running config it would delete that

255
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:37,620
running config this had been reported a

256
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:40,800
good couple weeks prior to that

257
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:42,600
engagement on their github page we

258
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,069
didn't go out and read that github page

259
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,470
we did not go and see if there was any

260
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:48,810
known flaws we didn't try to make sure

261
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:51,840
that the toy we were running was safe at

262
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:54,150
that point we assumed it was and because

263
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,970
of that we almost got in some rather

264
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:59,340
serious trouble because of that

265
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:01,200
it's one of those things that we take

266
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:03,390
for granted certain tools are gonna be

267
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,100
safe when we run them there's always

268
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,110
that possibility that something has

269
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,360
changed in the last since the last time

270
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:10,800
you ran it and now that something bad

271
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,570
has been introduced or somebody's

272
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,130
discovered some new flaw in it and

273
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,720
because that you should probably always

274
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:18,300
go out and make sure the tools that

275
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,920
you're running are safe make sure you

276
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,050
try them out in all different scenarios

277
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,890
in a lab something like that obviously

278
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:28,170
we didn't and I know as a general rule

279
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:30,090
not everybody does that anyway but this

280
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:33,180
is a case that it almost really bit me

281
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:35,480
hard but luckily we did have a copy of

282
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,479
the running

283
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:43,360
oh yeah we managed to break into a bank

284
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:46,179
and we break into a company see all kind

285
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,918
of findings and it be the wrong place so

286
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:49,059
we got out went to the right place still

287
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,279
broke in not a problem

288
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:53,158
it was happy there handed all the

289
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:55,480
information off to project managers and

290
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:56,710
I don't know if they ever actually

291
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,650
caught up that first company and got

292
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:03,419
them scheduled for a pin test or not but

293
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:03,419
I leave that up to them I don't remember

294
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:11,350
similar scenario go into a shared

295
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:13,899
facility there's a bank on this side of

296
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,969
critic mmm financial institution on that

297
00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:17,469
one side there's something over on the

298
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:19,840
left and right in the middle there was

299
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:22,419
some sort of engineering company the

300
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,299
geographic geology engineering all that

301
00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:27,850
well trying to sneak in trying to carry

302
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:30,580
a box pick a box standard technique walk

303
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:32,139
along act like a you're carrying

304
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:35,470
something to open the door for you I'm

305
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:37,710
not paying attention I just picked it up

306
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:39,640
walked in went up this staircase

307
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:42,460
following somebody walk right through

308
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:45,130
the door turn around walk be good ways

309
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:47,320
into the building into the room set it

310
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:49,320
down turn around this was not a

311
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:53,559
financial institution this was the

312
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:55,689
engineering office not the customer so

313
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:59,710
there again I just walked into the wrong

314
00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:02,169
place not a big issue turn say I'm sorry

315
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:04,090
walk back out next year we had the same

316
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:07,630
contract again different consultant did

317
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:09,039
it did the exact same thing he's like

318
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,870
you won't believe what happened to me I

319
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,360
was in Hong yeah I did that last year

320
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:15,899
all right how do we both do that same

321
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:19,870
stupid thing year after year but still

322
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:21,459
last one on the fiscal I locked myself

323
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:26,168
out of a building I just locked I broke

324
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:29,110
into so so spent the time scoping out a

325
00:20:26,169 --> 00:20:30,610
building is a big complex building we

326
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:32,590
get our way in multiple different

327
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:35,229
techniques ultimately but right now we

328
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:36,820
came in through like a ladder got into

329
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:38,200
the building we're in there we're

330
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,779
walking around we have our bag of tricks

331
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,880
with us we find a little communications

332
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:45,250
closet we go in there set our gear down

333
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,990
hook it up and right side of it there's

334
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,760
a door that goes out we assume it's a

335
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:50,080
smoker's door you go out smoke whatever

336
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,399
so me my call

337
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,110
where they were like all right yeah

338
00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:55,479
let's go and see what's out there okay

339
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:57,428
okay and so let's see if we can get back

340
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,429
in that way I open the door I walk out

341
00:20:57,429 --> 00:21:03,220
then I hear click and there's my

342
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:06,630
coworker stand beside me look at the

343
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:09,940
door there's no handle

344
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:11,710
yeah we're just shut herself outside of

345
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:14,470
the building we just broken into and now

346
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,760
we don't have her gear with us so we had

347
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:17,679
to find another way back into the

348
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,279
building go get her gear and continue

349
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,690
the engagement that was a fun one just

350
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:26,080
tell the guys back in the office but

351
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:28,090
luckily for us that particular location

352
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,178
we felt like six different ways into the

353
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:33,399
building without Arab getting detected

354
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:35,010
including walking into their credit

355
00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:37,629
union which was attached to the building

356
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,919
waving at the guard walking by open

357
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:43,320
another door and logging right into the

358
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:46,320
building but it was the weirdest thing

359
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,320
yes

360
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:56,860
no no no yeah that would be a fun one

361
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:59,710
but no I've never actually tripped a

362
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:03,939
fire alarm before but to my knowledge I

363
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:05,169
have not but yes so there's all kind of

364
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,080
stupid things like that that have

365
00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:11,289
happened over the years let's see here

366
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,510
what it's another fun one this is one

367
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:15,490
that happened I don't know many many

368
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:19,510
years ago I was working for a company

369
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:23,649
that had a tendency to sell eight-hour

370
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:25,690
webapp assessments yep eight-hour Webb

371
00:22:23,649 --> 00:22:28,000
assessments I don't know why they

372
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:30,340
decided to sell a tower web assessments

373
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,990
but they did and I was mean actually a

374
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:34,149
co-worker of mine who was not doing much

375
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:35,440
at the time we're tasked with doing that

376
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:37,840
engagement so we're sitting there all

377
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,179
day long we're hacking away and we found

378
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,760
what we think to be blind remote code

379
00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:44,799
execution so we're trying it we are like

380
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,389
we're pretty sure this is executing

381
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,639
because you could do like this like

382
00:22:46,389 --> 00:22:50,529
sleep commands so like that you can do

383
00:22:48,639 --> 00:22:51,519
things that take time on the backend it

384
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:53,769
would take the appropriate amount of

385
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:55,720
time but we didn't ever figure out how

386
00:22:53,769 --> 00:22:57,159
to get data back out of there nothing

387
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,649
was going right the screen we couldn't

388
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:01,659
tunnel command back out we'd been

389
00:22:59,649 --> 00:23:03,340
working on this all day long we had a

390
00:23:01,659 --> 00:23:05,650
very short break at lunch

391
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,240
a vending machine it was getting up like

392
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:09,220
six o'clock in the evening we're both

393
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,170
tired and we're sitting there scratching

394
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:14,410
our head like how in the world can we

395
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:16,900
get in here we had working external

396
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:19,360
chameleons external interface going in

397
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,740
where we get issue commands but we

398
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,209
couldn't see any the results we could

399
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:24,490
we're pretty sure we're executing

400
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:27,100
commands he's like so in quotes the

401
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:29,740
intern you keep him on me and the other

402
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,120
guys both seniors here in in walks the

403
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,310
intern he's like oh what's going on guys

404
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:37,120
and we tell the scenario we're both

405
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:40,030
tired we're both upset all this cranky

406
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,290
he's like well is it a Windows box yeah

407
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:43,480
we're pretty sure it's a Windows box on

408
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:45,100
the back end he goes well you know if

409
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,200
you enable the Windows Firewall

410
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,149
it has great logging and tells you why

411
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,390
it's blocking certain things or if it's

412
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:53,500
actually getting to it rock all right

413
00:23:51,390 --> 00:24:00,010
let you stream command start Windows

414
00:23:53,500 --> 00:24:01,600
Firewall no commands work anymore we

415
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:03,090
pack up we go home tell them they're

416
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,949
fine now

417
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:07,659
is one of those things that we were

418
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:12,370
tired we didn't give it a second thought

419
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:13,930
and there's another lesson learned if

420
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:19,959
you have a remote access from a Windows

421
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:21,400
box don't enable the firewall it should

422
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,930
have been enabled to begin with mind you

423
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,120
but still it's just one of those things

424
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:28,030
we're tired at that point soon as we hit

425
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:31,840
the enter key we're like yeah we're just

426
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:32,800
left up didn't we yeah I stopped we'll

427
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,770
check to see if we can still do you

428
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:41,639
think no no all right no that's it let's

429
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:44,860
go home it's fun dumb stuff what's that

430
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,540
no yeah we did tell them there was an

431
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,699
issue something happened during the

432
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,500
engagement we lost the connectivity to

433
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,330
it and went onward from there and they

434
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:55,270
were just like okay you we paid you for

435
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:57,520
eight hours done checkmark done yay they

436
00:24:55,270 --> 00:25:04,990
don't care that one didn't in particular

437
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:08,580
so another intern based one here we're

438
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:08,580
doing a social engineering exercise

439
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:13,360
customer gave us two lists of names like

440
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,410
here's a hundred names there's a hundred

441
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,750
names and what you do two different

442
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:17,170
exercises against them go and see what

443
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:20,050
you can do

444
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:22,060
you fishing exercise remote shell

445
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:26,409
whatever you want to do out of it so

446
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:28,389
we're gonna do fishing exercise I was

447
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:31,330
too busy to be worried about it honestly

448
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:33,310
so I'm like hey mr. intern you've been

449
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:35,500
doing a few social engineering fishing

450
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:36,010
exercises haven't you yeah all right

451
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,870
fine

452
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:41,230
here how about you go set this up for me

453
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:42,820
okay so when often did it I'm writing a

454
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:45,310
report or something not paying attention

455
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:46,629
he comes back to me it's all set up we

456
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,620
ready to go I'm like all right let's go

457
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:53,860
okay

458
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:56,199
CIND waitin waitin few minutes go by no

459
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:58,929
hits nothing coming back on the logs a

460
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:02,170
few minutes later we see like one hit

461
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:04,630
come back not much we wait a couple

462
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:06,580
hours we see like three hits come back

463
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:09,700
one that is not right we should see a

464
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:11,260
lot more than that what's going on we

465
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,300
let it play out a little bit finally we

466
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,950
stop it like okay that's enough for

467
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,300
round one we have another round we'll

468
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:18,580
look at it in a minute let's figure out

469
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:22,090
what's going on here and we start

470
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:24,070
looking into what was going on I did

471
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:26,500
tell the intern to go set up the email

472
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:28,899
set up the web server he did that

473
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:32,470
because he had done one the week prior

474
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:35,110
for a different customer and he used the

475
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:39,520
exact same one for this one same website

476
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:46,800
same email template wrong logos wrong

477
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:48,940
customer name wrong everything yeah so

478
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:52,240
yeah so we're like okay well fine fine

479
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:54,160
fine we'll fix that we'll fix that so we

480
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,960
go in and we tweak everything we change

481
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,440
it making sure it's all right it's all

482
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,290
good to go

483
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:01,000
hey okay intern are you sure you got it

484
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:03,250
all right let me see the website okay

485
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,530
okay that's all right let me see your

486
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:07,770
email okay that's right okay okay let's

487
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:12,240
go ahead and send it out we sent it out

488
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:16,379
nothing this time no hits

489
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,380
we forgot to start the web server

490
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:23,630
we still write the report all right

491
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:26,780
second round one group no hits

492
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:29,960
second group we got like five hits total

493
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:31,970
out of the hundred and what you should

494
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,770
be aware of here mr. customer is that

495
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:35,420
those five people clicked on the link

496
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:38,120
that had the wrong company name wrong

497
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:40,490
email wrong logos everything those guys

498
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,560
need to be taught a lesson off you know

499
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:44,180
we did do something like that like we

500
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,560
had to find the silver lining somewhere

501
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:47,690
in there so we did tweak a little bit

502
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:50,210
and say like look they see these

503
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:51,680
individual you had five individuals who

504
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,750
would click on the link provided in

505
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:56,660
choice a website that is obviously not

506
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:59,420
branded as yours and so forth so tried

507
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:01,130
to save a little face on there but yeah

508
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:04,610
that was just a bad ordeal all together

509
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:06,620
and I fully take it fall on that one for

510
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:08,270
delegating everything to the intern

511
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:15,830
even though I didn't make him buy me

512
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:20,450
lunch for F towards oh yeah this was a

513
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:22,639
fun one so external assessments doing

514
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:24,770
external scans come across some web apps

515
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,740
okay this has been for a while I don't

516
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:29,930
know medical firm legal firms something

517
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:32,000
like that can't remember offhand so

518
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:35,660
we're doing external scan we found some

519
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,960
web web cameras IP based cameras all

520
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:40,760
right do a little searching oh they this

521
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,380
is default credit so straat hey look we

522
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,500
get in we're sitting here we'd been

523
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:48,620
hacking away at the external computers

524
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:51,140
for a while and we're not long maybe an

525
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:53,209
hour so we're going after it going we

526
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:54,770
get up the web cameras we get into them

527
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:59,000
we start pinning them around looking at

528
00:28:54,770 --> 00:29:01,370
them that looks like a cafeteria okay

529
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,070
okay that looks like some sort of

530
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:06,520
classroom okay that was like a plague

531
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:09,470
this is a school

532
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:11,510
let's check the IDS again no no that's

533
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:13,190
what the customer gave us let's do who

534
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:15,410
is on it someone like that yeah now that

535
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:17,690
belongs to summer school district hey

536
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:20,390
mister customer what's going on here oh

537
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:25,010
we left off the one on that IP range

538
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:26,450
there thank you you can blame the

539
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:28,160
customer on that if you wish or you can

540
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:29,990
blame us for not validating the IP

541
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,260
ranges they gave us if you're doing a

542
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:33,200
neck

543
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:34,670
colonel one double check that the IPS

544
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:38,090
that you're entering into your command

545
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:39,590
are accurate to do a simple who is

546
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:41,840
something like that make sure it makes

547
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:43,909
sense load up the webpage that if

548
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,379
there's a way webpage won't load it up

549
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:47,540
make sure it looks like your customer

550
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:52,250
before you accidentally hack somebody

551
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:53,899
that doesn't want to be hacked now for a

552
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:55,940
case of web cameras with somebody who

553
00:29:53,900 --> 00:30:00,340
wanted to be Hank but we did something

554
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:05,890
wrong with it so this was a university

555
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:08,120
large school external find a web camera

556
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:13,280
just through the port scans all that

557
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:16,250
version default credentials login it's

558
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:18,860
looking at some parking lot something

559
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:21,260
like that out the window we notice it

560
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:23,090
has pan and tilt options and zoom we

561
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,660
start pinning around so you Pan it to

562
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:25,040
the left

563
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:27,080
Hey look there's a whiteboard and it

564
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:29,270
zooms back to the home front that's kind

565
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,770
of weird we pan it across and look then

566
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:33,530
I look there's a disconnect goes back to

567
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:35,510
home we do this several times trying to

568
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:37,610
figure out what's going on because every

569
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:41,000
time we pin it away it goes right back

570
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:42,500
to where it was so we look it up we do

571
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,060
Google or whatever look it up does this

572
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,830
have like an auto home feature that

573
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:47,960
we're not aware of no it doesn't have

574
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:51,949
that so we wait a little while wait

575
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:53,210
until like lunch time we're eating our

576
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:55,190
lunch there and when you try it we pan

577
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:57,470
over this time it doesn't auto home but

578
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:59,180
we see a whiteboard there we zoom in we

579
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:01,790
see what will suck passwords and IP

580
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:04,010
addresses and email addresses and all

581
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:05,690
kind of network diagrams all kind of

582
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:08,060
awesome stuff we go down to the desk

583
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:10,220
same sort of stuff letterheads and

584
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:12,139
sensitive information then finally it

585
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:17,360
pans back home and there's somebody

586
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:18,980
looking in it right disconnect we call

587
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,320
up the point of contact later on Hey

588
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:23,480
yeah we found this web camera it was

589
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,740
doing this he goes oh yeah I know the

590
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:27,230
one you're talking about that that's the

591
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:28,880
one that has a live feed to our website

592
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:33,530
to her front page of our website showing

593
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:37,310
the weather on campus um whose office is

594
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:39,080
that in oh that's a head of IT do you

595
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:40,429
think head of IT has this of information

596
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:44,340
on his whiteboard in his desk

597
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:50,490
yeah oh you might want to change those

598
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:53,189
s words sorry so if you see a web camera

599
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:56,159
on the internet odds are it's probably

600
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:58,260
got a live feed to somewhere and if that

601
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,760
live feed is to somewhere that a lot of

602
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,860
people see on a home page of some

603
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,900
website you probably don't want to be

604
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:06,658
showing sensitive information across

605
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:09,000
that web feed just saying just kind of

606
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:11,640
one of those funny things hey they were

607
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,990
happy that we found it and that it was

608
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,340
in his room so I think they ended up

609
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:19,289
moving that camera somewhere else

610
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:21,120
ultimately but yeah oh by the way the

611
00:32:19,289 --> 00:32:22,408
auto home was he was sitting in the

612
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:29,520
office and every time he's always like

613
00:32:22,409 --> 00:32:39,860
what's gone just moving it back so so I

614
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:42,360
know what is that what time is it so

615
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:44,580
we'll go ahead and go through these last

616
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,709
few and then open it up for just

617
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:48,330
back-and-forth dialogue I got plenty of

618
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:51,149
other stories these are just the ones

619
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:53,250
that queued up for the talk I got plenty

620
00:32:51,149 --> 00:32:55,199
others I'll ask for any input from you

621
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:57,059
always to other stories as well but as

622
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,760
we're going through here the main things

623
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:02,970
over my career that will save you from

624
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:06,720
making horrible embarrassing possibly

625
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:09,559
costing your job experience is mistakes

626
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,149
is when somebody gives you something or

627
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:16,649
you copy something from a file whatever

628
00:33:12,149 --> 00:33:19,168
double-check it do a in head check some

629
00:33:16,649 --> 00:33:21,899
sort of thing like does that IP copy

630
00:33:19,169 --> 00:33:23,610
over here did I drop off a digit off of

631
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:27,059
it when I copied it over did the

632
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:29,158
customer give me a right IP of what he

633
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:30,990
provided me does that it just go through

634
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:34,320
double-check everything looks right make

635
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:36,029
sure there and this is a general rule

636
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,730
for life I guess is if something doesn't

637
00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:40,350
feel right it probably isn't it's

638
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:43,440
probably it in real life is probably

639
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:45,120
scam in pentesting it's just you've

640
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,740
probably made a mistake somewhere go

641
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:50,520
back figure out what you did before it

642
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:53,520
cost you something more serious never

643
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:56,490
rely on just one access vector if

644
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:58,120
there's two of you in a building and one

645
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:59,950
of you walks out a lot door

646
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:04,239
don't have the other one walk out as

647
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:07,510
well it's painful if you have remote

648
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,859
access to a system before you do

649
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:11,560
something that may jeopardize that

650
00:34:08,859 --> 00:34:13,750
access have a secondary access something

651
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,730
that will call out later reset whatever

652
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:16,869
always have a second method before you

653
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:20,530
do something jeopardize your first

654
00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:22,510
method basically and if you're using

655
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:25,659
some tool that you just downloaded off

656
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:28,179
the internet or off of what have you

657
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:28,839
without testing it out it's on you I'm

658
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:30,310
sorry

659
00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:33,460
understand the tool you're using

660
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:35,020
understand what it does if it has source

661
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:36,520
code try to read over it if it's

662
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:39,040
something short that's easy something

663
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:40,540
longer see if other people have done

664
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,810
reviews of it see what they've written

665
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:44,949
up see if it has a Rotter page it's not

666
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:46,899
like that where you can go and see what

667
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:48,489
other issues if people have found with

668
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:51,250
it issue page something like that and

669
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:52,868
just try to get a feel for it before you

670
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:59,320
use it live on a customer and delete all

671
00:34:52,869 --> 00:35:03,910
their configs but so it's one of those

672
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:06,160
now for the moral of the story it's okay

673
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:08,500
to make mistakes we all make mistakes

674
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,670
as you can just see that tip of the

675
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,530
iceberg with what I've been talking

676
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:14,080
about here I've made plenty over my

677
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:16,270
career and I'm still doing my job so I

678
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:18,040
haven't been fired I haven't lost my job

679
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:20,770
because of these kind of mistakes it

680
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:22,300
just comes with the territory most

681
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:23,920
people don't like to share that they've

682
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,930
made a mistakes I thought all that but

683
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,150
you need to understand that other people

684
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:30,970
do make mistakes as well it's part of

685
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:33,040
learning somebody once told me that you

686
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:34,689
learn more from making mistakes than you

687
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:38,349
do from mate from having a success

688
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:42,339
because there you only learn that one

689
00:35:38,349 --> 00:35:46,060
aspect of it so but yeah it's get out

690
00:35:42,339 --> 00:35:48,730
there try something if you fail fine you

691
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,420
can usually recover learn from your

692
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,760
mistake

693
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:53,650
move forward if it's something that you

694
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,960
think others can learn from to get up on

695
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:58,750
stage talk about it let other people

696
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:01,000
have a good laugh at you it's just one

697
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:03,730
of those things it's part of your career

698
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,310
part of your life go out tries things

699
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:09,099
and learn from it hopefully you don't

700
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:11,529
make the same mistake twice that's sort

701
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:15,850
of key there so

702
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:17,890
that's like you've been more elegant

703
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:20,770
about it that's the gist of the story is

704
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:24,430
it's okay to make mistakes long as you

705
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:28,210
learn from them so with that going on

706
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:29,799
I'll have any questions I'm open for

707
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:34,060
additional stories if people have

708
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:44,500
requests for certain stories so yes

709
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:46,810
somebody over there oh yeah no no no no

710
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:49,780
no never blindly trust an intern on

711
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:51,250
anything they will stab you in the back

712
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:54,070
now they will cost you your job

713
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:56,290
no so if anybody has any other questions

714
