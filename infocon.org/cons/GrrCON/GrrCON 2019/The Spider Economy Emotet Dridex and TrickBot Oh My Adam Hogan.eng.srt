1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:05,220
they conduct offensive cyber operations

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,899
probably seen him in the news from when

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,550
they went after the DNC a same year they

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,070
went after the German elections you're

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,120
after the Dutch ministries as well as

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,280
the International Association of

7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,710
Athletics Federations that you're after

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,910
the International Olympic Committee and

9
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:24,869
that's actually kind of interesting if

10
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:28,529
you're if you're jaded on the InfoSec

11
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:33,390
headlines or what a PT is is willing to

12
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:36,480
do unplug from InfoSec go watch a

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:41,430
Netflix documentary called Icarus which

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,480
is actually about cycling this guy

15
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,500
decided he was going to do the Tour de

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,419
France one year and then get really

17
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,280
doped up on steroids and do it a second

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,570
time and see what was different right so

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,030
there's kind of like his experiment he's

20
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,820
gonna do that now to do that you got to

21
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,260
find some people with dope and hands up

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,449
meeting this this Russian fella and

23
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,809
befriends him and along the way finds

24
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:07,970
out just from talking this guy how much

25
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:11,429
effort and resources they put into

26
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:13,229
fooling the test first steroids for

27
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,960
breaking in the labs to switch samples

28
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:18,090
right like a mission impossible level

29
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,089
stuff for the hopes of influencing the

30
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,850
Olympics and the general idea that that

31
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,100
promotes your your national presence and

32
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,390
I don't I don't know that maybe they

33
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,750
don't have Netflix in Russia they think

34
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,310
people still watch TV but that's how

35
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,770
much they were willing to put into just

36
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,869
the Olympics right so this is an

37
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,539
organization that that's taking their

38
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:42,570
role and their directives really very

39
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:46,170
seriously now back in 2014 we really

40
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,789
started tracking this group one of the

41
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,170
malware implants they're using had this

42
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,329
unusual string it's just this little

43
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:55,979
variable name but the string was so

44
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:57,539
fizzy now it doesn't mean anything

45
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,130
right it's just this variable it's in

46
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,780
the code you kind of wonder like where

47
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,030
that came from because it sits there

48
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,399
like as a word somebody was thinking

49
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:11,119
about it but anyway how did fancy Barry

50
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,119
get their name well top pop song in 2014

51
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:23,040
I'm so fancy by Iggy Azalea so so fancy

52
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:26,700
kind of so fizzy so fancy pretty clothes

53
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,870
all right so fancy Barry was born and if

54
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,239
you see like on our marketing and

55
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,080
everything well we'll put him up there

56
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:36,060
right so kind of mock the post the

57
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:39,300
tattoo is different but tattoo on fancy

58
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,790
bear says aquarium which is actually the

59
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,050
nickname for the gr use office here they

60
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:47,100
call it the aquarium because there's so

61
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:50,550
many windows that's a lot of windows by

62
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,840
you know Soviet standards so they call

63
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,910
it the aquarium so that's how we got our

64
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,470
name scheme right now what I also want

65
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,329
to talk about is a bit how more

66
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,040
sophisticated these these threat actors

67
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,560
are and you hear that all the time about

68
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,179
the nation-state actors right the

69
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,380
governments are dumping money and they

70
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,870
have all these resources or whatever

71
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,400
what I'd like to talk about instead is

72
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,920
just how sophisticated some of these

73
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,690
spiders are who do not have a government

74
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,488
backing them who do not have all the

75
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,660
resources in the world but our operating

76
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:19,019
what appear to be incredibly

77
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,790
sophisticated businesses these are

78
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:23,130
businesses they operate an economy and

79
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,709
can call it a black market perhaps a

80
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:27,150
gray market depending on legislation of

81
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:29,450
whatever particular country we're

82
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:32,880
standing in as we're talking about this

83
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:34,410
but they do operate an economy the

84
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,239
framework I'll sort of suggest for this

85
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,840
is to look at the evolution of the

86
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,600
supply chain

87
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,980
my general thesis is that we're not

88
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,239
taking some of these threat actors

89
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,910
seriously enough that they're far more

90
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,420
sophisticated than people manage and

91
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:50,220
that this idea that these hackers are

92
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,350
you know a guy in a basement somewhere

93
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:55,140
plugging away has to die a horrible

94
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:57,570
fiery death and that a number of these

95
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:01,649
threat actors are so sophisticated and

96
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:02,940
what's so successful so wealthy at this

97
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,750
point that we should be taking them a

98
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:09,680
lot more seriously as a model consider

99
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:13,590
our supply chain developed across the

100
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:17,329
traditional economy traditionally trade

101
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:20,190
routes were just like Marco Polo here

102
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:21,750
trading spices you know across the world

103
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,750
right it's a handful of goods like

104
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,200
spices that are very small very easy to

105
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,030
package

106
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,729
very easy jurors and valuable enough

107
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,979
that it's worth going thousands of miles

108
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:33,300
there weren't a lot of goods that fit

109
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,810
that at the time so you have the Silk

110
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,160
Road

111
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:37,340
you have spice routes and that's a bad

112
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,340
black

113
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:21,388
so we're mass-producing we're making

114
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,790
this thing and this thing only and then

115
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:25,710
hey you like it or you don't

116
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,060
don't care I'm so there aren't

117
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:29,729
individual requirements everything's

118
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:34,980
kind of mass-produced for a sort of

119
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:37,040
median or average consumer I'll suggest

120
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:40,620
then that this is where we really see

121
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:43,200
what we have labeled commodity malware a

122
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:47,220
time a term sometimes thrown out there

123
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:50,159
somewhat derisively as it's less

124
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:52,020
concerning malware and the idea that

125
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,850
this was built like the Model T for

126
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,469
anyone right I'm not gonna customize the

127
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,880
color this malware I'm gonna build it

128
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,370
for everyone throw it out there and see

129
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:04,469
what happens see who gets infected on a

130
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:07,070
very mass scale now after the war we saw

131
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:09,870
a whole lot more advancement in

132
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,310
traditional supply chain development and

133
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,870
it was driven almost entirely with

134
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,850
what's called containerization which is

135
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,530
whatever goods we have we're going to

136
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,570
ship in the exact same size container

137
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:20,460
that container is now what we build

138
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,810
boats for to work around that's what

139
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,599
goes in the back of a semi-truck that's

140
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:25,950
what goes on a railcar so that we can

141
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,500
ship whatever goods you want now you

142
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:29,580
compare that to like the sailing ship I

143
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,780
had up there before from the 18th

144
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,950
century which is okay your shipping

145
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,200
chair is great throw them in the hole

146
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:36,990
you're shipping eggs great throw them in

147
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,520
the hold and we'll just kind of hope the

148
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:41,340
boat doesn't rock enough and break

149
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,650
everything a container sort of built

150
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,109
that look everything goes on one box

151
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:48,479
we're standardizing on this way and now

152
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:50,820
we can put anything in it so you can

153
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,340
ship a very specialized individual good

154
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,200
across the world and the shipping

155
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:57,239
company doesn't have to cater to your

156
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,159
good to have to container to this one

157
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,110
steel box and it's gonna be easier to

158
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,990
ship it's gonna be more secure there's

159
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:06,060
gonna be less theft the containers in

160
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:09,600
theory I mean there's still some for

161
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:12,510
sure but those ports that are able to

162
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:15,450
move in the containerization are also

163
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:16,770
the economic miracles of our time if you

164
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:19,050
look at Hong Kong if you look at

165
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:21,719
Singapore we're talking about building

166
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:23,970
on ports getting on board with this and

167
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,010
lifting you know millions of people out

168
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:29,720
of abject poverty because this is such

169
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:31,800
an advancement in the economy overall

170
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,200
well suggested that we're seeing the

171
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,520
same development now in malware or the

172
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,440
malware supply chain has got to the

173
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,460
point where where we can now specialize

174
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,540
the point where there is container

175
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:44,580
malware and now it can worry about what

176
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:47,760
it's going to deliver inside of that

177
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:51,690
container later on so let's talk about

178
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:52,650
mummies spider mummy spider is there

179
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,390
another threat actor we're tracking

180
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:57,150
again in it for the profit for their a

181
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:59,849
spider they're active operations again

182
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:01,469
been going since about 2014

183
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:03,030
they are absolutely operating out of

184
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,350
Eastern Europe somewhere in the Russian

185
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:08,000
Federation to really know the location

186
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:08,000
but somewhere in that part of the world

187
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:16,380
and their operation is really well going

188
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:20,070
far back at least it starts as a banking

189
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:21,330
Trojan that's how it started at least so

190
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,169
they've got this banking charge and

191
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,580
they'll get it out there

192
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:25,560
once the malware is on your system you

193
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,479
go to your banking website it sees that

194
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,280
starts recording everything records your

195
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,230
banking site records your username your

196
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,030
password now they've got a username and

197
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:34,620
password to get into your bank account

198
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:36,478
and now we can start like great now

199
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,830
let's start on on spending your money or

200
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,490
getting your money out of your bank

201
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:44,850
account into mine problem there it's

202
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:46,890
difficult it's a lot of work alright

203
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:50,550
first I got to get your banking password

204
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:51,810
and login to your bank what can we do to

205
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,069
automate that right they want out of

206
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:54,420
that that's a lot of moving parts and

207
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,190
let's not forget that about the same

208
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,410
time we also saw a tremendous increase

209
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:00,180
in sophistication in financial companies

210
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,670
and their ability to identify and

211
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:05,010
respond to these to these kinds of

212
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:07,229
problems as well so it was getting more

213
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:08,850
difficult so even if you got a banking

214
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:12,089
password it's not well all right what do

215
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:14,070
I do with this so instead we're actually

216
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:17,130
snout is Mommy's player is focusing

217
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:20,190
entirely on land expand and lease they

218
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:21,930
will get on to this system they want to

219
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,390
propagate they want to move laterally

220
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:26,400
they want their Trojan on as many

221
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,660
systems as possible but then once it's

222
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,000
there instead of going after your

223
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,370
banking password they will lease out the

224
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,170
ability to distribute other pieces of

225
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:40,010
malware so we'd see them right the

226
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:42,660
Imhotep banking Trojan went out and then

227
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,000
they operate for a while and then they'd

228
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,069
uh

229
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,570
they take a break from like three to 12

230
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:51,130
months they just disappear for a while

231
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:53,260
but now even Tet is just this stage one

232
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:55,630
downloader and they're now leasing to

233
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,340
their customers so they'll drop other

234
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,510
exploit kits or malware based on the

235
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,840
customer requirements and then also

236
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:04,300
based on where in the world they are so

237
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,830
they can actually lease out the entire

238
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,390
network to more than one person in time

239
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:09,700
like okay you want to distribute coin

240
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:11,770
miners across Europe you want banking

241
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,180
Trojans in the u.s. great I can actually

242
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:15,130
lease it out to both you at the same

243
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,569
time and then as soon as a motet

244
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:18,070
installs a check to see where in the

245
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:20,140
world it is and then we'll actually

246
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:24,100
download the appropriate payload based

247
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:26,890
on that information what they take

248
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,330
breaks summer vacation always take the

249
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:31,420
holidays off you spend time with your

250
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:32,860
family right criminals too it's really

251
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:35,140
important for them they'll take the

252
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,360
holiday break off and in fact if you see

253
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,920
them our calendar some of the marketing

254
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,770
swag craft strike puts off we always

255
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:45,189
mark off the Orthodox Christmas season

256
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:47,350
as well cuz Imhotep will know they're

257
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:49,050
taking it off

258
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:51,190
they won't be operating during that time

259
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:54,130
it's a prediction worth making based on

260
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:58,089
the last you know however many years cuz

261
00:10:54,130 --> 00:11:00,490
ever needs a little R&R even criminals

262
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:02,890
right but their breaks are actually

263
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,210
getting shorter I mean would Lily seem

264
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,920
though I think that it take up to like a

265
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:07,830
nearly a year in the past but now

266
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:12,819
they've got a lot more demanding

267
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:16,150
customers and of course Emmett is the

268
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:18,130
most notorious tool at this point and

269
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:20,560
the nematodes also by the way how they

270
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:23,350
got their name so if you remember the

271
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,469
mummy with Brendan Fraser the bad guy

272
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:28,210
here was Imhotep but he's all mummified

273
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,470
and gross and kind of mumbled his name

274
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:32,740
and it sounded a lot like you know Ted

275
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:34,780
so his mommy spider for you at a hollow

276
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:37,690
or view are these days starting 2014 is

277
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:39,490
certainly taken private in 2015 and are

278
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:40,600
now downloading all this other types of

279
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,670
malware some of the most interesting

280
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,140
things to started tracking is what are

281
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,550
the payloads that email tests

282
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,850
distributing and we've seen that go a

283
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:52,300
Drydocks bulk bot trick bots quick bot

284
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:53,920
gozi and a number of others and this is

285
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,959
a bit of a surprise if you think of the

286
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,829
underground economy i think it would be

287
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:59,109
a natural

288
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:02,620
that these different exploit kits would

289
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:04,270
actually be competitors right aren't

290
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,070
they competing for the same desktops I

291
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:08,230
want to infect these systems I want my

292
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:11,620
banking Trojan out there and instead we

293
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:13,300
see them working together they're able

294
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,070
to identify certain niches like oh you

295
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,339
want to get in these types of systems

296
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:20,260
great I'll download your payload and

297
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:21,340
sometimes the reverse as well like we've

298
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,080
absolutely seen like we've seen trick

299
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:26,560
bots download a motet and you motet

300
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:30,370
download trick bot dana bot will

301
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,900
download anybody their map is incredible

302
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,070
really throws off my stats based on the

303
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:39,370
number of different payloads that one

304
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:41,080
downloads right so hold on all these

305
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,910
different payloads are involved they

306
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,980
have different customers right the dry

307
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:48,040
Dex botnet we track from from index

308
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:50,830
spider oh is has worked with Imhotep so

309
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:53,589
as Boat bot we track his lunar spider so

310
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:57,040
is a trick bot we track his wizard

311
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:59,230
spider um they have customers all right

312
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,390
this isn't this isn't a single person in

313
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:03,190
the basement they have actual business

314
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,840
relationships they have actually some

315
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,570
these exploits have exploit kits have

316
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:11,380
customer service if you ever get a

317
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:15,490
chance and you have let's say the legal

318
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:18,400
protection you might need to buy an

319
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:20,650
exploit kit some of them will offer a

320
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,360
skype service and call them up be like

321
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,829
hey I'm having trouble Dawson these

322
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,690
people and like look let me help you out

323
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:28,510
walk you right through that right this

324
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:30,820
is they're very friendly if you speak

325
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:33,310
the language I don't didn't wasn't a

326
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,600
long call but a number of them are very

327
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,069
very helpful if you need to work with

328
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,420
this though they'll take care of their

329
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,860
customers although their customer list

330
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,449
will get shorter and shorter the longer

331
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:44,830
they're around they will cultivate that

332
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:46,450
list if you are in a black market maybe

333
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:48,520
you have to advertise but it's not

334
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:51,550
exactly something you want to do right

335
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,960
if you're in an illegal business so

336
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:54,670
they'll start out advertising and you'll

337
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,040
see the proclivities for advertising

338
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:58,000
actually taper off as a particular

339
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,560
threat actor gets more and more

340
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,850
successful because it's kind of get to a

341
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,920
point where you sort of has a customer

342
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:04,120
list and then like I'll talk to them

343
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,740
instead of just putting up a billboard

344
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,680
down the streets like do you need crime

345
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:10,199
like that's not always the best way to

346
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,519
operate in a black marker

347
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:14,469
they've got these customers so their

348
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:16,959
model now is to hire them through they

349
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,369
have this trusted user base that they

350
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,738
can rely on so a fairly sophisticated

351
00:14:18,369 --> 00:14:21,879
operation but also we start to map it

352
00:14:20,739 --> 00:14:24,040
out as far as who they're talking to

353
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:25,959
fairly complicated alright they're

354
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,779
downloading all these different payloads

355
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:31,419
and vice versa so they can monetize that

356
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:33,129
by charging yell per day per download

357
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:36,730
depending on how specific your

358
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:38,230
requirements are recently certainly

359
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:40,749
operating if you take them out it sort

360
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:42,459
of collapses and the economy is you know

361
00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:45,999
everyone has to do a lot more legwork to

362
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:46,839
get out there but threat intelligence is

363
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:48,100
really important because now we can

364
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:49,299
start to keep track of what they're

365
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,669
doing and what we're going to see as a

366
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:55,358
part of it also that we also need to

367
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:57,129
know where malware comes from now take

368
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:58,929
wizard spider distribute trick bot

369
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:01,089
but beyond trick bot and sort of this

370
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:04,540
generic botnet that we want to get

371
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:05,859
everywhere mmm this is from hybrid

372
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,809
analysis you want to play with it but

373
00:15:05,859 --> 00:15:09,639
aside from the i/o seeds and things we

374
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:12,069
can learn the important bit is if you

375
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:13,419
track the activity and you track it long

376
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:15,910
enough you'll see some reconnaissance

377
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:18,009
and this is an important deviation to

378
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:20,289
find someone who's really trying to

379
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:21,970
monetize their malware this is probably

380
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:24,189
the difference you will see to operate

381
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:28,109
from like is this commodity or is this

382
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:28,108
have the potential to be targeted

383
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:32,649
because once you start to see them poke

384
00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:34,809
around I hope you config that config

385
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:35,949
that view all of you all especially if

386
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,269
you're on the domain you'll start to see

387
00:15:35,949 --> 00:15:38,589
these commands come from what you

388
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,850
sometimes think of as come on email or

389
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:40,509
it's trick bot trick bot infects

390
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,129
everybody

391
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:43,660
well they do want to infect everybody

392
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:45,730
they don't always want to deliver the

393
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:47,108
same payload they don't always want to

394
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,999
treat the endpoint the same they may

395
00:15:47,109 --> 00:15:50,529
want to get on all the endpoints and we

396
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:52,629
may because of that think of them as

397
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:55,239
commodity malware that would be a

398
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:57,789
mistake because once they're out there

399
00:15:55,239 --> 00:16:00,999
they will try and figure out what system

400
00:15:57,789 --> 00:16:02,919
they're on and how valuable that system

401
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:07,359
is and that will determine what happens

402
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:08,980
next right Oh what's my IP address you

403
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:11,379
know you'll see a fire off one of one of

404
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,789
these at random which is good for threat

405
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:13,929
hunting if you can pair down like why

406
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:15,789
would you see this legitimate u n--

407
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:17,350
environment there may be a legitimate

408
00:16:15,789 --> 00:16:18,189
reason to go this there probably are but

409
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:20,009
you could probably figure them out

410
00:16:18,189 --> 00:16:22,089
enumerate them and filter them out right

411
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:22,819
because this kind of malware that has

412
00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:24,589
the potential

413
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:25,728
the moving the targeted territory it

414
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:27,139
wants to figure out where in the world

415
00:16:25,729 --> 00:16:30,979
it is right I mentioned emote it has a

416
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:32,600
special downloader depending and then

417
00:16:30,979 --> 00:16:35,709
trying to figure out what kind of system

418
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:38,660
it is right yeah yeah yeah

419
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:40,399
because wizards fighter not only

420
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:45,410
produces trick bot they also produce the

421
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:47,389
ryuk ransomware but not everybody gets

422
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:48,259
riot grant somewhere that's where the

423
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:49,910
reconnaissance comes in the

424
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:51,619
reconnaissance happens they figure out

425
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:55,039
if it looks like a valuable target and

426
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:56,179
if so then they deliver riot if they

427
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,319
poke around the system it doesn't look

428
00:16:56,179 --> 00:16:59,119
that interesting then you get something

429
00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:00,829
else maybe a banking Trojan maybe a coin

430
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:02,149
miner depending on what's being rented

431
00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:04,339
out at that particular time

432
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:05,869
riot gets out there because it is

433
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:08,299
targeted ransomware the initial threat

434
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:10,758
vector might not be trick bot emote at

435
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:12,199
those might not be targeted it's after

436
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:14,959
they do the reconnaissance that they'll

437
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:16,370
decide to load targeted ransomware now

438
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,689
why this is actually inherently

439
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,628
predictable I've been predicting this

440
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:23,029
would happen for three or four years I

441
00:17:19,628 --> 00:17:24,948
probably actually thanks Adrian that's

442
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:27,980
the only reason I can prove it is

443
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:29,889
because these videos but it's not some

444
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,240
genius insight it's basic economics

445
00:17:29,889 --> 00:17:33,678
price discrimination is one of the first

446
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,139
strategies of business can gauge in to

447
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,389
try and increase their profitability it

448
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:40,428
sounds fancy but here are some examples

449
00:17:38,389 --> 00:17:42,559
I'm sure you've heard of senior discount

450
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:44,090
and the elderly a little less willing to

451
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,289
pay and you don't want to price them out

452
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:49,158
of the market so you offer them a lower

453
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:51,169
price seniors and students student

454
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:54,710
discount is a fairly common pricing

455
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:56,840
strategy as well there's also a pricing

456
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:58,220
strategy called the pink tax where the

457
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,500
exact same good will be put in a pink

458
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:06,049
box and sold for slightly more so that

459
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:08,269
if you need the pink stool softener it's

460
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:11,149
literally a dollar more exact same pill

461
00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:13,399
but you know for her a nun dollar extra

462
00:18:11,149 --> 00:18:15,168
why not

463
00:18:13,399 --> 00:18:16,549
coupons again help to identify a

464
00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:19,159
different segment of the market was only

465
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:21,200
to spend time cutting out coupons so we

466
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:23,480
can simply give them a lower price so

467
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,710
there are a lot of potential customers

468
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,480
out there and some of them are willing

469
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:29,029
to pay more than others if you give

470
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,320
everyone the same flat price that's just

471
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:32,299
a little bit of information to work with

472
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:36,179
you'd like to find the people who are

473
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:38,310
willing to pay more and charge them more

474
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,900
so simple principle some people are

475
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:41,970
willing to pay more than others so if

476
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,530
you're distributing ransomware who is

477
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:46,430
going to pay a higher ransom my

478
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:51,899
grandmother to get her photos back or a

479
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:54,090
hospital to get their records back that

480
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,650
one's pretty obvious so if you have a

481
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:59,340
monetization strategy that allows you to

482
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:01,440
figure out which is which you want to

483
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,760
figure that out and if I can do that if

484
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,220
I can do their reconnaissance find out

485
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,170
this is a hospital well they're getting

486
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,430
ransomware and grandma can have a quayne

487
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,690
minor or whatever is gonna hang out

488
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:13,500
there cuz I don't think she's going to

489
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:14,730
give me some bitcoins all right and

490
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,010
that's exactly what they do there's

491
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:18,300
their ransom I love it when they include

492
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:20,280
the Bitcoin wallet and then you can look

493
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,320
it up and see how much they're actually

494
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,780
pulling in and in this case for ryuk

495
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:28,129
about 3.7 million dollars with a Bitcoin

496
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:30,780
in five months that they were operating

497
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:33,600
and if that's crazy I'm about out of

498
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:37,290
time I am Lorde to jump ahead to the

499
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:40,100
absolute funniest one of those pinchy

500
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:44,670
spider distribute egg and crab malware

501
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:46,439
crabs pinch right that's the name they

502
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,910
published a retirement notice it

503
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,210
literally starts off all good things

504
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:52,170
must come doing it they're criminals and

505
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:54,780
they needed ever know that they're

506
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:56,370
taking some time off and announced their

507
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,840
retirement is a part of that they

508
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,189
announced that they had made a hundred

509
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,199
and fifty million dollars for themselves

510
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:02,760
and two billion for their affiliate

511
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,680
partners there's at least three things

512
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,030
ridiculous with that sentence and I love

513
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,680

514
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:11,670

515
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:14,460
have wrote that 150 million dollars is a

516
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:18,660
lot and to billions even more and by the

517
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:20,280
way they have affiliate partners this

518

sophisticated threat model we're seeing

sophisticated threat actors right and I

541

think this one quart of embodies men

542

even if they are retired I don't know if

543
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,730
I believe them if they retired but

544
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,930
nonetheless we have to take them more

545
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:20,140
