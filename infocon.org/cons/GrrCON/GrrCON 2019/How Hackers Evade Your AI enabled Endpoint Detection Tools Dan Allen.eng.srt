1
00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:26,519
okay good afternoon awesome so you guys

2
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,019
are awake cool otherwise I mean we could

3
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,070
flood you with more coffee or something

4
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:32,430
all right

5
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:36,180
so couple housekeeping things first you

6
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:38,579
are in ballroom see that is the anything

7
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,410
track if that's not where you want to be

8
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,989
run now because we're locking those

9
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,959
doors in ten seconds

10
00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:47,879
okay maybe not second thing I wish I

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,430
didn't have to say this but I always do

12
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,019
cell phones silent turn them off do

13
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,329
something so that I don't have to come

14
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,539
out there if I hear your cell phone and

15
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,620
you know start making use of the boots I

16
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:05,099
decided to wear today

17
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:07,520
and then finally pay attention enjoy we

18
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:11,419
are going to be talking all about

19
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,460
evasion techniques for AI powered

20
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:16,560
malware endpoint protections you get the

21
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,330
idea we hear it all the time lots of

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,040
folks over in that vendor hall talking

23
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:23,009
about it so our next speaker is gonna

24
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,409
tell you all about how attackers are

25
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,240
getting around it so you've heard enough

26
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:34,670
for me it's time to introduce our

27
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:37,490
speaker here he is Dan Allen thank you

28
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:39,620
so I know it's 4:30 so second to last

29
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,479
session of the day you guys probably

30
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:44,570
have a little bit of PowerPoint fatigue

31
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:46,369
at this point so I promise you the 62

32
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:48,949
slides that I have here I'm gonna do my

33
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:51,890
best to get through them the 25 minutes

34
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:53,360
as fast as I as fast as I can now and

35
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:56,000
all seriously I think I got like five or

36
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,890
six slides I'm gonna share with you and

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,170
then what I'm actually gonna do is do a

38
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,820
live demonstration demo gods be willing

39
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,070
to show you some new cool technology

40
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,690
that we've been developing and hopefully

41
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:08,478
get you thinking about you know

42
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:12,560
different ways that you can go about

43
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:16,430
protecting your environment so first you

44
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,080
might notice that in the schedule it

45
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,480
says I work for bromium how many people

46
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,190
here have heard bromium before endpoint

47
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,709
security software company leveraging

48
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:26,900
virtualization in order to provide

49
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:27,830
enhanced security so I'm happy to

50
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,630
announce our company was actually

51
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:33,880
acquired by HP last month

52
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:36,170
so I'm now Dan Allen working for HP

53
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,430
hopefully I won't get in trouble due the

54
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,369
fact that I've still got a Lenovo laptop

55
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:42,260
sitting up here on the on the podium at

56
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:45,829
some point will we'll get that swapped

57
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:49,250
out but that's just on on the to do list

58
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:51,980
for now so I'm VP of customer success at

59
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,570
at bromium and now at HP where we're

60
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,970
going to be continuing and I'm actually

61
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:57,980
excited to be a part of HP because the

62
00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:00,380
bromium we focused on using

63
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,940
virtualization and hardware to enhance

64
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,010
security and now that we're actually

65
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:06,410
owned by a hardware company it's gonna

66
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:09,470
open up a lot of new possibilities from

67
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:11,060
where we can take our tech and and tie

68
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:13,250
it to the hardware to make it even more

69
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:17,180
effective but what I want to talk to you

70
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:19,310
today about is you know artificial

71
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:22,340
intelligence and machine learning so how

72
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:24,170
many people here have some sort of AI or

73
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:27,049
machine learning powered security

74
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:29,570
solution in your stack today okay about

75
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:33,230
you know 20-25 percent of the of the

76
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:35,930
audience there's been a lot of hype the

77
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,578
last couple of years about machine

78
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,170
learning and artificial intelligence is

79
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:42,650
somehow gonna solve all of our security

80
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:45,410
was well the reality is it is just hype

81
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:47,599
anytime somebody says whether it's you

82
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,210
know virtualization is going to solve it

83
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,179
the cloud

84
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:53,160
gonna solve it ai is gonna solve it no

85
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,750
one technology is gonna solve all of our

86
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,070
security challenges if there was one

87
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,080
silver bullet out there we'd have

88
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,370
already found it and none of us would be

89
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,110
needing to sit here because we wouldn't

90
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,210
have to worry about how do we secure

91
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:06,270
ourselves against all the threats and

92
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:07,500
the risks that are out there so what I

93
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:10,470
want to do is talk a little bit about

94
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,360
you know how AI and machine learning

95
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:15,930
actually can't help us because there is

96
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:19,620
a role for it to play but you can't view

97
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:22,320
it as a silver bullet and you know at

98
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,040
the end of the day why we can't view it

99
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,070
as a silver bullet is it's just

100
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,450
mathematically impossible to predict

101
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:33,270
whether something is good or bad and

102
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,229
have a hundred percent accuracy you're

103
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,560
never going to get a hundred percent

104
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:41,040
accuracy is that a shark or is that a

105
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,840
dolphin if you get it wrong you might

106
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,850
end up dead right

107
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,049
or maybe you're playing with flipper and

108
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:49,170
it's actually not that bad of an

109
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:51,090
experience but to be able to predict it

110
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:53,250
with a hundred percent accuracy it's

111
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,039
just it's mathematically impossible the

112
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:58,380
amount of combinations on things are

113
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:01,230
infinite and when you're just trying to

114
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:04,140
do static analysis of a file or whether

115
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,730
you're trying to predict whether that

116
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,500
thing the user is about to open is going

117
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:10,590
to be good or bad you're inevitably

118
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,820
sometimes going to get it wrong now it

119
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,530
doesn't mean that we shouldn't be using

120
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,270
machine learning and artificial

121
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:17,450
intelligence to make our detection

122
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:20,159
engines more efficient and effective

123
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,479
because we certainly should and I think

124
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,530
there are some great technologies out

125
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:26,010
there on the market know are some

126
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:28,799
companies that have proven that this

127
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:31,830
type of approach can add value and

128
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,450
increase your defenses but they're never

129
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:36,240
going to be perfect so it's important to

130
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:38,670
understand how to separate the hype from

131
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,950
the actual benefit that you're going to

132
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:44,580
be able to potentially get from from

133
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:47,580
these types of tools so one of the

134
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:49,830
things that we've done at bromium if you

135
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,599
go to the bromium comm websites still up

136
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,490
and there's a blog section on there and

137
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,050
we've done all quite a bit of blogging

138
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,910
about some of the recent mo tech

139
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,220
campaigns

140
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:02,870
that have been out there and that was an

141
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:06,710
interesting example to look at because

142
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:09,260
what we found and and when we go into

143
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:11,150
customers oftentimes were you know the

144
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,980
the bromium solution is complementary to

145
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:15,169
the existing they still have traditional

146
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,450
antivirus they might have a next-gen

147
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:20,480
machine learning security tool and plus

148
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:24,140
they'll have our our isolation tool and

149
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:26,270
we find that malware is still getting

150
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:29,860
through all of those next-generation

151
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:34,430
defenses and even at customers that have

152
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:36,590
the latest AI powered defenses we're

153
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:39,020
seeing that the bad guys just become

154
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:40,700
more clever and how they disguise the

155
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:44,299
malware and when you look at a motet

156
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:46,640
specifically you know now we're doing

157
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:49,340
the exact same thing they're just making

158
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,500
it highly polymorphic they're making it

159
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:54,260
so that the the code is

160
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,810
indistinguishable one person's attack is

161
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,340
actually unique from another person's

162
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,990
attack although at the end of the day

163
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,270
it's the same command and control

164
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,800
servers and the same types of malware

165
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,750
they ultimately end up infecting you

166
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,310
with but they're just making the malware

167
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,020
unique and this is something that we're

168
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,640
finding and why we all know that

169
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:13,400
traditional antivirus just using

170
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:16,550
signature detection fails because you

171
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:23,169
just make the the malware malware unique

172
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:23,169
and so there there is an interesting

173
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,350
vulnerability that was exposed and you

174
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:30,260
know I'm not going to use names of

175
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:32,510
different cyber security companies but

176
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:35,990
in July there was a group out of

177
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:38,270
Australia and skylight Cybercom does

178
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,160
everybody read this no what threat

179
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,780
report I'm referring to that skylight

180
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,970
cyber found if you go to their website

181
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:46,700
you read a great blog article about it

182
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:48,790
but what they did is they targeted one

183
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:52,460
of the most popular and well-known

184
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:54,140
machine learning next-gen security tools

185
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,599
that were out there and wanted to see

186
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,789
well can we trick it could we trick its

187
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,230
algorithm into marking something

188
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:02,870
malicious as known-good

189
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:04,789
and at the end of the day it wasn't that

190
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:07,669
difficult for them to do it they just

191
00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:08,849
reverse engineered how the some of those

192
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:11,969
algorithms work

193
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:13,889
how the machine learning is making

194
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:16,319
predictive decisions by looking at

195
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:17,849
properties or doing static file analysis

196
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,949
and saying yeah that looks like it's a

197
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:22,229
clean file and they were able to just

198
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:23,459
masquerade malware with the same

199
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:26,399
properties that the machine learning

200
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:28,589
algorithm was trained to treat as benign

201
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,449
and they pretty much were able to get

202
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:32,429
any piece of Mao or even wanna cry and

203
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:34,680
off-the-shelf stuff that was really old

204
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:35,789
they could easily reduce Kai's it and it

205
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,828
would slip right through this machine

206
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:39,750
learning software now again it doesn't

207
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:42,029
mean machine learning is bad it just

208
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:44,670
means you can't we're never gonna be

209
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:46,829
able to accurately predict because at

210
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,810
the end of the day who's creating those

211
00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:50,609
machine learning algorithms all rights

212
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:52,768
as human beings that are programming it

213
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:55,410
for what to look for so there's always

214
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:58,649
going to be flaws and how it's doing its

215
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:01,469
predictive analysis so these guys blew

216
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:03,029
right through it blew it apart and you

217
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,350
know on a positive note they shared

218
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:06,509
those results and guess what that

219
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,220
company's solution is probably even more

220
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:11,100
secure now today because now they've

221
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:13,560
programmed the new algorithms to be able

222
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,230
to detect that kind of a bypass but the

223
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:19,800
reality is when you talk about detection

224
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:23,279
if I'm going to let a file drop onto a

225
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:26,399
PC and then potentially execute if I'm

226
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,380
relying on detection I'm never gonna be

227
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,170
a hundred percent there's always going

228
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:32,850
to be some clever bypass in order for

229
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:35,519
the bad guy to be able to disguise his

230
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:38,370
malware and trick pretty much any

231
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,279
security tool into marking it is clean

232
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:43,410
and letting it letting it run if we if

233
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,209
we could solve this problem with a

234
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:49,620
hundred percent certainty again we

235
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:51,268
wouldn't be sitting here today the other

236
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,329
thing with machine learning and

237
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:56,519
artificial intelligence is that well

238
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:58,258
it's not just good guys to use it so

239
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:01,410
what we're actually starting to see now

240
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:03,779
is some of the threat actors using the

241
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,759
same techniques with artificial

242
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:08,339
intelligence and machine learning to

243
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,829
improve the quality of their malware and

244
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:13,139
to improve their attack techniques so

245
00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:15,329
it's actually a double-edged sword right

246
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:17,519
we can use machine learning we can use

247
00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:18,000
artificial intelligence to do good

248
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,110
things

249
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,480
we can also weaponize it

250
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:25,000
use it to do bad things and don't think

251
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,190
for a minute the bad guys aren't using

252
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,769
these same kinds of techniques to make

253
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:38,350
their attacks more effective more more

254
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:43,060
stealthy how many folks here have a sim

255
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:44,740
tool or and maybe I hope more more than

256
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:48,040
this have actually some tools right yeah

257
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:50,730
Splunk or ArcSight or how many folks

258
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:53,110
have an EDR tool that does a lot of

259
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:55,660
endpoint collection of processes like a

260
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:58,510
cyber reason or a carbon black or

261
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:02,740
something along those lines about so

262
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:06,459
when you think about the volume data

263
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:08,740
that you can collect right this lady's

264
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:14,199
basically holding up the sim tool right

265
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:17,290
and we're just collecting a massive load

266
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,300
of crap and how how do you how do you

267
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:21,010
get sort through the crap or cut through

268
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,870
the crap in order to find that little

269
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:26,220
gold nugget that might actually be there

270
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:28,899
and be useful see this is where I

271
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,279
believe machine learning artificial

272
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:33,310
intelligence is going to have the

273
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:35,500
biggest role for us to play the amount

274
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,939
of data we're collecting today all of

275
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,709
these tools and then they're cool with

276
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,029
cyber ease and carbon black all these

277
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:43,479
all these tools out there are very

278
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:46,510
effective we can't hire enough analysts

279
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:49,360
to parse through that data to get true

280
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:53,529
meaning out of it think about Microsoft

281
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:56,890
with ATP and with Windows 10 and all of

282
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:58,810
the threats a lemon tree that they can

283
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,220
collect today and a lot of people opt in

284
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:02,859
to share it or they've got customers

285
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:05,100
using ATP Microsoft is collecting a

286
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:08,410
massive amount of threat intelligence

287
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,640
there's not enough human beings security

288
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,350
analysts on the face of the earth -

289
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,390
probably sift through that volume of

290
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,920
data that a company like Microsoft is

291
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:17,230
collecting from hundreds of millions if

292
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,479
not billions of PCs so this is where

293
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:21,880
machine learning artificial intelligence

294
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,070
are going to create the sort of the next

295
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,500
revolution of how we sift through that

296
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:28,839
data and do it in a fast efficient

297
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,730
manner and how do we look through this

298
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:33,330
giant volume of data cut through the

299
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:35,680
crap and get to what really matters

300
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:38,910
but the important thing to keep in mind

301
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,319
is it'll never prevent the first breach

302
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:43,900
you're always going to end up with some

303
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,420
patient zero or a sampling of patient

304
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,500
zeros maybe across your organization or

305
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,479
it could be across multiple

306
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,550
organizations if you're a Microsoft and

307
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,830
you're you know monitoring the security

308
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:55,839
on behalf of multiple clients and then

309
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:57,610
your algorithms gonna pick up on a

310
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:01,270
pattern and identify that something it's

311
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:05,110
malicious so machine learning will speed

312
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:06,400
our ability to do detection and sift

313
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,260
through the data so that then we can

314
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,600
take action so that then we can identify

315
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:12,310
wait a second that is malicious command

316
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,960
and control traffic let's just go ahead

317
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,880
and automatically update our proxy and

318
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,310
firewall rules so that we don't allow

319
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,980
any of that traffic to proliferate and

320
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:23,109
now we can quickly identify with the

321
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,550
volume of data we've collected what are

322
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,020
the twenty or thirty machines in my

323
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,240
environment that actually got hit with

324
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,790
that specific attack so there is a key

325
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,590
role for machine learning to play to

326
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:34,240
help us go through the volume of crap

327
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:40,030
that we're collecting out of all these

328
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:44,670
these tool sets that that we have so at

329
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:46,870
at bromium and now HP we believe an

330
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:49,240
effective tool you can put into your

331
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:51,820
tool belt again not a silver bullet to

332
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:55,990
solve all challenges is to actually

333
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:57,490
leverage the power of the hardware to do

334
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:00,160
something we call virtualization or

335
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:02,380
isolation and when you think about the

336
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,780
computing power and any desktop you buy

337
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:07,540
today especially compared to 10 years

338
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:09,310
ago or 15 years ago we've got a massive

339
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:11,890
amount of compute power and pretty much

340
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:14,500
every chip that gets manufactured in the

341
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:16,689
last 10 years has and of our

342
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,310
virtualization engine built into it it

343
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:20,770
has all the virtualization extensions

344
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:22,449
that are there and PCs are shipping with

345
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:25,150
it it's hard to even buy a PC with less

346
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:27,160
than 8 gigs of RAM nowadays so that we

347
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:31,360
can leverage that that amount of power

348
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:33,670
and why use virtualization because if I

349
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,800
take something like a word document that

350
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:38,890
I get from a an email sender that's

351
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,420
never sent me an email before trying to

352
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:43,600
predict if that word document is good or

353
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,920
bad mathematically impossible at some

354
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,580
point I'm just going to have to open it

355
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,620
and maybe a

356
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:49,270
kills me maybe a dozen but through the

357
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,310
power of virtualization what if I could

358
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,780
just open that word document seamlessly

359
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:55,510
to the end user invisible to the

360
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:58,180
end-user but drop it into a virtual

361
00:14:55,510 --> 00:15:00,010
machine for execution and let it execute

362
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,599
there and just do that on their laptop

363
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:04,030
or their desktop or even inside their

364
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,300
VDI session and that's what that's what

365
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:09,069
we do and the reason we do that is it's

366
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,829
not that it's a hundred percent

367
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:14,830
effective nothing is a hundred percent

368
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:17,850
but the ability for malware to escape a

369
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:20,890
VM or perform a VM escape operation is

370
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,450
infinitely harder than just trying to

371
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:24,460
compromise the host that it's running on

372
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:26,950
so by running things that you don't

373
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,900
trust and actually what I'm going to

374
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:31,390
demo you is the flip of that perhaps

375
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:34,569
running things that you actually trust

376
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:36,750
inside of a virtual machine can give you

377
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:39,370
an additional layer of protection that

378
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,960
makes it significantly harder for the

379
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,520
bad guy to actually cause compromise

380
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,140
because they're going to have to figure

381
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,910
out how to attack the properties of the

382
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,069
hardware itself or how to do a

383
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:50,319
hypervisor escape which is infinitely

384
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:52,090
more complex than just doing a word

385
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:57,150
escape or tricking a user into running a

386
00:15:52,090 --> 00:16:02,170
macro so why don't I just show you some

387
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:04,270
things at this point so I've just got a

388
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,969
standard Windows 10 laptop up here I

389
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:07,840
have loaded bromium technology onto it

390
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,240
rebooted it

391
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,310
it's just our software as an MSI package

392
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,250
that you install on a machine you do a

393
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:19,270
reboot and what that allows us to do is

394
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:21,070
basically put some hypervisor extensions

395
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:24,550
into the operating system and onto that

396
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:26,620
PC that allows us to create efficient

397
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,900
lightweight virtual machines now why

398
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:31,210
would I want to do put something in a

399
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,829
virtual machine let's go with the

400
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:35,170
assumption that this this device is

401
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:37,210
actually compromised and so you can

402
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:40,510
imagine the bad guy has already infected

403
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:42,310
the device he owns it he's got a remote

404
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:44,530
access tool kit on here

405
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:46,300
he's got key loggers he's got screen

406
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:47,740
scrapers so let's just go with you some

407
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,750
of the devices own that I haven't

408
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:53,470
figured that out yet so what I'm gonna

409
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:55,680
do now is actually open up a key logger

410
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:57,520
this is a little just a benign

411
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,439
PowerShell key logger but you can

412
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:02,029
imagine if I was the actual bad guy

413
00:16:59,439 --> 00:17:04,129
the remote shell wouldn't be running

414
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:06,439
here he'd be running back on my command

415
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:09,350
control and now I can collect all the

416
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:14,480
keystrokes that happen on this device so

417
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:21,589
when I is a user I run notepad you can

418
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:23,990
see the keys are being logged now it's

419
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:26,418
bad enough that the bad guys tipped over

420
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:28,970
this machine and has access to whatever

421
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:31,220
this user has access to but let's just

422
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:34,010
take this one step farther what if this

423
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:37,039
user is actually privileged user what if

424
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:39,080
this is actually an admin and hopefully

425
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,370
we're doing basic hygiene where at least

426
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,860
you have separate accounts for your

427
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:44,479
administrative work but how do what do

428
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,870
most admins do when they want to go

429
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,760
administer a server they fire up an RDP

430
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:52,689
session it's a pretty common common

431
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:56,510
thing for them to do so I'm gonna pop up

432
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:58,429
my RDP client now the remote RDP server

433
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:00,559
I'm going to connect to is not in the

434
00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:01,850
same Active Directory forest as this is

435
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,980
this laptop device they're two

436
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:05,959
completely completely separate networks

437
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:09,080
completely separate server that I'm

438
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,610
going to be connecting into now again if

439
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:17,629
I've got the remote access tool kit and

440
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:19,428
a key logger here you can see my

441
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,690
password would end up being typed now I

442
00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:22,399
didn't actually type my real password

443
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:25,130
into that because I don't want you guys

444
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:27,770
to see my password but whatever the I

445
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:30,110
type is the password not now I've stolen

446
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:33,230
stolen the password of that admin I also

447
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:35,120
have a screen scraper I could simply see

448
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:37,669
the name of the admin user account

449
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,439
that's that's being displayed as well so

450
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:41,720
let me actually go ahead and just close

451
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,190
the keylogger because I don't want you

452
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,190
guys actually seeing my real password

453
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:52,250
and I'm gonna go ahead and start to see

454
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:54,140
our DP session now there are and and if

455
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:56,390
you if you aren't using them I would

456
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:58,490
encourage you to look at them privileged

457
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:01,490
access management tools out there that

458
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:03,020
can eliminate the need for admins to

459
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:04,700
even have to know their passwords the

460
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:07,970
companies like beyond trust have

461
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:09,110
technology companies like cyber-ark I

462
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,669
know I think I sell cyber-ark has a

463
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,840
booth here they make a really cool tech

464
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:14,639
right I'm gonna

465
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,668
check that out and they help solve that

466
00:19:14,639 --> 00:19:20,580
problem of bad guys stealing the admin

467
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:22,559
credentials but let's just assume I even

468
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:24,389
did have a cyber-ark technology on here

469
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,119
and maybe I never had to type my admin

470
00:19:24,389 --> 00:19:29,399
password all that got handled for me

471
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:31,259
automatically by by cyber-ark can the

472
00:19:29,399 --> 00:19:34,949
bad guys still do something malicious

473
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:37,739
inside this RDP session so what I'm

474
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,229
going to show you now let's just open up

475
00:19:37,739 --> 00:19:41,249
Active Directory users and computers

476
00:19:39,229 --> 00:19:43,889
again this is the shut ins to be a

477
00:19:41,249 --> 00:19:47,129
domain controller in an isolated forest

478
00:19:43,889 --> 00:19:49,498
that I have if you look here there's

479
00:19:47,129 --> 00:19:53,219
three user accounts that are existing

480
00:19:49,499 --> 00:19:54,359
inside this domain controller so let me

481
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,869
go ahead and close Active Directory

482
00:19:54,359 --> 00:20:01,289
users computer so let's come back to my

483
00:19:57,869 --> 00:20:02,999
bad guy toolkit now I've got a remote

484
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:04,619
access tool kit I'm the bad guy I can

485
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:07,739
see that person has now made his

486
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:10,019
connection to the RDP server I'm still

487
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:12,960
collecting all the keystrokes in the RDP

488
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:19,349
session so if I come back and I fire up

489
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:22,559
my key logger again as I type in the RDP

490
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:24,749
session all the keys are getting it

491
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,309
getting logged but if I had a privileged

492
00:20:24,749 --> 00:20:27,749
access management solution on there at

493
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:30,960
least I wouldn't have scraped the

494
00:20:27,749 --> 00:20:32,820
password from that add in session but

495
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,070
without having to scrape the password of

496
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:38,519
the admin session if I come back to my

497
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:40,590
bad guy toolkit I'm going to go ahead

498
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:42,479
and execute code because I have code

499
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,849
execution on this Windows 10 device I'm

500
00:20:42,479 --> 00:20:48,239
going to go ahead and execute code

501
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:51,599
that's actually going to interact with

502
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:53,909
the RDP session and the RTP process that

503
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:57,779
we could see was running on this desktop

504
00:20:53,909 --> 00:21:01,049
and so what just actually happened let

505
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:04,379
me reopen Active Directory users and

506
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:06,119
computers and now from this Windows 10

507
00:21:04,379 --> 00:21:07,949
device which is not joined to the domain

508
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:10,139
that I'm already peeing into there's a

509
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:13,259
new user account sitting here a user

510
00:21:10,139 --> 00:21:15,359
account called bad guy and if I open it

511
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:18,869
up and look at the member of he's a

512
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:21,239
domain admin so I is a bad guy having

513
00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:23,340
wrote quote execution into this Windows

514
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:25,720
10 device can just sit there and wait

515
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:28,000
even with a privileged access

516
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,430
or managers solution I didn't get your

517
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,080
password but I can wait until I see that

518
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,880
you're in that RDP session I want to

519
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,860
interact with and I can actually get

520
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:39,430
code execution from the host into the

521
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:40,810
RDP session so how do you protect

522
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:42,250
against something like that that's a

523
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:44,649
really difficult thing if the device is

524
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:47,260
already compromised how can I guarantee

525
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:49,180
the user can do something that won't

526
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,770
also end up being compromised

527
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,630
and this is where we believe the power

528
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:54,940
of virtualization can help us solve this

529
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:56,950
problem so what I'm going to show you is

530
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:59,110
some tech that we've been developing a

531
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:01,450
bromium and and and now we'll continue

532
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:03,550
to work on this technology as part of HP

533
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:07,750
I'm gonna disconnect from this RDP

534
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:10,600
session now I'm going to relaunch it I'm

535
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:13,750
gonna right click that same RDP file I'm

536
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:17,560
gonna do open with bro me and protect it

537
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:19,180
at now this is all gonna get rebranded

538
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,070
will be clubroom and protected app in

539
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:24,070
the HP LAN don't know I'll probably come

540
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:28,480
up with a different name but now what

541
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:31,419
I'm gonna do let's go ahead and log into

542
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,850
this RDP session and you'll notice I'm

543
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,960
not closing the key logger because I

544
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:36,370
don't care that there's a key logger

545
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,750
running hopefully I type the password

546
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:43,209
correctly because that key logger saw

547
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:45,340
none of those keystrokes so what did we

548
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:46,780
actually do there well when we got our

549
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:48,909
bromium technology installed in this

550
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:51,100
Windows 10 device without having to

551
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:54,040
reformat the device without having to

552
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,540
set up new partitions or slide the disks

553
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,460
around or do anything funky like that

554
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,830
just simply installing an MSI package

555
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:02,440
and rebooting it has allowed us to drop

556
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:05,199
a lightweight UV bootable hypervisor

557
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,030
onto this Windows 10 system so that we

558
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,220
can actually create virtual machine

559
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:11,200
contacts that have a higher privilege

560
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:15,310
and run at a lower ring level than the

561
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:17,470
actual Windows 10 OS so at the end of

562
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:20,110
the day what does that mean simply means

563
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:23,080
we can when I'm interacting with that

564
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:25,360
protected application because we're

565
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,879
taking advantage of hardware and running

566
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,770
on the hardware and device I can reroute

567
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,140
the keystrokes of the keyboard I've

568
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:33,760
actually unplugged the keyboard from the

569
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,290
Windows 10 operating system and I've

570
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,810
plumbed it straight into the virtual

571
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:39,460
machine so any keystrokes that I type

572
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:41,649
away on this device

573
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,419
the Windows OS that's running here those

574
00:23:41,649 --> 00:23:45,580
keys are a hundred percent invisible it

575
00:23:43,419 --> 00:23:47,710
is impossible for you to snoop those

576
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:50,080
keystrokes because they're not actually

577
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:51,759
being routed through Windows anymore or

578
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,228
rallying them through a tiny little UV

579
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:54,580
bootable hypervisor that's running

580
00:23:53,229 --> 00:23:56,320
underneath Windows without the need to

581
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:59,739
actually rebuild the machine just

582
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:02,229
install reboot now I have what I've done

583
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:04,539
is I've actually launched a tiny little

584
00:24:02,229 --> 00:24:05,649
Linux VM we're using Linux and this in

585
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:07,749
this kind of scenario because it's a

586
00:24:05,649 --> 00:24:09,879
very small lightweight small footprint

587
00:24:07,749 --> 00:24:12,389
and I'm just running a Linux based RDP

588
00:24:09,879 --> 00:24:15,009
client to make the connection

589
00:24:12,389 --> 00:24:17,889
additionally when you think about screen

590
00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:22,080
scrapers we can also do funky things

591
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:26,289
like blanking out the frame buffers so

592
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:29,830
now when I'm at the bad guy I'm trying

593
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:32,379
to screen scrape that session that RDP

594
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:34,449
session comes back blank because we have

595
00:24:32,379 --> 00:24:36,519
the ability to control the frame buffers

596
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:39,190
that the VM is using and making those

597
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:42,309
hidden away from the actual Windows 10

598
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:43,839
OS so what we can do with the power

599
00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:45,759
virtually just want you to get you guys

600
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:48,369
thinking about how virtualization can be

601
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:50,049
used and bromium you don't now acquired

602
00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:51,488
by HP he's not the only company in this

603
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:52,779
space there's other technologies out

604
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:55,269
there there's companies like hi slate

605
00:24:52,779 --> 00:24:58,059
there's a you know uh remote browser

606
00:24:55,269 --> 00:25:00,339
solutions and others out there I want

607
00:24:58,059 --> 00:25:02,849
you to just think about how you can

608
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:05,080
leverage virtualization in isolation to

609
00:25:02,849 --> 00:25:07,029
try and solve some of the security

610
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,339
challenges that we have today whether

611
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:11,409
it's running potentially malicious Word

612
00:25:09,339 --> 00:25:14,019
documents in a VM so that they don't

613
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:16,269
infect my hosts or if it's just simply

614
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:18,969
allowing your administrators to launch

615
00:25:16,269 --> 00:25:20,979
secure RDP sessions and a protected VM

616
00:25:18,969 --> 00:25:24,339
so that you don't care if the machine is

617
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:26,559
compromised now the bad guy yes bad

618
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:28,210
enough you know it's this device least

619
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,249
he'll never own anything in my RDP

620
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:32,679
session but it just kind of highlights

621
00:25:30,249 --> 00:25:34,929
the power of virtualization and the

622
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:36,759
power of isolation and how we can just

623
00:25:34,929 --> 00:25:39,279
add this as another tool in tark our

624
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:41,729
tool belt to make our environment more

625
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,729
secure

626
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:48,070
right I think I've got one minute left

627
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:49,600
so probably don't have much time for

628
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:52,418
questions but if anybody has a question

629
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,059
or two maybe we can take one now and

630
00:25:52,419 --> 00:26:03,720
I'll certainly be around if you guys

631
00:25:54,059 --> 00:26:03,720
want to chat to me afterwards yep

632
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:22,290
so these BR um processes these are the

633
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:26,070
represent the actual secure VM contexts

634
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:33,480
that are running on the device you can

635
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:35,280
see 50 so the one with the CPU cycling

636
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,500
is the active one that's got the RDP

637
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,810
session so that RDP sessions using 2/3

638
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,790
percent of the CPU right now and has

639
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:44,850
consumed about you know 50 Meg's worth

640
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:46,409
of memory so pretty lightweight again

641
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,719
why we're using Linux for this

642
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:52,440
particular VM context to in order to

643
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,390
keep the footprint down cool all right

644
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,340
well guys hopefully you found that to be

645
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:59,270
useful I thank you for your time and

646
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,270
enjoy the rest of chef
