management talk this is a lot different

17
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,420
than the talks I'm usually given I'm not

18
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,340
releasing any new tools today I'm not

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,090
dropping any O'Day's here we're going to

20
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,280
talk about something a lot more

21
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,760
important though we're gonna talk about

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,440
how to get our work done because if you

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,539
see my bonus talk we kind of covered it

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,108
a little bit but how many here have

25
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,149
trouble getting budget for security it's

26
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,790
gonna be all of us right as an industry

27
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,590
we're terrible at it and we're going to

28
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,960
talk about kind of why that is right now

29
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:14,280
and we're gonna talk about how do we

30
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,229
solve this so during my technical talks

31
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,909
I usually have hands-on workshops since

32
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,340
it's a management job we're gonna have a

33
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,740
hands-on management workshop so how many

34
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,350
here is their first security conference

35
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,740
ever wonderful good good good

36
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,939
first gurken whole my goodness all right

37
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,189
there's something really cool about this

38
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,500
industry and this community that we've

39
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:36,419
built over the years everybody here is

40
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,650
really here to help each other so why

41
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,420
I'm up here speaking how to make sure

42
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,130
that you learn from my mistakes and then

43
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,720
we can have the conversation and kind of

44
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,158
just further the industry so we're gonna

45
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,960
take two minutes I'm gonna put down my

46
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,790
phone and we're gonna turn around

47
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,289
introduce ourselves I don't care if you

48
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,950
use your real name your hacker handle I

49
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,049
don't care

50
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,670
but what we're gonna do is talk about

51
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,770
the one thing that is pissing us off

52
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,909
about the industry and you're gonna find

53
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,380
out that we have a lot of commonalities

54
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,020
so two minutes on the clock

55
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,020
turn around find somebody new go

56
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,020

58
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,180

weird place that we're in right oh we

63
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,970
need marketing the CEO is not the

64
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,470
marketer right we've hired people for

65
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,470
that but for some reason people think

66
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:30,420
thank you one minute warning if you have

67
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:31,990

five four three two one

I always wanted to do that that's really

75
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:08,490
cool all right so again this is hacking

76
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,590
a barter on how to talk to executives

77
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,330
and secure your budget because we're

78
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,220
also so engineers here we are all texts

79
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,780
we all know how to hack stuff why can't

80
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,279
we do this to our boardroom to get our

81
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,290
budget so today we're going to talk

82
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,440
about Oh everybody

83
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:24,360
protip Pete the parrot is a PT PT P for

84
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,980
shorter than I think these will be

85
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,690
coming up in our presentations that's

86
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,060
offering a little bit of advice as

87
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,830
presentation styles and everything

88
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:34,230
always have an agenda people forget the

89
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:36,750
agenda side all the time so why isn't it

90
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:39,650
important anybody remember giving

91
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:42,330
directions before Google Maps GPS

92
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,530
MapQuest right it was all right you're

93
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,789
gonna go to this intersection you're

94
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,409
gonna take about five minutes you're to

95
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,760
see a big rock on the corner you're and

96
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,050
take a right there there's gonna be a

97
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,599
Whitechapel you're gonna take a left

98
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,700
there right so this back in the day we

99
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,720
used to have this mental map on how to

100
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:59,099
get from point A to point B you never

101
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,720
missed the Whitechapel it's right on

102
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,770
your left just past it and then 30

103
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,990
minutes later you're calling them right

104
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,549
so what we want to make sure is our

105
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,050
audience doesn't get lost so we're gonna

106
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,780
build a mental map on where we're going

107
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:11,550
I am putting my head because I know what

108
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,960
this presentation is some of you much

109
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,810
she didn't download it off and github

110
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,539
everything is up here public available

111
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:20,100
Twitter github slide deck it's all over

112
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,320
place if you can't find it come talk to

113
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,240
me I'll get to the deck feel free to

114
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,729
take pictures but we're building this

115
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,140
mental map on we're at point a we're

116
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:30,150
going to get to point B this is how

117
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:33,539
we're gonna do it so the objective of

118
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:36,270
this talk is to talk basically we're

119
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:39,330
gonna talk about how do we talk better

120
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,710
though we need budget we need to do this

121
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,780
stuff to get the job done

122
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,640
we're talking about four things we're

123
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,780
talking about framing the problem we

124
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,250
talked about how to make that problem

125
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,020
real now we're gonna talk about

126
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:52,890
explaining the solution and then doing

127
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:56,159
it right so for this presentation I will

128
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:58,520
be reading the PowerPoint no no no no no

129
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,220
I see this all the time we're gay

130
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:04,729
technical talks the slides have 800

131
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:07,220
words on there the font size is 8 you

132
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:08,300
see thank know there's this great

133
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,310
feature on your computer called

134
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,660
text-to-speech now if I wanted to hear

135
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,509
you read your slides I could just

136
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,650
highlight it and say talk to me computer

137
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:16,699
they are not here to read your slides

138
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,650
they're not here to listen your slides

139
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:20,810
they're here to watch you speak they're

140
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,780
here to listen to you they want to hear

141
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,319
your story your slides should be visual

142
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,539
representations of what you're talking

143
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,020
about to help you tell that story no

144
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:29,659
more no less

145
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,409
so again I said we're gonna talk about

146
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,479
frame the problem

147
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:34,280
so let's frame the problem this is

148
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:38,360
something we do terribly as an industry

149
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:42,650
so from our exercise before shout out

150
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:48,400
one of the problems that we have over

151
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:48,400
words alright give me some more budget

152
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:53,929
success is not appreciated alright these

153
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:58,849
are a lot of human problems do we have

154
00:06:53,930 --> 00:07:01,250
technical problems too many tools not

155
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:02,810
enough management cool so let's say

156
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:06,289
let's pick one of these problems and

157
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:08,380
focus in on why do I care so here does

158
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:12,740
anybody do vulnerability management here

159
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:14,419
ok is it a struggle or are we just

160
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,650
producing reports people patch it it's

161
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:21,469
wonderful we're in the green we're at

162
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:22,820
95% patch right now it's terrible so we

163
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:24,169
know that we need to do vulnerability

164
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,940
management you don't need to convince me

165
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:26,359
that but you do need to convince your

166
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,849
boss

167
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,750
so let's frame the problem right so why

168
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:34,130
is the owner ability management a

169
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:40,099
problem why do we need it that's Tuesday

170
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:43,969
ok why do I care we're gonna lose data

171
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:45,770
why do I care my data is public equifax

172
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:51,500
have you seen their stock since they got

173
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:53,090
breach it's up right why do I care if I

174
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:57,200
get breached

175
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:59,810
we're gonna lose money okay cool so

176
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,700
reputation cool how do we quantify that

177
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:04,830
because if I look at recent breaches huh

178
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,090
has anybody here stopped sharpness is

179
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:09,800
shopping at Target since they got

180
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:14,549
breached we got one two three whoo-hoo

181
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:16,460
Home Depot t.j.maxx you stop thinking it

182
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:19,230
was far galore Bank of America or not

183
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:21,719
everybody's breached who cares why am i

184
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:23,010
spending money this is where framing the

185
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,460
problem comes in so I'll give you a

186
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:28,080
story it's not like telling stories so

187
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:29,820
anybody here have to sell a sin project

188
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,650
I'm not talking about selling Splunk but

189
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,150
like we need detections and correlations

190
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,929
all that's okay so I'll give my

191
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,250
presentation

192
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:36,239
you know we'd give everything like oh my

193
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,770
goodness look at all these problems I

194
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,780
would have and then I'm gonna need to

195
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:42,329
put this in so Splunk oh my god I'm

196
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,709
gonna need 32 distributed systems to

197
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:46,020
handle the indexing we're gonna have hot

198
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,920
cold storage bla bla bla bla bla but at

199
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,470
the end we're gonna have all these

200
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,579
problems that we can fix them boss look

201
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:54,060
something goes Ryan you must think I'm

202
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:55,890
an absolute idiot what oops sorry it's

203
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,800
winking to miss on that one what do you

204
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:01,319
mean sir so right now we have no

205
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,670
problems and you're asking for money to

206
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,990
go create problems and then you're gonna

207
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,180
ask me for more money to go fix those

208
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:09,000
problems why the hell would I do that

209
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:11,400
hmm hmm that's an important lesson

210
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,610
learned didn't explain why it matters to

211
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:16,680
him so maybe maybe there's something

212
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,330
going on here so stats we all know we

213
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,459
need budget the more budget that we have

214
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:22,740
the more good things we can do so on the

215
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:25,170
Left we see spend it's left right yeah

216
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,690
on the Left we see spend come and up up

217
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:29,069
up up up up from 2010 2018 we're

218
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:30,540
spending more and more so we should see

219
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,340
incidents go down so on the right is the

220
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:35,459
incident graph and it's not going down

221
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:36,570
it's going to rather way so it's

222
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:39,360
somebody outside the industry you go

223
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:43,920
home so you're telling me the more money

224
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,360
I invest the more incidents we have all

225
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,900
right maybe I'm playing games of stats

226
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,760
right let's take a real world example

227
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,780
Facebook 2017 says they're gonna bolster

228
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,400
security they're going to double their

229
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,589
spend from 7 billion to 14 billion

230
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:58,199
dollars and then West in a year their

231
00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:00,320
breach done 50 million accounts oops

232
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,580
maybe they spent that extra

233
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,700
hundred thousand they couldn't stop that

234
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:09,080
one so there's something something going

235
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:12,560
on here so let's talk about how these

236
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:14,830
things are framed right everybody know

237
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:19,130
it's a capital one breach by now right

238
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:21,200
so this was a headline from the

239
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:25,370
Washington Post I believe that source is

240
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,740
done here yeah it's Washington Post so

241
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:29,690
if I'm reading this I look and Capital

242
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,970
One was breached because they embraced

243
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:33,020
cloud services

244
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:35,090
does anybody know what's special about

245
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:40,850
the relationship between Washington Post

246
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:43,700
and Amazon AWS same owner so you

247
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:45,920
literally have the only media outlet

248
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,780
that is incentivized to spin this in a

249
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,760
positive way for AWS and they still say

250
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:52,670
and in the end the embrace the cloud

251
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,050
services couldn't save them it's like if

252
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:57,140
I read this this is what this is telling

253
00:10:54,050 --> 00:11:00,920
me it's cloud bad knows anybody know how

254
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:06,860
they actually got breached unsecured s3

255
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:08,599
buzzes they're breached by somebody that

256
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:11,660
helped them set up yes that is one story

257
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,220
anybody else know the other stories this

258
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:16,640
configured firewalls anybody else know

259
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:18,380
the other stories ma a.m. and anybody

260
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:24,050
else know the other stories metadata

261
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:27,620
servers right what else we hear unpatch

262
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:29,689
since 2015 right we are the security

263
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:32,840
industry and we still can't get a good

264
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:35,480
cohesive story on what happened so

265
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,890
here's my challenge everybody here is if

266
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,870
your executives are getting their

267
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:40,699
security news from the news media you

268
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:43,160
already lost your game they need to be

269
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,450
coming to you to understand hey what

270
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,160
happened to account for the one do we

271
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,890
need to care about it can you explain to

272
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,329
me how they could have mitigated this

273
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:52,010
start briefing your executives and your

274
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,270
management and all these things happen

275
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:56,600
in news because news is gonna get wrong

276
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:58,100
every time so if we want them to

277
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,780
understand our problems we should

278
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:03,560
understand their problems does anybody

279
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:06,620
know how to answer this make money it's

280
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:09,589
a good start if I make $1 and I invested

281
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,260
100 billion is that a good business it's

282
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,360
probably not

283
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:17,310
so something more to it so we want to

284
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:18,090
make money well smile did profits cool

285
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,609
we're getting there

286
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:22,500
so if I'm Pepsi and I make a hundred

287
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:29,040
million and I'm coke and I make 1

288
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:33,720
billion is Pepsi successful depends on

289
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:35,569
what your costs are cool so protip

290
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,430
people he's gonna help us out

291
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:41,100
the objective of business is to provide

292
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:43,560
an abnormal long-term return withholding

293
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,570
nonprofits charities mom and pops that

294
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,369
have different things to kind of take

295
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:49,470
care of the company right majority of us

296
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:51,720
are working in public sector the

297
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:54,210
objective of a business is to provide

298
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,480
normal long term returns haven't all

299
00:12:54,210 --> 00:13:00,060
most important because if I can provide

300
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,520
3% but my competitor who provides 10%

301
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:05,819
the money should be invested there as a

302
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:07,560
as a member of the board my job is to

303
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,690
make sure that the investment from my

304
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,349
owners is being spent in the best way

305
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:13,020
possible

306
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,160
so if I'm making 3% my competitors

307
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,360
making 10% it should be my

308
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,339
recommendation to go invest in the

309
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,920
competitor that never happens but that

310
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:21,510
should happen right so long-term returns

311
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,969
because if we make a million dollars

312
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:25,620
today but we lose 10 billion next year

313
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,650
that's not a good business right so

314
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:30,420
abnormal long-term returns hotel again

315
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:34,380
how does this relate right so let's

316
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:35,670
frame the problem so shout out one of

317
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:40,020
the programs that you guys are working

318
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:42,839
on nobody's working on anything we're at

319
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:46,230
a conference we're drinking network

320
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:48,450
visibility cool so I need a project for

321
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:49,680
network visibility how does this support

322
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:57,210
they have a normal long-term return of a

323
00:13:49,680 --> 00:14:01,410
company anyway ok let's break it down so

324
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:02,940
if we work in security oftentimes if

325
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:04,500
we're not in a cybersecurity firm

326
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,750
selling our services as security

327
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,430
professionals we rapidly adding value to

328
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:11,820
the business

329
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:13,560
all right chances are we're costing the

330
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:17,000
business a lot of money we're expensive

331
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:19,229
it's nice well we're expensive right so

332
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,420
why do we care about add value reduce

333
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:23,070
cost because this is one of the basic

334
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,410
principles

335
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:27,480
that everybody knows in management we

336
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:29,759
need to make the profit goal one so that

337
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,079
leaves us two things we can raise the

338
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:31,589
revenue or you can decrease the cost

339
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:35,660
right

340
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:38,130
that's easy math so network visibility

341
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:39,449
are we gonna add revenue to the company

342
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:44,699
if we got more visibility into our

343
00:14:39,449 --> 00:14:45,949
network cost are we making costs go up

344
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:51,149
or down

345
00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:53,870
why would I approve your project alright

346
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:56,639
so here's the fundamental issue

347
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:58,440
does anybody know a different industry

348
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,120
that is not security that operates like

349
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,399
security from a business model

350
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,620
perspective because what do we really do

351
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,389
as security professionals if we're not

352
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:10,380
adding value or reducing costs what do

353
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:12,690
we do manage risk the risk of the

354
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,970
situation right we're protecting this

355
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:16,709
formula right we're protecting the

356
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:19,680
profits because we can protect the

357
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:21,630
revenue stream right we know that if we

358
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,888
don't have security revenue isn't going

359
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,480
to be coming in because you don't have a

360
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:28,889
business you got breached you're gone

361
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,779
the revenue drops let's take our network

362
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:32,220
visibility we can actually reduce costs

363
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:33,899
with network visibility because right

364
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,970
now we need a staff Asaka thirty five

365
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:37,260
people because we got all these

366
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,279
different logs coming in we're trying to

367
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,839
correlate different things and it's just

368
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:41,310
taking way too much manpower if we had

369
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,779
better visibility we could actually

370
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,149
reallocate some of those resources

371
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:47,220
elsewhere and kind of reduce our spend

372
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:48,750
over all right so we can actually reduce

373
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,130
cost right vulnerability management when

374
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,709
you go hard on that one because it's a

375
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:54,480
terrible topic vulnerability management

376
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:55,949
done right it's gonna reduce your

377
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,319
patching costings gonna reduce your IT

378
00:15:55,949 --> 00:16:00,540
maintenance cost because let's say we

379
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:01,889
don't patch everything we can offer them

380
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:04,230
an 8020 rule

381
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:06,000
idea this is the patch that you care

382
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,439
about you need to get this patch in all

383
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,510
right we're gonna reduce the cost on i.t

384
00:16:07,439 --> 00:16:12,810
minutes this is how we have to be

385
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:15,209
talking okay now again this might be too

386
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:19,920
hard there's one last trick I can show

387
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:21,508
you so your boss has a button don't not

388
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,769
that button don't press that button

389
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:24,180
that's the button that makes you work

390
00:16:22,769 --> 00:16:26,040
nights and weekends don't press the

391
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,780
right button press the green button I'll

392
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,040
get to boss excited

393
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:31,829
when you're talking about something what

394
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,540
does your ears perk up chances are it's

395
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:36,840
tied to his objectives and its goals if

396
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:39,180
you don't know your bosses goals ask ask

397
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,400
them because that's gonna be tied to the

398
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,439
company's success and the other thing is

399
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,360
it's gonna be tied to his or her bonus

400
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,470
and that makes anybody excited right I

401
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,640
come to you I'm going to say I'm gonna

402
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:51,210
do this working it's gonna make you

403
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:52,920
money I'm excited right if you're not

404
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,210
reporting straight to the C so how's

405
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,040
your Cecil's bonus structure work you

406
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:59,370
make this E so happy chances are you

407
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:01,699
gonna get some budget right find this

408
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:04,230
button press it as often as possible

409
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,420
that's gonna start the conversations on

410
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:09,150
yes I understand the problem right I'd

411
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:12,540
frame the problem effectively this is

412
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:14,339
why it matters to the business so

413
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:16,980
conclusion we need to educate our

414
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:19,010
management we can't be letting them get

415
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:21,150
in there security news from the news

416
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:22,470
we're gonna relate to the solution to

417
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:24,120
the business and the problem and why

418
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,530
this matters and how it affects the

419
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,669
bottom line and we're gonna press that

420
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:29,520
bosses button all the time right so

421
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:31,080
that's step one step two is making the

422
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,750
problem real everybody knows Deming

423
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,669
right process genius of the 80s 70s 80s

424
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:39,630
somewhere on there stickler for metrics

425
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:42,060
right so if anybody here has never

426
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:44,310
managed KPIs or metrics or anything go

427
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:46,620
pick up this book it's on Amazon eBook

428
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:48,330
read it on the way home it gives you a

429
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:52,260
very good fundamental understanding of

430
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:56,040
what measurements and metrics are how

431
00:17:52,260 --> 00:18:00,750
many of you get asked this I should see

432
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:04,950
more hands this is our one job so how do

433
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:12,090
we answer this one not some of those

434
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:15,890
Russians right we are maintaining an

435
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,889
appropriate level of insecurity okay

436
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:22,689
how do we know if you can answer these

437
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:25,450
questions chances are you can skip this

438
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:27,190
part of the talk a problem is when we

439
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,900
get asked if we're secure we throw out a

440
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:30,250
whole bunch of words and this is what

441
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,650
they see sometimes where I've been using

442
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:34,510
words oh I'm gonna need a new sim to

443
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:36,310
write I OCS and I'm just spitting

444
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:38,340
letters now this is really hard to

445
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:41,950
understand if I'm not in the industry

446
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:43,419
this is easy I don't have to know about

447
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,040
your firewalls or anything - no

448
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,690
something happened between April and May

449
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:52,290
and since the graph is green it's

450
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:54,400
probably good to progress this is simple

451
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:56,320
so thank you for coming to talk to cell

452
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,220
you need to do know so how do we get you

453
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,510
all right so if you're in the American

454
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,460
education system you probably learn the

455
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:05,110
scientific method back in third or

456
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:07,480
fourth grade all right we're gonna ask

457
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:08,679
questions we make observations we're

458
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,030
gonna form a hypothesis we're gonna

459
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,050
figure out how to test that we're gonna

460
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,420
gather some data we're gonna make

461
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:15,460
recommendations up what we find

462
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:17,170
excellent maybe I'll learn this one

463
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:21,400
maybe they're teaching you this an agile

464
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:22,840
101 no see you dilute credit so I

465
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,980
believe it was the Air Force I got

466
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,750
credited with this who knows if they

467
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,400
actually came up with it but the theory

468
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:30,640
is I'm in a dogfight I'm a fighter pilot

469
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,830
I need to observe orient decide and act

470
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,140
as fast as possible to make sure that I

471
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:37,510
live whoever has the tighter you de loop

472
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,340
wins a dogfight same thing in security

473
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,530
same thing project management same thing

474
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:43,480
in business strategy whoever can react

475
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:46,389
faster to the changing environment is

476
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,490
going to win there's another one out

477
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:51,250
here that we cover in class I don't like

478
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:52,690
it it's really ugly but it kind of makes

479
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:56,680
sense so this is the critical decision

480
00:19:52,690 --> 00:20:00,070
map and what they do is you tell a story

481
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:02,140
so I'm going to do this because of this

482
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:04,629
and then I'm going to do this because

483
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:07,030
this and the person you're telling the

484
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:08,560
story to throws in Jack say yeah and you

485
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:10,360
handle the index oh if this were to

486
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,520
happen I would do this and you make sure

487
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,860
you get out to your fundamental

488
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,360
objective and if you didn't you figure

489
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:18,879
out why and then that's your process

490
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:21,310
break down this is a lot of crap to

491
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,920
remember I'll make it easy so those four

492
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:25,389
steps well question are we try and

493
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,910
answer cool we already did they form the

494
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,900
problem what day's going to show us the

495
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,820
answer

496
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,830
if I want to know which is heavier a

497
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:35,379
pound of rocks or pound of feathers I'm

498
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,520
probably gonna weigh them I'm gonna get

499
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,680
their masses and I'm gonna compare them

500
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,930
right how we gather data points of scale

501
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:43,750
so if we want to relate this to security

502
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:45,580
I have a theory that it takes 8 hours

503
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:48,550
from initial compromise the laptop to a

504
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:53,429
full-blown compromise the domain how do

505
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:56,290
we gather that data red teamers yeah oh

506
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:58,210
cool so we're gonna hire the red team

507
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:59,590
we're gonna come in and go hold crap

508
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:02,290
seven minutes is a lot less than eight

509
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:03,760
hours okay I'll represent the findings

510
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,830
this is who's our stake holders and

511
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:09,010
everything so again when we're gonna ask

512
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:11,169
are we secure we now have things oh well

513
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:13,660
we run a phishing campaign and last year

514
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:15,670
is a 33% click rate we introduced new

515
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:18,309
education systems now it's down to a 12

516
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:21,010
right metrics don't answer to questions

517
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:22,840
they reduce uncertainty so now we can

518
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:24,460
answer this in a fundamental way how are

519
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,959
we secure well I'm gonna throw a bunch

520
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,309
of numbers at you and those are gonna

521
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,110
make sense so now I'm not talking

522
00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:30,580
security I'm talking metrics and they

523
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:32,110
can understand that I can know that

524
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,919
numbers too big I want to drop that

525
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:35,379
number how do I do that

526
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,510
now we're talking about explain to the

527
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:39,429
solution right so now we have them

528
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:41,770
engaged in our problem we need to talk

529
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:43,630
about the solution so we're gonna throw

530
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:45,760
together all these different task lists

531
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:47,080
and plans we're gonna build some models

532
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,450
about how we're gonna go about it we're

533
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,010
gonna list the project benefits and this

534
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:52,390
is what you end up with right yeah I

535
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:55,179
already watched half with you this is

536
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:56,620
boring make your content to enjoyable

537
00:21:55,179 --> 00:21:59,800
and easy to understand anybody know what

538
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:00,729
this is it's an eye chart this is the

539
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,950
main page for one of the simplest

540
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:05,410
commands and commuting this is ping okay

541
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:06,940
I don't want to read this if you are not

542
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:10,870
following this Twitter account go do it

543
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:13,059
now b0r Kim Julia releases comics on

544
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:15,040
different commands and techniques and

545
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:17,230
everything in really nice ways I want to

546
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,428
read how Bing works now it's a comic

547
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:20,530
this is wonderful this is like Sunday

548
00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:21,320
newspaper all right so how do we do that

549
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:23,210
here

550
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,980
I refer to this in the last talk mist

551
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:28,810
anybody reading this documents and

552
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:31,160
staying awake nope all this is just for

553
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:35,060
inventory you need inventory break it

554
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:37,370
down all this all this stuff right here

555
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:38,690
can be set in four sentences just say

556
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:40,489
the four sentences this is easy to

557
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:43,700
understand I can grasp it and look I got

558
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:45,290
numbers on there too good going back to

559
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,300
this is a terrible screenshot anybody

560
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:49,190
know what I'm trying to convey here nope

561
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,629
make your screenshots easy to follow huh

562
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:56,480
I'm in a security conference

563
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:58,640
what is this trying to show Metasploit

564
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,210
cool what am I trying to tell in my

565
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,940
story

566
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:04,300
we have no idea oh yeah I'm trying to

567
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:08,690
show you that it's vulnerable Oh 8 67

568
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:12,220
honey this one's a little better welcome

569
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:12,220
and am i running and what am i doing

570
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:19,060
exponent users cool which user do I care

571
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:43,680
in the solution so this is how we solve

572
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,300
stuff right we create project charters

573
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:48,600
we create project plans for poles as all

574
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:49,980
this stuff and again who cares now let's

575
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,219
try something different so what we're

576
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:55,890
going to do is I got this problem it is

577
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:57,240
taking it takes about an hour from

578
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:59,940
initial compromise to fold the main

579
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,370
compromise and given our response times

580
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,290
and everything we get about 30 minutes

581
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:05,610
two hands on keyboard so we have less

582
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:07,170
than 30 minutes to react to this and

583
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,490
actually clean it up that's kind of crap

584
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:10,020
because there's no way we're gonna do

585
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:12,390
that so what I want to do is along at

586
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,620
that time and the way I'm gonna elongate

587
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:15,810
that is with an idea called active

588
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,649
defense and cyber deception that was

589
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:18,780
cool it worked

590
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:20,670
as I click the button everybody's eyes

591
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:22,740
straight to the screens you started

592
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:24,450
reading it you're engrossed in it you're

593
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:27,830
going to read what I want you to read

594
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:30,660
now and you're gonna like it right so

595
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:32,189
this is wonderful because management's

596
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,720
gonna read this and it's gonna govern

597
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:36,090
some questions and we're gonna start a

598
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,580
conversation about this here's a problem

599
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:40,350
that is absolutely useless to us as

600
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:42,360
technical people what the hell am I

601
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:44,429
gonna implement here no idea that's why

602
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,840
you do all this work still because this

603
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:49,580
work is gonna be what enables your

604
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,580
success to deliver on this one

605
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:24,280
we can enable frictionless work six and

606
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:27,280
seven go together generate the short

607
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:28,810
term wins make it easy to win and start

608
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:31,000
gaining that confidence in your board

609
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:33,280
because when you can do that and you

610
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,630
sustain the question isn't why do you

611
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,280
need a budget is how much do you need

612
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:38,470
and that's a really good place to be

613
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:41,200
these guys last step is Institute change

614
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:44,620
I don't like that one so many legacy hey

615
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:47,950
this is what we're here for it so in

616
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:49,719
conclusion well maybe one more tip

617
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:51,130
always have a conclusion side because if

618
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,900
you did this right this is a nice little

619
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:54,490
bow on your presentation all right third

620
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,340
trick is the conclusion is just the

621
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:58,690
agenda slide renamed because if you said

622
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:00,310
I'm gonna talk about this and you talk

623
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:02,770
about it this is what I talked about

624
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:06,879
alright I had one more them it's may a

625
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:08,770
legacy always in the collection so what

626
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,570
I want everybody to do here I talked a

627
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:12,160
little bit about all these different

628
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:13,210
problems that we have and why we have

629
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,710
the problems and how we're going to

630
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:16,090
solve them I want you to think about

631
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:18,520
personally who do you want to be in the

632
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:20,770
workplace I want you to think about how

633
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,660
you're going to do that what support do

634
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:24,400
you need who's gonna help you enable

635
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,780
your success how do you build these

636
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,670
relationships to make sure that you

637
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:29,830
become the trusted advisor the security

638
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:31,990
professional how do you become elite

639
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:34,449
right we are here to be the absolute

640
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:36,190
best that we can be getting budget is

641
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:37,360
going to enable you to do this and grow

642
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:39,940
and grow and grow

643
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:43,379
and with that I'm out of time thank you

644
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:43,380
everyone I got questions in the hallway

645
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:51,049
[Applause]

646
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:51,049
