1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:22,590
Oh No please don't send a picture of me

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:26,140
as your proof that you are here never

3
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:28,060
okay hi guys let's just go ahead and get

4
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,470
started I'm hope you're here for

5
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,660
learning how to break in to enter into

6
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:34,269
stuff if not you're in the wrong room I

7
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,249
have a lot of disclaimers I apologize my

8
00:00:34,269 --> 00:00:37,870
employer and my university do not

9
00:00:36,249 --> 00:00:40,359
contribute to this research or support

10
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:45,428
it in any way this does not reflect them

11
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:47,800
they don't they don't they're not a part

12
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:49,569
of this and all of the actions that I

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,809
did take in this research and the

14
00:00:49,569 --> 00:00:55,030
actions of my volunteers were not

15
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:57,309
unauthorized access we were permitted so

16
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,019
just as a clarification however this

17
00:00:57,309 --> 00:01:00,370
research does reflect my research

18
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:03,159
institute which is Purdue homeland

19
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:05,080
security Institute if at any time you

20
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:06,520
hate what I've said or you're super

21
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,620
critical of it or you have a security

22
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,720
concern please email that email address

23
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,390
right there it goes to my academic chair

24
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,060
aka think of that guy as the guy who

25
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:18,010
controls my entire life because he does

26
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,420
so go ahead and reach out to him if you

27
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:23,410
are concerned with anything that I have

28
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:25,660
said so in this talk I am going to share

29
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:27,789
with you how I break and enter into

30
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:30,310
large event venues and how some of my

31
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,990
volunteers have done so as well but I'm

32
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,430
kind of over the talks that just tell

33
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:36,310
you look at the cool things that I did

34
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:38,290
so slides that are in blue are going to

35
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,600
provide solutions or the reasons why

36
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:42,790
what I'm doing is working so that we can

37
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,949
actually make things better so they'll

38
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,990
look like this also I have a lot of

39
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,150
information to share and the span of 50

40
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:52,089
minutes so there will be content on the

41
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:55,010
slides that I don't get to if people

42
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:59,150
care I'll put them on the Internet

43
00:01:55,010 --> 00:02:01,790
so um hi I'm Alyssa some of you know me

44
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:05,030
as DMS princess and that's cool I do a

45
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:08,360
lot of things obviously I go to school I

46
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:09,949
have a job like a real job but um I'm

47
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,360
gonna be honest with you I'm doing all

48
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:13,579
of this just so I can be that like

49
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,890
really crazy professor that like does

50
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,690
weird things I don't take myself too

51
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,779
seriously but I take my research pretty

52
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:24,020
seriously so these are all the people

53
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,340
that I'm just trying to be in life but I

54
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,220
don't like talking about myself so

55
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:30,760
here's pictures of my dog because he's

56
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:33,770
like the most interesting part okay so

57
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:36,320
okay I've been breaking and entering for

58
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:38,810
a long time this specific research that

59
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,180
you're seeing I'm on year 4 of doing it

60
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:43,670
but I've been doing it outside of this

61
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,860
specific research site for longer than

62
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,780
that when I was a kid my friend Lorraine

63
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,120
and I would lock ourselves out of her

64
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,590
house and break it back into it for fun

65
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,930
because we're in Indiana and there's

66
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:57,830
nothing to do her mom wasn't really

67
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:58,670
thrilled by that idea but um yeah I love

68
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,680
breaking and entering

69
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:03,859
and I'm not the only one who did this

70
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,570
the slide says 200 and as of this week

71
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,459
we have now reached over 300

72
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:09,380
interactions with this venue so

73
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:10,970
volunteers who have helped me do this

74
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,350
before who have done the

75
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:14,510
breaking-and-entering research you can

76
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:17,420
raise your hands I'd like to remind you

77
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:20,239
that their lawyers are way better than

78
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:22,010
any lawyer you could ever get so if you

79
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,530
do ask my volunteers about what their

80
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:26,359
experiences are like remember they can't

81
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:30,590
disclose any information about the venue

82
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:33,050
or they will get super sued so why large

83
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:34,489
event venues I've heard a lot of stories

84
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:36,080
about people breaking and entering in

85
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:39,380
the office buildings I've done that

86
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,820
myself it's cool it's great but I found

87
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,799
large of it then used to be more of a

88
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:45,019
challenge and way more interesting

89
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,050
especially for like agar con talk right

90
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:51,920
so they're higher value targets and that

91
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:54,830
can be objects and people think famous

92
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,609
people right these people are people

93
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:58,000
that you're not going to necessarily

94
00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:00,870
encounter in an office building

95
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,480
additionally we have a lot of transient

96
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,950
employment in large event venues you

97
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,140
guys might have done it maybe when you

98
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:09,209
were a kid volunteered at a concession

99
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,119
stand to you know raise money for

100
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,830
something right and these are all

101
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,200
unauthenticated non badge non identified

102
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:18,959
people in your building and I love that

103
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:21,870
so I pick large event menus for this

104
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,280
reason they're super fun and that's what

105
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,200
I'm going to talk about a lot of what

106
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,359
I'm speaking about though can be applied

107
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,690
to your typical business or office

108
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,419
whatever it may be Gary here is gonna

109
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:37,650
help me out to give you some information

110
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:39,719
so you can say hi to Gary let's start

111
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:41,669
you're gonna have to start doing recon

112
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,139
right everyone knows how to do week on

113
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:44,760
and I'm not here to reinvent the wheel

114
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:47,490
to tell you how to do that

115
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,409
Osen is a very well covered topic in

116
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:52,620
this community I can recommend to you

117
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,840
like 50 people who can do that so I'm

118
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,000
going to try not to repeat things here's

119
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,650
what you definitely need to know about

120
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,440
what you're about to break and enter

121
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:03,539
into before you start phone numbers and

122
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,290
names are way more important than you

123
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,580
can imagine

124
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,710
you're going to keep these down and put

125
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,359
them in your phone it's not enough to be

126
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,250
like look at all these cool phone

127
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,760
numbers I found online that say do not

128
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:16,860
publish online right that's cool you're

129
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:19,110
going to need that hold on to it I'll

130
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,970
tell you what to do with it later you

131
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,520
need to find security policies and these

132
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,530
are very easy venues are in the business

133
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,109
of making money they want to sell

134
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,820
packages wedding packages catering all

135
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:32,729
sorts of stuff so they're gonna put

136
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:36,270
their security procedures as a sales

137
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:38,430
pitch online and they do it all the time

138
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,570
so you're gonna look that up you're

139
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,789
gonna look information about their

140
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:44,039
cameras I mean this is 2019 you put a

141
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:46,889
camera basically everywhere right but

142
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:48,270
not all cameras are the same and you're

143
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:50,190
gonna go ahead and look up things like

144
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:53,340
maps and loading docks we'll talk about

145
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:55,110
doors in a little bit but loading docks

146
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,929
are basically the best stores you can

147
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:00,060
pick now a fun thing that a lot of you

148
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:02,639
probably haven't considered when doing

149
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,860
reconnaissance are permits these

150
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,289
buildings need permits to hold events

151
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,580
outside of their regular fare so let's

152
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:11,280
say for example you're trying to break

153
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:13,650
into like a sporting arena their sports

154
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,969
events probably don't need a permit but

155
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,919
when they host that really gnarly

156
00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:19,169
monster truck show they're gonna have to

157
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:21,568
file a permit with your local government

158
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:22,919
whether that be the city the county it

159
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:26,189
does depend on what state you're in

160
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:28,560
these permits give out crazy amounts of

161
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:32,099
information so these are what you should

162
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,930
look for next if you haven't done any

163
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:35,909
like Google dorks or anything here are

164
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:38,129
some suggestions for you the only one I

165
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:40,860
really want to point out is target named

166
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:44,610
coca-cola is the most effective one I

167
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:47,039
found granted I've done this on venues

168
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:49,740
that do and don't have coca-cola as a

169
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:53,300
vendor it seems that a lot of their

170
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:56,879
information about like marketing and

171
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:58,830
delivery is included online so that's a

172
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,810
fun one I think you should try here's an

173
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:03,539
example of some information I found now

174
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:05,009
fun enough I found this when I started

175
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:06,870
you know writing and researching this

176
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:09,270
talk months ago but I didn't take a

177
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,979
picture of it and so I had to go back to

178
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:14,039
take a picture for these slides right

179
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:15,568
well the problem was you know the they

180
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:17,068
no longer existed they were no longer

181
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:18,330
available publicly on the internet that

182
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:20,159
venue learned their lesson

183
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:23,400
great job I'd like to remind you if

184
00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:27,389
that's not the venue that I did okay but

185
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:29,698
I still found it right and I'll address

186
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:31,050
that so here's mentioning about loading

187
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,490
docks it's talking about moving in

188
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,740
moving out time that might not be

189
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:36,870
specific but knowing how your loading

190
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,370
dock works if you need a key card or a

191
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:41,909
code or anything like that

192
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:43,830
is going to be wildly helpful so and yes

193
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:47,009
I just had a metal piece fall out of my

194
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:48,599
back so why does this work then use

195
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:51,029
frequently put this information online I

196
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:52,889
like I said to make money they want to

197
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:54,719
make money and try to get everything

198
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:57,150
that they can to get you to buy their

199
00:07:54,719 --> 00:08:00,240
product before you even contact them

200
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:01,560
don't write it's great if you post your

201
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,289
packages about how much it's going to

202
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,810
cost to feed 500 people you don't need

203
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:08,279
to put that your security cameras aren't

204
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,700
monitored and if they are you have to

205
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,880
pay

206
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,950
try you should never put that online and

207
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,020
additionally if your information is then

208
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,909
taken offline I can still find it on

209
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,370
Google we all know Google cache exists

210
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:21,750
the Wayback Machine archive.org you're

211
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,180
going to have to petition your search

212
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:27,900
engine of choice to remove this

213
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:30,090
information right so if this is you and

214
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,890
you have this information online it is

215
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:34,650
going to take way more work if it's been

216
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:36,120
indexed by a search engine so now you're

217
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,289
outside of your building let's say

218
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,860
you've done all your research you

219
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:44,010
possibly can and you're outside so let's

220
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,540
talk about beating evading cameras I put

221
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:47,370
the show down they'll go on here because

222
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:50,599
again I'm not here to reinvent the wheel

223
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:53,220
I hope you all know how to use showed in

224
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:56,280
showing it as a place that I start to

225
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,110
see what kind of cameras places have you

226
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,060
want to know what type of camera and

227
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,280
I'll go through a list and like describe

228
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:04,709
types of cameras I don't mean models you

229
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,990
don't need to go that specific you just

230
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:09,750
need to know what blind spots are

231
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,920
available and how often those cameras

232
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,960
are being looked at and how often

233
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:16,349
they're taking pictures so here's a

234
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:19,620
picture of a building on my campus it's

235
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:21,540
you know a building that is you know

236
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,090
being built and it has this nice little

237
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:27,870
time-lapse because it's a still image

238
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:30,120
camera it's not a live feed somehow even

239
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:32,040
though this camera is only taking

240
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,730
pictures on the 50 minute mark of the

241
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,980
hour some dumb kids still got caught

242
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:39,660
breaking in here because they couldn't

243
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:44,010
not get caught on a camera for two

244
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:46,740
seconds but that's fun so about this

245
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:49,260
camera because it's taking stills at a

246
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,630
mark that you can try to ascertain so

247
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,610
you're looking at these timestamps it's

248
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:55,890
an old school James Bond movie at this

249
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,490
point synchronize your watch don't get

250
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,680
caught

251
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:00,660
these cameras are often selected because

252
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,069
they are cheap they don't have a lot of

253
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,170
data to store because they're not

254
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:05,430
storing full video they're not showing a

255
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,750
ton of images

256
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,969
and they're mostly just there to look

257
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:11,070
pretty to show people this is a publicly

258
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:14,550
accessible camera so that's why I picked

259
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:16,620
it of a really fun building so you're

260
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,449
gonna have cameras that are recorded and

261
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,790
monitored or neither

262
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,440
you could have false cameras you can

263
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:24,990
have cameras that they only go back to

264
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,660
ask yourself do you really care if

265
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:29,430
you're on camera heads up I don't I

266
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,380
don't care if I'm doing everything

267
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,810
correctly inside of the building you

268
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,130
will never know that I'm there so you're

269
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,869
not going to go back to those cameras

270
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:38,820
and review them the only time I

271
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,980
particularly care about cameras is if

272
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,470
there is live monitoring which I am

273
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,600
sometimes willing to risk I would

274
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,280
recommend that if you are worried if

275
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,660
your cameras are being live monitored is

276
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,449
to look at the security policy of that

277
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,670
building if you must take those fun

278
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,950
phone numbers from earlier give mr.

279
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:57,750
important bossman a call and demand that

280
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:59,700
you know how secure this venue is before

281
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,680
you step foot in it not as yourself but

282
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,870
as a I don't know a vendor a client

283
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,849
whatever you want they will easily tell

284
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:08,670
you and try to pop out their chest about

285
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,810
how important their security is giving

286
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,420
you all the information to make

287
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:15,150
themselves sound important now where I

288
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:17,189
live over the bridge and West Lafayette

289
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:19,079
we are allowed to have false cameras

290
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,880
I've worked at a place that had false

291
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:23,540
cameras and people reported a theft and

292
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:27,210
I had to unfortunately sadly tell them

293
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:29,790
they're not real but in Lafayette just

294
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:31,320
you know a mile away boss cameras are

295
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,870
completely illegal they can't have any

296
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,040
of them you cannot have them on public

297
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:37,110
business you cannot have them in a

298
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,449
public area they must be real cameras

299
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:42,120
knowing if where you're living allows

300
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:43,650
you to have false cameras or not we'll

301
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,860
help you determine if you're at greater

302
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:48,360
risk I am more nervous obviously in a

303
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,570
place that doesn't allow false cameras

304
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:55,530
but it's up to you so you have these

305
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:58,560
cameras I would not push if you are a

306
00:11:55,530 --> 00:12:01,199
venue owner or anything for a longer

307
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,510
recording time monitoring is way more

308
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,040
valuable that live interaction because

309
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:06,509
again if I'm doing my job

310
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,610
right you're not going to go look at

311
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:10,620
those cameras in the first place so if

312
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:13,529
you can afford to have life monitoring

313
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,720
go ahead and do so how frequently are

314
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:18,089
you going to review those cameras if you

315
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,399
only have enough data to store 72 hours

316
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:22,500
worth of camera time who's actually

317
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,079
going to go back and look at it every 72

318
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,190
hours if someone's not doing that then

319
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:27,569
you're losing the data that you're

320
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:29,639
recording anyway and your camera is

321
00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:31,050
basically useless I'd also like to

322
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:32,759
friendly remind you that if you're for

323
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,979
some reason going to not connect your

324
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:36,329
camera to the Internet you must put it

325
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,740
on a private network we all know how

326
00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:40,138
Showdown works right because these

327
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:43,110
cameras are publicly accessible you

328
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:44,519
don't need that it takes what 30 seconds

329
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,959
to get on a VPN or I don't know Cisco

330
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:50,339
and it connected could take an hour who

331
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:51,660
cares but like right get on a VPN it

332
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:53,819
does not need to be on a publicly

333
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,689
accessible network so now you're going

334
00:12:53,819 --> 00:12:57,599
to look for doors

335
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:59,459
I love doors you are going to look for

336
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,100
doors outside of your venue to walk in

337
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:04,469
in I test my venue by smuggling into

338
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,660
objects a lot I may like a lot of them

339
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:07,920
so I'm gonna go through the front door

340
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,779
and we're gonna talk about that later

341
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,089
but if you're trying to not get caught

342
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:14,100
you're gonna look for a side door how

343
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:16,139
can you tell in a giant building with

344
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,029
many many many doors which door is the

345
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:20,670
right door for you your girl look for

346
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:21,930
doors that are worn down hand oil on

347
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,189
people's hands and like your skin

348
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:26,160
everyone has it don't be grossed out

349
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:27,990
it's going to wear down handles for

350
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,040
doors it's going to smudge them up it's

351
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:32,069
going to be evident that they're more

352
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,599
used right with cake plates the cake

353
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:36,120
plates is like the lower part of the

354
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,730
door like 6 inches from the bottom right

355
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:41,519
that area is going to get used and abuse

356
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:43,680
every time a cart comes in every time

357
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,380
someone's kicking it open the more used

358
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,870
and abused the door no more often people

359
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:51,120
go through it why does that matter it's

360
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:53,220
likely employees I've never seen a

361
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,529
customer of a venue like going to a

362
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,319
concert and being like yeah a door kick

363
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:59,880
right that doesn't happen so it's the

364
00:13:58,319 --> 00:14:01,199
people actually working there and if

365
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,810
it's the people actually working there

366
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:06,630
and there's not a badge reader outside

367
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:08,430
you can bet it's probably unlocked so if

368
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:10,019
you're going to look for a door you're

369
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,609
not going to look for a door that's all

370
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:13,260
nice and pristine and you're not gonna

371
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:14,339
look for a door with words on it because

372
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,740
no one labels there

373
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:18,689
Wars like here's all the good stuff the

374
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:22,589
back entrance no one knows about right

375
00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:25,349
no one does that if this door is locked

376
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:27,779
I wouldn't recommend this door be the

377
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:29,999
one that you pick or shim someone might

378
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:32,189
be behind that door and super super

379
00:14:29,999 --> 00:14:36,660
super mad at you you should also

380
00:14:32,189 --> 00:14:39,599
consider just waiting right because if

381
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,819
you wait like Tim and I saw yesterday

382
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,139
there just might be a door propped open

383
00:14:41,819 --> 00:14:49,498
with a switch for some reason outside

384
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:52,499
just open just nicely cracked go through

385
00:14:49,499 --> 00:14:54,959
that right opportunities present

386
00:14:52,499 --> 00:14:57,959
themself in funny ways so again why does

387
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,180
this work if you're not going to have

388
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:02,969
some actual security behind that door

389
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:05,489
again locking it could probably prohibit

390
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:07,259
you know workflow if you're carrying and

391
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:08,999
like big trucks of merchandise through a

392
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:10,860
door it's going to be a pain in the butt

393
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:12,870
to lock it all the time you're probably

394
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,819
gonna want to have someone behind it if

395
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,709
not at least make the door less

396
00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:19,290
accessible for someone like me right

397
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:20,849
keep it up make it clean look it look

398
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:23,610
like that nice pristine door that no one

399
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:25,620
ever uses try to remove those indicators

400
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:27,209
that I mentioned so you're gonna ask

401
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,040
yourself a couple of questions do you

402
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:31,619
want to break into a locked door and

403
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:35,550
again this is a door outside most of the

404
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:38,069
time I don't recommend that lock picking

405
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:39,420
unless you've practiced it for a super

406
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:41,899
long time I'm gonna guess it's gonna

407
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:44,819
take most people 30 seconds or more it's

408
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:47,819
often not worth it because these places

409
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:49,889
have so many entrances if you do want to

410
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:51,540
break into that door just make sure that

411
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:54,540
you examine the door for any like

412
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:56,009
sensors I know not everyone has magnets

413
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,829
implanted in their hands so like feel

414
00:15:56,009 --> 00:16:00,839
for the magnetic sensors carry like one

415
00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:02,819
of those rare earth magnets in your

416
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:05,370
pocket you know just grab one of those

417
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:07,079
put it in if your doors metallic and

418
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:09,929
itself oops sorry you can't use that

419
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:13,859
trick I've seen people use lasers I've

420
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:16,040
seen people use like can't air all sorts

421
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:19,790
of stuff to look for these

422
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,930
do your best so there's probably better

423
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:23,060
option that door

424
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:25,160
it's a loading dock Ilona dock is huge

425
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:27,079
they are meant to fit semis ambulances

426
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,760
especially like I said there are really

427
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,040
really important people at these venues

428
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,200
sometimes when they're there I guarantee

429
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,930
you there is an ambulance under wherever

430
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:38,030
you are right these are left open and

431
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,800
are meant for easy removal and access

432
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,300
you're going to walk through the most

433
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:45,290
giant door possible like you're a little

434
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:46,930
ant-man so do you need to be hidden by

435
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:49,730
security a hundred percent of the time

436
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:51,500
no this is not like an office building

437
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:54,170
where every single person has a nametag

438
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:56,720
and a badge right I don't have to prove

439
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:59,030
that I work there I could be whoever the

440
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,390
heck I want so do I have to be there all

441
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:03,290
the time

442
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:05,690
no also security and law enforcement

443
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:08,119
presence doesn't necessarily always help

444
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:10,459
I'm about to show you a statistic for my

445
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:13,698
research that I've done over time and I

446
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:16,339
want you to take it with like more than

447
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:18,020
a grain of salt right I'm continuing to

448
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:19,458
do this research over the years one of

449
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,579
the reasons is because I'm trying to

450
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:24,410
explain this variable so my volunteers

451
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:26,690
actually have to fill out an assessment

452
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:29,120
while they're going through the venue on

453
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:31,910
their phones and like I said I have over

454
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,649
300 for that now different interactions

455
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:35,030
and that's different people write a lot

456
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:37,550
of people do them multiple multiple

457
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:40,160
times and I had a variable called

458
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:41,450
attempt success which is did you break

459
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,580
into the thing that you said you were

460
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:46,100
going to like the super secret room or

461
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:48,530
whatever right when they did this

462
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,179
variable officers visible is a variable

463
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,470
that I asked hey can you see law

464
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,780
enforcement officers outside of the

465
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:55,730
venue these are for only seeing them

466
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:58,250
outside not inside so not inside and

467
00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:01,550
outside now just inside right just

468
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:04,310
outside so what's this fancy graph say

469
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:06,860
it says that when officers are present

470
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:11,500
only outside the attempt success of my

471
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:14,000
volunteers went up five times right so

472
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:16,490
reconsider that now let's go ahead and

473
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,490
walk into the building I will let you

474
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:21,260
guys know I love metal detectors in fact

475
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:24,020
I considered giving this talk on dressed

476
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:25,430
metal detectors but I thought you all

477
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,660
would get bored because I'm pretty sure

478
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,840
I'm the only one that loves them to this

479
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,370
degree

480
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,928
we have two types of metal detectors

481
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,489
that you're going to walk through we

482
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:35,070
have walked through metal detectors like

483
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:36,900
the name says and we have hand wands

484
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:39,000
also abbreviated really knowingly

485
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,220
handheld metal detectors these are

486
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,970
pretty great and they work very very

487
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:46,860
very differently your decision-making is

488
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:51,000
going to be judged based on how these

489
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:54,779
work so if you think you could force a

490
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,980
false negative which I do go ahead and

491
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:58,169
try to walk through the walk through

492
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,480
metal detector if you want to force the

493
00:18:58,169 --> 00:19:02,549
false positive or you have a false flag

494
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,340
on you you're gonna go with the hand

495
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:07,110
wand the hand wand is not a great tool

496
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,789
and I'll be demonstrating that for you

497
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:12,479
guys today so you could take a look and

498
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:14,580
just see how awful it is so we're gonna

499
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,870
make those decisions how do you know if

500
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,500
you can make that false positive or

501
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,820
false negative

502
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,490
you're gonna ask yourself these

503
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,700
questions what are you trying to smuggle

504
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:25,049
in is it prohibited and non ferrous

505
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:27,419
what's prohibited and non ferrous you

506
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:30,570
might ask a lot of venues prevent you

507
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:33,029
bring in things like beach balls if you

508
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:35,820
guys went to Def Con this year you might

509
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:38,520
know why beach balls are prohibited

510
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:42,750
maybe because they destroyed seven

511
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:43,860
ceiling tiles right so those things

512
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,490
aren't gonna get caught through a metal

513
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,379
detector

514
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:47,390
you don't want security to look at you

515
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,770
more than they have to

516
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:51,390
you're gonna put that on your person no

517
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,679
one here is in here to smuggle beach

518
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,159
balls so let's talk about the things

519
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:55,320
that matter

520
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:56,880
they're probably ferrous or ferrous type

521
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,059
which just means that they themselves

522
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,470
are magnetic or have metallic properties

523
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:02,879
and depending on how you put them on

524
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:06,779
your body will depend if you can make a

525
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,730
false positive or not so for example

526
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:10,289
this is one thing that keeps falling out

527
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,640
of my back because I can't strap it to

528
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:13,730
myself because I was going to take off

529
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,200
my clothes for you all no not really

530
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:19,230
it's an object that has a very large

531
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,149
surface area and is metallic and when

532
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:24,000
actually wanded when it's in my back

533
00:20:21,149 --> 00:20:26,050
very very difficult to find because how

534
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,880
far it's spread out

535
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:31,360
I had the pleasure of having a walk

536
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:34,240
through metal detector for like six

537
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,949
months in my research lab and by the way

538
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,480
if any of you have a spare walk through

539
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:39,970
metal detector and would like to rehome

540
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:42,250
it to a really deserving researcher I'd

541
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,150
be very very happy if you helped me out

542
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,910
okay

543
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:47,710
anyway we had a huge box of knives and

544
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:49,180
weapons and stuff and we would practice

545
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,830
smuggling them through the walk through

546
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,960
metal detector and one thing that we

547
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:55,149
found was that when you can increase the

548
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,220
surface area of the object it was much

549
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:58,710
much easier to sneak through and I'll

550
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,670
show you an image of why that works

551
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:03,640
let's talk about handheld

552
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:06,400
false-positives first a proper handheld

553
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:09,310
wand is supposed to be used in a very

554
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,650
very specific way and I guarantee you no

555
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:15,340
one does it right imagine you have one

556
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:17,680
of those child's water wings on the

557
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:20,770
actual paddle part of the metal detector

558
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:23,140
that water wings should be touching the

559
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:25,900
person's skin can you actually use a

560
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:28,150
water wing now it'll it will interfere

561
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:30,190
it won't work but why I say that is

562
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:31,420
because you have to scan the person two

563
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:33,940
to six inches away from their body

564
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:35,950
anything closer than two inches is a

565
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:38,290
false positive you're going to get

566
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:41,190
things that are not metallic at all that

567
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:43,480
will set it off it's not effective so

568
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:46,360
how can you force a handheld monitor

569
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:49,120
vector false positive by when the

570
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:51,580
security person goes to scan you by you

571
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,439
moving it closer to the hand wand which

572
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:56,710
do it slowly enough so they don't really

573
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,470
see it you will annoy them and wear them

574
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:03,130
down your goal here is for them either

575
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:05,860
to say oh your belt is what setting it

576
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:07,150
off or but then to just give up because

577
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,760
they don't want to screen you anymore

578
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:13,260
both have worked very effectively for me

579
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:16,750
I went to a babymetal concert recently

580
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:18,220
dressed in black and a lot of metallic

581
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,900
chains and I looked at the security

582
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,040
woman if she looked at me and I'm like

583
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,740
I'm not making that through that metal

584
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,480
detector I'm just not and she decided

585
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:27,220
yeah you know what you're not you're

586
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,750
gonna pat-down just completely removing

587
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,160
the metal detector in the first place so

588
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,490
if you can hold that kind of move and

589
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,679
never get scanned

590
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:36,350
I recommend it let's talk about hand how

591
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,029
hand wands work this is an old image of

592
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:39,379
a very very old metal detector that's

593
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:40,700
walked through but we don't use them

594
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,529
anymore so we're just going to pretend

595
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:45,380
like it's the same picture before a hand

596
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:47,059
wand okay that paddle is going to have

597
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,399
two different coils a sending and

598
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:51,320
receiving coil this sending coil will

599
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:52,580
try to obviously send current to the

600
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,950
receiving coil and when it is

601
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:56,689
interrupted there is an audio module

602
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:58,130
inside of the hand wand to set it off

603
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:00,500
and make a really really annoying noise

604
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:02,899
the thing about hand wands is you cannot

605
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,620
adjust the level of them they work or

606
00:23:02,899 --> 00:23:05,600
they don't

607
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:08,779
there's no way to increase the strength

608
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:11,779
dumb it down none of that it's pretty

609
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:14,630
basic and that basic utility is easily

610
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:17,179
exploitable now to create a walk through

611
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:19,640
metal detector false-positive you have

612
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:22,220
to know how they work pretty intimately

613
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:25,070
I know not everyone has the ability to

614
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:27,559
take one of these home with them so let

615
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:29,149
me try to explain you still have that

616
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:31,340
sending and receiving coil on the

617
00:23:29,149 --> 00:23:33,110
panel's of the metal detector but you

618
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:35,480
have many many other things that go up

619
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:38,178
against one metal detectors have

620
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,340
sensitivity everything from we're not

621
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:44,470
letting anything in but a big aluminium

622
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:46,158
box to the foil of a toothpaste like

623
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,210
container you like when you buy

624
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,730
toothpaste you have to peel off that

625
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:52,220
little metallic foil they can catch that

626
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:56,240
do metal detectors ever get set this

627
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:58,100
high really only in prison so I'm not

628
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,630
here to help you break out of prison you

629
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:03,139
can come to my next con talk when I talk

630
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:04,880
about that okay hmm so walk through

631
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:06,529
metal detectors are now multi zoned and

632
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,230
frequently they're the kind that are

633
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:11,360
here on the right sometimes the cheaper

634
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:13,850
ones are like the one in the middle the

635
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,399
whole point of multi zoning is to try to

636
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:18,260
give the security personnel an idea of

637
00:24:16,399 --> 00:24:21,080
where the object is they're supposed to

638
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:23,390
get for you but here's the problem with

639
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:26,149
them not all the zones are created equal

640
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:28,010
this is actually a zone from the metal

641
00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:30,620
detector that I have there are

642
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:32,429
overlapping zones so in total there are

643
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:34,709
33

644
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:35,879
ones that are around here and here so

645
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:38,460
that's going to be everything from zone

646
00:24:35,879 --> 00:24:40,740
two and a half to four are different

647
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,350
than the zones higher or lower on your

648
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:45,749
body higher up it's going to be more

649
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:49,168
sensitive the ability to let the metal

650
00:24:45,749 --> 00:24:51,539
go is not going to be there for some

651
00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:52,830
people in my research lab we were trying

652
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:55,080
to get stuff through metal detectors

653
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:57,449
they found the most effective place to

654
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:00,029
put stuff was on their sides like their

655
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:01,889
hips that wasn't the case for me mine

656
00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:03,539
was the lower back it changes for

657
00:25:01,889 --> 00:25:05,549
everyone but if you're going to try to

658
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:07,529
smuggle things through put it in the

659
00:25:05,549 --> 00:25:09,269
more dense part of your body your hips

660
00:25:07,529 --> 00:25:11,549
and your femurs are like really big

661
00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:13,860
bones so you're gonna try to put them

662
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:16,559
there additionally many walk through

663
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:19,049
metal detectors remove zone 6 which is

664
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,090
this bottom one here because if that

665
00:25:19,049 --> 00:25:23,009
metal detector is on concrete flooring

666
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:25,439
that concrete flooring is most likely

667
00:25:23,009 --> 00:25:27,899
made with rebar in it which is metal

668
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,830
which they have to negate now this isn't

669
00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:31,498
always the case

670
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:34,110
zone 6 when active is supposed to touch

671
00:25:31,499 --> 00:25:36,059
the floor but it frequently doesn't scan

672
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:39,389
the bottom two inches because those

673
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:41,460
metal detectors are on casters right so

674
00:25:39,389 --> 00:25:43,709
if you are able to put something at the

675
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,659
very very bottom of your shoe you could

676
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:48,299
try that as well we've gotten in

677
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:51,389
everything from box cutters small

678
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:53,369
objects to entire smartphones by putting

679
00:25:51,389 --> 00:25:54,928
them in the bottom of your shoe yes this

680
00:25:53,369 --> 00:25:57,480
is why the airport asks you to take your

681
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:59,369
shoes off because venues are in the

682
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,950
business of making money there likely

683
00:25:59,369 --> 00:26:04,408
aren't going to have everyone do that so

684
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:06,409
in order to show you how this works I'm

685
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:09,450
gonna need a security guard to help me

686
00:26:06,409 --> 00:26:13,129
so everyone is going to welcome my very

687
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:13,129
trusty security guard Tim

688
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:22,390
I promise you he is the perfect security

689
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:24,800
garden he's fantastic hike them

690
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:28,190
now Tim just so you know I am wearing

691
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,840
this microphone it's going to set off

692
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:36,730
that microphone so we're gonna we're

693
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:36,730
going to figure it out a microphone

694
00:26:37,149 --> 00:26:50,268
sorry kid okey yeah okay so um Tim I've

695
00:26:48,349 --> 00:26:51,468
asked him I've told Tim Tims actually

696
00:26:50,269 --> 00:26:54,229
one of the volunteers who's done this

697
00:26:51,469 --> 00:26:56,330
before I'd like to remind you that all

698
00:26:54,229 --> 00:26:58,129
of my volunteers are highly skilled and

699
00:26:56,330 --> 00:27:02,029
very employable but not him

700
00:26:58,129 --> 00:27:03,918
I need him so move away alright Tim

701
00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:19,519
could you uh could you be a typical

702
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:22,639
security guard at a venue please he has

703
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:24,200
now paid attention now Tim I'm gonna

704
00:27:22,639 --> 00:27:26,178
hold this microphone in my hand this

705
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,249
should surprise none of you that uh can

706
00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:32,479
we show them it's gonna set it off all

707
00:27:28,249 --> 00:27:33,769
right so can you could you run me down

708
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:41,089
like I'm going to a concert

709
00:27:33,769 --> 00:27:43,249
please it hit on you and not on me yeah

710
00:27:41,089 --> 00:27:45,529
that's about how that works and attempt

711
00:27:43,249 --> 00:27:47,629
did that because more than one venue

712
00:27:45,529 --> 00:27:49,759
that I went to that was there screaming

713
00:27:47,629 --> 00:27:52,549
method you could probably already figure

714
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:54,609
out how that was terrible so can we try

715
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:54,609
again

716
00:27:59,379 --> 00:28:05,478
Tim's touching me he should not be

717
00:28:02,719 --> 00:28:09,200
touching me first off this should create

718
00:28:05,479 --> 00:28:11,389
wild false positives I have still many

719
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,299
many many metallic objects on my person

720
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:16,549
at the moment and so that should have

721
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:19,639
worked and yet it didn't now Tim can we

722
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:23,119
please attempt to not piss off Gary any

723
00:28:19,639 --> 00:28:26,539
more and try to do it the way that it is

724
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:29,019
prescribed by the Department of Homeland

725
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:29,019
Security

726
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:42,670
do you see how this is taking forever

727
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:46,960
no one does this it's also still not

728
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:48,340
working okay look I know that this came

729
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,190
out but this is like the easiest thing

730
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:52,419
to actually hide so like I said I was

731
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:54,970
gonna strap it to me like I normally

732
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:55,870
would but uh I'm not taking off my

733
00:28:54,970 --> 00:29:00,760
clothes for all of you

734
00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:02,919
it is it self Faris but I still have a

735
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:06,930
lot more so could you please do it the

736
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,930
way that I actually recommend to do it

737
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,910
he's doing it like he is before but

738
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:23,800
there's gonna be a change here in a

739
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:28,630
second oh yeah I do thanks I don't have

740
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:31,570
steel toed boots on why is it not

741
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:40,210
hitting the microphone me oh hey my

742
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:41,439
badge the boots again fun part is he's

743
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:46,570
not even hitting on the boots where the

744
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:48,100
actual weapons are so I like raking a

745
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:50,889
lot more than picking when I have to be

746
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:52,510
fast so I keep a bag of rakes with me

747
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:53,740
there's also by the way this is an

748
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:55,600
example of something that you shouldn't

749
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,830
try to smuggle through the one thing

750
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,709
that I actually have difficulty getting

751
00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:01,570
in are chains because they're so dense

752
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:03,130
we've got lock picks I've got a knife at

753
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:04,240
the bottom of my boot which I'll take

754
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:06,340
off at the end for people who want to

755
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,370
call my bluff and for when I actually

756
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:13,230
need to open doors I have this very

757
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:15,760
giant shim none of that

758
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:17,740
what's him picked up on scanning my

759
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,540
boots we're the little D rings on the

760
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:22,210
back of it so I could fold my boots down

761
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:26,110
to be cute but fashion is not a crime

762
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:30,840
and he didn't find it so thank you for

763
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:30,840
being a great security guard Tim

764
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:35,620
[Applause]

765
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,500
you know what I might just keep this

766
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:41,559
handheld Mike Oh we'll try it out

767
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:43,690
Oh quick fact here Tim give me that give

768
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:46,059
me that Mohan walk back so if you guys

769
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:48,100
haven't met me before I have a lot of

770
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:50,889
things implanted in me I have four

771
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:53,168
magnets and a various range of chips and

772
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:55,659
when people ask me about biohacking

773
00:30:53,169 --> 00:30:57,100
they frequently asked what about metal

774
00:30:55,659 --> 00:30:58,380
detectors it's not gonna help for

775
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:02,889
airport security

776
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:06,039
no I've never been like on the other

777
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:07,450
side of prison so I guess I don't know

778
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:10,059
if that would actually matter for them

779
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:13,450
but even for metal detectors in order to

780
00:31:10,059 --> 00:31:15,879
create that to go off I have many ships

781
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:17,200
in both hands to set it off you're going

782
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,380
to have to get in false-positive range

783
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,179
and I use that on purpose to force false

784
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:24,429
positives because people look at your

785
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:27,190
hands that are like there's nothing

786
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:28,539
there it's not going to trip a walk

787
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:30,760
through metal detector that's not how

788
00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:33,640
walk through metal detectors work the

789
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:35,710
zoning won't pick it up in your hands so

790
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,299
in order to get it through the hand wand

791
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:40,210
you're gonna have to put your hand

792
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:42,429
closer than two inches to the actual

793
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:44,320
hand wand but for a walk through metal

794
00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:45,970
detectors the answer is no so for

795
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,220
everyone who's wanted to implant lights

796
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:50,340
under their skin get a ton of magnets

797
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:53,409
hey security guard you dropped your

798
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:56,350
so for everyone who's ever wanted to do

799
00:31:53,409 --> 00:31:59,580
that it's not going to matter if you

800
00:31:56,350 --> 00:32:01,928
have more questions about biohacking and

801
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:05,020
security procedures you can tweet me at

802
00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:06,399
dns princess k why does this work the

803
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:08,260
levels of those walk through metal

804
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:10,209
detectors which I promise I would have

805
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,260
for you if I could so please be home one

806
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:14,710
to me

807
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:16,539
they're usually set very low how do you

808
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:19,330
know as the penetration tester that

809
00:32:16,539 --> 00:32:21,760
they're set low look at signage these

810
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:23,590
venues typically say these things can

811
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,190
stay in your pocket and these things

812
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:27,939
can't

813
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:30,250
if coins and keys are allowed to stay in

814
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:33,880
your pocket your event level is set

815
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:36,760
anywhere from 145 to 185

816
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:38,590
this is too low I've tried to tell my

817
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,580
venue that I've tried to tell a lot of

818
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:41,740
venues that

819
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:43,629
I told one venue that I have one venue

820
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:45,010
that I did that is much much much much

821
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:48,370
bigger than the one that I'm researching

822
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:49,540
here and their security practices are so

823
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:51,100
terrible and they took none of my

824
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:53,680
feedback that I don't go there anymore

825
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:56,790
so these levels are set poorly and way

826
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:58,900
too low and are poorly calibrated also

827
00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:00,070
they're not the most secure things on

828
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,480
the face little planet but you're gonna

829
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:05,350
have to donate me a metal detector to

830
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:08,110
find out okay so security personnel get

831
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:10,149
worn down very very easy they are easy

832
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:12,040
to manipulate they are getting paid what

833
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:15,160
nine dollars an hour they don't really

834
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:16,270
care so even if their people are doing

835
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,760
it correctly

836
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:19,870
let's say half of your staff is actually

837
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:22,300
doing what they're supposed to be doing

838
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:24,879
it doesn't matter

839
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:26,530
let me show you some cool data I got so

840
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,750
these are a bunch of variables that I

841
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:31,000
got from my research and what this fancy

842
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:34,000
chart is trying to tell you is these top

843
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,560
two ignore the the like rows past the

844
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,760
top two okay we only care about the top

845
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:42,220
two right now we have attempt so did you

846
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:45,790
attempt to break into stuff and attempt

847
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:47,680
success was it successful it came back

848
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:49,540
with the relationship with three of my

849
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,250
variables were they using the walk

850
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:53,830
through metal detectors properly it

851
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:55,180
should be no shock to you that when the

852
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:57,460
walk through metal detector screeners

853
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:59,230
aren't doing their job data it's not

854
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:01,300
being done properly like in there you're

855
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:03,820
gonna get through right that seems

856
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:06,909
obvious the variable next to it is Lane

857
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:09,159
consistency which basically says that if

858
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:11,620
the security practitioners that are

859
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:13,480
there aren't doing the same things as

860
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:15,429
each other they aren't mimicking this

861
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:17,230
thing stuff some of them seem serious

862
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:20,489
some of them don't some of them seem

863
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:23,139
lacks just that consistently is

864
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:25,600
significantly related to my two

865
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:29,049
variables the negative in here it means

866
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:31,330
that the less consistent they are the

867
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:33,400
more easy it is to break in enter and

868
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:36,520
for that attempt success it didn't

869
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:38,920
matter if my volunteer or I went through

870
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:41,050
the good metal detector screening simply

871
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,490
the inconsistencies made it more

872
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:44,409
successful and again

873
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:46,089
and I had that officers visible variable

874
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:47,440
I'm not gonna touch that with a ten-foot

875
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:50,290
pole until I've done this research for

876
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,659
like three more years okay so let's get

877
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:55,149
in further you're now past security or

878
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:56,710
you picked the right door or you still

879
00:34:55,149 --> 00:34:58,390
have this box cutter at your boot that

880
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:01,650
kind of hurts but you did it anyway

881
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:04,029
right so how do you know we're going

882
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:07,119
those venues I told you they're in the

883
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:08,470
business of making money this is not my

884
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:12,640
client I picked it because we're all

885
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:15,189
here right now okay so this is a really

886
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,810
really nice very and detailed map of

887
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:18,910
where we are right now

888
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:20,380
all the rooms all the doors all the

889
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:22,629
entrances and all the emergency

890
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:27,340
entrances keep this with you

891
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:29,590
okay next you're going to have to set

892
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:31,300
yourself some goals you need to get out

893
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:33,160
of sight from security if you just

894
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:35,140
especially through them a false flag

895
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,149
there are already a little upset with

896
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:39,160
you you're gonna go even if you walk

897
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:42,100
through the employee entrance you're

898
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:47,379
still going to want to thank you new mic

899
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:53,170
because this one's gonna die yeah so let

900
00:35:47,380 --> 00:36:09,040
me change this out for a second oh maybe

901
00:35:53,170 --> 00:36:10,180
the new mic anyway both of them don't

902
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,800
work okay this one's fine

903
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:14,529
I'll let them turn this on I want to

904
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,930
makes an annoying noise I'm sorry so I

905
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:18,970
put down bathrooms I go to the bathroom

906
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:20,440
usually to take off all the gear that I

907
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:23,799
just smuggled in because it can be kind

908
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:25,990
of difficult but one time I picked a

909
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,340
unisex bathroom on a floor that the

910
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:29,529
public isn't supposed to get to there's

911
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:32,070
a whole floor of this place no one from

912
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:33,550
the public should be and I was there

913
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:36,640
honestly

914
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:38,350
to use the bathroom and I noticed there

915
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,299
were hangers on the floor the kind that

916
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:44,830
you get from Walmart Oh is just working

917
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:46,600
on that's right oh heck yeah so I was in

918
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:48,670
there and I saw these hangers on the

919
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,380
floor which gave me the idea that

920
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:52,510
someone obviously just changed their

921
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:54,779
clothing who changes their clothing on a

922
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:58,229
venue like that on a restricted floor

923
00:36:54,779 --> 00:37:00,989
personnel and when I was there I looked

924
00:36:58,229 --> 00:37:04,919
around on top of the sanitary napkin

925
00:37:00,989 --> 00:37:06,869
container I put my hand up a badge not

926
00:37:04,919 --> 00:37:08,669
just a badge not just any other badge

927
00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:11,009
because I can fake those right I can

928
00:37:08,669 --> 00:37:13,769
fake an employee badge no no no no no

929
00:37:11,009 --> 00:37:16,859
this was a security badge to open all

930
00:37:13,769 --> 00:37:20,218
the doors in the venue all of them it

931
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:23,098
was an all-access badge that was so bad

932
00:37:20,219 --> 00:37:25,589
I considered is this even in my scope I

933
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:26,219
called for a backup because it was that

934
00:37:25,589 --> 00:37:28,349
terrible

935
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:30,390
so bathrooms I guess are a little bit

936
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:32,189
more fun honestly though I'm gonna

937
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:35,549
recommend that you look for an office or

938
00:37:32,189 --> 00:37:37,439
a conference room next ok somewhere with

939
00:37:35,549 --> 00:37:39,719
a phone somewhere with internet and

940
00:37:37,439 --> 00:37:41,308
somewhere where you can do stuff I'll

941
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:43,169
get to the whole internet thing in a

942
00:37:41,309 --> 00:37:45,479
second but here are lots of other areas

943
00:37:43,169 --> 00:37:47,069
that you can hide and go look for you're

944
00:37:45,479 --> 00:37:50,609
gonna claim this space is your own and

945
00:37:47,069 --> 00:37:52,919
use it as an asset ok so how do you

946
00:37:50,609 --> 00:37:55,259
identify what's behind that door if

947
00:37:52,919 --> 00:37:57,719
you've had the pleasure of talking to me

948
00:37:55,259 --> 00:38:00,539
for more than two hours you'll probably

949
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:03,239
know that I'm a super shill for wiggle

950
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:06,809
when I say that hashtag not sponsored

951
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:08,209
hashtag I wish I was trust me I'll do

952
00:38:06,809 --> 00:38:12,150
anything for wiggle

953
00:38:08,209 --> 00:38:14,519
it's a wardriving platform it maps Wi-Fi

954
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:15,839
on maps how is this going to help you

955
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:18,598
we're not going to use it for its

956
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:20,939
purpose we're actually going to look for

957
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:24,380
devices so everyone and their mom these

958
00:38:20,939 --> 00:38:27,328
days has a fitness band a smartphone

959
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:29,039
printer HP printer is to set off the

960
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:31,529
best wireless networks at least for

961
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:33,630
wardriving for me so I specifically much

962
00:38:31,529 --> 00:38:37,019
them and then other stupid printers all

963
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:39,659
printers are stupid but we have all

964
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:42,808
these things my desk from Ikea is

965
00:38:39,659 --> 00:38:45,209
Bluetooth - so there's Bluetooth and

966
00:38:42,809 --> 00:38:47,489
literally everything so I stood outside

967
00:38:45,209 --> 00:38:49,769
of a door that I knew would have people

968
00:38:47,489 --> 00:38:51,839
behind it and I turned off Wi-Fi and it

969
00:38:49,769 --> 00:38:54,288
looked like this right I could see five

970
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:57,828
Bluetooth devices now I

971
00:38:54,289 --> 00:38:59,150
asked him was now I don't know somewhere

972
00:38:57,829 --> 00:39:01,099
but in a security guard because he's a

973
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:04,189
great security person and definitely

974
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:06,410
staying where he's supposed to be galaxy

975
00:39:04,189 --> 00:39:07,939
has 10 plus you put on your Bluetooth

976
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:10,910
shows up immediately

977
00:39:07,939 --> 00:39:14,479
I wonder what's all in this room right

978
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:18,910
hacking now if any of you I'm giving you

979
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:22,218
a whole second to turn off your oh

980
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:25,160

things that you want to try to grab okay

1025
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:07,040
and they could be there surprisingly

1026
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,790
just having that stuff add your

1027
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,800
credibility

1028
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:11,960
take that letterhead take that business

1029
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,220
card be careful if you're taking the

1030
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,110
business card of an important person

1031
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:17,118
who's in that building it's likely that

1032
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:19,220
they've seen them so try to find someone

1033
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,630
that they collected you know look in

1034
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:22,009
their desk for that pile of business

1035
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:23,980
cards they never actually imported it

1036
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:28,520
into their phone you're that person now

1037
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:31,130
so about those phone numbers I hope that

1038
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:35,860
you're in a place with you know Ethernet

1039
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:38,420
a phone some something maybe not right

1040
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:40,670
you're going to try to use these things

1041
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:42,650
to continue further and you're gonna use

1042
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:45,170
those phone numbers in a helpful way so

1043
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:46,580
you found some phone numbers I know we

1044
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:48,470
all know how or at least know how to

1045
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:50,810
Google how to spoof a phone number and

1046
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:53,029
that's great but it does it take more

1047
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:55,340
than 30 seconds of my time yeah so I'm

1048
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:58,630
not gonna do it right I'm trying to get

1049
00:41:55,340 --> 00:42:00,980
things done in a reasonable manner so

1050
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:02,330
what you're going to do is you're gonna

1051
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:05,810
call one of those phone numbers that you

1052
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:09,710
found right pick something not

1053
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:11,480
particularly helpful like procurement or

1054
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:15,859
maybe procurements great for you who

1055
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:20,690
knows call them say oh no I misdialed by

1056
00:42:15,859 --> 00:42:22,580
mistake can you transfer me to Bob John

1057
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:25,040
the got in the head of security right

1058
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:28,130
can you transfer me there right the

1059
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,690
target will see the incoming call from

1060
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:32,660
the cut phone number that just called in

1061
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:33,950
okay so they're going to see that their

1062
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:36,770
co-worker called them not that you

1063
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:38,149
called them this is much faster and more

1064
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:39,380
efficient if you're going to go through

1065
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:41,150
the trouble of spoofing their phone

1066
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:43,820
number fine but we have a lot of

1067
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:45,410
controls in place for that now so make

1068
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:47,359
it easy on yourself

1069
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:49,368
with those phone numbers you're gonna

1070
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:51,619
call places that you want to know are

1071
00:42:49,369 --> 00:42:53,540
occupied or not let's say for example

1072
00:42:51,619 --> 00:42:55,369
you're breaking into a concert hall the

1073
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:57,500
box office you're going to call the box

1074
00:42:55,369 --> 00:42:59,119
office and see if anyone is there you're

1075
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,880
also going to call the attention of any

1076
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:03,670
people targets so again

1077
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:06,460
hi c-level people that you're trying to

1078
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:08,289
get to call them see if they're there if

1079
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:10,420
they're in their room that's why you're

1080
00:43:08,289 --> 00:43:12,579
using your phones okay and when you call

1081
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:14,019
them at least have a reasonable excuse

1082
00:43:12,579 --> 00:43:15,940
I'm not here to teach you how to

1083
00:43:14,019 --> 00:43:18,069
socially engineer so come up with that

1084
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:20,349
on your own but do you need a quick

1085
00:43:18,069 --> 00:43:22,000
distraction and credibility let me show

1086
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:24,250
you a way to be a total jerk and get

1087
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,230
both of those things so you've found an

1088
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:28,269
office or a conference room and you're

1089
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:29,529
in luck you're gonna get some Pat Jack's

1090
00:43:28,269 --> 00:43:31,660
you know what Pat rocks are they look

1091
00:43:29,529 --> 00:43:33,849
like this my friend Brock bought like

1092
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:36,670
five hundred for I don't know two cents

1093
00:43:33,849 --> 00:43:38,529
on eBay so you're gonna grab them and

1094
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:40,690
you're gonna plug them into an Ethernet

1095
00:43:38,529 --> 00:43:42,579
port and in fact try to plug them into

1096
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:45,099
all of them it's really annoying

1097
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:47,289
you're gonna call security aka or the

1098
00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:49,119
head of IT or whomever else and you are

1099
00:43:47,289 --> 00:43:51,309
going to harness your inner Karen okay

1100
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:55,180
if you have to get the haircut to pull

1101
00:43:51,309 --> 00:44:00,069
it off get the care and haircut harness

1102
00:43:55,180 --> 00:44:01,328
caring complain be upset right you need

1103
00:44:00,069 --> 00:44:04,529
to tell them to remove them immediately

1104
00:44:01,329 --> 00:44:07,450
have any of you tried to remove a Paget

1105
00:44:04,529 --> 00:44:11,349
you have to use like big thick wire

1106
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:14,259
cutters okay security NIT or whoever

1107
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:15,309
shows up is not gonna really question

1108
00:44:14,259 --> 00:44:16,390
why you're there because you're

1109
00:44:15,309 --> 00:44:19,720
complaining and they're gonna try to

1110
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:21,578
make you happy but also it gains

1111
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:24,279
credibility because who the heck goes to

1112
00:44:21,579 --> 00:44:26,740
a concert or a movie or I don't know

1113
00:44:24,279 --> 00:44:28,660
whatever fun people do who goes to that

1114
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:30,368
and then complains about an Ethernet

1115
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:34,569
port being plugged up I've used this

1116
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:35,980
twice very fun don't do it too often

1117
00:44:34,569 --> 00:44:39,670
because then they'll just get an actual

1118
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:41,650
utility to cut Patrick's so why does all

1119
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:43,150
this work people don't like to answer

1120
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:44,859
numbers they don't recognize it's pretty

1121
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:48,400
obvious I don't like to answer my phone

1122
00:44:44,859 --> 00:44:51,190
what I do recognize the people so having

1123
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:54,940
that amount of credibility in your name

1124
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:57,309
will help what do you do if you're that

1125
00:44:54,940 --> 00:45:01,119
person who gets the call like hey can

1126
00:44:57,309 --> 00:45:03,640
you transfer me to Steve asked why who

1127
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:06,069
they are your best way to prevent what I

1128
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:07,808
just told you is to have the person that

1129
00:45:06,069 --> 00:45:10,029
you targeted for transfer actually

1130
00:45:07,809 --> 00:45:11,440
authenticate who you are before you make

1131
00:45:10,029 --> 00:45:13,900
the transfer

1132
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,869
many people won't I've actually seen

1133
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:19,839
hotels put little placards in their

1134
00:45:16,869 --> 00:45:21,250
hotels warning about this exact scam but

1135
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:22,930
instead they're trying to confirm your

1136
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:23,859
reservation number with your credit card

1137
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:28,450
and they're taking your credit card

1138
00:45:23,859 --> 00:45:31,869
right so ask questions so you want to

1139
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:33,368
remove that immediate trust okay you're

1140
00:45:31,869 --> 00:45:36,460
gonna proceed with your engagement now

1141
00:45:33,369 --> 00:45:38,740
you have some steps I hope that you've

1142
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:41,079
come there for a reason if you're not a

1143
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:42,759
criminal you probably have a reason to

1144
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:45,099
be at your engagement I'm not here to

1145
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:47,170
help you do crime take pictures and

1146
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:49,630
audio if they're in scope this helped me

1147
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:51,910
a lot with writing reports because again

1148
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:53,349
if you're just there to break a nutter

1149
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:55,210
and you're not writing a report first

1150
00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:57,460
off I don't know why you're hired but

1151
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:59,380
also you're not going to get paid pace

1152
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:02,230
it out I know everything I've said

1153
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:04,480
sounds like a mission rush to get it all

1154
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:06,579
done this is a big mistake I've noticed

1155
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,990
a lot of my volunteers make smoothing

1156
00:46:06,579 --> 00:46:11,020
everything out and having a reasonable

1157
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:12,970
pace does make the engagement easier and

1158
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:15,369
keeps you out of sight so go ahead and

1159
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:17,078
give that a try if you feel like

1160
00:46:15,369 --> 00:46:19,390
security is starting to watch you go

1161
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:23,680
back to that hideout place do whatever

1162
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:26,348
you're doing there and wait okay so

1163
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,328
hopefully you have some target goals if

1164
00:46:26,349 --> 00:46:31,450
you don't here's a list of some that I

1165
00:46:28,329 --> 00:46:34,660
recommend to you obviously getting into

1166
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:37,450
a target area fun getting personal

1167
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:39,160
information about famous people fun and

1168
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:41,890
they hate that please make sure that

1169
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:43,930
that's in your scope do never contact

1170
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:46,359
them you're never going to contact that

1171
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:49,450
target famous person ever right you're

1172
00:46:46,359 --> 00:46:52,779
gaining it for a purpose they again also

1173
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:54,730
have super fancy very expensive lawyers

1174
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:56,380
so you're never going to do that you're

1175
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:59,440
probably there for compliance that's

1176
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:01,510
probably why they have you so hopefully

1177
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,940
you have that as a goal obtaining

1178
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:08,200
objects let our heads

1179
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:09,820
Raja's IDs keys stuff like that so

1180
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,680
that's what you're here for

1181
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:13,780
and then smuggling objects into the

1182
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:22,560
building is obviously a super fun one

1183
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:24,790
that I like because yeah I'm not okay so

1184
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,240
security now has decided to take you

1185
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:27,130
away

1186
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:32,020
there are many doors into this building

1187
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:33,550
oh hey wait security man you forgot I'm

1188
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:36,640
so sorry here this is what you actually

1189
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:38,980
were looking for right I have more than

1190
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,870
once told security guard I pulled a

1191
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:42,430
knife out of my pocket and I'm like yeah

1192
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:43,450
I'm sorry I'm walking around with this

1193
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:46,029
here you go

1194
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:46,689
I'll leave and I do leave I go back to

1195
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:49,180
my car

1196
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:54,190
sometimes I go get a slushie come back

1197
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:56,770
and then the engagements not over it's a

1198
00:47:54,190 --> 00:48:00,220
big place apologize for your mistake

1199
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:02,980
walk out be the most polite Girl Scout

1200
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:07,029
that you could ever be and then go back

1201
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:09,660
in so if you can't give them a

1202
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:12,400
prohibited object or something of theirs

1203
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:14,500
like a name tag because they leave their

1204
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,250
security room with their uniforms and

1205
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:19,030
nametags open so you grabbed a couple

1206
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:20,740
give that back

1207
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:23,530
why cuz the things that you're just

1208
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:26,080
giving up but you're not so find a new

1209
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:28,570
door go in place your goals in order

1210
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:31,060
orient them to the hiding place you now

1211
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:33,520
have a map put that on the map orient

1212
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:36,190
your goals appropriately avoid these

1213
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:38,080
things do not attempt to be an on venue

1214
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:39,640
service worker do not attempt to be the

1215
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,110
network engineer that's coming in with

1216
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:44,020
cables and looking official I'm sure

1217
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:46,240
that you can do not they do not do this

1218
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:48,730
during their operating hours these are

1219
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:51,370
off our things do not stay in one place

1220
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:54,160
for too long do not talk to those famous

1221
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:56,350
people and mind your scope so some other

1222
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:58,149
things that you can do eat their food

1223
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,620
they give out free food to executives

1224
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:01,620
and stuff all the time

1225
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:03,420
why are you doing that

1226
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:06,540
because the free food also you're doing

1227
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:09,060
that because when you eat the amount of

1228
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:10,680
cortisol and your brain lowers you're

1229
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:11,730
literally tricking your body into

1230
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,980
thinking that you're in a safe

1231
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:16,530
environment and you're going to lower

1232
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:18,150
your stress and be more confident you're

1233
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:20,790
also going to slow down a little bit

1234
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:22,770
afterwards it's going to help you and

1235
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:24,240
then make friends of non-staff so you

1236
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:26,880
can yell at them later and be like hey

1237
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:30,240
Charlie how are the kids and you're

1238
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:33,900
there okay now as my friend liad likes

1239
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:35,399
to say and why is that it's because it's

1240
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:37,710
really helpful to know other people and

1241
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,180
to calm yourself down and to not be

1242
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:41,310
nervous even if you don't think you're

1243
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:45,600
nervous do I look nervous right now I

1244
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:47,430
don't know I'll tell you I am oh some

1245
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,900
more tips real quick shims are faster

1246
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:51,240
than lock picks lock picks are cool I

1247
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,750
got it great their doors are use

1248
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,850
shims

1249
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:56,970
okay get an anti ship door and Auntie

1250
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:59,640
shim plate if that's you okay security

1251
00:49:56,970 --> 00:50:02,220
guards can be jaded and annoyed and you

1252
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:05,580
salt him so on an engagement if you get

1253
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:08,129
caught give them a prize I know how that

1254
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:10,319
sounds weird but like you making that

1255
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:12,030
little business card saying you got me

1256
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:14,790
and then them turning that into their

1257
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:18,360
boss ooh that does something good for

1258
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:19,920
your security team try that also if the

1259
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,930
venue is really large you can use paper

1260
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,760
clips post-it notes everything else

1261
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:26,399
sometimes I get lost so I literally

1262
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:27,630
leave myself a breadcrumb trail I don't

1263
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,930
really have a solution for this other

1264
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:32,220
than picking up trash so try that I

1265
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:34,919
don't know how you're gonna defeat that

1266
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:36,779
one and then names hanging labels to

1267
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:38,250
hold doors open for knobs and stuff like

1268
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:41,670
that tape you guys have probably all

1269
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:43,710
done this before give that a try so to

1270
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:45,570
summarize for you all this is equal

1271
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:47,820
parts knowing your facility doing the

1272
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:50,730
research and exploiting their technology

1273
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:52,410
that doesn't actually work okay not

1274
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:53,850
every assessments going to be the same

1275
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:55,410
you're going to have to feel it out

1276
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:57,990
you're going to have to be willing to

1277
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:59,640
tell what it takes every challenge that

1278
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:01,129
you have even that security guard

1279
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:03,259
kicking you out

1280
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:05,809
because they thought you were gone right

1281
00:51:03,259 --> 00:51:08,660
every single thing can be used in your

1282
00:51:05,809 --> 00:51:11,539
favor think about it like science

1283
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:13,339
this isn't crime I mean kinda it's not

1284
00:51:11,539 --> 00:51:15,440
though this is science

1285
00:51:13,339 --> 00:51:18,049
you can test and try everything again

1286
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,630
over and over think about why it works

1287
00:51:18,049 --> 00:51:21,500
if you can't answer why it works it

1288
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:25,130
don't work

1289
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:27,920
okay one more thing this is my fourth

1290
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:29,960
year at gherkin 2016 was my first and in

1291
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,640
that year I pulled off a really cool

1292
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:34,430
stunt with our friends because clappy

1293
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:36,078
was talking about teledildonics or we

1294
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:37,730
thought I think he was actually talking

1295
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:40,730
about anarcho-capitalism at the last

1296
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:42,890
minute and as you guys know this was the

1297
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:45,289
moment that we decided to rain

1298
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:47,450
dick glitter and big dick penises on him

1299
00:51:45,289 --> 00:51:50,930
and he was a really really good sport
