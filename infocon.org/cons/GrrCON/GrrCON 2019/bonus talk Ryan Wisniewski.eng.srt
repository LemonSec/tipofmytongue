1
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:43,320
yeah about noon - so go

2
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,520
you guys get a bonus special today so

3
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,899
today we're going to talk about zero

4
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:17,830
datahero day this is a talk to have a

5
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:21,950
given for about two years now one second

6
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:24,470
so today we're going to talk about what

7
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:27,680
we do when basically shit hits the fan

8
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:29,590
we have no plan to do anything and how

9
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,350
do we cover the business because

10
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:36,320
quickshow hands blue teamers

11
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:38,530
red teamers the i do everything because

12
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:44,300
my company doesn't give me enough budget

13
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:45,979
there's my people alright so don't care

14
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,810
about this stuff so it's gonna sound a

15
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:49,009
little bit fictitious but this is just

16
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,970
kind of an amalgamation of a few

17
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:51,740
different incidents that have worked

18
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,720
it's the same story all the time right

19
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:56,750
it's we don't have enough budget to give

20
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:58,310
to our security team maybe even we don't

21
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,920
have enough budget to fund our IT

22
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:05,150
operations so what happens is you know

23
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:07,040
that's up yeah again so I started giving

24
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:08,390
this talk before a few of these hit now

25
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:13,630
Pat years over ten billion dollars

26
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:15,738
nowadays there's this email server yeah

27
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,299
and they just caught the dude just

28
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:22,640
written zeros to all their backups and

29
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:24,769
everything so are we recording this okay

30
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,070
this is a very hypothetical situation

31
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:29,900
definitely never happened before so you

32
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:31,760
get a text message from your boss late

33
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,640
at night said hey can you check out a

34
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,290
couple things we can't get to anything

35
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,738
on the network so you log into your

36
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:44,030
servers and you see this maybe you see

37
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:44,450
this one possibly this one anybody know

38
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,170
this one

39
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:51,200
bonus points wanna cry there's a small

40
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:53,559
thing hit the news maybe even you see

41
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,130
this one they just wipe the drives right

42
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,130
alright so what do we do

43
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,589
should have known no interaction from

44
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,110
here right so we got instant response or

45
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,880
instant response plans well we know this

46
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:07,310
was a thing that we needed to do we just

47
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,150
never got around to it awesome disaster

48
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,590
recovery

49
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,780
oh yeah yeah yeah we got disaster

50
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:13,819
recovery now four years ago Jim ran this

51
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,810
thing he said that some of the systems

52
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:17,810
came up and he was documenting

53
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,760
everything else I didn't anybody know

54
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,959
what the hell is going on here do we

55
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,429
have any system Docs

56
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,939
well yeah remember Jim like Jim died two

57
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:32,750
years ago

58
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:34,159
so uh all right so here's some lessons

59
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:37,370
that we've learned a little bit about

60
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,439
recovering from scorched earth chances

61
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:41,780
are if you got hit by one of these nasty

62
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,670
Ransome where's it propagated everywhere

63
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,470
because you don't have ideas of network

64
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:48,559
isolation or segmentation if you have 4

65
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:51,049
4 5 open up to internet right I still

66
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,310
step 1/2 this is gonna sabi it's gonna

67
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:55,700
be one of the worst experiences of your

68
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:56,930
life and you can't screw it up so if

69
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,040
you're moving quickly and you screw

70
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,299
something up chances are you're going

71
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,760
bankrupt because the business is down

72
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:03,019
already you're gonna keep you down more

73
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,700
so remember these two things and then

74
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:06,319
yeah it's gonna be terrible you're not

75
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,488
gonna sleep but afterwards you can come

76
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,328
up on stage and talk about it a little

77
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:12,349
bit this is a step that not many people

78
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:13,940
know unless you've been through an

79
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:16,548
incident always have legal engage your

80
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:19,760
instant response retainer everything

81
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:20,810
needs to be client confidential this is

82
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,229
gonna save your button when you go to

83
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,310
court make sure that legal is initiating

84
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:26,719
all this stuff they just have to be on

85
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,159
the phone call with you they're not

86
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,840
gonna be actually talking to technical

87
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:31,130
jargon but they have to be there to keep

88
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,810
client confidentiality

89
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:35,150
it's going to keep you out of hot water

90
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,500
when things become discoverable in court

91
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,729
on why this happened if you're going to

92
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,380
your cyber insurance company or

93
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:43,400
something like that so just make sure

94
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:45,969
legals on the calls all right so we got

95
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,349
we got a patient patients business

96
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,780
business is dying now so what do we do

97
00:04:48,349 --> 00:04:52,610
so we got to figure out exactly how to

98
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,409
stabilize this situation we're going to

99
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,880
talk about three different things we're

100
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:57,139
talk about what do we know all right

101
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,849
talk about how we stop the bleeding and

102
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:00,530
then make sure that we don't make the

103
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:02,270
situation worse as the last thing we

104
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:06,380
want to do is actually wipe backups when

105
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:08,090
that was a less hope so I promise you

106
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,289
that if I've worked for you before this

107
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,280
not your network diagram this just

108
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:12,289
happens to be everybody's network

109
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,460
diagram all right we got these legacy

110
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:15,320
windows that we just can't retire

111
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,820
because oh my god the PLC systems are

112
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,729
running on Windows 2003 we can't touch

113
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,779
those we got some clients some laptops

114
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:22,460
maybe we got some back books in there

115
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:25,849
too we're moving to the cloud because

116
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:28,068
clouds cool but in the corner this dusty

117
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:29,569
old machine it says IBM under all right

118
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:31,669
we got some connections out there and we

119
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:34,370
connect to the internet so this is kind

120
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:35,089
of what systems look like this is where

121
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:38,569
we're at now

122
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:40,150
all right so windows are dead the IBM

123
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:42,650
thing is still chugging along because

124
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,688
for some reason viruses aren't being

125
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:46,998
written for IBM stuff right now or we

126
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:49,249
just don't know about them hey we got

127
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:51,409
some c2 traffic going to the Internet we

128
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:55,279
got traffic going in between the clients

129
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:57,050
and the Windows servers cloud looks ok

130
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:00,020
because they figured out yeah firewalls

131
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,300
are good really frightened Network right

132
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,979
so as people are coming in the office

133
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,080
power and on their systems they're

134
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:09,349
getting ransom right so you just see

135
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,919
computers come up computers go down so

136
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:15,800
what do we do anyway save this company

137
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:19,039
what should we do first unplug the

138
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:24,649
Internet cool hey seriously yeah that is

139
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:27,520
a answer what else we're doing shutting

140
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:29,240
down infected machines cool what else

141
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,149
Boxey to cool

142
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,580
what else come on I know are all smart

143
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:38,209
people here and it's not that early yeah

144
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:43,698
way back there come on don't memory yes

145
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:48,620
I love forensics cool yes yes boo-ki

146
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:50,300
boxes right so so here's one that I

147
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,729
didn't usually hear that in here today

148
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,709
update your resume all right that's

149
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:56,659
messed up number one make sure you are

150
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:58,039
protected right so we're gonna list all

151
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:59,779
the actions that we have right we can

152
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:02,748
disconnect system so we can power down

153
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:04,189
servers well disable all the users right

154
00:07:02,749 --> 00:07:06,319
they have to be using the users somehow

155
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:07,819
let's disable them all once you have

156
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,309
your list of what you're gonna do you

157
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:11,569
list out the bad things right so if we

158
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:13,039
disconnect from the internet we don't

159
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:15,080
have any business transactions happening

160
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,699
the business is done it might be okay

161
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,050
but we want to make sure everybody

162
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:21,229
understands what's going on so we can

163
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,999
make informed decisions so let's usually

164
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:25,039
what we do right so we disable routing

165
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:26,460
we're looking at the core we're at going

166
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,380
off stuff right and what we're

167
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:32,669
end up with these isolated areas of

168
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:34,500
investigation and remediation so here's

169
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:36,419
the big thing though is okay you got

170
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,280
your systems down your business is down

171
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:40,609
go get your management to figure out how

172
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,960
to make money with all your systems

173
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:44,220
number three is a big one there's gonna

174
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,590
be a lot of people that want to help a

175
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,759
lot of people are useless make sure

176
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,020
you're sending them home they might have

177
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,610
some great ideas they're gonna send you

178
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,469
down rabbit holes that will cost you

179
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,240
alright make sure you got your top dogs

180
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:59,490
on this and we're working towards a

181
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:03,930
resolution so we've disconnected

182
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:04,860
everything business is down ok we're on

183
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:08,940
to step two

184
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:10,229
so what's broken how bad is it what we

185
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,750
need you to fix it and what do we do

186
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:13,680
first simple questions keep them in the

187
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,639
back your head when you're working on

188
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,490
this because you're not gonna be able to

189
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,849
think you just have to do so be careful

190
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:23,720
with the what is broken question because

191
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:26,789
this is the answer you're gonna get I

192
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,590
actually recorded one of the board rooms

193
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:30,570
when I came in and asked what was broken

194
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:33,299
that was their response no we're not

195
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:36,870
gonna play it's a PDF so it's him screen

196
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:37,859
but um so let's change that question a

197
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,479
little bit so instead of you asking

198
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,669
what's broken what do we need to do stay

199
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,899
in business that's actually going to

200
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:44,730
garner a response that's somewhat

201
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:47,370
helpful right so here's a business cycle

202
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:49,110
for 90% of businesses right we're gonna

203
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,550
take orders we're gonna do something

204
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:54,120
we're gonna ship it we're in pay bills

205
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:57,810
we're gonna get money cool how do we do

206
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,130
these things this is where if you got

207
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,140
some red teamers or anything you're

208
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,730
basically black box pen test now because

209
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,410
we have no system documentation we got

210
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,540
to figure out how to hell to put Humpty

211
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,310
Dumpty back together again alright we're

212
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,510
gonna be looking for absolutely anything

213
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,000
and everything that we could call up

214
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:15,480
your ISPs see if they have Network logs

215
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,380
see if you gotta backups no joke anybody

216
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,500
work in data center with the raised

217
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:21,570
floor pop off the floor tiles

218
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,040
I found a dr binder in there once it was

219
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,140
really dusty but it had some system

220
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,029
inventory out there alright any

221
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,199
informations good information put it up

222
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:30,839
in a whiteboard here this is what you're

223
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,580
looking for problem is this is what its

224
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:35,880
gonna look like to everybody else

225
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:37,620
okay so here's your pro tip of the day

226
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,519
if you want anything done in business

227
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:43,740
put in an excel make it a task list and

228
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:46,170
other Pro tips red green red

229
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,839
bad green good management understands

230
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:51,300
that it but so we're gonna list out all

231
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,640
the functions that we need to do the

232
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:57,300
systems that pertain to it and then what

233
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:59,130
step in the remediation where it put

234
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,439
this up on the TV projector or somewhere

235
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:03,240
outside of your war room you do not want

236
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,370
to be giving status updates you need to

237
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,450
work you cannot be telling people every

238
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,560
five minutes that you didn't get

239
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,019
anything done because you're preparing

240
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:14,130
the next status update and make it easy

241
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:15,779
for somebody to see this cool so we kind

242
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:20,550
of got a plan of attack how do we

243
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:22,649
restore this safely so we know that we

244
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,599
have some bad systems in this area we

245
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:26,250
know we got a backup system we're gonna

246
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,200
restore to this idea called the

247
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,899
quarantine and then we're gonna put it

248
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:34,230
into this new network there's one

249
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:35,959
problem and a backup systems are usually

250
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:39,270
running Windows and they're affected too

251
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:42,689
so how many people here have offline

252
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:45,029
backups okay I should see everybody's

253
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:47,220
hands we're going to tape on this one or

254
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:49,110
if you've got storage that's offline for

255
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,880
three days or whatever your idea is if

256
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,230
you are under a ransom ware attack

257
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,550
chances are the backup sort of going to

258
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,130
be the first things hit make sure that

259
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:58,260
you have offline backup somewhere okay

260
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,760
so now we're gonna build a new backup

261
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:03,000
system we're gonna rebuild the tape

262
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,250
catalog so now we can start our rebuild

263
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,420
process right so a lot of people skip

264
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,270
this quarantine step and go straight

265
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,620
into prod Network again that's not going

266
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:13,920
to be good because what if they've been

267
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,959
here for six months a year three years

268
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,839
all right if we're dealing with an agent

269
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:20,160
stated chances are they didn't

270
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,270
ransomware your system they just wiped

271
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,160
them because they were hiding their

272
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:26,189
tracks and they've been using you two

273
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,899
three four years so we're gonna put in a

274
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,910
quarantine this is an out of an

275
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:31,170
air-gapped Network say it again this is

276
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:33,870
an out of band air-gapped Network

277
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:37,229
there's a clean virtually every single

278
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:40,290
way you cannot risk a reinfection at

279
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,730
this point because let's see here we had

280
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,410
to get the tapes from somewhere in

281
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,310
Timbuktu shipped them out here so we

282
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:46,740
chartered a jet

283
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:48,599
got the tapes finally in we had to get a

284
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,269
new tape library because we needed more

285
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,009
drive space so we're about now no 20

286
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:54,480
hours into incident right now business

287
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:55,499
is already complaining they're like well

288
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,560
how long is this going to take

289
00:11:55,499 --> 00:12:00,329
if you start restoring you're in day

290
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,410
three day four of remediation and all of

291
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:02,699
a sudden you get a reinfection you're

292
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:05,129
starting to clock back in ground zero

293
00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:07,019
and it could cost the business make sure

294
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:09,029
that you are going to this quarantine

295
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:10,079
and you're checking for the iOS iOS ES

296
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,180
and everything else make sure those

297
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,008
things are clean

298
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:16,258
everyone move into the new network so

299
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:17,639
here's another tip for today does

300
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:22,529
anybody know what happens when you get

301
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:24,749
breached to your budget it goes way up

302
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:26,790
do you know how up it goes there is a

303
00:12:24,749 --> 00:12:28,860
blank check for you if they saying fix

304
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:31,920
this now so what do we want to do what

305
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:38,879
are we spending our money on new stuff

306
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:40,469
yes okay I stuff the good stuff every

307
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,149
vendor in the vendor Hall is happy to

308
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:50,569
sell you things which ones are the right

309
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:50,569
answers huh so what work are we doing

310
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:56,730
we're not doing anything because we're

311
00:12:52,649 --> 00:13:01,170
updating our resumes I'll give you I'll

312
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:03,389
give you hints so this is our chance to

313
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:06,509
Greenfield install some stuff we're

314
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:07,139
gonna implement some segmentation ad is

315
00:13:06,509 --> 00:13:09,149
hosed

316
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:11,670
we need new ad environment all right

317
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:13,259
they pop da six months ago and they've

318
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:15,509
installed users you can't trust anything

319
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:17,160
at this point we could try to recertify

320
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:18,180
and everything but realistically we need

321
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,610
to get the business running before we

322
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:23,729
can get users back up so let's build out

323
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:27,300
a new forest we're putting in some type

324
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:29,370
of app aware firewalls ids/ips next-gen

325
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,829
firewall whatever we're gonna called now

326
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:34,110
I need something to detect what's

327
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:36,269
actually leaving because anybody know

328
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:39,120
the most popular way of exfil right now

329
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:41,249
DNS all right if we're not looking at

330
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,579
that traffic it's possible the data is

331
00:13:41,249 --> 00:13:46,410
going right underneath our nose put in a

332
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:48,929
sim something right

333
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:51,389
does anybody have kids here little kids

334
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:52,889
if you take a ball away from a toddler

335
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:53,910
what is the only thing the tower wants

336
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:56,190
again

337
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:58,350
all right you just took away that the

338
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:00,180
attackers ball they're gonna want to

339
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:03,750
back in we're gonna be ready when they

340
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:06,390
come back MFA anything that is external

341
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,680
all right these are best practices but

342
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,000
again if we're in the situation's

343
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,660
because we were missing a basket back to

344
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,460
practice

345
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,260
probably one two or three of them all

346
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,790
right get your outbound proxies out

347
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,770
there get some email protection make

348
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,880
sure people are clicking ship you know

349
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:22,370
voter ability scanner because you're

350
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:25,920
probably running Java from 2002 so

351
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:28,140
wonderful at this point probably five

352
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,209
six days going in maybe five hours of

353
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:33,090
sleep your war rooms starting to smell

354
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:34,380
pretty terrible you got to find a point

355
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:36,120
of being done because you can't keep

356
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:38,490
this up forever right you've still got

357
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,170
the business down so can you bring the

358
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:43,350
business back up can you do the basic

359
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:44,760
functions to make money if you can let's

360
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,800
bring them up how do we bring everything

361
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,680
else up safely then alright and then

362
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,120
this is a big one sleep deprivation

363
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,010
easiest way if you don't have money and

364
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,990
you want to get drunk just don't sleep

365
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:56,819
you're gonna start hallucinating you're

366
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:59,220
gonna start thinking things like you're

367
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,510
gonna hear shit is make sure that you

368
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,680
figure out when you can make sleep

369
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,610
because you're gonna accidentally press

370
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,439
the delete button on when you should

371
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:06,390
enough right so define all these

372
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,740
conditions before in your tabletop

373
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:10,740
exercise and everything so you don't

374
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,320
have to do this in like our 150 and

375
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,360
recovery

376
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,490
other miscellaneous tips again three two

377
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,700
one roll of Commons applies here three

378
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:22,650
hours of sleep two meals one shower you

379
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,060
do your best you're never gonna get

380
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:26,550
there

381
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:29,430
assign a wardrobe manager you're gonna

382
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:31,109
need somebody that takes care of the

383
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:34,020
room that schedules the meetings that

384
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:35,430
orders food that takes all the notes and

385
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:37,530
make sure that they're getting pictures

386
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:40,140
of all the whiteboards you're gonna need

387
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:41,910
somebody to organize all this done as at

388
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,590
the bottom save everything USB drives

389
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,280
are cheap go buy everything that they

390
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,890
have at Best Buy

391
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,720
don't delete stuff you never know what's

392
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:52,439
gonna save you in an investigation or

393
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:55,140
provide evidence to the authorities this

394
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,670
last one this is a no this is funny if

395
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,699
your email systems pop do not

396
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:01,670
communicate new credentials over email

397
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:04,020
it's a bad idea

398
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:06,900
figure out how you're gonna do this

399
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:08,279
securely personal phones you

400
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,300
you tour all right we're security

401
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:12,930
professionals we know how to do this

402
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:15,420
stuff so here's the second lesson I get

403
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:19,650
to give you guys I'd never want to do

404
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:20,370
that again that was awful right so how

405
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,110
do we do that

406
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:24,120
all right so again we're gonna start

407
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:25,529
asking questions I always like guessing

408
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,270
questions not answering them pants norms

409
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:29,040
work I don't like it you know delegate

410
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:32,850
it out like a good manager so where are

411
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,770
we weak how do we prioritize this and

412
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:40,170
it's gap analysis right sis pees in the

413
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:41,490
room yeah phew okay all right this is

414
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:44,279
the boring management work all right so

415
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:47,550
where are we where do we want to be how

416
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:49,860
do we get there where are we easy to

417
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:52,170
answer right we know where we're at

418
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:55,110
we're at Ground Zero or do we want to be

419
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:56,579
go steal somebody else's work any one of

420
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,200
these go pick a framework that you

421
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:02,070
understand and run with it they're gonna

422
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:04,439
be better than what you had before so

423
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:06,179
this is my attempt edge

424
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:07,679
anybody here reading this documents

425
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:10,260
they're terrible all right

426
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:13,500
I mean we got it's kind of like an AAA

427
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:15,689
meeting it's anonymous but uh they're

428
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,670
boring to read they're terrible so what

429
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:19,439
it is I took up in this Thai 800-53

430
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:22,230
controls and just made them into single

431
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,970
sentences by the way feel free to take

432
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:25,709
pictures everything this is all up on

433
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,390
github SlideShare

434
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:29,880
my Twitter they're all over the place

435
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:32,130
everything is downloadable too so feel

436
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,620
free to steal this but um what I did is

437
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:36,120
every news control gets a card and we

438
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,239
are going to sign the maturity level to

439
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,850
the cards right now so here's a zoom up

440
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:46,230
so NIST I think has 23 pages on physical

441
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:48,809
inventory like have a budget of systems

442
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:50,910
done so physical devices our inventory

443
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:53,129
we can define this on one through five

444
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:54,950
anybody see mmm their capability

445
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:57,960
maturity model all right we'll go over

446
00:17:54,950 --> 00:18:01,530
so the idea is you got a scale of one to

447
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,929
five and you measure your control based

448
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:05,639
on these criteria right so you start at

449
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:07,559
one is that hoc somebody's always

450
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,150
thinking about the decision and the

451
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:11,639
outcome is always determined by whoever

452
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:13,500
is thinking about it step number two is

453
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,150
repeatable that person is gonna make the

454
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,520
same decision twice in a row three times

455
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:19,380
in a row three is defined that

456
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,730
he now can make the same decision to get

457
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,410
the same outcome right this is kind of

458
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:26,430
where your processes and procedures come

459
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:28,410
in for is all about managing exceptions

460
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:31,590
so do we notice if process isn't

461
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:33,480
followed and are we alerted to it five

462
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:35,639
is continued improvement this is the

463
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,730
goal for everything but don't make

464
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,170
everything be a five right physical

465
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:42,540
devices our inventory probably doesn't

466
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:43,890
need to be a five three is probably good

467
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,330
enough because if you make everything a

468
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,860
five you're gonna overspend you're gonna

469
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,750
be not utilizing your budget right

470
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,100
because every dollar they're giving

471
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:52,670
security is a dollar that they cannot

472
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:55,740
invest into making more money right so

473
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:57,840
okay so we talked about we're at a zero

474
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,730
we don't have any inventory as we

475
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,159
learned through the incident we want to

476
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:03,690
be at three all right we want some type

477
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,880
of process in play where we get new

478
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:08,250
assets in and it goes into the tracker

479
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,570
and then when we get rid of the assets

480
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,190
it comes out of the tracker and we know

481
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,870
where the asset is and the deprecation

482
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,890
value and all that suffering so we're

483
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:17,360
going to implement an asset management

484
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:18,930
program we set up some goals and

485
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,909
eventually when you go through all these

486
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,720
cards you're going to get programs so

487
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:26,240
we're gonna have all these different

488
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:28,500
programs upon them we're never portfolio

489
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,190
so that's a lot of work right how we're

490
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,100
gonna get this done

491
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:33,540
Oh obviously we threat model we're good

492
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,310
at this right we're gonna talk about

493
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,780
data flow diagrams we're going to talk

494
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,649
about entity relationship so we're gonna

495
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,510
talk about the geopolitical

496
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:43,740
relationships of the Middle East and you

497
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:45,990
know we just got popped we are not ready

498
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,700
for this let's break it down there's

499
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,260
some bad people out there we got some

500
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,060
protections and we got stuff for pretend

501
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,920
we're protecting all right so let's

502
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,480
think of it that way so what do we do

503
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,450
first

504
00:19:53,480 --> 00:20:00,630
again we're going impact and likelihood

505
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:02,310
so we're we know Grand Rapids what's the

506
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:06,510
likelihood of an earthquake to hit Grand

507
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:08,669
Rapids in a small 0 all right what's the

508
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:10,890
likelihood that it gets snow to the

509
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:13,320
point that the office has to close right

510
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,790
so that's that your likelihood impact

511
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,340
how much money is it gonna cost when

512
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:19,889
that happens so if an earthquake were to

513
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,939
hit here it'd probably be bad right so

514
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,430
you're gonna have a high impact but a

515
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:26,460
super low likelihood and what happens is

516
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:28,710
when you put this overlay on you're

517
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,020
gonna get this right so again top rights

518
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:33,410
always good in graphs

519
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:35,150
make it green management knows right so

520
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,410
we got things that we know it's gonna

521
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,270
happen it's gonna cost a lot of money we

522
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:40,460
need to mitigate that the problem is

523
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:43,910
what this is lacking is one piece of the

524
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:45,080
equation effort so I take this and take

525
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:47,570
it one more so we're gonna put the lost

526
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:49,730
expectancy so if we go back to here and

527
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:50,899
you take the product of the impact in

528
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:53,360
the likelihood you get this thing called

529
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:55,400
loss expectancy let's put the lost

530
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,949
expectancy up on the Y graph and put

531
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,280
ease of implementation on the X now what

532
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:05,090
we have is a bang for buck diagram

533
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:07,520
anybody here running laps okay

534
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:10,820
not as many hands as I want to see laps

535
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:14,240
is an example of a no-brainer anybody

536
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:15,080
that deployed it how easy is it super

537
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,210
easy right

538
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,919
you run this script you push gpo you're

539
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:21,920
done anybody that doesn't know what laps

540
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,840
is local admin password solution so what

541
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:26,000
it does is it rotates all your windows

542
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,010
local administrators passwords it gives

543
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,900
you a GUI to pull the password and you

544
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:31,610
can click rotate password whenever you

545
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,110
would like you set that up to whatever

546
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:34,969
interval you have maybe it's 8 hours

547
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:36,770
maybe is 24 hours something like that it

548
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:38,210
rotates your passwords it's wonderful

549
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:40,280
it's super easy to deploy this is a

550
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:42,800
no-brainer because how many people here

551
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:44,870
have laptops deployed where if it

552
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,780
changed me 1 2 3 or something like

553
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:49,939
company 1 2 3 it's terrible so I pop a

554
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:52,250
laptop I popped all that tops go to play

555
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:54,140
labs other things that we had end up

556
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,400
with their big projects right so these

557
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,110
are things very difficult but it's gonna

558
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,000
make a huge impact this is stuff like

559
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:02,479
micro segmentation zero trust

560
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,070
architecture move to the cloud AWS all

561
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,020
that stuff right there's a huge projects

562
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:07,610
but those are going to take more time

563
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:11,150
more effort let's capitalize on the

564
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:15,020
small wins and the easy stuff then you

565
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:17,870
go right so here's my ideas here's what

566
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,080
we're prioritizing boss I need some

567
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:21,770
money

568
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,870
we're gonna get this done cool how many

569
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:26,060
people you need well it's gonna be three

570
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:27,229
full times for a year and a half we're

571
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,610
gonna need to buy a couple different

572
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:30,320
appliances it's gonna cost us a million

573
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:32,270
half in capex probably hard thousand top

574
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,270
X right so we have all this stuff built

575
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:36,770
out or say hey we're gonna split off the

576
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,240
teams we're gonna have a weed over here

577
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,080
lead over here lead over here we're

578
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,580
gonna meet once a week

579
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,620
talk about progress make sure that we're

580
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:44,360
actually doing something here we're

581
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,830
gonna reprioritize these maybe quarterly

582
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,820
make sure that we're still on track with

583
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:49,580
the business and we're going to continue

584
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:52,129
our gap analysis congratulations

585
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:58,610
everyone's I see so here that you like

586
00:22:52,130 --> 00:23:01,070
it or not poor Harry that's the bonus

587
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:02,510
talk for today I keep this one in my

588
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,129
back pocket all the time just in case

589
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:05,870
this stuff happens because it usually

590
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:08,570
sparks a pretty good conversation so

591
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:11,809
yeah that's fun and stuff but really I

592
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:13,549
want to talk to everybody here and what

593
00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:14,990
do you think is the biggest problems

594
00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:24,490
that we have in information security

595
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:35,960
anybody complexity no budget mm sapping

596
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:37,220
skill lack of leadership so now it's in

597
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,149
between usability and security

598
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:41,600
you notice how none of the other

599
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:43,850
technical technicals easy stuff it's

600
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:48,799
less than half of what we do though so

601
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:52,158
how do we how do we solve this right and

602
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:54,080
uh here's my teaser for uh coming up in

603
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,779
10 minutes at noon so we're gonna talk

604
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,939
about how do we fix this problem how do

605
00:23:56,779 --> 00:24:01,549
we communicate effectively to make sure

606
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:02,750
that we become those leaders if there's

607
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:04,158
a lack of leadership there's a void that

608
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:06,679
needs opportunity let's go be those

609
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,120
leaders if we don't have a budget to get

610
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:09,260
our shit done how the hell are we gonna

611
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:13,129
protect this place so let's go get a

612
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:15,070
budget if we got a lack of skill how do

613
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:20,960
we treat the skill problem we train them

614
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:22,399
we execute all right so does anybody

615
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:31,220
else have anything they want to talk

616
00:24:22,399 --> 00:24:32,629
about absolutely anything yes so there's

617
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,779
my Twitter go to my Twitter it's a pin

618
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:37,429
tweet week to a slide deck otherwise

619
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:38,990
let's go all the way back to the front I

620
00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:42,139
got my github there all my talks are up

621
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:43,760
on the github too so you can cheat and

622
00:24:42,139 --> 00:24:44,658
find the one that we're gonna be talking

623
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,940
about in a couple minutes

624
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:48,940
holy cow that's a lot of slides Oh

625
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:55,810
