1
00:01:08,480 --> 00:02:08,220
good morning come and find a seat if you

2
00:01:17,940 --> 00:02:11,459
didn't know thank you so I'm only about

3
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,590
25 minutes so about 15 slides I really

4
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:16,470
want to talk to you a little bit about

5
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:18,810
how surfing relates to security and my

6
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,880
experiences over the last thirty years

7
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,070
from security and probably the last four

8
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,280
years from surfing and there's a lot of

9
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:31,920
analogies that go along with this track

10
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:33,959
so really we are in security to help our

11
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,450
organizations protect their data their

12
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,739
people the brand and I'm going to talk a

13
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,200
little bit about what you could do for

14
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:41,970
your organization to then follow those

15
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,920
those creases that as security people

16
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,650
are basically following for

17
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,260
organizations that's why we get paid so

18
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:52,080
the agenda plan the work work the plan

19
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,820
tools why the matter actions

20
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,780
practice makes perfect or at least

21
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:59,820
better have fun find other people that

22
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,650
share your passion because I think the

23
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,720
most successful people in security are

24
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,549
the passionate ones I interview people

25
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,790
every single week whether they're for my

26
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:10,590
team the company or for other

27
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:12,569
organizations that we work with and if I

28
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,760
can't see passion and that person that

29
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:16,470
I'm talking to they automatically get

30
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,940
put in the other pile

31
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,380
because I don't think you could do this

32
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:23,180
job if you're not passionate about it

33
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:26,460
it's not a nine-to-five job and then

34
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:29,400
reflect on the past learn and find some

35
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:32,520
new challenges which I call the waves so

36
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,280
here's my labels I've been a leader of

37
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,690
my entire life whether it's the captain

38
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,100
of the football team president of

39
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,859
eternity

40
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,450
coach blah blah blah I like the

41
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:46,260
leadership positions I like teamwork I

42
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:48,239
like to learn I've gotten my MBA my

43
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,399
cissp those are things I needed to do to

44
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,380
make it into the corporate world and get

45
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,160
the get the Cecil position so I've been

46
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:58,140
a CSO for twelve years until I joined

47
00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:00,320
CBI we're a cybersecurity consulting

48
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,850
company what I do really is go help

49
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,350
organizations look at their strategy if

50
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:06,420
they have one if they don't build one I

51
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:08,160
look at their team's look at their

52
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,959
technologies look at their tools along

53
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,730
with the entire portfolio vote CBI

54
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,730
offers and we put them on the right path

55
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:25,200
so basically I've been doing cyber since

56
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:27,000
1993 started off as a UNIX admin doing

57
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,849
that then doing broke into my first

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,140
computer probably before then but in the

59
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:33,210
corporate world broke into my first one

60
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:35,880
but within the first week of my job and

61
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:38,880
trying to secure those kind of or those

62
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,500
machines I got the bug they didn't

63
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,540
really have a security title but I was a

64
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,130
UNIX admin for quite some time moved to

65
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,380
the networking team did some development

66
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:48,840
then I was in Oracle DBA for 14 years

67
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,669
and then in 2006 switched over to a

68
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,460
Cecil role and had been doing that up

69
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:55,229
until last year so I think I'm qualified

70
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,940
to talk a little bit about the

71
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:59,370
technology side and then also about

72
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,630
making organizational change because you

73
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,010
could have the greatest technology the

74
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,110
greatest code the greatest ideas but if

75
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,550
you can't communicate that well you're

76
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,570
gonna sit in your cube and you're gonna

77
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,370
have great ideas and you know to talk

78
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,270
about at the bar and say you can do all

79
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,890
these great things but if you're not

80
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,719
helping your company you're not doing

81
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:16,800
your job you're creating cool technology

82
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,870
and doing things for fun but ideally as

83
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,400
passionate people we want to bring the

84
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,230
value to our organizations and grow

85
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,080
ourselves and help protect the company

86
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:26,370
so I think before you can help the

87
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,289
company you have to understand what the

88
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,729
strategy is of the business every

89
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:30,180
culture is a bit different every

90
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,070
business

91
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,389
functions in a different way some are

92
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:37,380
more risky some are less risky so

93
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:38,820
understanding what the drivers are for

94
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,889
the company helps you frame your

95
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,840
messaging and until you understand what

96
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:45,240
the what the business goals are you

97
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,969
really can't put an effective strategy

98
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,910
in place whether you're the CSO or the

99
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:52,889
admin or the network director you also

100
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,270
have to understand what your superiors

101
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:56,430
are doing and you have to communicate

102
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:58,409
that down to what your direct reports

103
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,630
are doing it all goes together whether

104
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:02,610
you're an endpoint guy a network person

105
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:04,259
a developer they all have to be seamless

106
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:06,030
because all it takes is one crack in the

107
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:08,490
in the portfolio and the strategy and

108
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:11,130
then your name or your organization is

109
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:14,150
in bad light in the paper and when I

110
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:18,479
joined Oakland County as their Cecil in

111
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:20,280
2013 my whole premise was keep Oakland

112
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,590
County off the front page of the paper I

113
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,229
knew I was the fall guy I was a security

114
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:27,270
consultant brought on to assess and

115
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:29,880
build a program for Oakland County there

116
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,599
was nothing there before I showed up how

117
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,969
was the fall guy

118
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:34,800
it was my brand and but most importantly

119
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,300
it was all Brooks Patterson who was the

120
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,820
county executive and his entire

121
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,310
portfolio that he built it was all

122
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:43,620
dependent on a security breach he

123
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:45,570
preached we are one of the best in the

124
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,909
country I didn't want my name to tarnish

125
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:49,530
Oakland County's image so I thought I

126
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:51,719
took that to heart very passionate about

127
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:55,349
it I looked at what they had to do I

128
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,000
went and talked to all 23 directors of

129
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:59,070
the what I called the kingdom's inside

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,900
Oakland County and found out what their

131
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:03,270
business drivers were the prosecutor the

132
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,340
sheriff the medical examiner all these

133
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,830
people and find out what they are trying

134
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,599
to achieve from their business then I

135
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,669
could properly build the strategy around

136
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,830
it I came from a manufacturing

137
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:15,719
background I also worked in utility and

138
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:18,448
Finance different type of cultures

139
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,490
different type of mandates in the

140
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:23,400
manufacturing world it was whatever the

141
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,960
CEO said at the time followed suit in

142
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,429
Oakland County it was whatever these

143
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,989
twenty three kingdoms decided to do

144
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,060
within their kingdoms that's how they

145
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,599
ran their business totally different

146
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,610
environment

147
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:33,930
I would not be effective if I used the

148
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:37,380
same strategy at the manufacturing

149
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:39,060
company that I would if I had at the at

150
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:41,610
the government cuz in manufacturing the

151
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:44,010
CEO says yes everybody follows suit at

152
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,480
the county one person has

153
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,620
argument and then I have to go have

154
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,300
three to twenty three different

155
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,790
conversations with 23 different people

156
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,530
and potentially 23 different solutions

157
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:55,950
the different type of strategy at the

158
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:57,989
rollout so understanding that will help

159
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,670
you build what's most valuable for your

160
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:02,370
culture

161
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:03,840
I suggest selecting a framework just

162
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:06,330
pick a framework that works best in your

163
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,460
industry whether it's a NIST framework a

164
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:10,590
CIS 20

165
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:12,330
ISO finding out what's works best in

166
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,469
your sector because you're gonna want to

167
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,390
compare at least your leaders are gonna

168
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:17,640
want to compare what you're doing to

169
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:19,380
what the county is doing the next or if

170
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,780
it's a manufacturing company what are

171
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:24,600
they doing how are they comparing to you

172
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:27,929
everybody wants to be a little bit above

173
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:30,240
average or or better than most but they

174
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,230
don't want to overspend it's your job to

175
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,930
make sure you put them in the position

176
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:35,520
where they want to be nobody wants to be

177
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:37,890
the under spender and nobody wants to

178
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,760
over spin and be laughed at basically by

179
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,340
their peers and say why are you

180
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,380
investing all this information and

181
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,730
resources it's not needed so you have to

182
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,610
you have to balance it that's well how

183
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:50,670
kind of equates to surfing I had been

184
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:53,670
doing lots of team sports until I was in

185
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:56,670
my low early 40s playing basketball and

186
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:58,680
football as I said I really like team

187
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:01,290
sports but then I started tearing my

188
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,630
calves and my Achilles tendon store so I

189
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,709
had to kind of give up playing sports I

190
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,990
had to switch to something new

191
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,730
so I switched to wakeboarding well I'm

192
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:11,100
switching to wakeboarding when you're 42

193
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,630
it's hard on your body so these epic

194
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,550
wipeouts said I was taking as I'm going

195
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:16,890
35 miles an hour seven feet in the air

196
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:19,170
may come in a Monday Monday morning work

197
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,699
pretty hard so about four years ago I

198
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,349
switched to surfing if you haven't seen

199
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,740
wake surfing you go about 11 miles an

200
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:27,720
hour you can actually drink a beer while

201
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,010
you're surfing you can hang out you can

202
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,050
talk to somebody on the boat you play

203
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,610
the music it's a lot of fun it may be

204
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,949
going to work on Monday mornings a lot

205
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,300
easier but I had to learn how to balance

206
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,440
because when I first stepped on a

207
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,880
surfboard is way different than a

208
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,730
wakeboard I would just fall over and

209
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,500
until I started practicing I would have

210
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:45,510
these epic wipeouts that my friends

211
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,270
enjoy but I didn't enjoy so much so

212
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:50,760
there's a balance there

213
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:52,199
so here understanding the top management

214
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,060
support understanding what your

215
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,830
landscape looks like to figure figure

216
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:58,920
out what the right type of balance you

217
00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:00,240
can play and you're in

218
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,029
you have to also understand your

219
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,470
expectations so what's the wave that you

220
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:06,120
want to ride it all depends on your

221
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,550
culture and you'll see later in the deck

222
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,149
when I talk about what works best it's

223
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,149
about people

224
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,959
a little picture of Jerry Maguire one of

225
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:18,660
my favorite movies relationships

226
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:20,310
relationships matter your career your

227
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,680
organization could depend on one person

228
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:24,930
and it's that one person that you have a

229
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:29,910
relationship with that can make or break

230
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:33,630
the brand of your company or yourself so

231
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:35,430
I found building relationships is the

232
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,319
most important thing to do when you're

233
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,508
talking about information security I

234
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:41,550
never found myself to be a sales person

235
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:43,680
until I got in the sales side of things

236
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:45,689
but I figured as a Cecil I'm actually

237
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,599
the one of the ultimate salespeople

238
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:49,860
because I have to impact change in an

239
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,750
organization that does not want to

240
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,759
change and it makes it sometimes harder

241
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,529
but for good reasons so you have to be

242
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,060
able to communicate that to make people

243
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,680
change the way they've been doing

244
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,599
business for thirty years it's a

245
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,750
difficult job and sometimes it's an

246
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,519
extra task but there's the benefits once

247
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,500
you understand that you can use those

248
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,670
relationships to position your message

249
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:14,670
another great movie in the 90s so this

250
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:18,410
is a the whole movies fun for me but

251
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:21,510
it's about positioning your message so

252
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:23,189
Billy Hoyle is basically a hustler in

253
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,760
basketball if you haven't seen white men

254
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,399
can't jump

255
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,920
great movie he goes out and he just

256
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,870
hustles the street and wins a lot of

257
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,939
money doing this but it's a balance

258
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:36,449
about how he's positioning himself he

259
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:39,269
has these gray socks long shirt baggy

260
00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:41,760
shorts a hat backwards not what you

261
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:43,050
typically see on a basketball court I

262
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,730
grew up playing basketball on the east

263
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:46,709
side of Detroit I never saw a guy like

264
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,360
that playing basketball if it was

265
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:49,649
anybody was probably me that looked like

266
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,019
that guy playing basketball

267
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:54,360
so it was positioning myself or

268
00:11:52,019 --> 00:12:00,209
positioning your message to be able to

269
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:00,779
get in and win win your objectives so

270
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:03,239
tools

271
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:06,149
I see people processes and technologies

272
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,939
as tools they're all components to a

273
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:11,430
business outcome and I always always

274
00:12:08,939 --> 00:12:13,880
focus on people I think with the right

275
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:16,949
people you can make the biggest impact

276
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:19,140
just like with the right wave you can

277
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:20,670
have your ride the longest or could be

278
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,860
the shortest so this is kind of some

279
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:24,300
transitions between surfing and security

280
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,350
if you don't have the right people or

281
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,560
the right wave you're not going to surf

282
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:29,940
long and you're not gonna last long so

283
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,130
what you can do is find the right people

284
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,440
make the right wave that you can ride

285
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:36,720
long how do you do that understand what

286
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,820
your processes are so the speed of the

287
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,430
wave matters the height of the wave

288
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:43,080
matters and the weight of the boat that

289
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:44,550
you're behind makes a huge difference in

290
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,860
the way that it creates so understanding

291
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:48,479
what components make up the processes is

292
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,850
the next most important step

293
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,260
technology is the tools that you

294
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:55,380
actually use to create that business

295
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:57,450
outcome so for me it's the boat it's the

296
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:59,490
surfboard I've got boards that have a

297
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,780
1-inch fin and only one of them

298
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:03,840
I've got boards I have four inch fins

299
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:05,880
with with five inch depth they were used

300
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,650
for different things if I want to spin I

301
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,880
use this the board with a small little

302
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:11,069
thing if I want to go super fast and

303
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,439
jump out of the wave I use the five or

304
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:15,330
the four fin board different things for

305
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,600
different outcomes just like you at your

306
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,920
job

307
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,710
if you want to communicate something

308
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,089
with finance talk to them about what

309
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:23,910
matters in finance getting records

310
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:25,950
cleaner of having faster access it to

311
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:28,350
anywhere understanding what makes it

312
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:30,450
easier for them to do their job makes

313
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:33,600
the difference but always focus on the

314
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:35,610
people decisions one of my favorite

315
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,770
things so how do these things kind of

316
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:39,510
relate together so when you're going to

317
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:41,670
the store and you're going to look for

318
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:43,080
an Apple how much time do you take to

319
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:46,260
make that decision whether gonna get

320
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,760
this Apple or that Apple probably not

321
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,050
much decision right you look for any bad

322
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,090
spots I'm gonna buy it you know why

323
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:52,800
because it costs you less than a buck

324
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,780
and the impact of getting this Apple

325
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,270
over that Apple impact is the key word

326
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:59,220
is not much right no not much of a

327
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:01,380
difference okay think about you're gonna

328
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,240
redo your kitchen how much does it cost

329
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:05,189
injury to a kitchen between 20 and 50

330
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,240
grand maybe you're gonna think a little

331
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,530
bit harder you're gonna interview some

332
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,120
consult you're gonna interview some

333
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:11,100
contracting companies take some

334
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,920
recommendations I'm gonna put more time

335
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,650
into the decision because there's a

336
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,990
bigger impact to you just like in your

337
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:20,160
organization some decisions you can make

338
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,020
really quick and you shouldn't spend

339
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,480
much time thinking about those others

340
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,230
there's a long play think about those

341
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,060
long played to say

342
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,830
and get feedback from other people

343
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,719
there's a bigger impact here when you're

344
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:33,420
thinking about things and the last is a

345
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,930
scalpel I've had I don't know eight or

346
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:39,510
nine surgeries throughout my my life and

347
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:41,699
I had interviewed people I got

348
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:43,439
recommendations from doctors I looked at

349
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,790
recovery time whether to have it have a

350
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,960
surgery or not have a surgery and

351
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,490
sometimes I elected not to have a

352
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:50,130
surgery and do physical therapy because

353
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:52,770
the impact of my life was too big to

354
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:54,960
have that one surgery but you put a lot

355
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:56,699
more time and thought into the impact of

356
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,400
a surgery than you would over buying an

357
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:01,170
apple just like in your job think about

358
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,600
the impact that these decisions that

359
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:08,579
you're making every single day can

360
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:10,350
impact you and your organization what I

361
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:14,490
find when I talk to a lot of people is

362
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:17,460
they fail to take an action and I say

363
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:19,410
change is okay if so I would rather have

364
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:21,000
someone make it a decision take a step

365
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,740
and realize it's the wrong step and then

366
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,630
take a sidestep you've actually made

367
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,280
some progress it may not be the most

368
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:28,380
effective progress but in life you think

369
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,480
you have this pick this very straight

370
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,680
line you don't you have this jagged line

371
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,660
and why do you have this jagged line

372
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,459
because you're making decisions but

373
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,439
you're progressing typically you don't

374
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:40,440
start here and go down you're making

375
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,840
decisions that are impactful and that

376
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:46,140
you are trying to achieve something so

377
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:48,660
making a decision is okay being the

378
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:50,520
chief no officer is not okay locking

379
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,469
everything down don't do this you can't

380
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,689
do this being the fear monger doesn't

381
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:56,220
work it's you're gonna be booted out and

382
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:58,770
not listened to and people are smart

383
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,480
that's why we've survived because we're

384
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:02,340
smart and we are innovative we find ways

385
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,340
around processes we find ways around

386
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:07,200
guards we found ways around systems that

387
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:09,390
are put in place to control us humans

388
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,040
exist because we were innovative and if

389
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:12,420
someone wants to do a job that you put

390
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,430
all these protections in they're gonna

391
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,750
do it probably in a more insecure way

392
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:17,699
than the originally planned because you

393
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:20,700
put all these controls in so don't do it

394
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:23,610
have the conversation be a negotiator I

395
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:25,920
have an example I try to get the sheriff

396
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:28,950
to do something and he said I'm in a

397
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:32,099
locked building I've got two deputies in

398
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:35,280
front of my office with guns I have to

399
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:38,220
run or two guns no one's gonna mess with

400
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,939
me kind of mentality well are you here

401
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,030
at six

402
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,230
o'clock at night no people have acts at

403
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:45,390
the cleaning crew has access to your

404
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,930
data has access to your files has access

405
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,699
to your computer

406
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:49,229
let's wrap a couple controls around

407
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,930
there and then once I started

408
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:54,570
negotiating about locking your files in

409
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:56,339
having a tighter screensaver window

410
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:59,040
certain things that I thought were

411
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:00,150
important to it to me he said that

412
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,709
sounds reasonable

413
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,569
no problem and then I had him forever

414
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:06,000
every other decision I wanted to take

415
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:08,370
he's felt that I understood took the

416
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,130
time as a technologist as what he looked

417
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:14,629
at me as an IT guy - time to go over

418
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:17,790
there understand his point of view I

419
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:21,270
communicated my point of view and we had

420
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:24,599
a happy outcome it was great

421
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:27,720
but having that solution negotiation

422
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:29,040
mentality will go way too far also

423
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,640
understanding what your peers are doing

424
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:35,700
I talked to CISOs every week and as soon

425
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,590
as I say you know your competitors are

426
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,810
doing X Y & Z they start to lean in a

427
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,830
little bit more they want to know what

428
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:42,780
their competitors are doing from a

429
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:45,030
security standpoint are they keeping par

430
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:47,280
are they doing more are they doing less

431
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,960
because ultimately their bosses are

432
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,000
gonna be talking oh you're not doing X

433
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,620
you're not looking at thread Intel we

434
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,110
found some great things we found this we

435
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,120
did this and we did that always look at

436
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:58,800
your peers for great ideas you don't

437
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,870
need to come off the ideas yourselves

438
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,399
use the people that you have in your

439
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:04,770
network the people down the street I

440
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,780
found that I spent the first seven in my

441
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,639
year seven years of my life and security

442
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:10,020
focusing I was in an international

443
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,970
company so I talked with my peers within

444
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,950
my own company and I only got as good as

445
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:16,110
those peers in my own company once I

446
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:19,380
left and started talking to Tier one

447
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:21,689
suppliers healthcare CISOs all these

448
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,920
other type utility sees those we had

449
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,780
great ideas that I don't even thought of

450
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,770
because it wasn't in my vertical but

451
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,750
there were probably good ideas that

452
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:30,090
transitioned to my new group to my new

453
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,680
role so I leveraged those ideas I took

454
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:33,179
power points and said I'm just gonna

455
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,530
change the name wrapped a couple new

456
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,970
boxes in there and say I'm gonna use

457
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,860
your stuff and they were they were happy

458
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:40,440
to give it to me and likewise I shared

459
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,179
with them I would go to their their team

460
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,980
meetings and and talk to their team

461
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:46,020
about how they can better improve their

462
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:50,450
security so these lessons learned across

463
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:50,450
even verticals are helpful

464
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:57,039
but also keep in mind that you have to

465
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:59,499
not blindly follow everything that one

466
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:02,320
organization tells you use your own

467
00:18:59,499 --> 00:19:04,089
brain you know best what will work in

468
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,359
your organization and if you don't ask

469
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:09,519
questions you can't just say take the

470
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:10,809
the direction of your your superiors and

471
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:12,969
say this is what you must do what you

472
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:14,799
could but I suggest that you don't I say

473
00:19:12,969 --> 00:19:16,450
how always have a counter-argument and

474
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,529
say well what if we did it this way or

475
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,779
this makes sense but have you considered

476
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:21,909
this just blindly following this

477
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:23,589
protocol in my opinion you're not you're

478
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:27,639
doing your you yourself and your

479
00:19:23,589 --> 00:19:28,239
organization a disservice practice makes

480
00:19:27,639 --> 00:19:29,498
perfect

481
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:30,960
or at least better haven't that I think

482
00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:34,299
we get the perfect but at least better

483
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:38,070
and I always say start small so you

484
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:41,019
can't change the entire organization and

485
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:42,009
there's for all security controls and

486
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:44,259
come in and say they're here we did an

487
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:46,149
assessment there are 700 bad things that

488
00:19:44,259 --> 00:19:47,409
we're doing starting tomorrow we're

489
00:19:46,149 --> 00:19:49,539
gonna change everything that just

490
00:19:47,409 --> 00:19:51,519
doesn't work but start at something

491
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:54,219
small that you can have a positive

492
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,929
change for a low cost and a quick

493
00:19:54,219 --> 00:19:58,960
turnaround time with a big impact I

494
00:19:55,929 --> 00:20:00,489
always use time cost and impact as my

495
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,679
decision points when I'm doing security

496
00:20:00,489 --> 00:20:04,210
is it cheap is it easy and is there a

497
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:06,249
big impact if I can find those things

498
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:07,989
those are great quick wins I'll do those

499
00:20:06,249 --> 00:20:10,929
all day long then you start to build

500
00:20:07,989 --> 00:20:13,210
your case it's a good strategy to take

501
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:16,839
that's made it effective for me in my

502
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:19,629
career again learn from others and teach

503
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:21,609
I think preparing for things like this

504
00:20:19,629 --> 00:20:23,468
talking to people you'll have a friend

505
00:20:21,609 --> 00:20:25,178
for life I've mentored people inside my

506
00:20:23,469 --> 00:20:28,029
company I've mentioned people outside my

507
00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:29,710
company when you are put on the pedestal

508
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:31,599
to teach someone you actually have to

509
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,830
research a little bit more and figure

510
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,019
out you do you really know this topic

511
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,639
you may think you know this topic but it

512
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:38,440
may change in the last 10 years and

513
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:40,089
you're like I used to know Dean that's

514
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,379
pretty well well man I haven't really

515
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:43,178
kept up with I know Dean s everybody's

516
00:20:41,379 --> 00:20:45,820
internal CMS but really attacks have

517
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:48,549
changed things have changed methods have

518
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:50,499
changed technology has come out

519
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:53,259
there's tool changes things have

520
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:54,339
definitely evolved so if you're in a

521
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:56,139
position where you actually have to be

522
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:57,789
you're the expert you have to go out and

523
00:20:56,139 --> 00:21:00,758
teach somebody I actually had to go out

524
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:03,190
and do my own upkeep you know refreshes

525
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:05,260
of certain things but you'll definitely

526
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:07,510
have a friend for life I've got friends

527
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,549
that I've mentored and we're good

528
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:11,410
buddies now so that I'm learning from

529
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:13,510
them which I taught them things 12 years

530
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:15,220
ago my direct reports probably every

531
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:17,679
single job I still keep in touch with

532
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:19,360
when we share family stories and we and

533
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,350
we share professional stories and I'm

534
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,389
learning from them and they're learning

535
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:25,120
from us from me so it's fantastic and

536
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:28,650
then write down your goals I've this

537
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:32,168
picture is I had a wrist surgery back in

538
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:33,790
2011 and the sarai two surgeries on my

539
00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:35,260
wrist the first one failed the second

540
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:38,230
one either have a full reconstruction of

541
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:41,140
my wrist and the doctor said you

542
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:44,020
shouldn't lift anything more than 225

543
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:46,240
pounds and I still work out today I've

544
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:48,400
worked out since I was 19 I go four to

545
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,679
five days a week and I've done that for

546
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,450
thirty years consistently because that's

547
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:54,460
what I like to do there's a couple

548
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:57,100
things that I'm passionate about one is

549
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:59,080
information security two is working out

550
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:01,389
and then I picked up surfing in the last

551
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:04,240
four four years but working out as much

552
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:06,040
as mine is my jam I love doing it I feel

553
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,440
great about it you'll see in a slide

554
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:11,020
deck but I've got goals I've written

555
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:14,260
down my goals how much I weighed how

556
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:16,600
much I lifted since 1993 it was in paper

557
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:18,780
format up until 2003 and now it's

558
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:22,540
digital so I can go back and tell you on

559
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:24,040
October 5th of 2007 what I was doing how

560
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,750
much I was deadlifting how much I was

561
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,610
bench pressing how much I weighed

562
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:29,440
yada-yada-yada because that's what I'm

563
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:31,389
passionate about I like to teach people

564
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,700
I've had one workout partner that stuck

565
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:35,950
with me the last five years I probably

566
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:38,140
had 50 workout partners since nineteen

567
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:40,090
but this is the guy that we would ride

568
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:42,370
to the gym together every day and we

569
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:44,010
hang out we're great friends we're

570
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:46,780
passionate about we push each other and

571
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:47,770
I found that he's probably my best

572
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,600
friend now because we're passionate

573
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:52,090
about something and we love to do the

574
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,309
same thing we from the workout

575
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:56,350
perspective it's great but without

576
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:59,160
writing it down I would never achieved

577
00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:02,889
this which was my Pete my personal best

578
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:06,700
dead lifted this which is 510 pounds a

579
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:09,669
month ago prior to this summer I had

580
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:11,590
only done 470 the most and I hurt my

581
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:13,630
back when I tried to do more and I would

582
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,740
revolve and try it again and try it

583
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,659
again and then finally I said you know

584
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,650
I'm not it's not worth it one day I felt

585
00:23:16,659 --> 00:23:22,200
great

586
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:26,430
the gym and I put on some what I put on

587
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:28,630
some crazy rock music white zombie and

588
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:30,820
went in there and I felt great and I

589
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,900
pulled up five ten so if to me that was

590
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,060
cool I'm proud of it I'm passionate

591
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:37,510
about it this is something else

592
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:40,060
so while surfing it's light out longer

593
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:41,650
I'm drinking more beer and I'm eating

594
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:43,870
more bad food because we're staying out

595
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:45,460
later on the weekends so I put on 10

596
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,840
pounds over the summer time even though

597
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:49,180
I continued working I was putting more

598
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:51,040
calories in the more calories burned so

599
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:53,290
I said okay fatty time to burn some

600
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:56,290
calories to get at it so I said I want

601
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:58,810
to get down to 185 I was up to 196 I

602
00:23:56,290 --> 00:24:02,409
said I'm gonna give myself 50 days well

603
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:04,780
today is day 35 so I stepped on the

604
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:07,180
scale yesterday I got down to my goal in

605
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:09,490
34 days and primarily it's because I

606
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:14,560
exercise 40 minutes a day every single

607
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:16,780
day for 34 days and I ate eggs with

608
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,520
broccoli and hot sauce for breakfast

609
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:20,230
every day two cups of coffee and a

610
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,420
protein shake and it sounds kind of

611
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:24,520
gross maybe to you but I feel phenomenal

612
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:26,200
I've got so much energy that I'm not

613
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,970
putting potato chips in I'm not eating

614
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,010
ice cream I'd grab a cookie for my kids

615
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:31,690
I would do all these things that I'm

616
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,460
working out five days a week I can have

617
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:36,040
that well what happens if you keep doing

618
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:37,990
that you put on ten pounds and you're

619
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:42,190
not happy about it but writing down the

620
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:42,820
right goal got me to my objective two

621
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,950
minutes left

622
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:47,320
all right so two more objectives I think

623
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:50,800
keep it simple I'm a huge fan of the

624
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:52,210
power of three if you can whittle down

625
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,770
your message to three things you want to

626
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:55,240
do you'll achieve those three things if

627
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:56,350
you have more than three most likely

628
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,390
you're not going to accomplish those as

629
00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:00,070
quickly as you probably could so focus

630
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:01,360
on the power of three so it's a great

631
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:04,330
marketing message people can remember

632
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,679
three things you should do it what's in

633
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:07,720
it for them when you're speaking with

634
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,610
people especially about cyber always

635
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,890
include what's in it for them you'll get

636
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:14,679
their attention and you'll probably a

637
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:15,790
lot be a lot more successful focus on

638
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,980
the strengths of the people in your

639
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:19,300
organization there's a lot of people

640
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:22,390
that have great strengths that we never

641
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:24,129
leverage do it passion is contagious

642
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:26,170
hang out with people that are passionate

643
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:27,790
about the topics whether they're in your

644
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:29,650
company or outside your company that's

645
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:31,270
why you're here probably hang out with

646
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:37,180
more passionate people

647
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:39,310
execute I call it GSD get done find

648
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:41,290
others that are passionate we have less

649
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:43,600
than a three a six degree of Kevin Bacon

650
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:45,460
and IT security it's a one degree of

651
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,870
Kevin Bacon an information security you

652
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,730
know everybody or at least know somebody

653
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:50,050
that knows everybody walk around here

654
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:51,250
you can't walk around without just doing

655
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:53,169
