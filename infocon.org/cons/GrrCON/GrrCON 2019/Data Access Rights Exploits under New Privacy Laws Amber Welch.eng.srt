1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:07,470
good afternoon welcome to the 4:30

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:10,889
edition of gurken in this here room I

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,690
think we called 4:30 edition or 1630 if

4
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:15,750
you're one of those military timing

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:18,029
nerdy guys like me so I happy to present

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:22,369
amber well she's going to be talking

7
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:22,369
about gdpr and a bunch of other acronyms

8
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:27,779
thank you that's very accurate summary

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,279
although not potentially very exciting

10
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:36,030
so I hope you enjoy it more than just

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:39,239
hearing about acronyms so I am I'm amber

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:42,210
Welch I work for Mackenzie I manage the

13
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,959
security and privacy program for the

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:48,090
healthcare analytics data analytics

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,840
processing so we provide a few services

16
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:54,030
to healthcare organizations and as part

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,530
of that we have healthcare data and it's

18
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,930
my responsibility to protect it while

19
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,800
it's in our care I've also worked in

20
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:04,589
audit and assessment for privacy law so

21
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:07,920
primarily CCPA GDP are things like that

22
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:09,710
and have also worked managing security

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,119
and privacy for a multinational

24
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:14,210
hospitality software organization so

25
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,380
I've seen privacy from a few different

26
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:19,259
directions and across a few different

27
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,240
countries so to give you a little

28
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,340
context I usually give this as a

29
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,289
one-hour talk but I'm going to be trying

30
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,810
to fit this into 25 minutes so we're

31
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,210
gonna skip a little bit on a few things

32
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,070
I won't take questions here but I will

33
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,289
leave immediately and if you want to

34
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,600
talk to me there just go outside also

35
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,390
I'm on Twitter so if you can't catch me

36
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,798
feel free to reach out there also all of

37
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,710
these slides will be available online

38
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,840
and there is content in a github

39
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,270
repository as well so if you want to

40
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,340
look up any of the legal references or

41
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,360
find any of the references for sources

42
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:57,240
that I've used everything's available

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:02:00,509
there that direction okay so what we're

44
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:03,298
going to talk about today is what data

45
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,180
subject requests are some of the evil

46
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,740
things that you can do with D SRS and

47
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,330
defense strategies if you're in charge

48
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:13,430
of an organization that is responsible

49
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,430
for responding to any of these requests

50
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,520
so data subject requests anybody

51
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,590
familiar with this term it's it's been

52
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,290
it familiar to Americans for a little

53
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:26,700
while now but still maybe not something

54
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:28,260
in common vernacular so what we want to

55
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,170
be aware of now is that we're in a

56
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:34,560
global privacy era the advent of gdpr

57
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:37,559
which isn't European law changed the

58
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:41,220
context of privacy law because we no

59
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,950
longer can think only of our ability to

60
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:46,320
comply with our own region so we now

61
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:50,339
have to comply potentially with privacy

62
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:53,700
laws for other other jurisdictions if we

63
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,170
have data on those residents so it's it

64
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,420
kind of has changed the nature of

65
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:01,260
compliance and changed the way that we

66
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:04,850
think about how we structure programs so

67
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:07,709
the u.s. the EU Brazil APEC region

68
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:10,320
Canada all have similar privacy laws

69
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:11,790
with a few different changes the access

70
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,950
laws that we're going to be talking

71
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,500
about today is a particular right that

72
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:18,510
people have to access information about

73
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,690
themselves and there are differences

74
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,679
between the regions but usually they

75
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,810
kind of follow the same sort of

76
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,660
principles so I'm going to talk in terms

77
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,680
of the GDP are just for ease but do know

78
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,230
that you can kind of apply these

79
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,090
principles to different regions if

80
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:37,290
you're working in maybe Canada with

81
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:40,200
Poppy that's very similar so there are

82
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:42,900
four primary rights under this category

83
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,730
you have the general access right which

84
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,250
is the ability to access all of the

85
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,500
information that a company holds on you

86
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,790
the other one is modification or

87
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,160
sometimes called the right to

88
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:55,260
rectification this is where maybe that

89
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,780
company has incorrect information and

90
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,370
you can request that they fix or update

91
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,010
that information so if they're saying

92
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,440
that you're a serial killer then you get

93
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:07,109
to say oh hold up now let's not go that

94
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:10,410
way you would also have the right to

95
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:12,120
erasure this was often called the right

96
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,820
to be forgotten when people were talking

97
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,380
about gdpr when it first came out also

98
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,120
called the right to deletion these are

99
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,130
basically all the same thing this is the

100
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,899
one that made companies panic the most

101
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,200
especially the ones that heavily

102
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:26,280
monetized personal information there's

103
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,110
another one called the

104
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,840
right to portability this is a little

105
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,639
bit lesser-known but one of the risks

106
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,310
here is that if you were able to

107
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,669
successfully execute a portability

108
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:40,410
request which is the right to transfer

109
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:41,520
to a competitor company you could

110
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,260
potentially get personal information

111
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,180
that way as well and it's it's less

112
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,280
commonly known so maybe organizations

113
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:51,120
haven't done a good job of preparing for

114
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,820
that one so there are a few different

115
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,660
challenges that are new under this kind

116
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:59,820
of new world of privacy compliance we

117
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,370
have the challenge of a metadata and

118
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:04,290
indirect identifiers so we in the US

119
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:07,169
tend to think of privacy as very much

120
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:09,330
PII equals human readable personal

121
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:11,789
information names addresses telephone

122
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:15,180
numbers email addresses that's kind of

123
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:18,210
the HIPAA era of understanding privacy

124
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,950
but now gdpr and the upcoming CCPA

125
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,919
understand that there may be machine

126
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:24,990
readable information that that a person

127
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:27,270
can't necessarily look at and and know

128
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:30,419
that it is associated with a human being

129
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:32,400
but in the context of a larger record it

130
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:34,560
could be personal data so we need to

131
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,539
switch into an understanding of personal

132
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,210
data as hackers understand it really

133
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:41,729
which is that you might be able to tell

134
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:44,039
who someone is from information that

135
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:45,930
isn't immediately obvious as personal

136
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:49,490
data so this is really a good thing for

137
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:53,240
us we we have a move forward in this

138
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:56,250
location data is yep so precise GPS data

139
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:59,430
and there are when you get into the

140
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:01,979
complexities of it you have to there are

141
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,510
ways of identifying how precise it has

142
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:07,469
to be before it becomes personal

143
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:09,960
information also we have household and

144
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:12,630
device data and we really have CCPA to

145
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,210
thank for bringing this to light this is

146
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:18,840
information that's associated with IOT

147
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,669
vehicles people who are simply visitors

148
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,440
in your house are covered so this is

149
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:24,330
really good because we know that this is

150
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,479
how information works so we're kind of

151
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:30,419
moving forward on on that front there's

152
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:32,099
also a new concept of linkable data so

153
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:34,200
this means that personal data which

154
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,150
isn't currently associated with an

155
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,610
individual but could be combined with

156
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,919
another data set is personal data in its

157
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,750
car

158
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,790
form so one of the challenges here is

159
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:46,240
that you may have personal data that you

160
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:48,190
don't know for sure can't be linked with

161
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,380
something and become identifiable so the

162
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,540
more conservative approach is to assume

163
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:55,659
that the data is going to be personal

164
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:57,490
information there's another really

165
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,230
interesting concept here which is from

166
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:01,750
the EU which is the idea of data

167
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:04,900
controller that doesn't necessarily have

168
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:07,060
actual control over the data the EU

169
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,159
defines data controllers as the

170
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:12,010
organisations who kind of control the

171
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,200
means of processing and data processors

172
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:16,780
as the contractors the people who just

173
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,969
follow directions so one of the

174
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,809
interesting things that happened is that

175
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,690
this man

176
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:26,140
Mario submitted a data subject request

177
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:28,719
to Google Spain and he asked them to

178
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:30,099
delete information Google Spain argued

179
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,660
that they were just an indexer and

180
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,880
couldn't really do anything about even

181
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,740
though they did have control of the

182
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,530
information they hadn't necessarily done

183
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,600
anything active to to gather it aside

184
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:42,940
from their general indexing the EU

185
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,250
disagreed and then did force Google

186
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,890
Spain to comply with the request so we

187
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:50,380
have to understand that even if you

188
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:52,570
simply have come across the information

189
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:57,430
you do still have responsibility for

190
00:07:52,570 --> 00:08:00,340
executing these requests so essentially

191
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:02,470
any data that can be P can be linked is

192
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:05,890
personal information and to really be

193
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:07,480
treated as such so companies generally

194
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:09,909
panicked about this if you remember

195
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,620
about a year and a half ago people

196
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:13,900
freaked out they didn't know how to deal

197
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,790
with it the the response was generally

198
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,659
hire lawyers provide all of the

199
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:21,820
information when you get a request and

200
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,800
basically don't do anything that could

201
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,780
lead to a complaint so the companies

202
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,370
didn't tend to think of incorrectly

203
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:30,340
fulfilling these requests as a data

204
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:32,919
breach which it is so there are two

205
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:34,539
primary ways of fulfilling these data

206
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:37,449
subject requests there's a manual

207
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:39,939
process which is you send an email or

208
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:42,280
fill out a web form or talk to somebody

209
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,530
in person they take the information down

210
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,780
run off and fulfill the request there's

211
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:48,610
also a way of doing it by authenticating

212
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:50,560
into an account and then doing a button

213
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,880
click some companies have gone the

214
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,040
direction of using the authentication

215
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,079
for the

216
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,240
portion and allowing you to start the

217
00:08:55,079 --> 00:09:00,019
process but then fulfilling it manually

218
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,459
so this is kind of the 23andme approach

219
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:04,079
so companies usually choose which

220
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:06,829
approach they're going to take based on

221
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:08,969
technical feasibility and the ROI

222
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:10,319
essentially how difficult it will be or

223
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:14,610
expensive it will be to go either

224
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:16,050
direction so that's kind of the

225
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,600
high-level overview of what these

226
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,769
requests are so what kind of evil things

227
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,420
can you do with it I'm sure you've

228
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:24,779
already got some ideas just from that

229
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:28,170
information one of my favorite ones is

230
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:30,209
the concept of legal DDoS so fulfilling

231
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:33,479
request is actually very difficult even

232
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:36,810
the even the requests that are completed

233
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:40,920
in an automated way have their own risks

234
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:42,899
and do are very expensive to set up so

235
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,360
what can happen here is that an

236
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:48,750
organization would be subjected to a

237
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,220
potential flood of requests this is

238
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,959
especially problematic for ones that

239
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,940
need to be processed manually or have

240
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:57,599
any kind of manual component to them

241
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:59,910
because an organization could have say

242
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,010
they only process unexpected ten to

243
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:04,889
fifteen per month and then they have a

244
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:06,600
thousand you do have a limited amount of

245
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:08,060
time to comply with these requests so if

246
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,680
you missed that you do risk

247
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:12,300
non-compliance you're also a lot more

248
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,430
likely to make mistakes if you're just

249
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,790
trying to churn through a gigantic list

250
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:22,019
of requests this also happens naturally

251
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:25,260
and organically so if you remember a

252
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:26,370
couple of weeks ago lizard ran into a

253
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:30,449
little bit of hot water

254
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:32,730
they had a an incident related to a Hong

255
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:35,370
Kong protester and there are a lot of

256
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:37,680
people who were very angry about this so

257
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:40,529
what they did what a lot of the gamers

258
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,599
did is flood Blizzard with data subject

259
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:43,920
requests it was very funny because I

260
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,670
started giving this talk before this

261
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,860
happened and it was unfortunate for

262
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:52,459
Blizzard but interesting to see this

263
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,329
actually play out in real life

264
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:55,680
Blizzard didn't really have a very good

265
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:56,339
response to this which we'll go over

266
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,949
later

267
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:01,079
but this is kind of something that you

268
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:03,339
want to assume will happen naturally as

269
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:05,589
either a public data breach or

270
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:07,030
when you have bad press so this may even

271
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:09,100
be something that you would want to put

272
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:11,800
into incident response planning to have

273
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:17,800
capacity to scale for data subject

274
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:19,660
requests if you get a large flood and to

275
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,490
really drive this home the data subject

276
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,469
requests can be extremely expensive to

277
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:25,210
fulfill properly especially if you have

278
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,700
to redact any information or you have

279
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:29,770
sensitive data that you're working with

280
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:32,200
James here had a data subject request

281
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:35,770
that cost two hundred and forty thousand

282
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:38,890
pounds for the midwifery clinic to

283
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:40,840
fulfill so this this was because he

284
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:42,610
submitted a data subject request in

285
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,740
response to the death of his son which

286
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:47,320
he believed was wrongful and the

287
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,910
midwifery clinic wanted to protect their

288
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,130
own position and not provide that much

289
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:53,589
information so they outsource this to a

290
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:55,770
legal firm this is obviously a very

291
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:59,110
extreme case but would be very expensive

292
00:11:55,770 --> 00:12:00,819
the average cost for a data subject

293
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:03,040
requests that has to be fulfilled

294
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,530
manually the only place I could find

295
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,839
stats for this was in the UK but it cost

296
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:10,780
one hundred and forty five pounds per

297
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:13,860
request and guess how much companies are

298
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:17,470
allowed to charge to submit the request

299
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:19,420
nothing yes absolutely zero so this is

300
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,340
completely free and if you're combining

301
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,650
that with this legal DDoS it could

302
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:27,940
become profoundly expensive and and

303
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:31,150
disruptive to your organization so as an

304
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:34,000
example Twitter decided that I was mail

305
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:36,430
which I found very entertaining so I

306
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,350
asked the DPO I went to their forum and

307
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:41,109
said you know hello Twitter why do you

308
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,850
think I'm a guy and a couple of weeks

309
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,860
later I get back this extremely lengthy

310
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:48,430
and probably a lawyer written response

311
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:51,790
so on a whim I can essentially cost them

312
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:54,550
legal money I could continue having this

313
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:57,069
conversation with the DPO you guys could

314
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:58,449
go and do this yourself check it out see

315
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:00,490
if you have any questions and you can

316
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,560
have a conversation with that legal team

317
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,390
and they have to spend resources to

318
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:10,630
respond to you and it doesn't cost you

319
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:13,960
anything to ask questions so does anyone

320
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:16,390
remember ship your enemies' glitter so

321
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,390
this is someone was inspired and decided

322
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:20,510
to create

323
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:22,370
ship your enemies gdpr which is a form

324
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:25,280
that will auto-generate

325
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:28,220
a request that asks for every single

326
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,500
legally available data subject request

327
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,780
under the GDP are every single one there

328
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:36,200
are even more there's seven categories

329
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:37,480
and subsets under them so if you really

330
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,440
want to ruin someone's day I'm not

331
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,440
suggesting that you do this but this

332
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,360
does exist and the thing to remember is

333
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,980
that this is perfectly legal and it's

334
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,990
also very confusing for companies

335
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:50,660
because boilerplate text is often how we

336
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:52,070
identify phishing but if actual human

337
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:56,420
beings are using it how do you know the

338
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:58,430
difference okay so some fishing tactics

339
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,079
I'm not gonna spend too much time on

340
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:02,900
this for the sake of time so take a

341
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,450
photo if you want to but you can use

342
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,800
data subject requests for fishing

343
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:09,230
because it's really the only time that

344
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,780
you get to engage with a company in a

345
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:13,460
perfectly legally valid way just asking

346
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:16,430
for information that's literally what

347
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,630
this is for this law was created to

348
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:20,359
allow you to ask for personal

349
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:22,430
information so you could do things like

350
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,070
ask for updates verbally you're allowed

351
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:26,839
to do that under the law you can ask to

352
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:28,790
speak to the privacy officer you can

353
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,410
claim that you can't access the email

354
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,880
they can't refuse to fulfill it just

355
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:35,750
because you don't have access to the

356
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:37,490
email you can also this is another thing

357
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,320
that you could do if you had a data set

358
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:41,150
from a different organization you could

359
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,790
potentially use some of that information

360
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:45,890
to try to get through the ID procedures

361
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,420
for a different company and then extract

362
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:50,390
additional information then build a

363
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:53,270
profile that way so this is where you

364
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:55,220
would possibly be be able to make

365
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:58,040
progress on a spear phishing attack or a

366
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,630
CEO fraud another thing that's

367
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,730
interesting is that companies don't tend

368
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:03,980
to tell the data subject if they do

369
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:06,140
identify an invalid request they just

370
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:08,540
ignore it a lot of times they don't even

371
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:10,730
really document it they just they just

372
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:13,250
don't respond or they might say like we

373
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:14,900
won't fulfill this so a person who was

374
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,790
being targeted for an attack like this

375
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:20,810
would potentially never be informed of

376
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:23,030
that you can also escalate with family

377
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:25,520
names especially under that household

378
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:27,380
request type and escalate to higher

379
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,630
value data if there's an organization

380
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,230
that does have escalated vetting

381
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:33,689
procedures for the identity

382
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,580
you can try to get in with a lower

383
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:37,920
sensitivity request and then ask for

384
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,450
additional information financial or

385
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,829
health information beyond that that's

386
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:43,700
more sensitive because you might already

387
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:46,230
have that verified checkbox on your name

388
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,850
another thing that you can do is use

389
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:49,230
common names and I'm always very sad

390
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,880
just help people this because I have a

391
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:53,070
very common name which is why I think

392
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,439
about this I get a lot of emails from

393
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:57,630
other amber Welch's and I I try to

394
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,190
respond as much as possible saying like

395
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:02,700
that's not how you email works please

396
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:05,670
stop doing this but people who have very

397
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:07,920
common names would be potentially very

398
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:09,719
good targets for this kind of attack a

399
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,089
lot of organizations use

400
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,950
government-issued ID as a means of

401
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:16,530
verification even when they never had

402
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:17,790
that government ID before so it's not

403
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:19,410
like they're matching up with existing

404
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:21,510
information they're literally just

405
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:23,339
looking to see that you can submit a

406
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:26,040
copy of a driver's license with

407
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:27,680
someone's name on it so there are there

408
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,599
are quite a few problems with this

409
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,489
imagine what what a name really tells

410
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:37,500
you aside from the fact that that that

411
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:39,510
is your given name so some some reasons

412
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,190
that you might want to use this type of

413
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:44,340
phishing attack is that you can confirm

414
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:47,850
profile data if you want to identify two

415
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:49,080
that the same person is associated with

416
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:51,600
two different records you would be able

417
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,730
to match them up that way you can learn

418
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,610
new data if you're already working on

419
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:57,780
some and you want to build out that data

420
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:03,600
set you can get additional information

421
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:06,000
and the the spearfishing so there is an

422
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,810
organ a group of researchers in Belgium

423
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,310
who actually tested this and there their

424
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:15,270
method for doing the automatic one

425
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:17,698
wasn't quite as quite as strong but if

426
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:20,310
you look at the statistics for the

427
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:23,640
susceptibility of organizations to these

428
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:26,520
manual DSR attacks it's over 25% and

429
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,290
they pulled these organizations from the

430
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,030
top websites in their country so these

431
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:34,080
are large organizations they're not

432
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:36,300
mom-and-pop shops the researchers also

433
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,460
used only publicly available information

434
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:41,159
so there's no information that was

435
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:43,950
gained which wasn't already usable just

436
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,440
from finding things on social media or

437
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:47,980
things

438
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:50,159
were already listed publicly so a few

439
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,990
other things that you can do maliciously

440
00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:54,730
guerrilla marketing a few organizations

441
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:56,679
for privacy vendors we're trying to do

442
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:59,740
marketing this way it doesn't seem very

443
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:02,529
effective but they did try competitor

444
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,669
research actually I'll just I don't

445
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:05,259
think I have enough time to go through

446
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:08,500
all these if you want to you can take a

447
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:09,850
photo or look online this one is my my

448
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,220
least favorite and the most concerning

449
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:14,649
intimate partner violence stalking and

450
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:16,149
harassment if you live with someone then

451
00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:18,639
you will get a lot of information about

452
00:18:16,149 --> 00:18:23,018
them and could be very abusive you can

453
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:27,928
get location data photos messaging

454
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:31,929
history so I think I'm going to skip

455
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:35,620
this one organizations that don't have

456
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:37,210
to FA are especially susceptible to this

457
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,830
as well because if you have an automated

458
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:42,730
request where you simply click a button

459
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:45,610
then someone would be able to if they

460
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:47,169
had a compromised account or even if you

461
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:49,330
just went to the library and were logged

462
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:51,039
into social media if you don't logout

463
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:52,629
and there are no security procedures

464
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,519
around requesting this information

465
00:18:52,629 --> 00:18:57,129
someone can simply download all of your

466
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:59,399
account history and take it this

467
00:18:57,129 --> 00:19:02,350
happened to someone with Spotify because

468
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:04,840
Spotify rather infamously won't add to

469
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:09,639
FA to the accounts so this is one of the

470
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:12,730
challenges and for Twitter as well if

471
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:15,158
you submit an automated dsr through

472
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:16,750
Twitter it does ask for your password

473
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:18,909
but even if you have to FA on the

474
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,679
account it doesn't trigger a to FA again

475
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:23,860
so all you have to do is go into the

476
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:25,509
settings and privacy options and you can

477
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,610
simply put in the password so if the

478
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:30,309
password was included in a data dump

479
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:32,918
you might not realize that your account

480
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:34,720
is vulnerable because the to FA was

481
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:38,019
functional for the actual account itself

482
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:42,129
but then the that secondary step is

483
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:44,980
missing from this DSR portion there's

484
00:19:42,129 --> 00:19:46,928
also no email or UI banner or text

485
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:48,549
message letting you know that a data

486
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:51,279
subject request has been made on your

487
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:52,779
account so a user who is who is under

488
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:54,500
this type of attack wouldn't even be

489
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:57,320
informed of it

490
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,210
when I submitted this request the only

491
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:02,030
information I got about it was this

492
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:03,919
rather unhelpful email which was already

493
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:07,129
at the point where the data was ready to

494
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:09,080
be downloaded telling me to ignore it

495
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:11,299
they did finally change this although

496
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,158
they haven't made changes with the other

497
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:18,200
suggestions that I would prefer to see

498
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:19,820
included so all you have to do is go in

499
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,620
click this button you guys can do this

500
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,500
as well it's a really good exercise to

501
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,969
see how this works and then this is all

502
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,770
the information that you get this took

503
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:30,289
about two hours for me to have delivered

504
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:33,440
to my account this has all of the

505
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:34,669
metadata and account history so for

506
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,919
people who have been using Twitter for

507
00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:39,169
maybe 10 years this is your entire life

508
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:40,940
potentially especially in the security

509
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:42,950
community where Twitter features very

510
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:51,169
heavily in in the way that we connect

511
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:54,409
with each other you know this used to

512
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:56,750
cost 10 pounds the in the UK you used to

513
00:20:54,409 --> 00:20:58,460
be able to charge for these a reasonable

514
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:03,020
fee to dissuade from some of these

515
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:04,640
attacks and that's been taken away so

516
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,740
we've known about this as a potential

517
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,559
problem for over 40 years

518
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:11,630
this has primarily been identified by

519
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:13,280
academic researchers so we've really

520
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:15,380
struggled to bring this to light in the

521
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,110
security community and most people are

522
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:20,270
unaware of this as a potential issue and

523
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,729
privacy tends to be dominated heavily by

524
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:26,600
lawyers who don't tend to be very

525
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:28,280
security minded so my my plea is that

526
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,990
you would become aware of this and make

527
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:32,020
some of the changes in your organisation

528
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:35,330
to prevent these attacks

529
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:37,700
so defense strategies I'm gonna have to

530
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:40,600
do summary slides on some of these so

531
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:42,980
get ready with photos if you want them

532
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,469
there are three primary concerns we're

533
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:47,000
trying to prevent abusive identity

534
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,640
checks where you ask for more

535
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,010
information to verify an individual's

536
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,169
identity than is reasonable so asking

537
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:56,179
for a passport when all you have is like

538
00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:57,130
an ice cream shop loyalty program that's

539
00:21:56,179 --> 00:22:00,230
not reasonable

540
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:03,679
also the overall denial of access you

541
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:06,559
can't simply deny access as a security

542
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,590
procedure but also if you do incorrectly

543
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,299
give that access

544
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:11,428
to data breach so this is the sort of

545
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:14,879
trifecta that we're trying to navigate

546
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:17,970
through correctly I'll skip this you

547
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,460
don't need to know that so the ID

548
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:22,529
challenge is you you will potentially

549
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:25,440
struggle to link the data correctly with

550
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:28,260
one individual person also you can't

551
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,929
require that an account exists you can't

552
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,908
collect excessive information the ID

553
00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:35,070
can't be burdensome and even

554
00:22:32,909 --> 00:22:38,940
government-provided identity services

555
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:42,049
are not potentially very very good means

556
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:44,659
of identifying someone gavotte uk's own

557
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:47,279
estimation of their verification

558
00:22:44,659 --> 00:22:51,210
accuracy is 51 percent that's not very

559
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:53,190
good so also collecting ID documents is

560
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:54,779
just additional information that you now

561
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:56,520
hold on that person that you could be

562
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:58,320
giving out to the wrong individuals so

563
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,289
you're just making the problem worse at

564
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,658
that point so remember you don't need ID

565
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:05,580
documents this is a bad idea

566
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:08,220
please stop doing it it's still super

567
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,539
common even though we have known about

568
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,309
this as an issue for a very long time

569
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:15,840
it's also very easy to photoshop ID

570
00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:19,250
documents this isn't challenging ok so

571
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:22,049
back to Blizzard Blizzard did require

572
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:24,390
government-issued photo IDs in order to

573
00:23:22,049 --> 00:23:26,220
delete Blizzard accounts after the

574
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:29,520
protest related to the Hong Kong

575
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:31,590
incident was in full force so Twitter

576
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,629
users were incredibly incensed about

577
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:35,789
this and rightly so because there's no

578
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:37,590
requirement to show government-issued ID

579
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,820
in order to create the account so

580
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:40,649
they're almost holding these accounts

581
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:42,629
hostage holding the information hostage

582
00:23:40,649 --> 00:23:44,010
by requesting this information which

583
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:48,330
isn't even a very good way of

584
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:51,840
identifying users so there's only really

585
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:54,809
two good methods of ID you can use

586
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,389
identification with one scenario where

587
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:59,039
you already had that information in the

588
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:00,929
first place if you didn't have the

589
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,490
information don't ask for it because

590
00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:06,000
it's not helping you identify that

591
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:08,730
person the other good option is using

592
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,950
shared transactional history so confirm

593
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:13,890
information that only the actual account

594
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:17,070
owner would have secret history between

595
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:21,020
the organization and that user so for

596
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:21,020
example if I go to a hotel and

597
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:29,250
then I'm asked to confirm my identity by

598
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:31,559
say the user ID so the challenge here is

599
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:33,059
like if you asked for information that

600
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:35,039
could be gathered just from one source

601
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:37,649
like a credit card receipt at the hotel

602
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:39,510
bar then you're not actually confirming

603
00:24:37,649 --> 00:24:41,428
valid history so you need to include

604
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:43,590
multiple sources of information that

605
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:45,779
wouldn't just be instantly gathered when

606
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:51,110
somebody was interacting with other

607
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:53,429
socially anybody know what this is

608
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:55,949
Arecibo oh I love it when I get that

609
00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:59,039
answer so the purpose of the Arecibo

610
00:24:55,950 --> 00:25:00,809
message was to establish shared

611
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,750
transactional history between ourselves

612
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:05,789
and potentially anyone who was listening

613
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:08,039
so this is the same idea we if we get

614
00:25:05,789 --> 00:25:10,049
this back to us with some changes or

615
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:11,520
even just reflected back we don't know

616
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:13,559
who's on the other end and we don't need

617
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,360
to that's the important thing is that we

618
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:17,309
know we've established a connection even

619
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,779
if we are sort of agnostic to

620
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:20,700
understanding the identity on the other

621
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:22,980
side so when you're thinking of data

622
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,770
subject requests stop getting hung up on

623
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:28,020
whether you are talking to someone who's

624
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:32,690
driver's license you've seen that's not

625
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:35,399
good ID okay so use graduated ID

626
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:37,919
requirements high highly sensitive data

627
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:41,070
requires more vetting lowly low

628
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,929
sensitivity data does not assume that ID

629
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,350
numbers are compromised this is very

630
00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:44,750
easy

631
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:46,820
you give your passport away to

632
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:50,789
international hotels all the time

633
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:52,529
provide secure ways for individuals to

634
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:55,080
actually provide that information back

635
00:25:52,529 --> 00:25:57,840
to you and consider looking at things

636
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,399
like kyc e or the NIST digital identity

637
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,870
guidelines because they do offer pretty

638
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:05,389
good information about how to verify

639
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:08,250
individuals okay the automated D SARS

640
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:09,870
Rios indicate the session provide

641
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:12,419
information to the users to let them

642
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:15,360
know that this is happening like a UI

643
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:17,159
banner email notification and make sure

644
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,899
that you're campaigning for 2fa so that

645
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:23,370
users are more protected against account

646
00:26:18,899 --> 00:26:24,899
takeover okay this is a photo on I'm not

647
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:26,370
going to talk about these these are the

648
00:26:24,899 --> 00:26:31,199
red flags that will let you know that

649
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:33,059
you're potentially in an attack and you

650
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,830
want to remember that bad data subject

651
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:36,389
requests are a data

652
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:39,570
you have to treat it as such it is

653
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:41,090
reportable and here's my cat I know this

654
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:43,590
is really long

655
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:45,929
okay I'm gonna I'm gonna skim through

656
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:47,010
the rest of this and if you want to see

657
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:50,310
it in more depth

658
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:52,770
grab the slides online so remember you

659
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:54,990
are allowed to reject data subject

660
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:56,430
requests if you are convinced that they

661
00:26:54,990 --> 00:27:00,420
are invalid you simply have to document

662
00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:03,140
why and explain it to the user so these

663
