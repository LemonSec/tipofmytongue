I too so he's talking about 10 all
securities

29
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,579
smart to be you soon not are about the
space pic

30
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:19,739
fender Stevie which is starting out with
about s

31
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,880
Picasa the the vendor

32
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,290
asked me out to not mom and son
offenders them directly

33
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:31,150
but I'm pressure US already recognized
author

34
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:35,560
that TV rights reserved for all right so

35
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,670
of

36
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,750
so today was a small to pay some on the
small TV is so

37
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,130
being very popular in last year I'll

38
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:49,230
there are like 88 me a smarty be sold
and which is some

39
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:54,019
really impress for me and if that's all
you're going to be a more popular

40
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:58,360
and but even though it's a popular vote
there are no loss to research on

41
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:05,349
smart to be okay salsa not to be as as
you know

42
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:09,360
is to use the many feels and home
entertainment office for first

of many companies this they said they
make smart EB

47
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:29,670
and a small to be but in my opinion
smart to me is just a regular PC

48
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,879
but this shows you TV programs

49
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,209
and conducting some in this material and

50

on and left you can see the camera and

57
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:09,239

voice

73
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,169
and of exam hi to be something to song

74
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:14,430
I have to mess on that the first the pic
although some small tourist

75
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,909
research arm as you as i sat on

76
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:22,060
not gonna teach on or search but there's
a summing go as I said already

77
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,630
and the TV sublet boss so on also scored

78
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,589
and mouse not call this a real issues i
mean the body to

79
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:33,339
the fight Fedor I the vendor has made a
lower court

80
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:36,740
so mmm tell all over honza

81
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:40,649
a hundred megabytes are for the by
Norris mmm

82
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:45,010
which means so it's really hard to find
the sum interesting spots I mean

83
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,279
sewn there were also really because of
and

84
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:51,870
the hottest one is that if you do
something wrong

85
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:56,120
your TB I your research can break your
TV

86
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,740
soul some time mister the factory reset
those only work

87
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,950
so you have to send your TV today SNR I

88
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:06,779
the vendor to the to make the vendor to
fix it

89
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:10,390
so on I did it two times but I I didn't
say and its

90
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:16,460
anything so yeah

91
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,680
so I have to say this a lot TV has
almost the same

92
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,979
defector says a smartphone updates like
this song

93
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:28,190
their song that obligation market and

94
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,300
there's also a defector sly common in
the Middle

95
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,479
all when you do a rep rosing on me know
that and

96
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:39,550
there's also prescribe text like a you
put da money so serious mistake

97
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,349
to the PC on this this this is the same

98
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:46,810
so

99
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:51,390
song the first over new research on this
this %ah smartphone

100
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,909
you have to do a routine at the first so
that you

101
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:59,560
you can that two things in the I in the
smartphone

102
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,810
the same meaning as much to me as well
you have to get a shell

103
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,839
to first so

104
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:08,870
um but from

105
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:13,200
they're out really none what's
information about the TV from the vendor

106
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,240
so I had to go to other side legal are

107
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,000
because %uh the zombie go from has so
lot away from my son

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,529
of all manner and if I if I get

109
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:28,029
I'm the ticket to the farm error so I
can do a static analysis

110
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:32,789
on so which means some I could try to
find a summit protests poss

111
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:35,789
so long but all for charity arm

112
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:39,330
disarming or at the time they didn't
have much information on

113
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:44,570
about my TB because saw this on also
really a friend you and

114
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:48,909
so now

115
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:53,060
so we got on now order roseanne and
different more though for mayor

116
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:57,060
but all we could do it article appeared
because that there was a pass or before

117
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,550
that

118
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,200
on this article from what I have to say
hum

119
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,469
to find a war very order so were
whatever

120
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:08,029
but I said to be formed on the call the
is a very big so on

121
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,909
there must be same court now in

122
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:15,909
between the or divers and and the Nexus
One

123
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:21,599
so I have the virus and we have also I D
A

124
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,760
okay um as these TBA is using on the CPU

125
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,300
the I idealize really well on-court

126
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,339
I'm called around also arm

127
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:37,269
I was try to use the UART to get some
people message despite the

128
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:42,060
program us are sewn but I'm already a
hobby or newbie

129
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,410
so overall main Sunam

130
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,480
very quickly about this we ought to stop
the first

131
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,830
so for shiny though the program must

132
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,700
are make a lot of people messages for
are fall for them

133
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:00,470
actual for now costs but are you few
connect if you can connect to UART

134
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:05,339
for the TV are you christiane lot of
people MSS like our segmentation fault

135
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:09,019
or some MMS as if they collect there's
like that

136
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:12,190
am and some the string so

137
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:16,810
really on them I to be very quick can't
when you do us that the analysis

138
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:21,990
for sure so on you have to make that you
ought to feature

139
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,150
you know what about in default it's
disabled

140
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:29,240
so you have to go to get into a sub a
small team the TV

141
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,440
are out there are do actually to waste
to do that 1 year SUP of commute wall of

142
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,610
a are poor on I mean resume your remote
controller

143
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,890
but about that the first long bows and
provide aus

144
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:46,620
all the best the malt song really have
to choose that that's the second walk

145
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,800
if all of a tricky combination

146
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,290
putdown our remote control it doesn't
have to perfect working

147
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:57,480
so all we have to make cuts onto a
serving of

148
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,900
on I some way so we got some heat from
the Sun legal

149
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,130
are asshole so

150
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:09,770
no the other two call the fourth Earl
info and the factory

151
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:13,010
I mean or x1 F or 3p

152
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:16,850
yes so um re you stopping all

153
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,300
and now postponed out to get into out
all the rest moored

154
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,870
and we made it to a remade the New York
Court you outfitter

155
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:28,360
in ample song yet this is comment for
that

156
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,560
so after this one are you can make it
never

157
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,750
and Cassio order to a message from the
TV

158
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:41,190
but arm if this on your site has so your
formula

159
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,610
it's a sign use it because I'm the

160
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,750
arm they are all for use on waste to our

161
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,220
on the North what the FI the former
nurse hard to the TV

162
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,330
which means that you could get those
trail very easily

163
00:10:54,330 --> 00:11:01,160
so on this morn usually

164
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,750
song the TV is a player also bought the
home we still

165
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,370
have the binary Sun UART which is some

166
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:13,880
very nice this chase chase on and

167
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,920
so the basic approach it approaches
stepped on

168
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,980
the reversing by Norris in I mean in now
start

169
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,590
stepped away and a finding some 9:30
spaus

170
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:28,410
to past and te Kingdom at on responses
from the TB I mean that you are two

171
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,160
messages

172
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,160
and you do it you this you do this step
down

173
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,220
done by your if today

174
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,100
so on song as I said before

175
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,760
our alarm none what's mention about the

176
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,810
what affect us because so it's almost
the same to a smartphone

177
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,900
song for the anyway the the first one
you saw us not to be

178
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:58,150
App Store are you can commission that
the smart to be off store so almost same

179
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,720
s/o

180
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,720
like airport App Store or I'm sure the
App Store

181
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,360
things like that but from you can only

182
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,960
I also you can make your program are two
circuits can be running in the TB

183
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:16,530
but you have to write and not data
morning it's just like a C or C plus

184
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:19,220
plus you can twenty you so it sa script

185
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,390
waste ml of less a site that

186
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:26,460
I'm not sure but on this might be a pic
or support portability

187
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:30,440
or on or to some skretta policy

188
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,770
not sure sure they're so the guy from
some so you could ask a man later

189
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:38,610
I mean at this conference song

190
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:44,029
from so I think so the vendor saw white
that's right

191
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:50,390
tool to prevent the bed the guys from
loading my sis programs that parity

192
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:54,230
so so this is a text no you on all your
muscles to

193
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:59,529
operate case onto the market and other
users to download a video pick a son

194
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:03,279
and infected a simple Sol

195
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,110
widest up to writing JavaScript and/or
Flash for for the case on

196
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,920
in May so you cannot call assisting call
indirectly

197
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,070
or you cannot access are many resources
like a process them

198
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:20,200
or because are you on the Opera que son
is running in them for some Russian

199
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,230
song new law basically you cannot

200
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:27,210
arm tomb what's wrong with this
languages stupid error

201
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:31,040
on a super there are some Moscato foxy
site

202
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,390
and there are also a lot of the point
affect us like I use in web browsers

203
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:39,540
miss our mission in Libya look more
about it

204
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:44,100
so on but readout they are on trial for
example read out the file

205
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,290
I your ape-like you gonna cannot make a
pretty cations because some

206
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:52,230
you have to use a database of things
like that in more than a prick a son

207
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,890
I'm also for the wall also the break a
son so the vendors

208
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:59,790
are provided you are some SDK an API

209
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,950
to use sup some

210
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:07,250
are a place like our accessing xxc

211
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:11,890
process them or using some network
traffic if they start that

212
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:15,000
so so basically mmm

213
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,820
there's no sandbox I'm anderson also on
the bus Arctic Tern site

214
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,570
but on the there having to rely on the

215
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,170
the APS curious yourself so on

216
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,960
they are trying to do or something
attack in

217
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,230
almost every API father arlo AP I saw
you you too

218
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:37,790
ready hard to make a sure so fit for
example

219
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:42,890
this one is sure that you cannot open
any file so all signed up to some strict

220
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:46,700
arm Jeffrey yes song

221
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,660
yeah so I have to say to a Payless and
the a pain levels

222
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:54,100
attack a snob passed away am

223
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,910
song they might be a very pick up for

224
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:02,220
on for for says Steve a player like a
crisis am

225
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,620
I your are far are you a pic I

226
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:09,050
but what about all your calls for API
nobody cares about it

227
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:13,520
but there might be some boys site and
the other part of the problem is that

228
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:13,910
the

229
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,490
all public a say is running as a route
to prevent its sooo intestinal

230
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:22,529
separatist

231
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:25,920
the force for art of us one from

232
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,950
South I've on their own the many

233
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:32,190
arms the false but I will home

234
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:37,720
opens or them because some I will tell
you the reason later

235
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,100
the first one art when you make on your
free case on

236
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,570
you have to provide on on XML file to
the

237
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,930
the TB I mean to the end market it
passed campaign

238
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:52,820
to offer a cation name a title comp
ratio no description found not all know

239
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,310
based on the URL you provided

240
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:59,040
all and not see file format

241
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,980
so so as we don't have much time

242
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:07,670
mom this is often called this is a
really bad because some

243
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:11,200
been you trust our own that this API's
on

244
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:16,710
it cost to up the on the bus C and 13 C
and and and

245
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,990
Navy at based they say yes you show it

246
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:23,089
are it or some system Fido

247
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:28,070
cornea Freeport on way to PIDs you silly
it's almost the same s/o system

248
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,910
off on some so it passes so aren't

249
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,050
argument to the voices sound fun Sun

250
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:38,620
sewn if are as if as I told you before

251
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,830
alt follow the URL is so tough see if
I'll

252
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:45,160
so which means I'll it passes all value
I'll

253
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:50,390
read them to that of system also and
são for a fix how

254
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:53,649
binary the call the peeing now owns it

255
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:58,149
of course there's the Senate detect like
com for pie press I call on

256
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:01,920
part saying mister some then also
special characters like a

257
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,299
kilt opportunity creeks could to
multiple

258
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:09,490
are comments at the same time but
they're also hold all of tiny haldol

259
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:14,020
my because you cannot do you sell your
you can I use less paper

260
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:17,399
but no you can use you can you sell

261
00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:22,789
the to YouTube I don't want a value
though or the PW to pick on Picasa

262
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:27,419
the install use a background of the case
on switching means some

263
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:31,210
the all the PWD maybe having always
stuff

264
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:36,860
those slash the value so I can use that
what

265
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:42,900
yet the other one is some democrats on
home in in dhahran the XML file

266
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,910
because he that does so it's just
raining cockpit

267
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:49,140
call Kate if you see a pic AC um

268
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,610
a pesticide of editor 2.0 for some and
it also

269
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:58,340
exactly and azteca it's a actually
already off on some

270
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,340
so you can see that register at the PCA

271
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:06,070
Sussex 2006 2006 talk to sister operate
on topic I can't

272
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:12,500
think that and yeah I P in next x86

273
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,420
so the others that OPM

274
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,100
really many a pest that use SSM false
%uh still

275
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,330
and memnoch rock songs song so

276
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,420
yeah

277
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:30,760
so you can easily get the shell are
using this boss

278
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,820
sewn you cannot rest on bypass

279
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:39,130
call yeah

280
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,920
from psalm I'm pretty sure there are
more

281
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,170
and they are more and more but I cannot
that this cause all the boss

282
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:50,980
but yeah so you consider the quality is
so boss

283
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,300
you may find it I mean this is a really
99 E

284
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,399
boss

285
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,860
yet some hop

286
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:05,850
at the one yet this is so also very
traditional of defector

287
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,470
Aiko when you up on surf's up on the net

288
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:12,960
I'll

289
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,980
so um there's also

290
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:22,660
up the victor home I mean to your cell
like a Facebook application on the site

291
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:27,559
so to me it's like is working like a
mess in school admissions I am

292
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:30,580
saw only you to miss you can do on

293
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,410
active ok tire because you can send your
portal or laying

294
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:37,500
core the images I'm the video to the

295
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,510
to your friends so and

296
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:44,630
there are some insight um

297
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:48,050
yeah so all songs on the web the web
browser

298
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:52,429
has a lot of problems because some I as
you know it's really hard to

299
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:55,800
from the maintained older Texas are

300
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,620
latest in especially in embedded systems

301
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:03,620
so on this is also same on OKC the

302
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:07,130
resigns like on the press was honest up
and walk

303
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:11,929
which is really old on the call I don't
care about the car wasn't fucked

304
00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:15,040
that the press president nor wiki for
things so of

305
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,400
really a serious problem it's like a
soaking within the

306
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,890
really know web browser from many also
so

307
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,390
and there are really in many and that of
them also it's not

308
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:30,840
because on snuff aldape to pee or things
like that

309
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,240
solve the provide to you deal for you

312
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,559
are fifty-five dollars on arm they

313
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,720

314
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,670
the provide also 20 comments X-ray many
of the comments are not the comment on

315
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,809
documented

316
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:57,059
are not but men take it but down

317
00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:00,460
some already having serious problem I
mean

318
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,660
in a screw point of view so for example
arm

319
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,900
the the comment number on long

320
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,240
21 are said to craft or so

321
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,380

325
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,670
or no comments all readout and you of

326
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:29,980
are so for example the comment the 121

327
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:34,290
call somebody inside song to me so you

office a noun i'd all it's a spike the
ball by the Freddie referendum me

330
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:47,120
because I cannot control the value so
you have to do is some

331
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,380
like a huge on spraying

332
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,220
you must answer to so

333
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:58,350
yeah the 626 I'm arm I'm messing just
over

334
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:02,540
quickly because I feel when I of talk
about this all but also stop

335
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,570
so or more about it us on

336
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:09,160
the UK MPs a lot of features inside also

you don't have to be authenticated so

340
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:21,380
some embed in the middle there are a lot
of men in the media issues inside

341
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,940
for example for sending a credential so
we don't think of some

342
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,000
and also Tom hackett

343
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,370
all for the case on I some injecting
mice espero the site

344
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:36,450

346
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:44,460
yeah known cent stake horse theft

347
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,670
yeah also on there are some US to be out
drive a ball inside

348
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:52,270
here which means that you can put by
source yes we stick to the TB

349
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:56,170
and just bought I mean on you have to be
a

350
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:59,440
or other TB to of to try this attack

351
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,679
but anyway how so this is Sergey popular
this way

352
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,059
I mean not for TB party for PC the

353
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:10,830
I so on there are some

354
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:15,120
interesting of defectors as well all we
will try to find the sum them across

355
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,200
some also

356
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,570
are in the cold the posse and a remote
control signals because some

357
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:25,220
it's like a yes sent that wont style the
possum call

358
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,770
ball we failed because he was with tiny
accordance

359
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:32,540
the self itself so on

360
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:36,630
and the broadcasting of this is also on
on should be mass on

361
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:39,740
because the the vendor provides you are

362
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,900
to update to your TV are reading this
three-way race

363
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,440
one yes oh yes a mistake our site call
one is so byee

364
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,880
and internet the the last one huh you
could update your TV by

365
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,110
broadcast signals on which means to you

366
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:57,549
if you could do on us send you see it
all very strong me

367
00:23:57,549 --> 00:24:00,860
or under 2.0 get TB arm maybe

368
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:04,790
the TBA will capture signal is to don't
the the signals from the

369
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:08,840
the vendor no

370
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,780
so yeah today so

371
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:19,780
at this moment are I need to know

372
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,300
sewn I'm listening on

373
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:45,100
8208 original for port it in

374
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:49,390
and she to get us our diverse a share
from Max I'll talk about the reverse

375
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,090
share later

376
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:55,740
okay yes so because some

377
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,620
the sig imy said the second I is a
really big so you can I see the TV

378
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,260
program

379
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:06,800
are sorry secretion song

380
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,150
as I told you I thought the chibi if you
have a show inside

381
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:14,700
it's like it's just like a regular basis
over to mister can do

382
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,720
whatever you want hi as to you doing

383
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:23,070
PC or laptop song it is possible the
high sticking to your program send to

384
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:23,660
loading

385
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,730
and capturing the TV screen shot the
sniping at them so I think

386
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:32,400
order of things are possible but all we
first need the

387
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,880
now process of shells from the TB
actually a dust

388
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,640
I'll I wanna say it there are three
general waste for that

389
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,540
one is a rewriting at the format but
this might be a very risky

390
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:49,670
because I was eating them it seem better
system economic 2tb a break

391
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:53,640
song you which means you have to send
the TB again today said a

392
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,380
I don't do that am the second one I'm
not sure about this you ship are

393
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:01,230
remoting some pass was a working name
but a system

394
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:05,440
um it's not working just to be as well
but

395
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,650
ardent right through the pick it off
because I

396
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,420
choose the the third way so some

397
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:17,500
as a it uses the legal system arm if
your father so share the library inside

398
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,810
Lycos up but so-far spot arm

399
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:24,040
have a a lot they are not in order to
buy to programs

400
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,600
Hall so so you know you she disliked

401
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,590
yellow remade ICM poll taken in a
scholar a more chill

402
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,830
on which hosts a system called RCS open
call

403
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:39,270
and checking if there are any erm and a
number

404
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:43,420
heart indicates to and Cohen also filed
rhetoric

405
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:47,150
are within that offer at ISO file
extension

406
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:50,330
in me is so EPA

407
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:54,310
are a few we put arm some fake eso files

408
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:57,840
on in of trickery which area a Polaris

409
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,940
Red Cross so we can now you can

410
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:04,400
wrong I'll call the on during don't
loading

411
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,630
sonya fun refocus on on

412
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:11,530
and review put some reverse engineering
sales site

413
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:14,560
an all yeah we got it

414
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,820
down this is from the the library

415
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,510
on the back door so every time when the
TV

416
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:24,610
arm put up are I gotta show from the TV

417
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:30,500
so but took

418
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,880
the problem is that there is some
protect some program by the vendor

419
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,640
cold to you p but I'll this that this is
not that we're almost Provost

420
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:46,430
our own I woulda guessed that you EP a
stanza for use a script evolved

421
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:49,940
a renter so on text some

422
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:54,290
is Cass ordered victorious all the files
inside

423
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:57,840
Kb and Texas pass the the fed into

424
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,950
signature or a song quickly

425
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:04,060
arm signed if it's not

426
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,590
on both of the vote them on on Thur

427
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:11,340
the program which means some or show the
library

428
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,940
is not signed by the the vendor it will
be at the lit

429
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,410
and deleted by the sprawling media
button

430
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:23,130
the problem is that as a UNEP house to
scan ordered victorious enough I'll

431
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:24,820
switch music text hi I'm

432
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:28,380
saw your your file will not be a
tentative immediately

433
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,560
you have time to do something people
rock

434
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:35,320
our people to free the to prevent us so

435
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,660
so the source I is a very simple

436
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,850
you just killed a the freemen to so

437
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:47,320
sorry about that they actually it is
sooo really

438
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:52,060
not a good idea because studied those in
actually the free event

439
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:55,710
stop fun on EQ some bad of months to the
TV

440
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,960
because he has a scandal Victoria so

441
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,380
all the time yeah okay

442
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:06,660
from I saw yeah I ask you to all that

443
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,120
100 France for a month are to me so
what's the

444
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:14,130
the worst case if the slots to pick up
past on

445
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:17,940
so long-standing finest of

446
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,330
and second the hijacking TV programs yes
so on

447
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:26,290
officename on them before almost all
peoples

448
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:33,180
no have chosen yeah yeah

449
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:37,660
as got this portal in the morning I want
I

450
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:41,220
want to try some for a sharp I incised

451
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:45,710

okay

454
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,260
okay almost ill eighty-five percent is a
really high

455
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:00,570
but I think the the the 15 percent
didn't exactly understand

456
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:05,340
what I'm going on in a smart TV I mean
points Marty B

I'm sewn yeah

461
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:26,280
on yeah people I I take about this sucks
all the loss program how to implement it

462
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:30,460
it but my help I or I want to mention
about them

463
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:36,560
stop between a smartphone so their loss
and a smart to resolve a loss

464
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:40,460
smartphone as as you know smartphone has
also Mike

465
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:44,680
and the camera inside but have you ever
tried to capturing

466
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,620
and the polls using the point some up on
the smartphone

467
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:52,280
its I did it how about it it didn't
really work

468
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,720
because so yeah I met this a simple

469
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,780
so this program in and I'm sure the
phone and

470
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:02,610
I went out with the with the phone and

471
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:06,780
after that I got two problems so from
the past the one is that

472
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:10,330
yeah so after having really many

473
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:14,450
polls song 21 are less so than one

474
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:17,930
1 percent on you can say they are just
OK

475
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:21,950
but most of the day I mean I'm Allbutt
99 percent Pieterse

476
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:25,490
I have really I use it is because almost
all the time

477
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:28,770
your smartphone usage in your pocket or
on the desk

478
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:32,330
song they don't watch you now usually

479
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:37,600
so and though the smartphone is moving
very quickly

480
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,730
so d'amato pictures are are really a pro
or

481
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:44,290
the second one so I'll it's a shame but

482
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:48,090
I tech false much Yahoo to my iPhone

483
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:51,120
are but I rushed that onto taking
pictures

484
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,420
takes a lot of power song after the
solace

485
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:59,110
Europol will be thought you up on
following the dying

486
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:03,220
because it takes so little power us to
take a course

487
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:07,230
well smarty be arm this on long-haul

488
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:11,030
hosts of the flock at the home

489
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:14,370
are sprawl smart to be ever know

490
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:18,190
yeah this so as a small TV I i mean or
the TB

491
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:22,420
is connected to power Paulus maybe I
think so

492

to set up of coking coal enough on Sun

534
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:08,950
and T to follow along as on

535
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:12,580
that actual cooking court

536
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:17,020
so if you put some cold like the same in

537
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,710
you know hooking call to tell his urine
I'll call for debugging

538
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:23,770

shown

539
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:28,440
sometimes very hard to a tryst style
course corning walkways Colt

540
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,010
I mean to fall just so we want to use
the debate all tore

541
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:36,570
to to know that breezy so as you see
that though

542
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:40,070
read we're talking day our registers and
pizza register

543
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:44,330
40 and augments registers research to
see the value

544
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:48,920
so um

545
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,570
yeah us yeah we

546
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:55,900

all we have to make some unscom order to

550
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:09,770
the shadow to missus but we needed to
have to do that because

551
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:13,730
a recruit you could the right down on
into a file

552
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:17,770
not just 10 but stand up for anyway

553
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:21,510
yet there are also a lot of mm:ss by
daughter developer

554
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:25,260
arm what force of course Rd some

555
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:29,870
for the are real resources on both
people missus are not

556
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:33,010
available for for the virus or

557
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:37,000
Barack if you take if you see the
coldest efficient a Colt

558
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,810
decide on that ought to look to global
available some

559
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:44,140
are tax it um because say that

560

I'm to people all dressed or table hi
all dressed

561
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,910
song if you're set on both to load a
call

562
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:55,350
variables to on like this I can walk on

563
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:58,990
you saw 000 what the other one is Sun

564
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:02,080
3203 Joel song

565
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,000
recruit I'll we can rest to %uh the
print up

566
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,930
process actually I'm as the spider is a
real issues

567
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:13,660
and so that to you can if your cam wants
to develop

568
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:17,630
SS just it's really helpful

569
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:21,200
yeah and can do that the

570
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,210
using the petrous call in Aus

571
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:30,710
and this is for Honda parked for the
making the tuba 24 hours

572
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:34,240
actually yep this is the live because I
don't want to be

573
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,360
at all I us yet so I don't have to
basically

574
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:42,880
yeah yeah some

575
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,010
hom on

576
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:49,430
how r we want to make the the syllabus
for when

577
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:52,550
the working 24 hours when even

578
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:55,880
though that you just saw pawn off the TV
and

579
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,870
so we have to find the sum trick for
that

580
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:04,230
part for the record I have to set this I
user-defined of all abilities and

581
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,220
exploiting

582
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,320
I'll before on the ball send

583
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,110
reverse engineering I recent I never on
all makeup

584
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:16,120
any solve a lost also a rootkit this is
a lot this is my first time

585
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,380
but I i have to do this because so the
vendors

586
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,470
are set to mess media the

587
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:27,800
that already passed them by the best my
bed also taken P just might be possible

588
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,800
but that's impossible when they were
just off the TV

589
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,100
so on that inspired to me on this why
yeah

590
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:37,170
I went to law to make it 2tb

591
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:42,210
24 hours working

592
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:46,230
because it you must be possible because
its own software

593
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:50,840
and/or are when you send on signals from
your remote controller

594
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:54,010
on it just of software so you can do
anything

595
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:57,020
whatever you want so on

596
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:00,040
I don't wanna show I don't want us to
your thong really

597
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,430
each long on the home on wall somebody
call so

598
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:07,000
because son's future issues so our
system

599
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,900
the to write down the process them so we
have to find

600
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:14,820
so far so instead I relate to other time
on our condo features

601
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:18,760
on when we send the signals onto the TV

602
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,810
by the remote controller saw

603
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:25,520
not there are a lot of also spun the
most Anita CCTV

604
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,350
a cologne Cologne power I'll the fall so
so that

605
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:34,140
are so when all user press the policy of
autumn

606
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:37,520
on our people yeah it also

607
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,090
of the screen all of assault of some
processes

608
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:45,090
on Oct not not the Connell and finery
it's just too

609
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:49,130
on but that's a shitty week will open up
our

610
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:54,790
on so extra time off so actually I'm

611
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:59,040
their song the Brule at eighty here

612
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,450
you are others say that because I put
some sticker inside

613
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:06,340

I got this constant disconnected from
the TV but it's okay because we have a

637
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,300
persistent

638

just thus just pour ce so yes

657
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:57,299

are to make it yeah we could have are we

658
00:42:57,299 --> 00:42:58,150
could use that

659

i Justi the come out you must try but
iraq today

660

button yet right to know what your
saliva false answers to use for their

661
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:12,299
yet there were about to I just say

662
00:43:12,299 --> 00:43:15,670
the first saw to implement the program

663
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:20,380
that for so long as some for hiii
provided by the vendor

664
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:23,869
belonging to a pic I so we could do you
speak with a maker

665
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:26,999
up taking now on the

666
00:43:26,999 --> 00:43:30,950
it s effort easily Picasa the vendor
actually pro

667
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:35,380
actually provides you that those AP I
saw you can you stay here

668
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:39,109
AP guys to make you very easily but we
were worried about

669
00:43:39,109 --> 00:43:42,589
um you careen all major program

670
00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:47,039
and reading data not on the a place by
the vendor

671
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:50,200
you might PA now working and

672
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:54,890
background our song there might be a
possibility that they're just so we'll

673
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:55,690
work on ice

674
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:59,450
our program so we we we went to the
second option

675
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:04,720
just around town on the spending the
holiday the comment camera app

676
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:09,940
works so so on

677
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:14,140
I take those

678
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:17,739
process some decide ready after me

679
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:22,460
but the first all pawn of I'll I mean it
first opens so kept

680
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:25,900
and send some comments

681
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:29,499
artists on the fight up offender I could
ice

682
00:44:29,499 --> 00:44:34,200
on camera stopped sec came streaming and
semi-custom sector

683
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:38,460
and so I'll pick on one up to what are
the comments

684
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:41,480
here for example on for examples

685
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:45,739
you see the sect aum sick am that
desperate

686
00:44:45,739 --> 00:44:48,849
sysprep be just display size comment and

687
00:44:48,849 --> 00:44:52,999
term thought the protocol is a recent
poll so on

688
00:44:52,999 --> 00:44:56,150
the first one the lesser Command and the
commander to

689
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:59,660
argument is I'm that's about a month the
very about a month

690
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:02,809
and so on some stupid bomb the

691

00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:14,900
and that directly a saber the

694
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:18,019
the picture into our file song can just
some

695
00:45:18,019 --> 00:45:22,099
get the file yeah

696
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:26,019
song not ours for the taking the video

00:45:26,019 --> 00:45:29,130
you can take pictures yeah

698
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:34,960
sewn for takes a video estate sales
slide to be different or

699
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,869
the take a course because some the ball
first time into

700
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:41,989
just remains on in the

701
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:45,130
capturing process kept taking picture it

702
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:49,319
a set list of argue with the following
24 images into

703
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:52,460
into a file but when new a veinte or
some

704
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:55,630
taking wheelbase you and never are

705
00:45:55,630 --> 00:46:00,049
write to the file yes on we have 20

706
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:03,450
we have to find a way to after the fall
for

707
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:07,230
on so that we can now write it into a
file

708
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:10,519
so as we did and I'm

709
00:46:10,519 --> 00:46:14,499
for the take a picture so that I stole
are we here

710
00:46:14,499 --> 00:46:17,829
again the head to the reverse
engineering are so on

711
00:46:17,829 --> 00:46:20,849
up to take off the cliff

712
00:46:20,849 --> 00:46:24,059
on %uh those folks also court

713
00:46:24,059 --> 00:46:27,690
yeah like this

714
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:31,430
and you see it up to folks us here

715
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:35,499
on to to the second Don

716
00:46:35,499 --> 00:46:39,079
camo I people for the rip the sea sounds
like a very

717
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:43,309
call false because or all week with its
just so full

718
00:46:43,309 --> 00:46:46,559
are a record as a setup for coal and

719
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:50,579
bomb on some a double for

720
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:55,920
into a file but I at sought to render
our stuff the phone some here

721
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,770
yes here I'll

722
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:05,970
we found on a better way so you when you
see at this on court

723
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:09,539
song yeah them

724
00:47:09,539 --> 00:47:14,190
yeah by the way you have we have to go
to colocation

725
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:17,460
because they precourt you can be a um at

726
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:20,720
location the cold of myself I'll

727
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,910
and just stomp stomp was the ball for
into the file I think it is just

728
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:29,270
this is for on some debugging stop but
no money

729
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:33,660
for the reason binary on the value all
this them

730
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:36,900
comparing um is some

731
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,329
so you normally go to the federal case
of

732
00:47:40,329 --> 00:47:44,839
which means so you have to from to run
time: that's my game

733
00:47:44,839 --> 00:47:48,339
are by this way you could've yucatán
for value

734
00:47:48,339 --> 00:47:54,410
Sun not too long though 0 so we can all
rest to go to a talk with location

735
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:58,349
so that the colder will be the opening
of I'll

736
00:47:58,349 --> 00:48:05,349
and saving to the fall for into the file
so now we have

737
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:09,880
we arm have a

738
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:13,349
of pedofile now it's a4 okay

739
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:17,619
yeah so this is so

740
00:48:17,619 --> 00:48:20,630
them a time yep

741
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:23,780
I've tested this a lot and

742
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:27,240
i'd never I I never got them all costs

744
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:35,900
by anyway I'll try yeah I still

745
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:39,430
