6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,070
topic of my talk is your IP addressing
attacks on android devices on at what I

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,699
want to show you today is

8
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:31,230
wats you I V dressing is in relation to
mow by base operating systems

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,870
this will be quite cool because I B and
you will see

10
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,309
and more or less 0 David of us assets
and I take a chance

11
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:43,690
to a tech all Android systems en vous
maybe for the next five years

12
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:48,230
so first I've won a few details about my
personal

13
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,770
which is may be interesting for you: I
am i working

14
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,920
if you host gratitude for IT security or

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,340
to sate and Roman if you left from that
some thought and socialize I met you

16
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,660
when you visit him both on

17
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,769
on and we my PhD vera and so on

18
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:06,440
what I'm doing fair and also doing my
research

19
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,689
is that I'm focusing on cross site
scripting attacks and countermeasures

20
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:14,400
as well as you I V dressing and your ID
dressing is

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,509
actually my passion advice I ever vote a
book about it in the last year

22
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:21,590
at the different a lot from my book
which is a quite nice

23
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,790
and to have this book is called click
taking on drive addressing

24
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,150
what a surprise so if you're able to
read something in German

25
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,380
yeah I can really recommend it to buy it
say

26
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,189
I'm also getting some %uh security
trainings and penetration tests

27
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:38,740
I he's young working for the go to a
post beef

28
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:43,500
and so um I also gave some talks in the
pasta conference like who had to since

29
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,140
we won for Microsoft in Redmond

30
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:49,149
a blackhead tremon overstating Munich I
and so on

31
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:53,659
and you can also find me on twitter so

32
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:57,939
before I will show you be table of
contents I want to

33
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:02,369
I yeah actually one notes light

34
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,770
on the thing is that I've read a paper
for the black hat a.m.

35
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:10,910
I would I be conference in December of
last year and this paper

36
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,450
includes let me say ninety percent of
for research

37
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,270
we ever present today iight seven pages
long and it's free

38
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,350
to download so if you're interested in
it here is the link

39
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:25,540
I Veeco offer issue of think this is my
professor

40
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,110
from of art show up as a cadet at
security

41
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:33,680
and so on yet this should be set

42
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,610
okay business hold a table of contents
looks like I we will begin

43
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:42,180
with a typical structure out first of
all an introduction of the vet I will

44
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,820
show you some related work

45
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:48,760
so what they did for security guys in
the past then we will see on how we can

46
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,240
play with existing you I dressing
attacks

47
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,640
are two android devices or other mobile
devices

48
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,330
I after that I will introduce a

49
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,600
more or less new brawls all this attack
which

50
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,260
I is the zero-day if one can't be said
they were they to it

51
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,310
we'll see arm van some mitigation
techniques

52
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,650
so how can I prevent the user against an
attack on a best effort basis them

53
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,150
against

54
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,620
I'm being an attack on a mobile bay
system which

55
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,850
includes on the usage of browser Slyke
Internet Explorer Firefox

56
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,910
and how can i won on

57
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,030
yeah create mitigation on techniques

58
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,180
again so I knew but also less the tech

59
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,300
that's not what this was a conclusion of
an all-black way I will show you

60
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:41,760
how are my research all research can
affect your future or past

61
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,240
already affected the future so

62
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,440
the introduction part and this is by way
of a typical structure of a paper so

63
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,380
Aug we will see domestic this displayed
here

64
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:58,410
be related work for importing your balls
are less which is sometimes confusing

65
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,000
but it's

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,250
are related to a paper and that makes
much sense okay

67
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,550
so you I we dressing as for civil no
problem since 2002

68
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:12,600
white Jesse watermen percent and 2002
into the muzzle a bug tracker

69
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,079
but it is possible to motif RV Adobe
Flash Player

70
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,109
and this leads to be behavior vets arm

71
00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:24,400
an attacker was able to control the
microphone on the webcam

72
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,660
of a victim you know with alt any notice

73
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:34,660
office picked up and today I'm cloth

74
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,600
yet Jesse a broken time with them so
about take a while

75
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,390
well guys it is possible to make
elements like iframes transference

76
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,810
and the case that we have DG m isn't in
an iframe

77
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:51,660
we can arm disable the white background

78
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,400
include was I from into a web page which
has for example the Great Neck Road

79
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,310
so we have even or with a knife from of
them is not calm

80
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,540
and saw amazon has a great back for an
hour because the white background as

81
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,310
trance but in this case and the victim
could think okay I'm on Amazon

82
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,920
bites you she's actually on even a dork
okay

83
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,940
say this program is overlook from V
moves into on

84
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,280
bike trek a team it up was a less
security to you MV service let

85
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,310
20 a problem but I despite before wifi
Adobe Flash Player

86
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,890
vistes a problem is called to check in
was followed up by

87
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:30,110
Roberts hands and Jeremiah Grossman 2008

88
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,490
so click checking is

89
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:38,570
today apart of the huge the tech said
aunt

90
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:42,840
this said is called you I V dressing so
user interface

91
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,540
redressing and say I'm user interface

92
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,770
redressing includes click Tech Inc or

93
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,820
you click checking attack from 2000 8
inside the click checking said which is

94
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,200
confusing because

95
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,820
I'm be click taking attack from 2008 is
is today called classic licked

96
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,990
okay so we have you are addressing click
checking and if you take from 2008

97
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,740
classically check taking inside the
click taking

98
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,330
a subset but this would be clearer in a
few slight later

99
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,950
so what one can save from

100
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:17,340
viz attacks since 2008 is

101
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,090
vet all of these attacks need a better
also to be executed

102
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:28,090
okay so we need Firefox Opera Chrome
Internet Explorer and so on

103
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,139
and what we want to show today is

104
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:36,350
can you I'm addressing a text deported
to nearby base system

105
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,410
like Android why Android

106
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:43,900
by the way well I am focusing

107
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,230
or private your train can I am focusing
on

108
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,580
Android Picasa for market share
situation

109
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,310
well can see it here quite nice and the
fourth quarter of 2010

110
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:59,340
the market share situation are well as
not so good for Android

111
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,480
because it was new and symbiont from
Nokia

112
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,480
was more or less a on they are on

113
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,870
yeah I V number run phone phone been
microchipped

114
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:13,540
ants vis totally changed in the fourth
quarter of 2011 especially

115
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:17,540
and the fourth quarter of 2012 here we
can see vets

116
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,930
arm and what has a market share of over
fifty percent

117
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:25,520
and as it is written fair and November
2003 if Android has a market share

118
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,000
of seventy 2.4 percent

119
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,070
and just for the a per-user society I'm

120
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:36,290
I O S has only a market share of 14 but
my process and in

121
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,580
November 2012 bitch is increased

122
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,990
so much sale

123
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,919
okay we are focusing on Android because
of a market share situation

124
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:51,900
and on which version should we
especially focus now

125
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,600
and we focus of course

126
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,790
at on this version so weaver's into that
field free to work with two

127
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:03,660
2.3 dots have I'm visitors

128
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:08,320
yeah at a.m. statistic from February
2012 was

129
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,590
is today more or less the same so a
muscle for people are using

130
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:18,480
ever since are 2.1 to 2.3 dark 7

131
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,940
so just to say if this is the new
president what photos 0

132
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,250
for more you more or less aunt the

133
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,740
version which we are focusing on and
write to the Free that free

134
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,459
and just to say it or is your day at the
end works on both

135
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:36,519
firms so from Android 2.2+ up to free
dots

136
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:43,519
one to Android 4.0 0 end up of

137
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:47,450
up just one sentenced to its low Petrus

138
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,790
I'm as we can see we have a typical
structure here

139
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:55,020
we have on the top of a notification bar
refer on

140
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,220
feed aid overclock we have from

141
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,330
the Google search power no to look up to
you works

142
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:05,410
we have I comes like it is in this case

143
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,730
kgs know I can but this could be also
bear and

144
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,930
we have here are some I can threaten
applications

145
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,750
like a phone call application the
contact a tour for menu

146
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,190
Susi are more or less the same and of
course

147
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:22,300
WiFi or some bull the browser so

148
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,339
weekend if we control on

149
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:30,020
v home screen open other applications
directly

150
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:36,060
just mention this and

151
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,690
a set but we are focusing on Android but
so

152
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,690
on which questions

153
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,190
our focusing on well the first of

154
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:49,660
we are focusing on the texan
countermeasures for death of baseball's

155
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,110
available for Android too so said at the
beginning and

156
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:56,900
we are focusing on attempt taking attack
which is a part of

157
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,170
click checking which does not need a
better

158
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,480
let balls that would be executed so it
will not

159
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,390
use a paper also it will use an
application from the Android Market

160
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:11,290
or of a Google Play It is at this a call
now

161
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:15,630
okay related work so

162
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:19,220
what did the security guys a

163
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,790
in the past first of all he does the
base to every dressing techniques of the

164
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,080
very few brawl the less you I redressing
techniques

165
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,310
well the desktop based

166
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,180
as a set we have few I'm addressing us
as head of attacks and

167
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,250
visits head of up a text includes sup
sets like click taking

168
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,570
and we have other attacks like stroke
checking reckoned reparations content

169
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,890
extractions even recycling and SPG
mosques

170
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,480
well I would hope so some demos and up
free minutes

171
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,580
so but just that to say but these
attacks

172
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:55,680
exist here I and

173
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,190
when he's so into the class I'm tessick
while click taking subset

174
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:03,680
we have things like classically checking
as a stand-alone attacked we have like

175
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,180
checking this is an attack which is bomb

176
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,600
attacking Facebook's like button or
Facebook we have messed up click

177
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,399
checking

178
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,240
and double-click taking academical
attacks we have cookie checking and

179
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,290
hijackings

180
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,870
even taking class taking crews are
taking test now being communications

181
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,480
with sea surf cassette scripting and CSS

182
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,570
so you will think what her pappas

183
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:29,490
up what's going on CS CS as a sexually
cascading style sheets

184
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:34,240
this can't be right and so the fingers
CS can also be used

185
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,610
arm ass an attack

186
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:42,110
language on like JavaScript which is
confusing but I you can look it up

187
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:46,110
arm in the paper which is called on
script was a text

188
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:49,220
attacks stealing the pie without
touching beso yeah

189
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,360
it's %uh free to download CSS really
interesting

190
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,680
so OK um

191
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,230
maybe one explanation of classically
checking soviet

192
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:03,930
Adobe Flash Player a tech on being built
com

193
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:07,279
and after that the temples so what we
want to

194
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,910
doing this but we want to carry all to
the classically checking attack now

195
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:15,029
as you can see I love a big not come web
page

196
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:19,830
and I'm walkin a small purse you can see
it at the bottom here

197
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:23,610
at the atop your so can't connect to my
score the year

198
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:27,200
perfect and what we want to attack this
be signed all slick

199
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,430
so we won for the victim will visit our
page 700 pages for example even a dork

200
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:36,140
and by visiting this page and clicking
on an element the victim should be

201
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:40,060
clicking on the lookout so what we need
is

202
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:46,140
all value it session with pink dot com
of a victim

203
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:50,279
so be targets I know it's

204
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:53,600
to use our tech we need

205
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,290
a little bit social engineering and this
case we have a headline hear a funny

206
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,209
pictures to Smiley's

207
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:03,260
and a button and vis I

208
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,540
should be used to cally let the victim
click

209
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:11,490
on this but your so most of the people
will say okay it when I click on click

210
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,010
me

211
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:15,600
I will see some funny pictures arm

212
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,040
like comics and so on about this will
not be the case

213
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,370
victim were actually taken sign out here
kept

214
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,510
good so we have all social engineering
page

215
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:31,830
once again the headline to smile is on
the bottom and all I a friend

216
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:35,110
and I from a small as a small window
which can go to website

217
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:39,500
and this frame or window

218
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,830
arm can lauck being both scorn

219
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:46,580
and as you can see when we lower being
not come here

220
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,769
be also lower being been dot com

221
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:52,910
on in a session with victim with a
victim so

222
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:56,180
the victim is locked in and so being
both come here as you can see it on

223
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,430
Marcus and signed out

224
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:04,459
what we need now is a little bit of CS
escort

225
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:08,810
CS couple also asked who month for
iframe

226
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,890
to the top left of a web page so that

227
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:15,630
v sign all clink over lace the arm

228
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:19,820
click the button your and we also need a
little bit of transparency

229
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:23,529
as we can see it on the left picture
because of its hot transfer and fair

230
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,970
full transfer right on the right

231
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,019
case okay on a sentence here

232
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:31,279
little bit clearer visits the source
code of the attack

233
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,740
nothing more we have all of x1 tech

234
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,940
or elements your were funny pictures

235
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,990
well van v smile iz your

236
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:45,500
click me as a bottom and no I from
elements

237
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,399
and the magic behind thick checking is
arm

238
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:54,560
this year's escort there's some
properties like position here

239
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,339
that index to overweight the click the
button

240
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:01,700
opacity & photo of opacities equal to 0

241
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,880
which on gives auspey transparency in
this case

242
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,899
so petty 00 means for transferring to
says

243
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:12,019
transparency 0 to 5 means of
transparency

244
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:15,800
and to have been we say please move the
element to the top

245
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,480
left

246
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,510
ants you say I am get from

247
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:30,350
sure it's 1/2 attributes like width and
height

248
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,660
so that we can get this

249
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,420
sites your yep

250
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:42,760
bets or so we have an iframe much growth
thing not comin over they saw a button

251
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,790
nothing more and after click on click me
who actually click

252
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:52,220
or by clicking on taking will actually
taken sign out

253
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,890
and the best thing as a victim will see
it so this is the attack

254
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:59,810
from 2008

255
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:03,540
now to brawls less you I be pressing
attacks

256
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:08,279
the first question is here is a possible
to perform balls I like you I be

257
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:10,310
dressing attacks on mobile devices

258
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,940
which already exist and to

259
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,190
get some produce about it aren't we

260
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:20,670
meet some knowledge about the existing
attacks of course and this is

261
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:24,839
the demo time of

262
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:28,860
sofa sofa the crews are taking a text to
give you a small impressionable fifties

263
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,000
yes the tech

264
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,100
in South the click clique checking
subset so

265
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,480
we have for links here

266
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,160
business visa things were for 8 Ref
ailments

267
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,430
a a 8x enter a trip attributes are
nothing special

268
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:47,430
when I click on to have a a pure window
with two

269
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,790
when I click on mono but we have if your
window with one and so on

270
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,220
sale i click onto

271
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,370
aunt here click actually click on one

272
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:01,110
so what happens here i click on one

273
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:04,539
and nothing happens a click on for

274
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:08,319
act actually take on Fri for stretch

275
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,689
the magic behind classic I'm cause a
checking your

276
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:15,289
yes you can see it

277
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:18,869
that View Mall skirt is this actually an
image

278
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:22,179
in here is the back row into law

279
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:26,609
malls Carozza displayed in ret before it
was displayed and transparent or

280
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:31,759
it was transferred in this case so we
can sit here once again if we click onto

281
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:35,830
the top left office images on one so I
click on run

282
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:39,139
have suan once again your for

283
00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:42,759
click on three and when I click on one

284
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:47,190
nothing happens because there is no link
to click on

285
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:50,289
okay so this is the easiest the tech

286
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:53,929
we can also do some click taking stuff
on

287
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:59,019
def elements

288
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:03,419
and I hope floats

289
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:07,129
mmm on no it does not

290
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:10,609
okay a global

291
00:18:10,609 --> 00:18:13,929
what kinda sure you van

292
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:18,350
company extract from

293
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:21,820
yep this is also take taking the suspect
and Rock Creek trekking

294
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:25,649
what I do them here is but I am want to
draw lot

295
00:18:25,649 --> 00:18:29,220
I'll select the tax and drop it into the
text use your

296
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,129
so I will select this textile

297
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:36,409
click on it and drop it into those text
field

298
00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:40,539
so V question as possible what will I
drop into this text here

299
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:43,999
actually dropped me but as you can see
if your

300
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:47,639
sis I'm dropping malicious code

301
00:18:47,639 --> 00:18:52,119
how can I do this well first of all

302
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:56,210
I can't drop a text which I

303
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:00,799
actually have not selected this is due
to reason that we are

304
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,289
using html5 attributes your

305
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:12,289
should okay to you with the source
courts

306
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:16,639
yes a tribute drag boat we set it to
true

307
00:19:16,639 --> 00:19:19,679
then we have an event tomorrow on break
start

308
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,190
we said remind me tired and then we say
please drop malicious cult

309
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,509
yep so I'm using issue 05 here

310
00:19:27,509 --> 00:19:31,039
to drop something into the text fields
which

311
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:36,190
I am not really want to drop us a victim

312
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:41,149
and the other thing is that I can move

313
00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:44,820
values like a text from another website

314
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,379
into another website because this one
here this

315
00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:51,499
a border is actually a iframe

316
00:19:51,499 --> 00:19:54,519
can show it here so this is an iframe

317
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:58,700
which can be flexible form I even at
work so we are on

318
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:04,249
and was no torque are all I can include
an iframe with even want or can we are

319
00:20:04,249 --> 00:20:05,690
able to

320
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:09,629
drag-and-drop text from members into
evil at work which is quite also because

321
00:20:09,629 --> 00:20:10,850
on

322
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:14,009
because of its him a return policy and
summer but Paul service should not

323
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:17,269
work but is a this you the case

324
00:20:17,269 --> 00:20:20,450
and Firefox and have a process your

325
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:25,830
when we are using different windowless
or iframes in this case

326
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:30,879
so weekend click on elements

327
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:34,669
here Atlantic checking and we actually
taken another element

328
00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:40,350
and say I we can change behavior of for
example reckoned operations

329
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:44,539
or videos here

330
00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:48,139
so once again to all a question

331
00:20:48,139 --> 00:20:52,129
as a possible to perform this kind of
attacks

332
00:20:52,129 --> 00:20:56,239
I on and mobile operating system

333
00:20:56,239 --> 00:20:59,700
without using event broza

334
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,289
and the first idea what's your from
David Richardson in 2010

335
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:09,249
on to be analyzed Android and what he's
head over at walls

336
00:21:09,249 --> 00:21:13,090
but an application is to lol to
programmatically

337
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:17,169
open a dialogue to interact with it so
this means that

338
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:21,559
we yes a developer can developed for
example a computer game

339
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:25,190
and this computer game is able to open
an application like the phone call

340
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,409
application

341
00:21:26,409 --> 00:21:30,759
you know but what we are not able to do
so. developer is

342
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:34,109
fat we cannot say please call this
number here

343
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:38,409
Nokia can just hop on the focal
application with a predefined number

344
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:42,759
nothing more so we need for final touch
keys to of a victim

345
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:47,369
for this phone call or Egbe can open a
bet balls with your

346
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:50,989
I'll which I opens the way our

347
00:21:50,989 --> 00:21:54,129
but we cannot navigate with a bit before
so they're pros at your

348
00:21:54,129 --> 00:21:57,940
a ser mama application with no rights
this is important to say

349
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,580
if no rights yep

350
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:05,759
so once again and applications that alt
to programmatically open a dialogue but

351
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:06,840
not in fact of its

352
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,019
this is very important for tech

353
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:13,619
so the next idealists based on

354
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:17,789
this message that one can use a toast
few

355
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:21,899
what is the toasts you a toast fewer is

356
00:22:21,899 --> 00:22:26,580
more or less notification message and
was notification message can say

357
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,820
hey you have change for volume of your
device

358
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:34,590
so you can make it louder or to a bit
more silent

359
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:38,419
and to in this case I A on use my

360
00:22:38,419 --> 00:22:42,330
mobile device ought to make it a little
bit louder and the specialists

361
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:45,359
message appears and the important thing
is

362
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:48,539
but i cant type or on of touch on

363
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:53,840
this message and after touching on this
message when i touch it

364
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,059
your I will actually touch the

365
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:00,749
Google search bar so its let's

366
00:23:00,749 --> 00:23:04,200
touch gestures under my application on
them a notification

367
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,309
you know its smallest totally
transparent

368
00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:10,889
am so

369
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:14,749
the next idea where s

370
00:23:14,749 --> 00:23:18,429
I'll fun from Jack a man you know I home
hoping that I am

371
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:21,789
I'm spelling it right here I is

372
00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:25,429
that you can scale such notification
messages

373
00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:28,690
and skating V's up this method

374
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:32,450
in this case on can be

375
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:36,249
escape can be used to make it full
screen so

376
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:40,269
we have this small one here make it full
screen

377
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:43,869
and bus we are able to

378
00:23:43,869 --> 00:23:46,929
you have a notification which

379
00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:53,929
over lace the home screen you know

380
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:57,009
so the crucial point here is that

381
00:23:57,009 --> 00:24:00,299
and I said this once again here a touch
keys to your

382
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:03,679
on South such a message on notification
would be passed through

383
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,720
to the underlying application so I can
touch on

384
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,739
notification I'll I was actually touch
on the home screen here

385
00:24:11,739 --> 00:24:15,299
so what we as an attacker can do now is

386
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:18,309
but we can design notification message

387
00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:21,679
which looks like an application like
this one here

388
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,149
this can be for example screenshot and
what we a

389
00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:28,309
victim would do is to click

390
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:32,460
or touch on goal but we are actually
touch another application

391
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,799
with the same bottom which is for
example yes

392
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:40,570
yeah and business reapplication if this
is the notification this is not an

393
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,019
application in this case

394
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:47,830
you know

395
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:52,009
so this to be related work part

396
00:24:52,009 --> 00:24:56,679
so we so I bet so we have

397
00:24:56,679 --> 00:24:59,820
you I'd be dressing attacks and we also

398
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:04,249
solve it if there are you I'm addressing
attacks

399
00:25:04,249 --> 00:25:07,609
possible on Android device

400
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:12,039
so not no to porting you I be dressing
to Android device to be more

401
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:17,710
with a gun more into detail well

402
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:20,849
classically checking is the key word
here

403
00:25:20,849 --> 00:25:24,220
on or double-click checking

404
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,509
but can say that most of it clicked
checking your texts are working on

405
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:28,669
Android

406
00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:34,379
because all when nearly all balls are
available on the Android like

407
00:25:34,379 --> 00:25:38,599
Internet Explorer Chrome we have okay so
far is not the case but so far yes the

408
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:38,909
same

409
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:42,179
engine escrow we have hope for now

410
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:45,950
but we don't have his Internet Explorer
and this is the case

411
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:51,379
why some attacks like hi I was like a on

412
00:25:51,379 --> 00:25:54,269
cookie taking I'm not working because
quickly checking is only at Tech which

413
00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:55,859
is based on Internet Explorer

414
00:25:55,859 --> 00:26:02,859
but most of us a text can be carried out
due to the available brawls ever since

415
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:07,129
so we have more or less the same issues

416
00:26:07,129 --> 00:26:11,590
what weekend also carry out his for
example crews are checking

417
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:15,609
why because me do not have crews were

418
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:22,609
on more wet device now

419
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:27,759
so now to movie new bras less the text
part

420
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:31,789
so what I told you what's that

421
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:35,940
on Jack was able to create a lot

422
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:39,200
notification which was displayed over
the

423
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,669
whole screen if yeah aunt

424
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:46,429
this is what I didn't say on

425
00:26:46,429 --> 00:26:50,200
he was able to show it for a longer time
because notification is only displayed

426
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,349
for

427
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:54,769
most of the cases for eight seconds are
true and if I'll

428
00:26:54,769 --> 00:26:59,889
to free seconds and what she was able to
do is too short for a long long time

429
00:26:59,889 --> 00:27:03,419
like for example 60 seconds or two
minutes

430
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:06,419
scare so

431
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:09,789
its more or less bet on the case because

432
00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:12,509
he was able to what it creates a
notification which overlays an

433
00:27:12,509 --> 00:27:13,479
application

434
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:17,340
and which looks like a normal
application skates yeah

435
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:21,019
bout the scope of Jack and business what
we did

436
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:25,090
I'll was too focused on for example
phone Colts

437
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:29,019
or too focused on the home screen itself

438
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:32,499
or on some applications on the home
screen when we find out

439
00:27:32,499 --> 00:27:36,359
is that v scope of this attack is

440
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:39,710
are a little bit wider because

441
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:45,090
we can many people hp.com take dater we
can use a bit but also to navigate to a

442
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:45,749
website

443
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:49,099
which we estimate it could be fine we

444
00:27:49,099 --> 00:27:52,809
can't lock touch his trust in the system
so wherever you touch

445
00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:56,919
on a display we can look this without
having any privileges for this this is

446
00:27:56,919 --> 00:27:58,299
really important to say

447
00:27:58,299 --> 00:28:03,309
weekend use you can a use that phone
call application through

448
00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:08,190
I do predefined flame Colts and this was
also possible in the posse couldn't stay

449
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:08,629
up

450
00:28:08,629 --> 00:28:11,869
applications in the background with the
help of E

451
00:28:11,869 --> 00:28:15,009
and what Mark Richt yeah

452
00:28:15,009 --> 00:28:18,460
so

453
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,710
I would show you but will be a demo in
two minutes on

454
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:24,749
all of these attacks are using the same
technique once again first of all there

455
00:28:24,749 --> 00:28:25,440
is a visible

456
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,119
attacker its application form of a
notification before grown so we are

457
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:32,450
going to it the Android Market Google
Play

458
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,039
and downloading a computer game for
example this computer game has no right

459
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:38,489
so what this computer game cannot to a
phone call

460
00:28:38,489 --> 00:28:42,299
it cannot fight SMS it cannot get access
to to conduct a thorough

461
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:45,469
but this is possible with our tech yeah

462
00:28:45,469 --> 00:28:50,599
and so on that this is possible because
there is an application for Beck Road

463
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:52,450
like a phone call a pic action

464
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:58,690
so at a CVS in a demo

465
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:03,519
gets so we have v Android on and the
later here

466
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:09,219
which is a little bit slower which also
slow shows that it is 3am a late or

467
00:29:09,219 --> 00:29:13,469
and we are using diverse in their 20 21
here

468
00:29:13,469 --> 00:29:17,940
but this works on all android versions
just to say to

469
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:24,529
so it's booting

470
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:30,580
you know

471
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:33,250
out here it s so we have

472
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:37,830
our home screen here a useful ok

473
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:41,049
when I look at and we have our

474
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:44,510
application which can be downloaded from
the Android Market and once again it has

475
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,289
no rights

476
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:51,000
as a so we can do actually nothing but
what we can do can you step taking your

477
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,630
so we introduce a tech thats

478
00:29:54,630 --> 00:30:00,130
where do vis attack with the dialer or
if a punk replication so

479
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:04,990
we have a notification in this case and
we as the victim think okay

480
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:10,590
arm I will take on go for it because
special a present

481
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:14,100
and look at the top left there PS a
phone call I can

482
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,830
yes and once again this application is
no rights to do a phone call

483
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:21,419
and what number are we calling here

484
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:25,580
we are calling for a number on 57 run
free Fri Sep I'm

485
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:30,390
so and now all

486
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:34,909
the attack River transplant back right
not with a white background

487
00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:40,000
so we have a transparent background here
we can see but very is

488
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,070
the focal application of a predefined
number and all what we need

489
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:47,440
is touch keys to your on

490
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,640
the phone call i cum which is under go
for it

491
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,240
that's all yeah so we can open
applications

492
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,549
behind other applications and this
application form us as an attacker

493
00:30:58,549 --> 00:31:02,140
just artist just a modification nothing
more

494
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:05,190
now on the certification looks like and
normal application

495
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:12,190
I'm

496
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:18,630
so just once again clicking here

497
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:21,890
on business but here's the phone call
its

498
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:26,570
czar

499
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:29,630
so this is

500
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:35,350
basically be a tech for fame

501
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:39,450
is and this is also something which one
should think about

502
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:42,850
um that there is a limited number

503
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,980
of operations all which one can do

504
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:50,570
because alright what we do here is to
call an application of

505
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:54,830
action underscore and then name and this
name can beat

506
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,560
for example phone pool may open the
phone call application

507
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,620
but there is a limit to number I puffing
15 applications

508
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,120
which are and that's what I lost to

509
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,860
another loss to control be more a whole
mobile device

510
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:14,030
you know it just the Los Undertaker to
control the focal application

511
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:17,430
or a fee contact later or director also

512
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:20,830
yep but not the whole device as a set

513
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:25,110
this solution for this s

514
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:29,570
an attacker is thats one can dynamically
exits the home screen

515
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:33,380
your so be do not need

516
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:37,700
application for background we can use
the home screen to navigate to the menu

517
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,310
bar

518
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:41,940
we can say go to Settings change your
password

519
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:45,010
or change setting off a mobile device
and so on

520
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:48,490
but what we need here I may have an
one-touch

521
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:52,620
Easter yes so we need a few of them and
this is a little bit

522
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,870
complicated and in rely for text

523
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:59,510
but this is also possible we can also
but at the home screen

524
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:04,900
so we saw some attacks and we saw some
mitigation techniques

525
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:09,750
now to movie mitigation or come to
measures

526
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:13,710
first of all browser-based to

527
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:17,190
hold the structure of a paper and fan
Tom

528
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:20,860
r1 um countermeasure against have
checking

529
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:25,870
so the attacker for focal application
browser-based you I'm addressing

530
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:29,000
ok so what can we do to

531
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,760
prevents a victim against being attacked

532
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,860
under event broza so against being

533
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:40,230
attacked by for example classically
checking as we thought were feeding not

534
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,000
calm attack

535
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,730
well first of all we can use frame
Buster s famed author's

536
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:47,770
is a piece of JavaScript called which

537
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:51,920
arm control its if a website is loaded
in the frame

538
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,950
so let us arm

539
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:58,390
name an example we are even or

540
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:02,090
and we have paper a dork which we want
to frame so

541
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:05,910
want to load inside an iframe and paper
or

542
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:11,360
of Hess such afsane bassir here which
could be the case in the past

543
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,010
who knows and what people did worse

544
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:18,240
or maybe that's wats

545
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,919
I am that they checked who is the top
location

546
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:25,090
not equal to the location which means is

547
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:28,820
papal loaded in a frame is Papalote an
a-frame

548
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:31,950
which is I am NOT

549
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:36,570
from paper or or which is um

550
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:40,750
for example even a dork as it is in the
case of the attack

551
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:44,720
so if it is loaded in the frame and not
from paper orc

552
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,830
van it comes to top location is equal to
a safe location

553
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:51,960
which means for fame movie buffs that
server

554
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,610
v URL of or but also to help for change

555
00:34:55,610 --> 00:35:00,150
from even a dork to paper orc because we
want to write a paper or

556
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:05,080
yeah so that's or this kind of Fame
busting attack

557
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:09,690
can be attacked by busting fame busting
techniques

558
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:13,820
arm these techniques are using for
example if cross-site scripting fit over

559
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,220
Internet Explorer of

560
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:20,280
or V chrome a cross-site scripting
filter which is your ex as audit of

561
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,690
you know that different techniques to

562
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:27,020
yeah stop the execution

563
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:31,080
but this kind of a text and fuss I have
this attack is not

564
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,680
real with this come to measure is not
really attack resistant

565
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,540
and baseless I

566
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,750
your more or less vera is developed an
offer

567
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:45,790
frame boss the with a little bit sees
escort and this is the most resistant

568
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:46,330
one

569
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:49,690
which I want to show you and which I can
really recommend

570
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:55,800
the finger is sped up arm victim

571
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,690
or offer and normal user arm

572
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:03,100
who is loading let me say papal once
again

573
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:06,259
arm on

574
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:09,380
at which is loading be the paper web
page

575
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:12,610
all will not see the whole body because
officers escort

576
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:15,940
so we have your CSS only say

577
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:21,600
the body I should have feces as property
display with a value known

578
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,830
so it should be a invisible

579
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:28,760
parity force and then we have a
JavaScript code to your roof of a

580
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,470
mustard

581
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:32,620
but the fame buster is a little bit
different because

582
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:37,380
it checks if the self location is equal
to the top location so

583
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:41,250
is paperwork all work all on

584
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:45,290
just train by papal both all-acc or
isn't there a frame

585
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:48,550
and if this is the case so if everything
is okay

586
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:52,390
van we say I documents

587
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:55,820
that's good element by i dnt
clickjacking which is your

588
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:59,430
yeah and then we have a reference there

589
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:02,450
and say had no remove child and cyclic
too XO

590
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:07,850
be removed for this plane known value
here

591
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:11,650
if we are on that an attack then we have

592
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:15,180
of famous eso top location the secret is
safe location

593
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:18,880
as it is displayed see you yeah

594
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,600
so the crucial thing you're the
important thing here is

595
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,410
if re are under attack there are two
options

596
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:31,830
the first option this a frame will be
both which is really really good

597
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:35,160
but if JavaScript code is disabled so if

598
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,080
week do not we have a chance to execute
this because of a

599
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:42,710
busting fame busting attack

600
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:45,720
we as a victim will not see the whole
body and what we cannot do

601
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:50,660
use the web page you know and survey for
an attack is not possible anymore

602
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:54,390
so this is a quite nice tech

603
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:58,150
Arora farrakhan to measure so okay
another

604
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:02,140
countermeasure is an HTTP header bitches
X Frame options

605
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:05,240
XM pop trance it is alleged if you have
to develop them

606
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,810
Microsoft in 2008 ants

607
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:12,050
it can have one of these a free

608
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:15,150
values to for assisting niven same
origin and then

609
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:18,960
lol from origin up deny means that nor

610
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,820
web page is loath to frame me so

611
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,910
if we at Amazon and we have extend
options deny

612
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:29,210
van a M is not all cannot frame

613
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:33,060
a.m. isn't now and also even a dork
cannot frame

614
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,600
Amazon cop if we say some original

615
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:41,140
then M is no cortisol all to frame
members in the torque but even a dork

616
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:45,410
isn't a lot to frame him as a now and
away from original

617
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:48,920
arm can be use to defiant have veinlets

618
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,420
you were lol on Bell

619
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:56,330
origin is and then we can say are for
example

620
00:38:56,330 --> 00:39:00,500
group of calm should be at all to fame
grew the

621
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:05,190
so been have the so work if Google yes
this head or so

622
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:08,520
XM options double point lol from

623
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,930
on educated PE google.com no

624
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:16,230
if you're a goody

625
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:19,650
the pointless here vet this header
smallest new

626
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:25,200
because it was founded in 2008 and saw
be confused here it is

627
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,580
just supported I in Firefox free

628
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:31,820
thought seven at that 6.9 and the BAF

629
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:35,550
of Route 10 to 500 of and I hear a
tandem of

630
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:40,390
so I know many many users who are using
idea six and i seven so

631
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:46,330
our visitors no yeah good countermeasure
prevent

632
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:49,730
another countermeasures to convince
security policy of you knows what you

633
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:52,190
gonna security policy this

634
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:55,750
no one really I okay

635
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:59,010
from okay so the content security policy

636
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:03,390
is also an HTTP header weird sharm

637
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:08,090
can be ya treetop and the w3c

638
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:12,110
dropped and so on taken a security
policy

639
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:15,330
arm defiance

640
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:21,410
if a web page arm can low three sources
from another web page so we can say

641
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:24,740
arm I'ma sleep

642
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:28,390
and I music on a security policy and I
say

643
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:33,170
fed already Flickr Israel alt as to
include

644
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:37,380
images on my website and only Emma's
nelson also include him in just a moment

645
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,160
site

646
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,460
and not Ateco subtle you know

647
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:44,820
so I can t find the resources your
however

648
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:48,110
by with a sole-source can come from but
to

649
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:52,720
CSP's to an all-time a new one I love
you all want one West

650
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,440
ahead to aims to first aim was to
prevent a victim against cross-site

651
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,650
scripting attacks

652
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:02,940
and v however a Morse to prevent the
victim against you I dressing attacks

653
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:06,970
and to have this change because this was
too complex

654
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:10,480
Twitter implemented its if you use a
girl

655
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,290
but the from was wasn't so use for

656
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:17,620
and as a side very very complex bus to
develop the new

657
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:22,010
CSP the famous fat you can see each year

658
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:26,040
I v CSP isn't well supporter

659
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,230
in the calendar ProSource on mobile
devices

660
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:34,140
it is supported on Chrome a.m. nearly
100 percent

661
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:38,370
and thats nearly full support its in
Firefox

662
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:41,540
but just a new version on the desktop
yup

663
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:45,450
what we can say on mobile devices is
they just the old CSP

664
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:50,450
and this is the CSP which is defined in
the w3c dropped anymore

665
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:55,080
this supported by Firefox for thought is
able to free and about

666
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,190
yeah and can you see if SP isn't

667
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:01,570
are supported by any Bros

668
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:05,520
but it will be hopefully XO options as
support at

669
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:10,970
any broza just to say it up

670
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:14,670
when we I zooming into

671
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:18,060
the content security policy then we have
to waste to

672
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:22,100
define it and the first way is I have to
use

673
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:25,650
the X minus content security policy
CSP's doesn't every

674
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:29,380
abbreviation here I to use it

675
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:33,160
and as you can see it's you have a top
100 falls in the pages of a world full

676
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,450
extent of calm which is a statistic

677
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:38,860
are web page I am with um

678
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:44,570
yup website ranks om we can see but only
free of a web pages are using

679
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:50,350
X minus content security policy from a
top 500 falls in nine that pagers

680
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:53,840
and from the top 1 million 18 web pages

681
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:58,860
so if not so much but sale some of them
are using it

682
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:01,950
and Tom X minus that kid CSP is

683
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:06,450
of course arm the header from WebKit so
chrome and safari

684
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:09,870
and so I'm vero this oil just one

685
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:12,930
a web page which on yes supports it

686
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:17,880
or includes it maybe F-four who knows
have

687
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,590
okay so we know that various afsane
bassir as a countermeasure

688
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:26,620
against brawls a base the tax on mobile
devices be no

689
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:29,990
that so we have XO options as an HTTP
header

690
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:34,390
and we know but we have taken a security
policy it's an HTTP header

691
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:38,420
mmm got this OP actually enough for us

692
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:42,380
but we have also a countermeasure or
maybe a countermeasure

693
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:45,510
against all odds have taking attack so
the phone call

694
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:49,770
attack or a home screen at a cure

695
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:54,980
well to be honest I actually more than
one

696
00:43:54,980 --> 00:44:00,800
a countermeasures but this come to
measure is more or less

697
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,130
yeah and useful for us we will see why
I'm

698
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:08,050
well the first countermeasure Ross

699
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:11,400
from Google by weight to arm

700
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:16,630
give %uh develop a chance to protect his
all application against being attacked

701
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:19,740
so let's imagine the case pets

702
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,770
an application from Dutch a bunk Hess

703
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:26,210
I from an option to mate

704
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:29,760
on ought to make online transactions all
and

705
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,350
what that's a bank and do here is but we
say if the victim

706
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:36,740
or if if the user is click a touching
all on

707
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:40,740
I'll transactional to make the
transaction or although v

708
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:44,030
as: something from the stock market then

709
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:47,290
the button or a element

710
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:50,370
can heft one of these attributes here

711
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:54,760
or methods I'm said Phil to touch a
smile upskirt or implied for the touch

712
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,430
us but upskirt

713
00:44:56,430 --> 00:45:00,520
this means that notification message

714
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:04,770
is 11th over this application or Driver
no touch these true

715
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:08,880
on an application with and notification
is adult

716
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,460
on over my application from such a punk
in this case

717
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:16,470
you know the point is very obvious

718
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:20,190
countermeasure were is actually one
because on

719
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:24,570
the scheme effort and he attribute here
it's more or less the same

720
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:27,570
always introduce with Android 2.2 to

721
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:30,790
but applications like a phone call
application

722
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:35,450
do not use it so very introduce account
I'm ever

723
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:38,830
which is more or less and useful for us
because

724
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:42,540
we cannot take a victim with for example
a focal application

725
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:46,390
and this is by whatever reason by vis
arm attack will be there

726
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:49,660
zero-day the next five years because the

727
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:53,250
people a buying mobile force today with
a bright

728
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:56,600
version of 2.2 both could have freed up
7

729
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:01,040
and so on global not upgrade your device
and to

730
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,110
a second attack the phone call anytime

731
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:08,130
or the different application anytime

732
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:12,790
all your idea what else the following
arm

733
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:16,090
we want to introduce

734
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:19,650
attacked a kink security layer at ESL

735
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:24,140
now and this layer consists of more or
less one button

736
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:27,340
and this button is using the attributes

737
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:30,580
from the last slight here so

738
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:34,180
its issues Inc and right foot that I've
just been upskirt

739
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:37,530
so whenever

740
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:41,040
there is a notification it will be
blocked

741
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:45,400
with all layer invest implication behind
it like the focal application

742
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,750
cannot detect any more the point this

743
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:52,230
that and later can be set

744
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:55,250
here and not behind

745
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:59,410
fee but if the cation notification is
every time on the top

746
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:03,720
and that's because american only
implemented by the Android developers

747
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,740
which isn't the case right now maybe in
the future

748
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:11,300
so conclusion of look we saw a baton

749
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:15,180
most of the existing you I we dressing
attacks can be used for very little a

750
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:15,930
fort

751
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:19,310
just some of them do not work like okay
JK Inc

752
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:25,970
and across the ticket there are a lot of
contem- evers for a desktop base

753
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:30,650
browsers and mobile baseball since like
Firefox

754
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:35,080
a on chrome in 20 prop

755
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:39,570
famous or Security Review have extent of
teens as an exit if you had her

756
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:43,430
and take on that security policy

757
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:47,160
and it would be also is fat a it is
possible

758
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:51,590
to a tech appli- cations with another
application

759
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:55,340
which has no rights for making EG phone
calls

760
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:59,480
no what we must 3 comments

761
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:02,930
to ever vendor

762
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:06,630
earlier developer team like Google is to
implement alright

763
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:11,290
t'as because saddam in my opinion that
this really

764
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:14,840
are important to have such a contem-
sure

765
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,840
and today off a final census year

766
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,540
fats I think that html5 and css3

767
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:25,620
word give office an attacker a chance to
carry out many many

768
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:29,160
I'm attacks which will maybe

769
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:32,170
I make the situation

770
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:36,620
even Bruce in the future you like at
this in the case of hijacking

771
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:41,790
always suffered reckoned with attack
with a drinkable as an attribute your

772
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:44,780
so that was it so I think if we

no question did you speak up with Google

776
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:08,620
yet I have rolled them some may have
thought so

777
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:13,730
response also that they are in more or
less not interested in that

778
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:17,220
I

779
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:20,240
.ca we will see that in future maybe

780
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:24,520
maybe it wouldn't be implemented but I
don't know

781
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:28,500
so by the way I'm one question for you

782
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:33,530
crew failings that IRS Sophie operating
system of

783
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:37,780
at poor can be also attacked with
high-tech checking

784
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:40,990
hands up or not

785
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:44,130
know hence you okay why

786
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:47,390
we haven't had your I have to say

787
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:52,109
yet on the famous IRS cannot be attacked
because

788
00:49:52,109 --> 00:49:55,940
you have to arm

789
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:59,780
lol each application to for example show
push

790
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:04,540
messages yeah so good is set on
application the application want to sag

791
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:08,370
say yes and you some push messages and
you have explicitly

792
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:11,900
222 click on OK to a law office you know

793
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:15,540
so its this doesn't work and I'll issue

794
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:18,920
notification attack just to say it

795
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,910
yeah itself was actually not so bad in
this case

796
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:27,100
but just in this case and what about a
Windows Phone 8
