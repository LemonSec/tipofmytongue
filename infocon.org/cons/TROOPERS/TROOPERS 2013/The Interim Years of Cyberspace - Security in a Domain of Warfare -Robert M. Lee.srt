1
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,069
all right thank you on sorry I'm
definitely side years thank you for let

2
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:08,960
me acecomm

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,530
this I originally started with a
conversation between Brian fight myself

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:13,980
back its or Seattle

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,730
he said you know some good commerce is a
go to any mention troopers what's ahead

6
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:19,470
for dove

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,660
it's kinda funny because I live here in
Germany right now I

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,170
but yes I'm properly and this will be
the intern years a sour face

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,020
presentation

10
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,370
get started I am and therefore
cyberspace operations officer

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:35,629
and I am station here in Germany and
we're currently for the Air Force

12
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:37,760
intelligence surveillance and
reconnaissance agency

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,360
so to get started let me

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,600
caviar that I'm not speaking for the
government not speaking for the ODI

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,650
I'm speaking entirely on my own account
all my opinions are my own

16
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,480
that is very important i recognize
because there are a lot of bright people

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,340
that do this

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,489
and they might have very different
opinions that idea a second caveat is

19
00:00:58,489 --> 00:00:59,610
that use a cyber a lot

20
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,530
as mentioned I'm not a hacking officer

21
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,090
the cyber Space Operations Officer so I
do use the term the government uses

22
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,990
on I do you really hate the over use of
the term as well though

23
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,509
when people are saying yes I'm a cyber
transport analyst in cyber trance for

24
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:22,450
capability percent like know you have a
router Inc at five they're different I

25
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,509
but I do cyber inside use that word

26
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:29,829
but there's a lot you bought their cyber
cyber cloud cyber

27
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:34,090
can turn RT second thing is even I live
in Germany and I have live in Germany

28
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:34,840
for two years

29
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,369
my German is not good I pretty much
non-existent I usually know

30
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:44,149
I'm be a better on I'm Snitzel better
and that's about this

31
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:48,679
extend my German so I appreciate you for
your patience

32
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:52,849
not even had to use Google for that not
Yahoo I have

33
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:57,079
so here's the takeaways from my
presentation day I know it is a little

34
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:57,799
bit different

35
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:01,679
and hacking conference we talking about
military history military strategies RF

36
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:04,689
government approach to things I think
it's important

37
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:07,759
I think there's a lot of similarities in
our own communities has been hacking

38
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,110
community military community

39
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,530
security researchers really when you get
down to ever wants the unique but a lot

40
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,489
of these traits are shared between us in
a lot of the history is actually share

41
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:17,000
between

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,560
I but i wanna talk about lessons learned
from air power that can actually be

43
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,340
applied to

44
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:26,159
CyberPower I and talk about what really
makes up these inner mir's a cyberspace

45
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:26,890
to me

46
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,459
start talking about cyber capabilities
verse 5

47
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:34,829
not everything is a cyberattack some
things are just peace in our

48
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:38,510
and they don't talk about spheres of
influence is rich really

49
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,719
relates to you all being at this
conference so

50
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:44,840
to get started lessons from airpower I

51
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,209
during the interim years airpower this
time between War One War two

52
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:52,530
there's a a really good development with
air power in terms

53
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,120
air shows and conferences and talking
about

54
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,060
showing of these capabilities the people
there was a certain level deterrence

55
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,579
they're showing the enemy showing

56
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:06,150
whoever we wanted a I go to war with
that yes we do have these advanced

57
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,769
aircraft we do have this

58
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:11,260
air superiority where there's also this
idea of getting people involved

59
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,939
it was so cool to think about kids and

60
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:18,519
even adults going to the stairs shows
news conferences and one

61
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:22,019
look at that that's cool right there
that plane that's awesome

62
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:25,469
I want to be involved in that and i
think thats a good approach with the

63
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:26,769
conference is that we have now

64
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:30,620
getting people involved in the community
is always a good thing on

65
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,099
some advocates and pioneers during the
early stages they really went on

66
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:36,189
awareness are talking about airpower

67
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:39,689
in a way that others weren't they were
trying to think outside the box

68
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:43,010
and in a way there hackers in their own
right they were

69
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,120
trying to do something different hadn't
been done before

70
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,920
and i think thats I very important to
realize that we've sorta seen this

71
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,749
aspect of

72
00:03:51,749 --> 00:03:55,010
technology increase before in be met
with side

73
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,709
different opinions and communities so
one though

74
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:02,749
original lessons learned from airpower
one of the least original thoughts was

75
00:04:02,749 --> 00:04:04,109
that the bomber always gets through

76
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:08,459
this idea strategic bombing was huge and
it

77
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:12,090
it was really an ideology sort of

78
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,299
based around almost Italian Air Marshal
Julia to Hayes

79
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,859
idea of going straight to the civilians
going straight to the city's

80
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:23,400
breaking the morale of people you
wouldn't have to

81
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,660
invade you would have to send in tanks
armies you could literally just go

82
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,850
straight over the front lines and bomb
wherever you want to go

83
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,520
and that aspect of the bomber always
gets through something that everyone

84
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,590
thought was

85
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:38,130
always going to persist but as we found
out General Mitchell started asking for

86
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,640
different aircraft to be developed not
just bombers

87
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,150
different people came out with
anti-aircraft artillery in guns

88
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,150
with different approaches to doing it so
if you think about the cyber aspect

89
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,240
right now we always think the attacker
always gets through the attackers always

90
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,560
effective it after always went out

91
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,920
all to me at least right now that seems
very short cited unlimited

92
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,540
and it may seem to be true but if you
start thinking outside the box which

93
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:05,260
hackers a really good about I think
we'll start developing better solutions

94
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,710
for this problem

95
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,790
%uh so the vector approach I wouldn't
necessarily expecting want to know this

96
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,630
picture

97
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:15,570
this is president truman signing in 1947
the National Security Act which created

98
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,430
the Air Force with some very happy for
obviously

99
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,090
as an Air Force guy I in no way think
that we need a cyber force that is this

100
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,620
last thing I would advocate for actually

101
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,180
I what I do like about this is there was
a vector approach

102
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,860
new original foundations air power in
the centre mir's it was this concept of

103
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,660
who's going on air power the military
army guys or the Navy guys

104
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,880
and gals who is really going on it

105
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,220
and a lot of conflict happened and
strategies once a minute and we really

106
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,330
lost ground

107
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,530
and a lotta ways on what we could have
done so when it comes to

108
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:54,350
cyber hacking information security I see
that same lesson

109
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:58,170
coming back that affected approach we
can all talk about a thousand different

110
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,510
solutions and

111
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,380
approaches and we can talk about how the
hackers are different than the

112
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,650
government guys and government guys are
different security researchers in

113
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:09,560
and some way they can be but if we sorta
take a vector approach in sort of look

114
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,700
at the problem

115
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:16,220
I in different ways but together and
then we start develop better solutions

116
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,780
on another felt really good point air
power's capabilities

117
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,340
can make a huge statements capability
sometimes can be

118
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,730
bigger than their original purpose that
secondary and tertiary effect

119
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:31,700
and we definitely see this in cyber but
original airpower

120
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,490
when B 52 flew over vietnam linebacker
to

121
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:39,910
has a huge statement that wasn't just a
vietnam that was to russia and everyone

122
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,030
else out there going

123
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,960
look at what we've got look at what we
can do don't mess with us

124
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,700
that's a big thing to realize Y-one the

125
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,390
best examples this to me was be stocks
at when stocks that came out and hit the

126
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,270
Iranian facilities and its hands

127
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,740
and destroyed centrifuges cyber
capability actually destroying upwards a

128
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,760
thousand

129
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,240
I'll step 7 controllers and p-1
centrifuges

130
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,410
that's a huge statement earned a cyber
capabilities

131
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,410
that statement made a big impact people
all around the world

132
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,680
obviously I don't know for sure but I
would assume that

133
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,270
indifferent national level organizations
around the world people are going

134
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,340
was at us if it wasn't how do we do that

135
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,810
and also food we not make mad and so I
think

136
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:28,600
again capabilities can be more than
themselves will see that more often the

137
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,590
cyber capabilities than we do now

138
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,760
this picture is very potent to mean
talking about blowing lines for

139
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,300
talked a little bit earlier about it i
an air Marshall to hey talking about

140
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,400
going after

141
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,540
the civilian populist going straight to
the heart of people and breaking them a

142
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,410
row

143
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:49,440
I could not disagree more with that
obviously that's just

144
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,520
not good we sort of thought about these
a

145
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,840
these approaches but this is a picture

146
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,220
painting a president in that was a
horrible experience in talking about

147
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,930
going after civilian personnel

148
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:06,140
and obviously I wasn't in the war I
don't know that terms in the

149
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:10,050
ideas come up with at the time but even
the military leaders at the time realize

150
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,650
that if they would've lost the war

151
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:15,700
they went right as war criminals floated
in Japan as well as resident

152
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,700
as you talk about the ability for
capabilities to blur those lines

153
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,680
with cyber this is incredibly true you
start talking about end-user devices you

154
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,770
start talking about perhaps for insulin
pumps like until

155
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:30,650
people if you start messing around with
them that idea blurring the lines is

156
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,510
huge and it may be completely
unintentional

157
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,390
you may have a cyber capability that
leaks out of the network you were trying

158
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,099
to get to

159
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:40,830
and cause havoc on civilian
infrastructure thats a

160
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,830
a thing that a lot of people sometimes
take for granted

161
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:47,880
um and in terms of this point as well

162
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,250
do hey originally thought you break the
the morale the civilians but they found

163
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,110
out

164
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,030
that you couldn't when you did this
you'd actually cause the civilians to

165
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,370
rally around the flag to rally around
the government

166
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,450
and say look those guys were obviously
bad cuz they came after our civilians

167
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:05,160
the problem in cyber right now is
there's a lack of attribution

168
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,670
so maybe that might actually hold up
without the ability to rally around the

169
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,310
flag and

170
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:15,290
actual target with an actual adversary
it may be very hard to do so

171
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:18,030
and this one is something that I really
loved one the reasons I really was

172
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,670
excited

173
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:22,440
come the troopers is this aspect of
education the air force

174
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,600
hi came back after the war and said you
know what we need

175
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,260
an air combat training center I and so
they created

176
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:33,430
axe and they still call their best
pilots and I some back to school and

177
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:33,940
they said

178
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,730
we want you to teach everything that you
learned all the capabilities you were

179
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:38,750
familiar with

180
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,320
to everyone else we don't want to have
this information gap we don't want to

181
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,500
have to recreate the wheel

182
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,650
every time we need a pilot and this is
something that I see

183
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:51,220
assess the true professionals as hackers
is even military members

184
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,900
needing to do more of teaching the
community around us getting those skills

185
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,540
out there and and and easy and
affordable way

186
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,950
and making sure that we do pass on the
information we have

187
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:04,720
so that if we do something really great
that we don't just leave out the rest

188
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,450
the community as we go forward

189
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:10,700
so to the aspects of the inner mir's a
cyber to me these in turn years a

190
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,890
cyberspace

191
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:16,210
I originally started around desert
shield desert storm

192
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:19,370
to me before the nineteen nineties it
was more of

193
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:23,140
this foundational experience figure out
the internet was about what about this

194
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,200
domain information systems

195
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,190
and then posts goal for is where I
really start thinking the nation states

196
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:34,100
as well some corporations or really
testing out the capabilities testing out

197
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,260
the strategies

198
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,529
if you look to history and you start
talking on military doctrine military

199
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:40,470
strategy was

200
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:44,190
every military officer seems after
taking love I

201
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:49,060
you get this cornucopia of experiences
and plethora of

202
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,390
options to choose from when it comes to
history

203
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:56,340
if all these good examples of this guy
didn't work in hey maybe if you invade

204
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,770
Russia in the winter time is not only
good for you

205
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:02,740
there's certain things that you know not
to do when it comes to cyber we don't

206
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,630
have a lot of case studies to look at

207
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:08,400
we don't have a lot of history to pull
from so these people

208
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,130
that might be operating on a nation
state level don't have all the good

209
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,830
experiences the pool from

210
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,910
and so in some aspects is starting from
scratch but in some aspects then you

211
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,870
look at other

212
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,900
ways love gathering case studies

213
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:26,140
and I do believe at this time is one
we're going to see a lot more of non

214
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,000
Asian state after involvement

215
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,840
more one more to you didn't have the
aspect to civilian pilots really being

216
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,790
disruptive to an operation

217
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:37,680
you didn't really have the aspect if
someone breaking down your intelligence

218
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,760
operation from another pilot

219
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,220
and terms cyber and hackers absolutely
nah nation state actors are huge force

220
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,350
when it comes to cyber

221
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,600
and so you do have to consider these
when you're planning operations or you

222
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,100
planning security strategies

223
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,230
it's not just Apte which as another term
that I do hate

224
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,570
but Apte breaking into your network
search I know whoever

225
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:01,270
its non-agency actors as well disrupting
what you're doing

226
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,710
Tom and we will see ongoing agency
operations in my opinion

227
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:09,480
we see in this time these leaders coming
out making large statements

228
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,290
so this is a statement by marine
Lieutenant General Richard Nelson he

229
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:12,900
said

230
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,950
I can tell you that as a command in
Afghanistan your 2010

231
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:19,839
I was able to use my side rash cyber
operations against an adversary with

232
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,390
great impact

233
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:25,710
that's harsh a big statement for a
military guy everything about cyber

234
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,580
seems to be overly classified

235
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,390
I can talk about a brand-new f35
capability I can talk about it Joint

236
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,350
Strike missile

237
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,610
but God forbid I mention netcat the
public you know it's

238
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:39,900
is this issue of not talking about what
everyone realizes already there

239
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:44,000
and you can't have good dialogue without
admitting that yes we take part in cyber

240
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,250
operations yes we do cyber defense

241
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,350
so I but as a nation if we're not saying
we're doing cyber defense something's

242
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,520
wrong in taxpayers should be upset

243
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,330
um so with statements like this we'll
see more of them we are gonna see the

244
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,940
demesne come watch the light

245
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,589
as people start realizing the dialogue
and education or great

246
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:04,279
things for this domain I'm we also see
other people missus

247
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:08,700
prior secretary defence up to now we see
other innovators coming out saying

248
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,650
you know the reality is that a cyber
capability could have a large-scale

249
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,640
impact infrastructure

250
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,700
that's something that we've known sense
P Diddy 63 1998 and Clint came out and

251
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,839
said hey

252
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,050
cyber is a big deal are infrastructures
is a big deal with electronic warfare

253
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,440
we probably need to do something about
this and other people who have much

254
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,390
longer

255
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,830
but actually come out and talk about
this threat being there is important

256
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:34,800
and knowledge that threat is important
and for someone in his position to come

257
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,210
out and put his name

258
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:40,160
which team likes a lot his reputation
and say yes this is something I'm

259
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,279
concerned about

260
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,430
that's something that others should be
interests as well you're always going to

261
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,220
have that aspect to fight that fear
uncertainty and doubt

262
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,620
but when certain individuals come out
and say that they're worried about

263
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,430
things

264
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:54,160
shirley's pay attention to it and say
well I wonder

265
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,390
are they just you know four fighters are
actual aspect there

266
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,690
so you have these nominations day actors
right in on this is one the great ones

267
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,730
look at everyone talks about an honest

268
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,490
I'm not a huge fan oven honest I don't
particularly dislike and Evan

269
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:11,270
the ones I've interact with online are
usually okay

270
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:15,670
um when it comes to this though it's
that aspect of people getting involved

271
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,779
certain when people look back in history
on this time a development for the

272
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:20,040
cyberspace the main

273
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,710
these that have a group that they'll see
and I don't want an honest to be the

274
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,700
only person or group that represents the

275
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:30,080
pain as it is now on 4chan is awesome I
guess but not

276
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,790
I am all only this represent the domain
so hopefully other groups continue get

277
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,560
involved into their own part as well so
the history that have to be written in

278
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,680
such a way

279
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,339
but at least there are groups out there
doing things and then we have to take

280
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:45,370
understanding that wells have
individuals out there doing things this

281
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:45,950
is someone

282
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,960
I like a lot haven't really gotta hang
out in the hall much on

283
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,130
or at all but to someone that I really
support this idea of taking your skills

284
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,420
and you're not helping charities

285
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,690
so cool saying you know what hackers
aren't about

286
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:02,020
owning computers time sometimes hackers
are mostly about thinking outside the

287
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:05,660
box and giving back to the community and
doing things in unique ways

288
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,710
I think that is that hacking methodology
that hacking

289
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:12,560
um culture and some people really embody
that what they do

290
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,940
and so hopefully other individuals go
out do very similar things cuz there's

291
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,910
much more room for this

292
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,020
we also have these non Asian state
afters that use

293
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,940
anemone to me so jester is a good
example

294
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:28,620
obvious hacktivist that no one seems
know who he is and he goes out it takes

295
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,460
down okay to forums in different eras
forms

296
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:37,120
I and again P someone kind of unique but
he's not there's a lot of people out

297
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,410
there like this

298
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:42,940
so these are the title individual solo
pilot soul operators those talking about

299
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,089
that must be taken in consideration

300
00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:48,860
if and if a nation state is monitoring
the forum and they're looking for

301
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,930
terrorist activity and they're gonna

302
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:54,730
you know if find out that this guy's
actually planning a an operation

303
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:58,010
and someone comes and thanks for being
awesome takes on the form

304
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:01,910
to their own intelligence operation and
tip off to the adversary that someone

305
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,470
was watching him or

306
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,920
did they do something good because
there's not that many people looking at

307
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,190
that the first place

308
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,899
I i don't have an opinion on it one way
or another as far as jester goes in

309
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:14,220
general just one on my communication
with them seems like a really nice guy

310
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,089
I but it's just again that aspect we
have to realized during these interim

311
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:20,920
years we have people like this

312
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,649
Tom we also have groups like this this
is one that I usually give a good set

313
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,390
out to

314
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,399
a friend now where researchers in the
room this is why the threat fees that

315
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:27,950
I'm on

316
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,870
on they do some amazing work with I
looking at

317
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:35,050
different now are indifferent or days to
come out and tracks to track it back a

318
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,010
little bit within the legal round

319
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:41,410
and they do a lot of good analysis and
this is security researchers hackers

320
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:45,450
government employees I'm from various
governments that come home

321
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:48,480
and go you know what I wanna do a little
bit more this something interesting to

322
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:48,950
me

323
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,950
and they get on these groups and I do
stuff and we have a lot of groups like

324
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,070
this for people to get involved with

325
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,649
I it's fine to me I actually really like
Kaspersky even though

326
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:01,730
the Russian and US and on over his first
he's done some amazing work and that's

327
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,679
fine to see casper see guys and a threat
if you'd like this in

328
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:08,489
I can do analysis with someone something
that's to me empowering when we think

329
00:17:08,489 --> 00:17:10,699
about the domain what it is

330
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:14,139
and also you have companies get involved
not is na nation-state group a

331
00:17:14,139 --> 00:17:15,289
nation-state group

332
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:20,209
playing along is these companies much
like many other ones you represent

333
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:24,909
but it's important have a good attitude
and good focus of what you're doing

334
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:28,169
I love Google's approach with the free
and open Internet

335
00:17:28,169 --> 00:17:31,669
going out and say something for maybe
they're not always perfect it's hard

336
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:36,159
ever have a large company or large
nation and all be on the same path

337
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:39,360
but at least sometimes they come out and
say something good

338
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,129
I so with your own companies be that
person that influences

339
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:47,649
that good to come out the company on so
these are the important aspects are the

340
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:50,999
main to me during this period is nine
ish it's a group these actors these

341
00:17:50,999 --> 00:17:52,019
hacktivists

342
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:54,840
these nation-state operators these
companies being involved in this domain

343
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,129
that we love

344
00:17:56,129 --> 00:17:59,149
the hacking do may know the sire two
main or whatever you wanna call it

345
00:17:59,149 --> 00:18:03,029
and being involved and in some ways they
represent all of us

346
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:06,600
and sometimes you don't want that rights
to do more arm

347
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,950
we do have these different roles that we
had to edge out I is your data in the

348
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:11,489
cloud

349
00:18:11,489 --> 00:18:15,869
really your data or is it something else
I can go access that server now secure

350
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:16,820
data

351
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:21,049
even as a government operator sire
operator for the US government

352
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:24,049
in the air force hi what my data to be
my data

353
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:27,539
I don't want the FBI or whoever to be
able to go get my data without me having

354
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:28,590
some say in it

355
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:32,539
unless they have a legitimate want I to
me that's a huge

356
00:18:32,539 --> 00:18:36,669
huge issue that more people need to be
looking at I have nothing to hide it but

357
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:39,580
I tell you that I encrypt my stuff
doesn't make me a terrorist because I

358
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,690
used for

359
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:45,129
I when it comes to these human rights
aspect different countries

360
00:18:45,129 --> 00:18:49,009
not allowing internet access to people
this is stuff that really should just

361
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:51,119
take a lot of you off if it hasn't
already

362
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:54,879
and these are the aspects we have to
figure out now in this

363
00:18:54,879 --> 00:18:57,989
curious I respect these legal frameworks
that we set up now

364
00:18:57,989 --> 00:19:02,299
this vectoring this populous decision
that we make now for the domain is going

365
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:06,169
to carry on for years so it's very
important to be involved now

366
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:09,700
and looking at those historical examples
because we have very limited once

367
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,899
like us talking about with the security
researchers researchers Packers

368
00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:17,059
or government peapod first now you don't
have a lot to look at

369
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:20,830
every samples important every operation
is important these things are

370
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:25,330
are important to look at and extract as
many lessons you can

371
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,399
so is that civil military sharing right

372
00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:31,850
and I'm not here to tell you government
civilians everybody should be happy

373
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,649
income by %ah install

374
00:19:33,649 --> 00:19:36,480
know beat on the drums together I
there's 20 people the government that I

375
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,909
don't trust in a funny people

376
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:41,590
and hack unity I don't trust it's not
about blindly trusting

377
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:45,769
it's about being willing to go outside
if you're small circle sometimes a star

378
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:48,139
interacting and start dialogue with
people

379
00:19:48,139 --> 00:19:52,789
if you can honestly create an innovative
idea and some sort of solution

380
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:56,460
doesn't matter who gets the credit for
it doesn't matter who

381
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,519
I'm you actually talking to a few can do
something good that is the ultimate

382
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:00,860
result

383
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,980
in this aspect a threat intelligence if
it I do a lot of stuff

384
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:09,109
open source with skate and ICS and a lot
of times just talking operators are here

385
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:13,009
that they were one plant was infiltrated
using a certain

386
00:20:13,009 --> 00:20:16,759
dropper of a basic persistent threat I

387
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:19,299
and they don't tell anybody about it but
it sure that intelligence and so on

388
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:20,350
another plant

389
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,700
and another country or another location
I have the exact same thing

390
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,139
not being able to share that threat
intelligence allows adversaries haven't

391
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:30,320
infinite scale on when they're taxol
work

392
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,519
and then all obviously we have to have a
protection basic rights and principles

393
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:38,369
nobody in the morning wakes up and goes
I wanna be an asshole today

394
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:41,840
doesn't really happen maybe in a few
cases I guess but not as far as i'm

395
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,940
concern on the people wake up and say
that

396
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,999
you know today I'm gonna wake up and do
something wrong in the world

397
00:20:46,999 --> 00:20:51,129
not a lot of people you get this
dialogue going you can influence ideas

398
00:20:51,129 --> 00:20:54,200
there's a lot of people military there
are struggling to figure out the cyber

399
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,739
stuff

400
00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:59,460
I promise you and it's important to talk
to the community in go you know what

401
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,720
guys gals here's what we're thinkin the
sounds good

402
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,840
I had any issues with it yeah that's
that's pretty messed up thats people

403
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,249
encryption or whatever it is

404
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:12,489
opening up that dialogue creates better
results for both parties and maybe even

405
00:21:12,489 --> 00:21:13,409
the government

406
00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:17,059
is actually sharing more information
regardless if the government's you're

407
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:18,080
from

408
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,259
you might see certain things that are
good at being able to correct others

409
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:24,799
I i don't think as a good strategy for
the government's a gimme gimme gimme

410
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:25,759
gimme

411
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:28,480
said you know civilians askew
researchers and companies need to ask

412
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,289
for something back as well

413
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:35,320
okay we'll is worse fun so we do have
this sort of like

414
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,100
fun aspect and hollywood movies which
sometimes is kinda cool but sometimes

415
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,519
really really annoying

416
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:44,470
when in my case a commander might be
like this looks awesome how do we do

417
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,840
that and it's like higher Hollywood I
don't know

418
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,929
but there are these aspects that people
actually look at and go

419
00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:55,539
this is real and we have to educate
people to tell them her real options

420
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:56,590
what are not

421
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:01,149
I a fire sale on fire and and live heart
is not exactly true

422
00:22:01,149 --> 00:22:05,919
but can you target state infrastructure
cyber capabilities absolutely

423
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,129
can you do it is easily as everyone
thinks know it's really really hard

424
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:13,899
I go home again have nothing to skin the
government but I do in my open source

425
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:14,859
free time

426
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:18,019
and just looking on the internet going
around doing things with the security

427
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:19,639
searchers they're not idiots

428
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:23,139
lot people %uh control systems class are
actually really good at what they do

429
00:22:23,139 --> 00:22:26,649
it's easy for us is intelligent people
to sort stick pens

430
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:30,369
and the the weaknesses a networks
there's a lot of good people

431
00:22:30,369 --> 00:22:33,720
everywhere they're doing good work and
make it difficult for attackers

432
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,730
which is awesome Tom there's also

433
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,820
you know again with five this one is fun
I

434
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:44,710
threatened to get as I had blown away
Western act into the DOD

435
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:48,399
in under a minute you know that can
really happen unless you send like a

436
00:22:48,399 --> 00:22:49,730
free iPad link

437
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:52,769
I it's not going to happen easily

438
00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:56,059
so then you've got your James Bond stuff
too like it's cool to see some the stuff

439
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:57,450
in movies that's nice

440
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:00,789
everyone we have a conversation last
night a couple people ever want to be

441
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:04,669
that James born in cyber everyone wants
their story the Cuckoo's egg if you will

442
00:23:04,669 --> 00:23:07,730
I but it's not always the case sometimes
it is just

443
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:11,609
dredging through analyst logs I so you
have to educate

444
00:23:11,609 --> 00:23:15,289
our own leadership whether it be and
security communities or educating

445
00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:19,480
leadership at CCC or wherever about
what's real and what's fun

446
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,149
um the CSA CSI effect as always the fun
one hate me enhance that image while the

447
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:25,499
pixels are certain

448
00:23:25,499 --> 00:23:29,109
now maybe you can just dance everything
I

449
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:32,730
and then obviously you get the people to
build the industry on fun told be those

450
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,159
guys and gals

451
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,539
it may look enticing as a short term
option to sort through out this hey if

452
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:39,549
you install this

453
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:42,999
I'll protect you and everything to be
great but the long-term it's a horrible

454
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:43,850
tragedy

455
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:47,409
and people will get wise is that the
government is getting very wise that

456
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:48,789
going know what

457
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:53,119
this isn't something that was great and
now I don't trust you as a company

458
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:56,169
that's it's not a long-term strategy so

459
00:23:56,169 --> 00:24:00,149
when people make this a other business
but is there this really massive spike

460
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:01,499
in ATT

461
00:24:01,499 --> 00:24:05,259
on everyone's talking about you know you
know there's this huge threatened

462
00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:07,739
Cybertech is gonna ruin your life and I

463
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:11,789
cyber Technik on top terror threat
everything at how much that's real and

464
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:12,869
how much is that

465
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:15,989
been around we just haven't seen before
because our own capabilities

466
00:24:15,989 --> 00:24:19,190
I really like the the next cyber wars
already in progress

467
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:22,859
security expert which is kinda like
saying

468
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:26,879
Santa Claus is real can expect presents
you know i mean

469
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:30,619
there's this aspect is being honest in
the media and to me is a cyber

470
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:33,440
operations guy for the military I'm
wondering where the hell the for cyber

471
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,210
war was

472
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:37,749
but I guess there's a next one coming um

473
00:24:37,749 --> 00:24:41,629
so ever get it good all rights

474
00:24:41,629 --> 00:24:45,129
so is it really is more threats are
there better analysts my

475
00:24:45,129 --> 00:24:48,340
my background my open source stuff my
masters and forensics

476
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:52,220
I love forensics and if you see the
development the friend's ex as Don

477
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:55,749
in the community you'll note that a lot
of the tools are so much better than we

478
00:24:55,749 --> 00:24:57,109
had access to before

479
00:24:57,109 --> 00:25:00,299
so obviously we're going to start seeing
more threats so yes

480
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:03,409
I do believe there are more threats out
there and that during this time period

481
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:05,979
nation-states are testing out their own
strategies

482
00:25:05,979 --> 00:25:09,830
their own capabilities in creating more
threats but also think that we have more

483
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,450
education tools and analyst and skills

484
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:16,179
they're showing a lot these threats that
have existed for years or Sun actually

485
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:18,419
see behind that curtain and realize that

486
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:23,200
the Internet is serious business a lot
of cases so yes I do believe is both

487
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,479
on the video he came out and made a very
public saying about this

488
00:25:26,479 --> 00:25:30,399
with prior secretary the leon panetta I
thought this was awesome to say publicly

489
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:31,419
is

490
00:25:31,419 --> 00:25:34,710
last two years Duty has made significant
investments in forensics to address the

491
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,460
issue the attribution

492
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:40,450
attribution sounds hard sounds mythical
but it's not so I mean it's definitely

493
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,979
hard but not mythical

494
00:25:41,979 --> 00:25:45,629
attributions something that deftly can
be obtained a change the game

495
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:49,379
absolute change the game when countries
are held responsible for the operations

496
00:25:49,379 --> 00:25:50,419
they do

497
00:25:50,419 --> 00:25:54,549
you'll see significant change in legal
frameworks and policy in politics

498
00:25:54,549 --> 00:25:58,100
when you actually have an operator being
attributed to an operation

499
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:02,460
heightened Heights I use same TTP is
might not do the same things might even

500
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,649
not do it at all

501
00:26:03,649 --> 00:26:08,340
I nobody wants to be attributed this
especially this deep dark domain

502
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:12,059
and ultimately you will have this level
deterrence as well

503
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:15,299
and not nuclear transfer old game theory
old

504
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:18,369
I models a prisoner to win a tight
deterrence

505
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:21,700
where you start looking at a
nation-state going you know what

506
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,979
were not to mess with you don't mess
with us because we can see that it's you

507
00:26:24,979 --> 00:26:28,440
lets us you falls off a cliff first
which right now is a lot better than

508
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,179
I'm gonna hack all the things and maybe
I'll catch me but maybe what

509
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:36,489
so what's the realistic employment ups
circuit lots of talk about a lot of fun

510
00:26:36,489 --> 00:26:38,070
a lot of the stuff that's out there

511
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:41,220
with everyone claiming the capabilities
what to me as

512
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,850
as an operator in the Air Force actually
big deal well to me

513
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,659
I think a nation-state weapons I think
love advanced capabilities

514
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:51,659
and termination say wat weapon
especially the current year's

515
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:55,169
is multi rollet we don't see things that
are single purpose

516
00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:59,840
you don't build the B 52 thats only good
bombing you build the f-35a the F

517
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,979
twenty-two that's a multi-role fighter

518
00:27:01,979 --> 00:27:05,080
that can do some bombing but some I
intelligence surveillance reconnaissance

519
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,539
or some

520
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:10,220
I air I air defense ur air missions

521
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:14,350
that's what we saw a lot answer the told
a platform with with Stuxnet

522
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:17,309
sucks I was kinda related cylinders
first he did a lot of good work on this

523
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:18,450
is team

524
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:22,049
césar look at sever capabilities that
are modular in effect we can move around

525
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:24,090
to make something completely different

526
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:28,039
and that to me looks exactly like in a
state capability for that very reason

527
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:31,309
you start talking about how much
oversight goes into the sex

528
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:35,299
think about your own companies how much
it is to get virtual firewalls installed

529
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:38,529
lot of people have taught at that check
in often go yet this is good

530
00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:41,320
nations say capabilities and no
difference there's a lot of the obvious

531
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,979
in the government go figure

532
00:27:42,979 --> 00:27:46,109
so there's a lot of people that have to
have some say in this stuff

533
00:27:46,109 --> 00:27:49,479
see start looking at capabilities that
are quicker to employ

534
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:53,450
if they're multi-role you don't want the
cyber capability that only does one

535
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:56,080
thing because if you need another one
you have to go back through that

536
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,090
bureaucracy

537
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:00,229
she want something that is a fish in
multiple different roles which to me

538
00:28:00,229 --> 00:28:02,200
again stocks until the platform

539
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,559
really fit that case Tom but this is
nothing new the hacker community start

540
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,369
talking about Metasploit backtrack

541
00:28:08,369 --> 00:28:12,239
times different models that you can you
throw in there I but this is a parent

542
00:28:12,239 --> 00:28:14,479
and I think will continue to increase
during these years

543
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:19,779
love interviewers I yes against these
powerful steam is coming out about this

544
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:23,259
the air force is pursuing several
methods to defeat aircraft

545
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:26,269
okay so I don't know if he means
crashing there crafter just the feeling

546
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:27,649
antsy to you or what

547
00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:31,549
but thats awesome and scary all the same
time thinking back to the airpower

548
00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:33,859
aspect of capabilities can be

549
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:37,559
large statements the first time that a
nation's

550
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:41,580
billion dollar aircraft falls out of the
sky it's going to be a big statement to

551
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,529
somebody

552
00:28:42,529 --> 00:28:46,129
if you think about it net 22 is nothing
but a mock to router

553
00:28:46,129 --> 00:28:49,919
you can hack it I breaking into it be
very up

554
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,330
crazy to do if anyone can think of how
please feel free to town hit

555
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:56,330
or at least published on it sewing it
some research on

556
00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:00,179
I but there's a powerful statements and
thinking downed a

557
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:03,739
Secretary of Defense deputy secretary
fence after carter time at the Russians

558
00:29:03,739 --> 00:29:06,830
and Chinese develop these specific
electronic warfare 2

559
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:10,690
disable certain aircraft or 22 Sep
disable other methods and high-value

560
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:12,059
assets that we use

561
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:15,999
that's crazy to think about as kinda
cool calm exciting but really really

562
00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:17,950
scary to

563
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:22,580
so were some cable is we know up well
even if its or the botnet aspect voice

564
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,229
on bronze night with a stone yah

565
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:27,450
or down to the weapons that we saw with
stock set

566
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:30,909
there are real cable is out there that
do really potent things that we do have

567
00:29:30,909 --> 00:29:32,289
to be concerned about

568
00:29:32,289 --> 00:29:35,519
but every single sample APT

569
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:38,960
you know of is getting its code is not a
new piece a VPC

570
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,440
and to me the whole APT's is again

571
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,999
abuse because a lot of times a spear
phishing email the spear phishing email

572
00:29:45,999 --> 00:29:47,639
really that advance guys you know

573
00:29:47,639 --> 00:29:51,039
how much is advance how much is a basic
persistent threat

574
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,139
I if anything it shows you that
persistent winds out

575
00:29:54,139 --> 00:29:57,169
in this game I but I do think there are

576
00:29:57,169 --> 00:29:59,989
obviously nation-states testing
capabilities misstates doing things that

577
00:29:59,989 --> 00:30:01,729
are important to note

578
00:30:01,729 --> 00:30:04,859
I'm so just like a mock scenario what
would one look like

579
00:30:04,859 --> 00:30:08,009
well again that multi-role aspect you
want something that can first go out and

580
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:09,279
gather intelligence

581
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:13,179
most people think that any hacker can
sit down a keyboard ants

582
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:16,570
take out power grid not that easy even
if you're a small team

583
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:22,009
not that easy I again open source stuff
that I do is with protocols with the

584
00:30:22,009 --> 00:30:26,029
ski equipment done some great work taken
and talking to people like matter while

585
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:28,529
an angel angle done a lot research in
this area

586
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:32,359
looking at ICC PND mp3 in my bus tcp/ip
protocols

587
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:35,749
is time consuming and he need a very and
niche

588
00:30:35,749 --> 00:30:39,580
expertise to do so you'll find that
there are no set unauthenticated

589
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,950
but you have to know the controller is
language actually do a whole lot to it

590
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:46,440
otherwise just throwing random code at
getting a buffer overflow

591
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,340
um but for capability would want that
cyber espionage impact

592
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,359
you want that free day one conflict

593
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:57,419
you wanna go behind actual warfare
behind the actual conflict

594
00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:00,509
time and in free conflict buildup that

595
00:31:00,509 --> 00:31:04,259
intelligence buildup that ideology in
realize what you really want to go after

596
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:05,789
what your strategy

597
00:31:05,789 --> 00:31:08,979
same thing with packet wars and in caps
the flags

598
00:31:08,979 --> 00:31:12,549
what are you gonna do before the game
starts

599
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:15,539
that's that intelligence aspect and
that's forcing a lotta right now it's

600
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:16,359
cyber capabilities

601
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:19,759
is the cyber espionage stealing
schematic still in controllers

602
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:22,809
in planning and businesses implanting in
control systems

603
00:31:22,809 --> 00:31:26,859
that stuff is pre conflict it's not the
latest cyber attack from China

604
00:31:26,859 --> 00:31:30,200
its free conflict but it's still very
important note:

605
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,349
so you take that level of intelligence
that you got in those operations new

606
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:34,590
plan to attack

607
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:37,639
so now that you know how the schematic
so silly layout

608
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:41,129
now that you know how the satellite data
links the KU bans work

609
00:31:41,129 --> 00:31:44,340
now that you know how the ISP's actually
function together what fails which is

610
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,279
they have

611
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,629
now you could go after them in a way
that would be an attack something that's

612
00:31:48,629 --> 00:31:49,779
actually disruption

613
00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:53,379
degradation destruction not just I have
no

614
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:56,509
at are popping up on your computer I

615
00:31:56,509 --> 00:32:00,969
something that's actually impact for and
so that would be more a cyberattack

616
00:32:00,969 --> 00:32:04,789
but it's not this aspect a cyberwar no
military person

617
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:08,399
ever I hope right never used to many a

618
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,919
definites but from Hall the training in
military aspects

619
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,149
you never use one capability and
conflict you don't go I'm gonna use

620
00:32:16,149 --> 00:32:19,519
all my aircraft and that's it you know
I'll be nice today

621
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,139
I'm not been used a naval ships and I
can use my land warfare will just use

622
00:32:23,139 --> 00:32:24,059
airpower

623
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:27,799
nobody does that that's not operations
think nobody's gonna say let's have a

624
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:28,909
cyberwar

625
00:32:28,909 --> 00:32:33,849
cyber conflict cyber attacks will be
followed by actual military conflict if

626
00:32:33,849 --> 00:32:35,059
we're gonna see it

627
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:39,070
I or you have what can create an
interesting

628
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:42,580
case would be economic I impact as well

629
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:45,759
but the remodel capabilities regardless
to follow so

630
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:49,830
you have your espionage you build your
advance weapon very customized what you

631
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,590
want

632
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:54,999
you use it now you've got an operation
now you've gotten ability to go in with

633
00:32:54,999 --> 00:32:56,330
some sort of attack

634
00:32:56,330 --> 00:33:00,409
now you can disable other feel good
features all these things on the screen

635
00:33:00,409 --> 00:33:03,429
use some level of computer operating
system or something

636
00:33:03,429 --> 00:33:06,469
data wise so they can be affected as
well

637
00:33:06,469 --> 00:33:10,039
you take a modular capability like I
talked about earlier

638
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:13,460
customize in such a way that you could
take out a sam site as well as gone

639
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,519
after a c2 link for an aircraft

640
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,840
now I've gotta keep believe that
disabled us feel good defense is that

641
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,029
civilians and everyone else

642
00:33:20,029 --> 00:33:24,229
use the really like I like to know as a
military guys we've got and put on a

643
00:33:24,229 --> 00:33:26,679
defense capabilities between me and the
enemy

644
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:30,509
of you start to disable those now you've
got a conflict that's actually

645
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:34,090
realistic an idea I've up government
being able to say

646
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:37,749
we've disabled you we've actually
followed up with military conflict

647
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,269
we had a really killed the civilians
have we haven't done anything that makes

648
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:41,849
this war criminals

649
00:33:41,849 --> 00:33:44,679
but you need a vote like we want on the
Security Council now we need to do

650
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:45,359
something

651
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:48,969
that we want that to me is more
realistic

652
00:33:48,969 --> 00:33:52,999
so to get really it's what your sphere
of influence is what mine as well

653
00:33:52,999 --> 00:33:56,029
so your role to mean must and some

654
00:33:56,029 --> 00:34:00,419
way focus on education you can choose
your role in anything that you want but

655
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:02,369
I think education must be part of it and
some

656
00:34:02,369 --> 00:34:06,719
way you come to commerce is like this I
want to see see see this year

657
00:34:06,719 --> 00:34:10,570
everyone's extremely overly paranoid
which is fun I

658
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:14,159
I'm paranoid about the government so
that helps you any I

659
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,049
everyone's paranoid ever once Hamlin do
this I wanna make this change among the

660
00:34:18,049 --> 00:34:19,730
homies all this information

661
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:23,539
and it kinda dribbles off after the
conference 23 slater you can I lose that

662
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:24,809
zeal that you had

663
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:29,089
or hopefully while you're at a
conference you identify that strategy

664
00:34:29,089 --> 00:34:30,010
there take ford

665
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:33,029
that idea of you know what I wanna have
this one impact

666
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:36,720
and I'll measure my success in this one
thing that I do and continued on so be

667
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,940
it

668
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:41,309
but you really need to find what that
role is for you I need to communicate a

669
00:34:41,309 --> 00:34:43,059
leadership in their terms

670
00:34:43,059 --> 00:34:46,789
as a military guy especially the Air
Force talking to a pilot commander about

671
00:34:46,789 --> 00:34:49,099
cyber capabilities can be kinda
frustrating

672
00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:52,500
the extremely brilliant me know things
that I will never know

673
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,089
but I must communicate in their terms
for the outcome to be something that I

674
00:34:56,089 --> 00:34:57,010
what's

675
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:00,490
the same thing was secured researchers
and industry professionals

676
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:04,569
you cannot go to your boss is many %uh
view probably in should realize not

677
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:07,599
and much more than I am so I assume you
do realize

678
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,250
and say you know what your idiots I
can't believe you let this happen Cap'n

679
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:14,380
I can't believe this happened why are
you investing and firewalls wire

680
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:18,599
investing in small boxes I'm you gotta
communicate in their terms right they're

681
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:20,380
extremely professional sometimes

682
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:23,490
and a lot of in the positions they are
whether we like to believe it or not

683
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:27,230
because they are good so they have some
sort of skills

684
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:30,299
now bring your skills the table
communicate in those terms

685
00:35:30,299 --> 00:35:33,690
if you wanna bridge that gap between the
military and the civilians and hackers

686
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:34,470
and whoever

687
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:37,960
source speaking common terms if I go

688
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,500
to a conference I not that I was able to
converse in China and I start talking a

689
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,680
cyberattack

690
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,049
sabretech might mean something
completely different to them than it

691
00:35:45,049 --> 00:35:45,880
does me

692
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,880
defining terminology is incredibly
important so you must use your sphere of

693
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,539
influence on what you're doing

694
00:35:51,539 --> 00:35:54,650
I again these these people that point
you earlier

695
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:58,250
they all have some sphere of influence
what they're doing it may be just what

696
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,220
reforms

697
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:02,650
or might be educating entire small
villages in Africa

698
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:05,700
or it might be taking down pedobear
sites

699
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,119
who knows what your Spears influences
but you have one

700
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,779
miss three guys in office and you know
three guys and gals in office and you

701
00:36:12,779 --> 00:36:13,920
can influence too avant

702
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,539
that your sphere and it'll ripple out
and it'll be impactful

703
00:36:17,539 --> 00:36:21,190
I'm so I I also looks like the free
education sites

704
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:24,559
conferences and workshops are great and
the very

705
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:27,690
awesome I'll took the re- class
yesterday it was

706
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:31,760
really really cool I the very important
but there are a lot of free sites out

707
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,230
there to learn skills

708
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:36,960
and a lot I want the people don't know
about icon Academy you can learn

709
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,059
everything from science math which is
awesome Python challenge get your script

710
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:42,349
and sells better

711
00:36:42,349 --> 00:36:45,930
I different sites so for me my sphere of
influence

712
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:49,069
is in some part coming out conferences
like this there's not a lot a military

713
00:36:49,069 --> 00:36:51,619
people not a lot operators to come and
talk

714
00:36:51,619 --> 00:36:54,839
trial because they're smarter than I am
I

715
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:58,660
but I like this or to bridge that gap
released try to think that idea

716
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:02,500
what I really do with my own serve
influences hackett I'm what I thought

717
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,069
hey you know I've got the skills

718
00:37:04,069 --> 00:37:06,690
they're not the most important thing in
the world there are better people out

719
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:07,460
there

720
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:10,660
but these are my skill sets that I can
get the people so I do teach free

721
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,480
classes

722
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:16,349
I'll with the cyber classes we talked in
the military in the US side

723
00:37:16,349 --> 00:37:20,220
about 9000 security professional short
why

724
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,400
why do we have so many people not ready
for the conflict

725
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,839
they're not up to the level that we want
when this stuff is so cool

726
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:30,410
who wouldn't be excited about this stuff
all then you start looking at a basic

727
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:33,400
level security class costing three
thousand dollars for a day

728
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,740
0 that's a reason yeah we're gonna be
nine thousand or for a while

729
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:40,319
I so I started developing classes and
teaching

730
00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:44,210
in my own small area been gone really
since january of

731
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:47,119
but we've been teaching since last year
in April talk about a hundred eighty

732
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,700
students so far lot of times I've been
on the road

733
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,250
I'm so at the end this month I'm not
doing conferences for a while

734
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:56,319
am gonna be teaching want you classes I

735
00:37:56,319 --> 00:37:59,460
every month for sure I've got a couple
other instructors that actually trained

736
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,980
on to teach these classes

737
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:05,039
and in the summer or fall depending on
deployments and

738
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:09,400
who goes to war through I am going to
try to put all the stuff on YouTube but

739
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,410
on a Web site

740
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:14,190
take the Khan Academy type model but use
information security skills

741
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:17,309
have actual classes were the says this
is your starting point

742
00:38:17,309 --> 00:38:21,579
here's your basic security plus type
class now here's memory level forensics

743
00:38:21,579 --> 00:38:24,569
are now here's developing Ricketts
whatever it might be

744
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:28,299
and waxing caught hacking incidents you
know super cyber security professional

745
00:38:28,299 --> 00:38:29,720
skills are ever in

746
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,680
Tom in the four focuses for me with this
or friends except ours is hacking

747
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,480
defense

748
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,549
I feel that if you have a good grasp on
those four things are pretty good in the

749
00:38:36,549 --> 00:38:37,279
main

750
00:38:37,279 --> 00:38:41,180
I'm so that's my sphere of influence
right I

751
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:45,730
and other in that office concluded was
saying that everyone needs to use

752
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:48,799
those lessons from whatever you can draw
from

753
00:38:48,799 --> 00:38:52,260
for me I think there is a lot of lessons
from airpower all this can use

754
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:56,569
in companies or governments on but
regardless there's limited case studies

755
00:38:56,569 --> 00:39:00,299
support from them and learn from them we
need to prepare to the center mir's

756
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:01,750
guess not going to get easier

757
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:05,609
as ideologies and methodologies get
cemented in these years they will

758
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:07,319
persist for a long time

759
00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:10,619
now truly is the time to shape a lot of
that

760
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:14,619
I you should have security and privacy
anyone that tells you they have

761
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:17,750
that you have to give up some your
security to have privacy

762
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,910
excusing give up some your privacy to
have security

763
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:24,770
is someone who doesn't understand the
domain that is an incredibly

764
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:29,029
incredibly think incredibly
short-sighted view

765
00:39:29,029 --> 00:39:32,099
and that is something that tells me as
an operator that they're lazy

766
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:35,200
I can have security on my network and I
can do it large-scale instill respect

767
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,630
people's privacy

768
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:39,650
otherwise it's just that Finn Fisher
type crap

769
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:42,869
that people don't know how to operate
they don't know how to use capability

770
00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:44,420
they don't know how to be an operator

771
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:47,940
so they take the lazy route out and say
wat just happened the body

772
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:52,089
that's crap arm so you can have that
everyone needs a man that

773
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:55,119
but said just demanding it educate to

774
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,420
if your gonna go to the government
whoever and say you know what that is

775
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,740
crap

776
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,880
here do this instead provide something
nobody likes the people that is coming

777
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,109
complain about things

778
00:40:05,109 --> 00:40:08,990
we must work together I so there is that
aspect government civilian hackers

779
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:13,690
at the core but all we are truly very
like I consider myself a hacker

780
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:17,440
I don't consider myself anything more
than that I know that I must make the

781
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,220
spot the Fed games really easy coming on
talking

782
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:23,950
on I don't even like being considered a
fed I if anything I guess

783
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:27,109
I'm grey hat bed right see a white hafez
that be

784
00:40:27,109 --> 00:40:31,299
Street researchers in labs need a black
f'ed switch I guess they like the FBI

785
00:40:31,299 --> 00:40:35,980
I and then yeah I so there's some good
analysts and the FBI and some great

786
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:36,510
people

787
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:40,519
but I i just to have a lot action with
them I just the stuff in the news was

788
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:42,059
unfortunate

789
00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:45,549
but to me i get some light grey hat I

790
00:40:45,549 --> 00:40:49,059
so does and military and now not
everyone likes the military I am

791
00:40:49,059 --> 00:40:52,079
but education is long-term made a
strategy that something will have to

792
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:52,960
rely on

793
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,059
if you can't and you're not willing to
go forward and teach people

794
00:40:57,059 --> 00:41:00,220
we're already losing kinda like the
keynote hit on

795
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:03,930
beautifully in massively education must
be that long term strategy must be

796
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,500
guiding the academia

797
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,000
must point the main back to the domain
and do something with it

798
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:15,630
so that's why talk are there any
questions

799
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:22,630
thanks

800
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:26,220
thanks

801
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:33,220
cool sewn up yes yes

802
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:57,100
mmm

803
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:03,430
yes so

804
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:07,770
it's a good point really is and an what
do we have to do to counter that right

805
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:08,590
so I

806
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:11,590
this is why things I think the
government these do better at is sharing

807
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:12,880
some that for intelligence

808
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,940
coming out going in what your beloved
we've noticed a large scale

809
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:19,860
way Microsoft what you got okay
semantically you got his first even when

810
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:20,300
you got

811
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:24,280
I I think coming together is and sharing
more thats to me

812
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:28,170
really important and there are I'm
obvious are talker handle whatever am

813
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:31,210
here but obviously you would hope the
government has its own capabilities that

814
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:31,480
are

815
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:36,070
publicly on Google I and do so just to
make that rational assumption that they

816
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,600
probably have some core capabilities

817
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,570
if we start to share not the
capabilities but the intelligence

818
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:41,720
gathered offer them

819
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,200
that I think we just are seeing that
attribution issue decrease

820
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,350
I but I would just point to the
Secretary statements are not trouble

821
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:51,360
even the secretary statement that

822
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,760
the DOT's invested a lot in forensics is
getting better attribution so I think

823
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,360
that

824
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,990
that medical issue will go down over the
years but I'll never be easy

825
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:02,190
as you're saying it's never going to be
something just be like haha thats China

826
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:05,510
well everyone blames China so as mention

827
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:09,210
keno why does not want to act like China
there's other things that can be done

828
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:12,760
and hopefully by focusing on them
investing in education

829
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,720
and sharing honest like anna's can buy
us out actually get something done

830
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:21,210
else cool well I appreciate all time

831
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:21,540
thanks
