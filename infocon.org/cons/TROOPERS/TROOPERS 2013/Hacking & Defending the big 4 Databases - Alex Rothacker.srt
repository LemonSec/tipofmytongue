1
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,410
123 and that's better so

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,610
a way my name's outsider of the car I'm
I'm running that team shot I which is a

3
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,629
security research team for a company
called application security

4
00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:19,369
um we are at database security

5
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:25,220
company that's all we do is agree to
tools to help you protect your data

6
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,080
basis

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,640
and I

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,200
really why do these talks s um

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,940
studio if if you look at this famous
tower here at the castle in Hyde Park

10
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:41,420
and a you know that really did a great
great job and they build really nice

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,530
perimeter protection

12
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,680
and a well tracks you always kept their

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,740
no matter what you doing so

14
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,500
if you look at recent data

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,660
um last year $27 million records

16
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,870
stole from databases um

17
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:05,880
or stall in general over ninety percent
of those came from databases

18
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,460
assist usual Report supra seen those
arising

19
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,610
um and we've

20
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:16,000
really really believe that an I really
believe

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,630
the data security is not the focus yet
of company companies

22
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:25,080
and in this where you have your stuff

23
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,409
right what what kinda data i hack ass
after

24
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,420
after credit card information after

25
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,760
purcell identifiable information um

26
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,470
there after your company secrets and

27
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:42,909
as much as you protective for a bit of
firewalls and all these things and

28
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:46,030
and they're good I'm not saying don't
have a um

29
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:50,120
16 inside your network

30
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,159
they will get to your database and a so
make sure you protect them

31
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,080
and

32
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,490
so-so thinks every year we typically see

33
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,729
that are used against databases are also
sequence actually comes through the

34
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:08,409
website

35
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:11,670
um that password attacks

36
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,049
access controls on not really very
effectively set up

37
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:19,370
on databases are job I splits

38
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:24,709
and just configuration issues in general
and

39
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:29,159
and I really think you know this is
gonna be a theme for

40
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:32,519
for this year and it it's been a theme
for the last couple years

41
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:35,529
so

42
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:38,769
we sow havoc a little top 10 it's a
little bit if you look at it it's very

43
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:40,290
similar to a

44
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,319
the to the OWASP top 10

45
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:47,299
bargains password sickly injection
privileges shows

46
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:51,840
patch issues buffer overflows amps gonna
go through a couple of them really quick

47
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,499
and I'll show you examples of how you
actually attack a database

48
00:02:55,499 --> 00:03:02,209
and then a little bit how you defend
yourself against it so

49
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:08,129
logins and passwords when you install
your database

50
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:11,319
I love you defaulting are you running a
Setup program or

51
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:15,669
your scripts that do this on

52
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:19,430
database will install a lot of default
accounts

53
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,499
and so to applications such a put on top
of the database

54
00:03:22,499 --> 00:03:26,849
if you install SAP or Oracle e-business
on a database

55
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:30,459
it well use a lotta default accounts

56
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:34,489
um and quite often they have

57
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:39,309
known passports so what we do it's the

58
00:03:39,309 --> 00:03:43,199
out disable those accounts if you can
use some kind of leisure suits for setup

59
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,599
um and then change those passwords

60
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:51,930
a if safe if the account camp is able to
change the passwords to strong passwords

61
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:57,669
um another thing as these installations
will

62
00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:02,349
right date out quite often take the
right passports to lock files

63
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:05,499
try to find those passwords unlock files
to a crap

64
00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:09,239
or find after installation basically on
the whole

65
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,779
the directory that has are calling a
single server installation try to find

66
00:04:13,779 --> 00:04:15,329
them and

67
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:18,840
sometimes you will and then clean that
up make sure that's life as a conse-

68
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,229
otherwise are anybody else can see your
passwords I'll

69
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:28,300
minors standard practice password
expiration reuse strains right

70
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,520
make make sure you configure that
properly and it's very different

71
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,539
different databases if you're

72
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:37,770
going through your OS obviously you have
a

73
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,069
other US settings that you have in in
windows or

74
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:45,650
in different units worsens um database
is often also have

75
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,849
a their own loggins especially in the
article case

76
00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:53,229
extinct really a and easy setup for
someone that

77
00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:56,729
um for example of up

78
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:59,919
past what strengths or reuse you have to
set up basically

79
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,110
write your own little procedures and use
triggers an article 226

80
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,689
things like that um

81
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:12,479
and other things when you assign
privileges to accounts

82
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,479
don't assignment directly to the account
because it's going to become a nightmare

83
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,819
to manage that

84
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:20,919
assign them through roles in groups

85
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:24,490
the and

86
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,919
another thing as locking activity as
often

87
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,180
not really trace and that's really how
you find an attack

88
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,210
espy or one way to find an attack

89
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:40,800
or people try to first passports as a
monitor your login activity

90
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,110
so you can either do that in your outbox
you can set up triggers

91
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,139
you can use tools to do that

92
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,479
arms public sample cf44 the counts so

93
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,650
very much everybody has some right and

94
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:58,229
most these are our mostly older ones
whenever it is shown 0s here

95
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:03,099
but you know are caught Scott that's
what I gots a very famous account

96
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:07,479
than you look at SAP right they they
have their default

97
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:11,699
user names and passwords and when my
favorites at Oracle hacked

98
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:15,960
um database security not my problem they
have an account called DP

99
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,430
as an MP and that's the password for
that account

100
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:24,280
to

101
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,569
now I'll it's a clever a sequence action
in the database so

102
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:30,879
sequence action in the database works
very similar

103
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,379
to the way it works through a web
application

104
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:38,009
you create some sequel that you in
checked some code and then

105
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:43,139
gets executed um

106
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:46,430
tests like the phrase this is usually a
flaw

107
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,180
or a vulnerability in the database code
itself has a snot

108
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,990
you are application called your web
application called on top of it

109
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,810
so gonna have a quick example here our
target as a

110
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:02,780
6 Server 2008 um

111
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,560
we do need a little bit up an elevator
privilege you create database to

112
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,479
to do this and after that our attacker
will be a

113
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,240
an essay um

114
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:21,240
so create the attack user

115
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,460
Scott actor Harry as password

116
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:32,460
and Sperrys and weak a grant this one
privilege that we need

117
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,629
the so as a little bit an elevated
privileges

118
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:40,650
but uses might get those from their
admins

119
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:47,650
every once in a while when they need to
at install suffer to either data

120
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,289
so we lookin our attacker here on

121
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:57,860
she's trying to get is an ass and
passwords from the syslog unstable which

122
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,169
is where

123
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:02,800
sepals or store sales information okay
to CSA

124
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,539
you see yourself and

125
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:12,340
I wanna you know at myself to this is
happening group and it fails

126
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,960
um I wanna look at the AdventureWorks
database which is like a sample database

127
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,719
that you should come sickle cell ran

128
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:22,560
well that fails now we do so we create a
database

129
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,949
and a funky thing here as some

130
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:31,020
if you look at the code like the name of
my database

131
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,529
its actual sequel coat so that's my
sequence action

132
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:39,010
but I'm setting up not back up the
database

133
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:44,110
on regular to a to a file on disk

134
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:51,110
and now it does all that just nice I
dropped the database

135
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:55,240
am so again here this is basically the
sequel

136
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,630
that's the name of my database right so
this is executed

137
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:02,560
SP at several member to actor Harry
sometime like at

138
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,900
try to make myself a sysadmin

139
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,630
open that backup file and now

140
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:14,150
in my acceptor Asus the cool stuff I
find my database name

141
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:18,330
in here and that ss1 buy it here

142
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:22,460
27 a change that 27

143
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:28,250
and Microsoft it's something really nice
here where they treat 7 specially

144
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:33,060
um knowing you restore that database

145
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:37,650
a.m. and his see the cast for rx7 so
that's basically

146
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:42,390
a character again to um

147
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:48,190
it actually was store search but it also
executes that's equal

148
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,760
so that's a sequel injection in that
restore function

149
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,160
and noms well

150
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:02,160
look I see a lot more use an answer
because I'm gonna say

151
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:07,160
and I look at my eventual exit a basin

152
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,190
I can get to that too so

153
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:16,430
this is probably the only vulnerability
that I'm aware of that was ever found in

154
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,870
Siebel Server 2008

155
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:21,820
and published Microsoft doesn't even
acknowledge it as a vulnerability they

156
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,020
say because you're

157
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:27,100
elevating from a privileged account to a
higher privileged account it's not a

158
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,330
vulnerability

159
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:32,570
at I don't really know why you know why
they

160
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:37,910
um why then they have those different
levels of travel a chance when it's not

161
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,900
a vulnerability to jump from one to
another

162
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:45,410
but to and oh-so

163
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:49,580
here's another one so this is a in
Sybase 15:07

164
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:56,580
yes the one so Kansas fixed in in the
latest patch

165
00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:01,390
in EST to kinda fixed it and then you
change to bite and

166
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:06,160
worked again

167
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,890
so setting up a attack user here

168
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:13,370
and the actually I have have it set up
already

169
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,930
issues up look at this user since James

170
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:22,150
and he really doesn't have any roles is
a very basic user

171
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,410
um now

172
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:28,650
I am is tempted be

173
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:32,850
as my database because I'm trying to
create table and a

174
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,930
getting that privilege in Tempe is a lot
easier than have an apt

175
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:39,470
in general on the database

176
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:44,100
and so here same thing so to write you
see

177
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,680
my table name as some sicko code in it

178
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,560
and I'll see coke 0 comments and 0 the S
a role in the SSL

179
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,200
over L role to James

180
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,800
and I create an index and again

181
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,060
I have that ok a single coat in there in
the name because that's the name of the

182
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,150
table that I'm creating in exon

183
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:10,460
and it does fail because Santa Ana some
really

184
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,460
weird tablename

185
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:17,580
but execute the sequel cut

186
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:21,310
and I'm so James

187
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:26,680
and look I'm gonna say it I so self

188
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,810
so this is so I'm

189
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:35,070
someone love it so how do we protect the
database a

190
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:39,370
from attacks like this it's a tough one
the flaws s

191
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:44,230
in the database called so

192
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,810
you really the only proper fix this you
need to patch a database and

193
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,500
in this gonna be my message throughout
this if you have a database

194
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,570
patch Pacha Pacha away the year like

195
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:00,220
probably an hour have the organization's
you working for their patch every six

196
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:00,990
months or

197
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:05,960
or less um meant minimize the attack
surface them

198
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,500
the more um

199
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,130
more features you have installed a new
database the more

200
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:16,460
likely there is a vulnerable function in
their

201
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,830
or some call it that swallow on

202
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:23,660
let me a privilege it's as as a really
important

203
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:27,100
thing um just like anywhere else

204
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,240
the less privileged as you have to
execute things

205
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,650
effectively have to create table
privilege in that last attack on

206
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:37,770
temp DB I couldn't execute it

207
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:41,870
um you can and monitor your database
activity

208
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:45,430
or look at your locks really make sure
you have

209
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:50,160
audit lock set up on a database on if

210
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,610
be aware of what kind of all abilities
are out there on databases the stuff

211
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:54,340
gets published

212
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,570
security focus on the place a san KNA

213
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,180
if you are aware of particular functions
that are vulnerable

214
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:05,880
go and other now but search our audit
lots for

215
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,650
them being called at least that way you
can

216
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,690
prevent the attack but you can find it
in

217
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:16,900
and react to it

218
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:21,810
user group religious ago as a sometimes
for similar to what we have

219
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:25,820
you know have in it. all the time and

220
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,920
yeah everybody think it's great and
nobody should have more privileges and

221
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,700
what they do to

222
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,950
need to do their best us a functions

223
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:37,150
um really

224
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:42,170
try to be aware of you know what users
can actually do and and

225
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,980
have policies in the organization and

226
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:52,690
make sure you on it your users
privileges on a regular basis and a

227
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:56,060
and minimize throw out users that are
not in the organization anymore things

228
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,530
like that

229
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:02,840
because a users can access that by a

230
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:07,080
I will by roles that are crafted to
roles and all that stuff the stuff isn't

231
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,350
easy

232
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:12,060
and then and other things after you
install a database default database

233
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,680
privileges

234
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,020
um data bases give a lot of privileges
at install time usually because they

235
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,390
want to make the customer

236
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:22,680
use features they want to make it easy
for them

237
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:27,500
so logo do here sir

238
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,540
we're gonna began to become a VBA right

239
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:37,040
and some anyone create session Wichita
Oracle database as everybody

240
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,640
an attack on an Oracle 11g r1 and this
is a

241
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,830
an attack in job I was up presented by
David Litchfield

242
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:50,010
its a two years ago what are the few
things where r

243
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:53,370
actually jump then released a patch
right away they didn't wait for a

244
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,930
critical patch update

245
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:59,770
so

246
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,820
so here that's just right so we lock
then where user one

247
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,850
and now

248
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:10,000
we're seeing now who can access all
files through Java

249
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,560
in Oracle and

250
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,170
nobody and they were trying to look a
city called

251
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:21,910
in touch on that ten-part the file

252
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:27,060
and we can't do it I so we don't have
the privileges for at the soccer at this

253
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,430
is the way it's supposed to be

254
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:34,500
and now let's try to a

255
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,610
see what we can do so yes we do we
create

256
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:42,470
a.m. a Java Virtual Machine access
control policy

257
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,560
and the with granting

258
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,940
lotta stuff

259
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,140
and here's the flaw in article they
actually

260
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,290
in in a default install if you look at
that

261
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:59,530
import JVM firms public has privileges
on that

262
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:03,370
everybody is part of public XO a

263
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:08,140
um even though I didn't have you know
couldn't do all that stuff I can just

264
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:13,860
everybody can grant themselves the
privilege to do this

265
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,910
so after that

266
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:21,939
I'll use 01 has set up come to Java
stuff and all files

267
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:26,620
and I can execute my my job opposite sex
and I can access my oil

268
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:30,240
my operating system and I to a I've been
touch

269
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,550
and back see

270
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:37,110
I'm running OS commence through Java on
that machine on

271
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,690
even I really have no problem just for
and

272
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:45,650
those OS commands basically now run in
the context of the Oracle user

273
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:48,990
a pretty privileged account

274
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:52,860
um

275
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:59,860
he asked by as well file that I created
through that touch command

276
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:06,060
nice thing s the bad guy s it's not a
lot of work for them to find these floss

277
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:10,130
Google and yes you haul exploit

278
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,810
and other you can even find a video

279
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:20,810
on up the backup website hit her if the
chills Sean the whole thing

280
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:25,100
so let's go through the best practices
again

281
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,820
so how do you defend yourself against
these things or try to do is

282
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:33,520
much as you can democrat permission so
use it directly

283
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,450
always through also group just makes it
a lot easier to manage them

284
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,740
um keep the roads for specific
Telecaster net too wide

285
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,860
um really think about

286
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:51,000
you know what kinda deferral chimney
rather create a couple more Olson

287
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,690
and manage them appropriately and on it
those role memberships

288
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:58,300
i think thats that's a really important
um

289
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:02,680
staying to to keep going through every
six months or whatever

290
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:07,730
you know as Joe really still need that
happen access

291
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,770
um public privileges and this is not
just an article but other databases have

292
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:12,840
the same problem

293
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,600
they they crammed a lot initially and we
see it a lot

294
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,590
in um it it's not an easy thing to do so

295
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:26,660
when we go and we we tell people you
know take the strip public privileges

296
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,700
away

297
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:32,560
or restrict them sometimes databases
break or certain functionality break so

298
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,070
it's not an easy thing to do you really
have to go and test applications make

299
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,690
sure they're still working

300
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:41,380
after you've done this its takes time
it's

301
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,860
it's a

302
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:49,000
its it's pretty hard problem solving its
different for every organization it's

303
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,290
not something like a

304
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,340
you know you just going to look for
everybody and

305
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,430
it works alright unnecessary enabled

306
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:00,770
a database features so when

307
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:04,100
when you install your database the
Venice one-up sell you of course to

308
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,500
everything they have right from their
space all to their little

309
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,840
CRM application or other things
reporting

310
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,800
that they sell with the database it's
the they cannot charge you for

311
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,050
so make sure after you install

312
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,150
if you don't need a feature get rid of
it because

313
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:25,570
these features are exploitable usually
java is a great one

314
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:31,210
a.m. are becomes a job outside his
comfort Java

315
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:35,650
and and other databases have similar
mechanisms to

316
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:40,770
to call OS commands or to advance stuff

317
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:45,370
so in this case for attacking us against
Cyprus 15:07

318
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:50,680
on Windows

319
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,720
for much a she

320
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,770
you don't even need those two privileges

321
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:06,770
just copy and paste some a slight so yes
yes I use either for creating

322
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,110
he's a little the allowable creating
what's the deal I'll be wanna call but

323
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:12,300
because call anything else

324
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:17,540
on was just an example so

325
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,920
basically you what it comes down to is
spend

326
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,160
in this job I exploit when you load the
DLL

327
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:29,020
or we can load at the lower right and so
if we're up right the deal properly

328
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:33,300
um it can execute anything it's not just
for my but you could

329
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,340
do other stuff in there too

330
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,750
now you say okay I have to get that deal
on the system

331
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,820
that you can actually even call about
path

332
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:49,100
so that but you don't even have to have
it on that system

333
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:54,120
me alright so here we tried a lot that
the lol

334
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,190
and well doesn't work

335
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,720
which is good

336
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,080
now this is a little more advances it's
using reflection job on

337
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,910
again it's a it's a it's a flaw that
sideways hat

338
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:13,110
initially it was it a little easier to
exploit then

339
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:20,110
site is fixed at then we had to do this
and now they fix that to

340
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:25,110
but the FSA it's a bunch of Java class
us

341
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:28,809
and

342
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:31,980
because I to August this we have
reflection code

343
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,190
I suddenly Khanna

344
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:39,150
Akamai select louts evil DL and

345
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:46,150
it just does it it worked fine

346
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,700
some minimizer attack surface right so
in a

347
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,980
in Siebel Server XP command shell as is
really a

348
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:01,330
very common thing recent version starred
in a blip but the following more but

349
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,480
although versus use to have it and still

350
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,690
if you go on the weapon you look at like
sickle server

351
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:12,320
%uh forums and one of the first things
the secular somebody asks

352
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,340
how can execute to OS commands from my
seat scripts are really want that as

353
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,580
feature for my

354
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:24,220
cool app that I'm writing and see and
and sequel and a

355
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:27,950
everybody will answer out just enable XP
command shell and use it

356
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:34,950
year really um you just open yourself up
to a whole lotta pain

357
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:41,830
basically you making Packers live super
super easy when you do that

358
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:46,650
um and especially other ones all EDP ad
hoc query or processes of

359
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:50,840
a a function in sickle sorrow that lets
you

360
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,800
'we're other databases and kinda break
security quite a bit

361
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,809
um in db2 that piñata

362
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:02,670
it has a create offense feature

363
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:07,470
that usually when you when france things
in db2 you really

364
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:12,240
but some layers and what people can do
and

365
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,640
I enabling this feature you make your
app development a little easier

366
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,010
but you really hurt security on and
everything

367
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:24,050
add-on modules that come with that %uh
basis

368
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:27,360
article has a special feature and his
sis

369
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,390
um if you if you look for article and
vulnerabilities

370
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:36,000
you will probably see that 30 percent of
those

371
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,120
us sequence actions and Oracle go
through MT sis

372
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,120
functions if you don't use it if you
don't need special stuff

373
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:48,410
just kick it out uninstall it

374
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:51,620
as a new feature called locator that
sort of a subset

375
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:56,160
that's a a a lot more a past and for
most people that'll work

376
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,350
on Java as I just to the

377
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:03,960
the exploit and Sybase an are a class
Java

378
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,650
it's a great tool for access to to get
in there and have fun

379
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,650
arco Enterprise Manager Grid Control
this

380
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:16,420
it's a pretty cool tool if you wanna
administer your databases

381
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:20,160
um its a web app

382
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,540
its full sequence action calls

383
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:27,140
so if you're if you're using it really
make sure

384
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:31,559
you patch Pacha Pacha everytime article
release a CPO

385
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:35,170
own patch that thing um

386
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:40,309
sequel server itself Microsoft has been
really great security

387
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:44,010
but some other at on things like
reporting

388
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:47,880
they're using you ideal else that a part
of the law

389
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,640
OS and people find vulnerabilities in
the house all the time

390
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,990
so again you don't need it turn it off

391
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:01,230
um a configuration management for when

392
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:04,650
database first came out right they were
great you install the little things you

393
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,520
say okay here's my area

394
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,500
instance name and here's why I put my
data files and that was it

395
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,790
um now we have so many features and

396
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:17,809
an add-on modules security settings and

397
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:22,160
what not relieve really

398
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,420
take the time when you install a
database or if you create

399
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:29,470
um it's a bit like a template for your
organization with data bases should look

400
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,390
like

401
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:33,660
go and look at there are so many
standouts out there

402
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,920
a.m. that

403
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:41,309
tell you how to harden your database
asan and what configurations

404
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:44,860
are good security configurations and
which ones are not

405
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:48,900
um look around find them find the ones
that apply to your industry

406
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:53,370
of its PCI or effect working for the
government and unita

407
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:58,070
CIS kinda stuff well as a seat US
government

408
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:01,900
um this estate this another one

409
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:05,120
there so no a very specific in a very
good detail on

410
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,800
on how to configure that and what to
avoid which pitfalls

411
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,200
um and then when you create those
configurations

412
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,140
try to create a baseline or snapshot and
compare that

413
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,540
every in a audit at and look at it every

414
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:26,640
couple months and make sure not some PBA
went in there was a

415
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:33,640
everyone X become an shell being I
enable it

416
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:39,799
so what are looking at and in a typical
stuff is so

417
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:44,410
in in db2 we can trust all accounts
sudden our clients

418
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:47,910
well that means any db2

419
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:52,740
client has full trust even

420
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,790
you have no idea where it's coming from
or on

421
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:59,140
in Sybase you think you can figure out a
day

422
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:02,170
and use it um said it tool

423
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:05,549
delete the lock file a.m. after

424
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:09,809
or the audit file when it's full or you
only have two

425
00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:13,030
but perhaps a dozen and they want to

426
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:17,929
XL project data then in order to look
for a sec tracks all that

427
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:22,299
have to do is write a lot a lot entrance
that our inocula suddenly flush out the

428
00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:23,799
locks

429
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:29,340
I'm think about those things when you
configure them

430
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:33,100
so here's another one this this is over
a fun attack

431
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:37,320
that to article sort of released by
accident

432
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,750
stay a

433
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:44,400
they've released a critical patch update
and I think this is April last year

434
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,790
and they Credit Act researcher called
Jackson Kara

435
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:52,640
and they credit him credit him as
security in

436
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,559
Dept contributor which is somebody who

437
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,970
mate the product long-term better and he
kinda mistook that it was a

438
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:04,740
how they finally fixed that flaw that I
every port at

439
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,630
it way back like four years ago and

440
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:13,140
any start at tweeting about it and wrote
a blog post and

441
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,750
release the proof-of-concept code and
then the

442
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:22,100
arm came back was like nah nah nah we
didn't really fix that in this critical

443
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,480
patch update

444
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:28,620
which escape your credit because gonna
fix at an article 12 for some

445
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:32,490
I and

446
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:35,820
10 warehouses attack go so

447
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:39,450
in an article your client site

448
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:43,990
little man there you have the listener
and expect client connects to the

449
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,030
listener and the listener

450
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:49,690
tells gives an IP address and port
number and says you know

451
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:53,130
talk to the state a base now

452
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:56,790
um in the CS place attack

453
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:00,640
you create a proxy and

454
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,910
it costs the listener kind except

455
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:07,750
Aug find out you know requests

456
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:11,340
you just say hey I'm that Oracle
Database to the listener

457
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:15,220
and from now on um that listener will

458
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:19,170
redirect the traffic to you instead of
straight to the database

459
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:23,410
bank in the middle you can see what you
want to do in a can

460
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:27,090
get all the info you you can actually to
commence on the database because the

461
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:31,330
database and now it's not your client
anymore

462
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:37,010
um iight so here s ninety is our target
database on

463
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:42,070
a 193

464
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:45,490
and we connect to it

465
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:50,500
and now we make a connection to that
target database

466
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,230
um EPA my treat some sensitive data

467
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:57,630
and sis user skits and password hashes

468
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,960
now what he does be write this little
proxy in Python

469
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:07,840
and you can find this well in that
Jackson spock post

470
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,250
so you start the proxy with that IP
address

471
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:17,700
and we register it so basically be send
a packet of data

472
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:22,010
to that listener because seles the
protocols pretty well

473
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:26,380
and the less noble and say of here's my
database I'm gonna send to traffic from

474
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,330
now on

475
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:34,470
and so we connect to the database again

476
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:37,510
we do our we are sensitive data

477
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:41,510
and this is basically what that level
Python scripts are

478
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:45,960
it's not cease that on encrypt the
traffic between

479
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,320
a client and that database and so

480
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,970
up there you see a our name

481
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:56,340
iIRC call that we call them this yes
that

482
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:02,220
the hatch for the password

483
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:06,330
and this isn't easy configuration fix

484
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:10,980
a.m. really all you have to do is secret
you turn off dynamic registration on the

485
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,780
listener

486
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:15,179
so that little python script and just go
and say hey

487
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:18,370
here simply traffic

488
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:21,919
um and then only allow secure
connections so

489
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,929
you can't just look at the TCP traffic
anymore

490
00:32:24,929 --> 00:32:28,120
for rack clusters what article that
after they were like books

491
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,960
he made a mistake um they

492
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,309
and they've basically now give away a
feature for free that enables

493
00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:38,660
SSL for listener

494
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:42,549
authentication this used to be a

495
00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:47,540
an add-on feature check to pay for

496
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:51,110
tell yet simple configuration changes
sometimes what really help you fix your

497
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,169
database and

498
00:32:52,169 --> 00:32:58,960
that stuff you need to be aware of

499
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,299
yesterday at I was and I don't feature
you paid for

500
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:05,870
whatever some ridiculous article price
for it

501
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:09,090
um her buffer overflows Center again

502
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:12,530
with a spare some other I'll same a
citizen programs

503
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:15,630
or operating systems

504
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:19,910
um simple buffer overflows we can crash
a server advanced buffer overflows you

505
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:21,330
can actually

506
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:26,169
execute our own called on

507
00:33:26,169 --> 00:33:31,919
we wanna fix this we need to fix from
the database when

508
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,380
there's really very little you can do to
protect yourself any other way

509
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:38,950
you can going yes I guess you could
audit

510
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:42,650
um certain commands that are susceptible

511
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:49,320
to to a prova flows but by then
databases stone already anyway

512
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:53,179
so in this case it's a TV 291 fix pack
it is a little bit although

513
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:57,490
attack but it's really simple n Easy

514
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:01,720
some nice services kinda small

515
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,600
but to so we have a are you someone

516
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:11,220
connect our database and his R siegel
cart

517
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:15,710
select repeat repeat 1/1000

518
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,849
some huge number so basically we create
the South

519
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:24,089
between low within the loop from society
and system me

520
00:34:24,089 --> 00:34:27,179
and we run this

521
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:31,059
don't really need any privileges for its
for supplies sequel

522
00:34:31,059 --> 00:34:34,720
home and now books

523
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,229
you to service terminate and services
how easy

524
00:34:38,229 --> 00:34:41,389
it used to be to crash a db2 database

525
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:44,889
likely effects again

526
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:48,099
you know a chronicle and

527
00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:52,049
we find color right there very first

528
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:58,319
entry select repeat repeat

529
00:34:58,319 --> 00:35:02,049
privilege escalation and of course it's
basically a

530
00:35:02,049 --> 00:35:05,089
similar to what we've had before

531
00:35:05,089 --> 00:35:10,970
low prevalence users becoming the VA's
let the call of pretty much any attack

532
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:15,059
um again we need when they're

533
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:19,180
fix s to fix those things but at least

534
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:23,369
the if we go in we monitor our database
traffic and we look at our audit locks

535
00:35:23,369 --> 00:35:26,489
10 going at least try to find out

536
00:35:26,489 --> 00:35:29,849
know if somebody's exploiting these
things actively

537
00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:33,769
a.m. arc 11g release 2

538
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:37,269
um create a procedure a and

539
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:41,640
execute an MD says reset in truck in
excite so there's one of those famous a

540
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:48,410
and his sis special issues

541
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:53,309
this one's a little hard as actually a
fun attacks or to execute

542
00:35:53,309 --> 00:35:57,809
so when you set this up %uh you create a
procedure

543
00:35:57,809 --> 00:36:01,710
and in that procedure you ground
yourself the privilege issue on so if

544
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,269
TBA privileges

545
00:36:03,269 --> 00:36:08,670
you create a function the contents call
to create a trigger

546
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:12,380
in the system schema and that trigger
calls

547
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:15,579
my that procedure you created before my
prop

548
00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:19,940
to exploit the vulnerability what you
need to do is eat a casa MD sass to run

549
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,619
that's

550
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:24,099
my function creates the trigger

551
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:27,650
and then you up basically you trigger
the trigger

552
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:31,170
isn't only public privileges by running
a sequel statement that

553
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:34,519
well causes a trigger to fire um

554
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:39,180
and then the trick I called swype rock
and it does that with Sis TBA privileges

555
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:42,910
or the MT sis privileges which are
equivalent and a

556
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:49,900
Kratz you EVA so

557
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,920
so we create our replace strike this is
the procedure to recreate

558
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,319
and that procedure assess grant EPA to
use our one

559
00:36:57,319 --> 00:37:02,579
that's the fun part that's what we want
um

560
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:06,579
and weak grant execute to our Proctor
public because swell

561
00:37:06,579 --> 00:37:10,349
we want everybody to be able to execute
that one

562
00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:14,410
um now

563
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:20,059
up we create that function that creates
the trigger

564
00:37:20,059 --> 00:37:24,380
so if you look up here execute immediate
create or replace trigger

565
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:29,069
system trigger and an electric as:

566
00:37:29,069 --> 00:37:36,069
before and in certain system I'll dollar

567
00:37:37,999 --> 00:37:44,999
and chronic secure to public to the
function public

568
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:49,890
so to run the the expired right

569
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:56,049
we're taken a batch again if a sequel
injection in every seven Prock index

570
00:37:56,049 --> 00:38:01,789
and so we do T three quotes a few
victories single quotes

571
00:38:01,789 --> 00:38:06,039
that's always kind of hint that there
might be some sick which actually on

572
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:09,420
um that's over

573
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,640
calling or user one my function this is
the exploit that

574
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,890
Casas and his sis to run function

575
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:21,390
to create the trigger so we have the
trigger created

576
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:25,460
with style not d/b/a

577
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,549
on back now we insert

578
00:38:28,549 --> 00:38:32,450
into that system I'll dollar table

579
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:36,019
and that will trigger the trader fire
the trader

580
00:38:36,019 --> 00:38:40,450
which will then call the function to
craft a TBA

581
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:45,569
and sure enough stuff in session roles

582
00:38:45,569 --> 00:38:51,940
I'm at the Vienna

583
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:58,789
again Google of rent really like oh

584
00:38:58,789 --> 00:39:03,170
so how do you protect yourself against
these attacks typically

585
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:06,950
and you see this the slide is basically
the same one that I had before for a lot

586
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,819
of other stuff

587
00:39:08,819 --> 00:39:12,819
their weaknesses in the in the database
and the setup is a complex so there will

588
00:39:12,819 --> 00:39:14,739
be more of them

589
00:39:14,739 --> 00:39:18,059
so whenever a vendor release a patch

590
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:22,220
going up that your database a stone
weight do it now

591
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:25,609
um and now it's it's expensive for the
business

592
00:39:25,609 --> 00:39:29,859
this is a stone like to update the
database and sometimes even US

593
00:39:29,859 --> 00:39:34,710
you are business application vendor
might hold you back now SAP might say

594
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:38,960
well we r Anna we are certifying against

595
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,279
Oracle 11gr2 with critical patch update
from 2010

596
00:39:43,279 --> 00:39:47,160
we have already tried it and in the
world's

597
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:52,930
um minimize your taxes surfers stuck in
this case

598
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:58,039
not having space of you couldn't execute
this attack

599
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:02,329
or us a limit privilege just if you
don't have

600
00:40:02,329 --> 00:40:06,729
create procedure you can execute this
attack

601
00:40:06,729 --> 00:40:10,489
if you know about attacks go look at
your audit lockstitch

602
00:40:10,489 --> 00:40:13,749
see if those functions have been called
anywhere or

603
00:40:13,749 --> 00:40:20,160
have you know to actively monitor SS

604
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,529
so not patching a database

605
00:40:23,529 --> 00:40:27,140
is probably one of the worst things you
can do

606
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:31,579
if a for vendor release a patch

607
00:40:31,579 --> 00:40:35,539
it takes the bad guys maybe a day or two

608
00:40:35,539 --> 00:40:39,380
took a reverse engineer it and figure
out but the band affects

609
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:43,690
on we do the same thing with when we
write

610
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:48,619
our signatures to to um detect attacks

611
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:52,130
article doesn't give %uh any information
week I'll we take this

612
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:56,509
the CPU reverse engineer it and it's not
that hard

613
00:40:56,509 --> 00:41:00,089
I mean it's basically a bunch of civil
code and scripts

614
00:41:00,089 --> 00:41:07,089
and and then be no what they fix them
but they changed

615
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:11,890
now what are your patch first of course
a patch a critical

616
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:16,430
systems first because that's where the
juicy de tus

617
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:20,940
at the same time it's really hard to do
because

618
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,890
you don't want to interrupt your
business process right now in order to

619
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:27,289
patch the database you might have to
take it offline

620
00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:31,180
the you have to maybe to some testing
first because you don't wanna

621
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:35,569
type action and it breaks the database

622
00:41:35,569 --> 00:41:39,369
good thing with that at least s that the
vendors have gotten

623
00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:45,029
a lot better in testing their patch is
actually in making sure

624
00:41:45,029 --> 00:41:48,749
that they don't break functionality
they've really just fix

625
00:41:48,749 --> 00:41:52,099
issues

626
00:41:52,099 --> 00:41:58,680
that so even if the new critical systems
don't forget your lower risk systems

627
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:02,809
an unpatched sequel server is a great
way to break into your organization's

628
00:42:02,809 --> 00:42:04,469
network

629
00:42:04,469 --> 00:42:08,660
on someone like that teacher TJ Maxx
attacks that

630
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:12,690
upper Gonzalez that she found

631
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:16,859
some all the band sequel server on the
network and he use XP command shell

632
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:19,979
and from there this is how he executed
all the stuff

633
00:42:19,979 --> 00:42:26,670
and that was all single server that ran
basically as a system privilege process

634
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:29,809
was a great jumping in part for

635
00:42:29,809 --> 00:42:33,660
so you're even if you think of assault
database I don't do anything but that

636
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,729
anymore

637
00:42:34,729 --> 00:42:39,479
turn it off if you don't do anything
with it anymore or patch

638
00:42:39,479 --> 00:42:44,069
a.m. know what's vulnerable really
really

639
00:42:44,069 --> 00:42:48,900
know which databases you have in your
organization I think so many companies

640
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,079
have no idea how many databases say half

641
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,890
they yeah they think about the couple
big ones other behind me ASAP in the

642
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:56,829
world this one

643
00:42:56,829 --> 00:43:00,700
that um how many

644
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:05,130
Siebel Server Express gets installed by
so much tougher

645
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:08,759
it's just pretty much everywhere and
often enough it's a very protect that

646
00:43:08,759 --> 00:43:09,900
and

647
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:14,200
skill attacker can find that instills
even that might have an obscure name

648
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:19,640
and a spider

649
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:25,579
last thing I S the data in your database

650
00:43:25,579 --> 00:43:29,170
if you can try to encrypt that it's
sometimes a limitation that everybody

651
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:30,680
can do it

652
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:34,029
um encrypt a file system have the

653
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:38,640
data not written in plain text because
otherwise

654
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,059
somehow people get access to the state
of files and they can

655
00:43:42,059 --> 00:43:45,890
reverse engineer a great tools out there
now from

656
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:49,599
third-party vendors or from the database
vendors that let you do

657
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,779
transparent data encryption they can
beat gonna

658
00:43:52,779 --> 00:43:57,069
column level on a roll level as a
there's a lot of neat stuff out there

659
00:43:57,069 --> 00:44:01,339
um educate yourself see what's available
and now

660
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:05,849
use that if it makes sense and another
thing state-owned motion so when your

661
00:44:05,849 --> 00:44:08,089
client connects to your database

662
00:44:08,089 --> 00:44:12,430
so many clients by default use on
encrypt the protocols

663
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:16,630
sybase by default no encryption
passports cochlear tax

664
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:20,390
but why um

665
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:24,900
so make sure as you set those little
options

666
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:28,789
in your applications when they connect
to the database use encryption

667
00:44:28,789 --> 00:44:31,849
is SSL or go over a VPN

668
00:44:31,849 --> 00:44:35,009
or anything like that an um

669
00:44:35,009 --> 00:44:38,690
you can see on team shot as a website
that we have

670
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:42,819
that's our research only website and
we'll have some white paper stare

671
00:44:42,819 --> 00:44:46,309
that reason explain that stuff in more
detail in

672
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:51,349
how you can configure your databases
accordingly

673
00:44:51,349 --> 00:44:56,109
scandia well

674
00:44:56,109 --> 00:45:00,269
you know don't be scared or be scared
but do something

675
00:45:00,269 --> 00:45:03,799
worst thing you can do is simply not do
anything and

676
00:45:03,799 --> 00:45:08,609
that's really my my pic happy face that
I think they have a security is just

677
00:45:08,609 --> 00:45:10,349
very very under-represented

678
00:45:10,349 --> 00:45:15,269
in this industry

679
00:45:15,269 --> 00:45:19,229
relying on car for a protection

680
00:45:19,229 --> 00:45:22,440
I don't think it really works because
the bad guys will be in your

681
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,700
organization if they want to be in your
organization in your network

682
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:30,150
I'll Sony

683
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:35,509
also Archuleta that's how they got
PlayStation Network

684
00:45:35,509 --> 00:45:39,339
they just cleaned up their article
databases had an unpatched Oracle

685
00:45:39,339 --> 00:45:40,859
databases

686
00:45:40,859 --> 00:45:44,940
absolute Ste similar I mean it's just

687
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:50,269
um

688
00:45:50,269 --> 00:45:55,420
yeah doctor Gonzalez a tax write the use
a single server on now

689
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:58,779
who's responsible for data security in
an organization

690
00:45:58,779 --> 00:46:04,229
do you know that are you aware of that
is it just a function of

691
00:46:04,229 --> 00:46:08,769
the DBAs because the DBS Volante to
security unless you really really step

692
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:11,099
on their toes

693
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:14,869
um security is a hassle for them they
don't like it

694
00:46:14,869 --> 00:46:19,150
makes their heart a lot at the life a
lot harder

695
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:22,450
so the data oh nice

696
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:27,430
I think should being out with the CSI
does so are clever people

697
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:30,640
they should make sure database security
s

698
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:36,630
is a priority and that you're really
aware what's going on in your databases

699
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:41,910
so trent this acts like a couple credits
here these other people

700
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:45,650
that to found all these exploits that I
just mr Teo

701
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:49,249
David Litchfield he is to MN outscoring
burst

702
00:46:49,249 --> 00:46:53,829
every day at the really really big names
in Article security

703
00:46:53,829 --> 00:46:58,349
um s pine martens 500

704
00:46:58,349 --> 00:47:01,609
some luckily he works from a team he's
sir fun

705
00:47:01,609 --> 00:47:05,019
over a hundred vulnerabilities and
Oracle reported to them that they have

706
00:47:05,019 --> 00:47:06,089
fixed

707
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:09,660
but rachmaninoff some

708
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:14,170
greats a single server a security
researcher he founded a showing of

709
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:19,989
in 2008 and he found a bunch of the
Sybase things such as Sharjah

710
00:47:19,989 --> 00:47:24,559
afghani like a rough had one of those
are quite exploits and

711
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:30,410
Jackson car as he hoped that TS poison
attack

712
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:34,999
and spent a reference I so if you look
at the slight 78 on autumn

713
00:47:34,999 --> 00:47:39,650
from the true purse website

714
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:43,190
we have you know there's a lot more
information about it

715
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:47,289
more detail same for vulnerability
disclosures

716
00:47:47,289 --> 00:47:51,170
um if you don't do this on a regular
basis not just for databases but for

717
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:53,809
other stuff go to security focus

718
00:47:53,809 --> 00:47:57,359
go to the CE website or the NPD website

719
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:01,959
am and basically search for
vulnerabilities against the products

720
00:48:01,959 --> 00:48:04,140
that you have in your organization

721
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:07,779
and be aware what's up there and a

722
00:48:07,779 --> 00:48:13,029
what you need to patch and how severe
officials

723
00:48:13,029 --> 00:48:15,650
for me thank you so much Press
