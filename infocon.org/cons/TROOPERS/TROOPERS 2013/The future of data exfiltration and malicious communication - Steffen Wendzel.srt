1
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,470
okay well come to my talk I'm just a
short introduction

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,800
um this is more an academic talk talk

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,330
I'm a PhD students and Hotmail and some

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,570
I focus on covert channels and such and
those

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,350
in that computer networks since about
some 2,000

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,670
ace a also brought my diploma in my must
see this on this topic

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,109
and I'm Marie such an ox book on I wrote
several

8
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:34,220
books we got home in the context of the
Knicks

9
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,809
and some one also s mentions

10
00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:42,399
about covert channels I have

11
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,410
I have to protectionists for the stalk

12
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,660
the first one this on

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,780
that smell were the future lol will be

14
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,469
much more stealthy at adept if than it
is

15
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,570
nowadays from you will learn what I mean

16
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:03,930
with small stuff Ian's adaptive at the
second prediction this

17
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,430
that we will find new ways to experts
hurt data

18
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:11,170
a split the stalker and

19
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:15,410
three sections on first to give you some
background information on

20
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,880
about covert channel votes um the
detection

21
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,509
prevention imitation of covert channels
and afterwards I will

22
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:26,330
um go into detail to um

23
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,849
for novel approaches in the area of
network of channels

24
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:32,869
because what we have now and and and the
research area

25
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:36,740
will come into practice within the next
yes and some

26
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,380
it is much more advanced than the old
courthouse where

27
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,420
so what's what do we need it

28
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,069
to creates mal well

29
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:54,099
or a safe communication for John assists
and an OPS of networks

30
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:58,200
on we needs a very very stealthy

31
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,869
communication and therefore our
communication should rice

32
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:07,500
few attention as possible if our
communication rice attention

33
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,670
maybe it's on the list a detect its
maybe get sent to jail

34
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,909
or on OS detectives and is maybe

35
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:18,049
maybe the weather will be blocked off to
what's so

36
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:24,860
this is what we does all main
requirements

37
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,000
on but what what what that we already
have an area of covert channels

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,950
on arrest hundreds of papers about it
and

39
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,950
basically we have three different
techniques for

40
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,099
for establishing a poco a chance first
one

41
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:42,480
is to use packets timings so we

42
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,870
with we um modified to in to pick up
gaps

43
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,510
sometimes also called into arrival times
between network packets

44
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,939
at & Co to the hidden information and
the timing debt us between that for pets

45
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:56,959
network packets this is already a

46
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,329
an approach from the lates 80s I think
nineteen

47
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:03,859
87 by by going over with

48
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:07,999
and we also can modify the picket order
for instance the

49
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:11,819
tipi di I we can sent in all the traffic

50
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:15,790
IP ninety one to Sri and so on but you
could also stuck with it. sry

51
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,530
and I D one and I to to the following
I'm

52
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,060
and using just or manipulated or a week
can encode hidden information

53
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,799
only understood by the receiver of the
hidden message

54
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:32,129
because some for quite generous sender
and receiver have to create

55
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:36,689
I'll common and coding of the hidden
message in advance

56
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:40,019
and of course we can on

57
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:43,379
puts hidden data in so many fields of

58
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:47,290
from IP of TCP ice MPs on their soul

59
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,379
many approaches available and we can do
this

60
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:56,459
since HS but even notice new tools come
up and do the same and the show

61
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,069
hey we can Heights in some out a new
protocol we can

62
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:03,090
height States and South 2nd so on but
that's that's actually quite

63
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,120
barring and it's not new and tits its
causes and remedies and we can detect

64
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,069
it's at least 50 cents fury

65
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:12,219
so on

66
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:16,340
what we have available to us we have to
basically

67
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,060
crap date the hiding capabilities are
very

68
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,160
from from a research perspective because
anomalies we can detect its

69
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,949
for instance there's want with I forgot
the name the tights they to like this

70
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:32,330
a you have to input from a did the
diversion number in HDPE

71
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,870
is used to encode state information
everybody can detect its

72
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,949
walking to know uses some a messy fight

73
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:42,720
if you know the magic but you can detect
think on it so it's it's its use this

74
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,889
its its knots not use this

75
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:49,650
you can use it to bypass a firewall that
blocks your protocol and

76
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,370
if you can do so I simply to bypass the
firewall it's good

77
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:58,470
but if you want to keep a low profile
you can forgot it's it's it's it's a

78
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,729
its use this so on

79
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:06,660
what what I would talk about now are
very all its

80
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,229
research some arm

81
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:13,539
techniques or techniques to um

82
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:16,729
to detect covert channels I

83
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:20,720
select its especially all techniques to
show you that we can't do this

84
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,030
detection mean since HS I'll come out I
was the first to introduce

85
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,550
an approach that's called Chad resource
metrics on this but it's

86
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:33,449
%uh operations %uh and and some
operations with individual operations

87
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:34,250
and

88
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,400
a try to figure out weather and
attributes can be

89
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,449
rex & Modifieds because folk what
channel you need to modify

90
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:44,560
I E two cents traffic and tour restrict

91
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,650
a to recognize the modification that's
the part the core channel receiver has

92
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:49,430
to do

93
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,910
saw in the stable you can on show logic
and you can

94
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,660
try to finds a possible way to
communicate using

95
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,870
operations Avaya a among folk what
channel using the

96
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,509
shows attributes actually this is not
original resource

97
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:09,430
a shout resource metrics meet although
dole archie

98
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,610
at some

99
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:14,750
it's an extended version from my cock on
developed and 95

100
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:19,150
but based on the original Russia on

101
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,590
later in +91 also can come up but

102
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,780
together for us they introduced um

103
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,670
means caught court float Reese using
Cover Flow trees

104
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:33,160
on access code is checked out a
medically again

105
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,450
a metric system goats thats a show issue
which

106
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:40,370
um attributes s refer 25 for returned

107
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:44,200
by which function and the good thing is

108
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,410
using this approach can even um
recognized indirect covert channels

109
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,690
the pictures of from from the government
shop um

110
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:55,160
so you you select an attribute for
instance lot and you know you have to

111
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,880
modify it

112
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,240
you have to recognize the modification
and you build a tree

113
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,350
with the with them um possible waz

114
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,760
of communication using the functions um

115
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,790
this just to get you know if you
actually to approach is a little bit

116
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,090
more complicated but

117
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,680
butts a just want to give you an idea um

118
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,860
they so several other approaches

119
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,270
came up like to Palm on

120
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:25,620
one way things blind right up store info
a protocol and such things

121
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,050
on the basic idea always same

122
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,210
we have no system 0 I

123
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:36,960
you with the low-security lever on the
high system with a higher security level

124
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,040
and develop a tu llamada I'm you
probably know it's

125
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,510
of orbits on some kind of communication
on Wed

126
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:49,330
low system on gets information from from
the high system

127
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:56,330
so on we have two prevents at the height

128
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,640
um

129
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,330
a okay clicking here

130
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,660
um the up to the high system

131
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,860
is forbidden to communicate to write on
information to those system

132
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,700
that's that that's the purpose of all
these approaches

133
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:19,570
and some win in between we usually have
a buffer

134
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:22,210
that prevents um

135
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:27,390
I i'm a general technology if that that
prevents the right on up to information

136
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,590
usually we only allow acknowledgement
message this

137
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:35,380
to be set sent down to the no system and
even these acknowledgement that

138
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,729
messages because they could built a
covert timing channels

139
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:42,599
based on the number of acknowledgement
message just per

140
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:47,030
time slice even this number of
acknowledgment message is this limit its

141
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,230
by the pump it's a device developed by
the nava

142
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,810
nava on research it up and some

143
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:58,030
it prevents what its it doesn't prevent
covert channels but it limits the

144
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,030
channel capacity

145
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:03,930
we also have this since nineteen
eighties sry I think it's developed by

146
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:04,620
by Kong

147
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,360
and moscowitz and its

148
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,180
um a mom recent approach

149
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,250
I'll but actually also a

150
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:20,290
from the from the on 90s late 90s

151
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,820
a traffic normalize a stay they are they
went up to signs to

152
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,050
um to prevent covert channel
communication

153
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:30,110
thoughts they are very efficient

154
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:35,580
for covert channel prevention nobody
nobody is aware of the fact but some

155
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,320
actually they are very very useful
because they clear unify

156
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,510
modify redundant had a area us unused
area us

157
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,880
aware usually placed our hidden
information into

158
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,900
now so if we hype data in

159
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,959
and the result lack of the IP header
these young nom less clear its most

160
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,460
normal as can do with its a

161
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:59,339
thinks not normalize opened his TPF
scrapping it did they can do that

162
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:03,790
um I'm there are some problems so with
its

163
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,180
love like the court stuff problem
normalize the bootstraps

164
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:11,140
see some X not as a some excess think
he's a few connections

165
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:16,030
um but does not know anything about to
the handshake and so on and

166
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:20,030
and inconsistencies if the transmissions
what also

167
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,720
must be considered a problem because
some you can see it in the picture it's

168
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,610
from from a paper by Headley at all

169
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:30,050
%uh that took a sense what the pickets
with the same sequence number

170
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:34,390
I D S 10 Melisa its located between the
sender and the receiver

171
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:38,220
some pickets reach the destination
others know

172
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,390
do not a solo the IDS

173
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,530
is not aware of the off to rest of the
network topology

174
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,800
and so it cannot be to mind whether

175
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,570
um 1 pick it will arrive or not and so

176
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:56,980
what a mess just throw it on ice as some
hot sauce of

177
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,160
coach in a research note that too um

178
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,500
to up improvements up that idea 'cause
to network to wear active water

179
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,730
that was actually designed by a by
another PhD students

180
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:12,459
um to come to IP version 6 based covert
channels

181
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:15,810
so that that the new from approach this

182
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:19,480
that the normal as as a way of the
network topology and it with %uh

183
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,690
be able to um too much rum

184
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:27,709
to understand what a a pickup with a
given TT as we arrive

185
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:31,170
on not also

186
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,860
very also but we just recently applied
it's a kind of talk about the

187
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,130
because paper so if you but I'm there's
an approach 55 who

188
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:43,200
a a the I forgot to the first name

189
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,200
but but some his name is who H you

190
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,700
um from 1991 they already had what show

191
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:54,209
machines in the pics security Connor and
to them it's the channel capacity

192
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:58,070
of timing channels between devote to it
but %um machines

193
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:01,320
day at introduced posit timings

194
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,620
so the the real system I Hess

195
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,620
up at that the host system has much
about to real time

196
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,510
at which events ok or butts the virtual
machines

197
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:16,470
are not two fights with a slight the

198
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:20,560
%uh incorrect I'm so the secular
crustacean between the covert channel

199
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,130
send a

200
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:25,400
and receive a it's not operates what the
limits the coach and a capacity

201
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:30,150
and that in 1991 and that that's amazing
weekend

202
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,160
we can use all the salt approaches even
today

203
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,180
okay that are so many

204
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,970
other approaches but due to the a
limited amount of time I will not go

205
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,589
into detail about the other

206
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:45,920
approach s1 since we can um we can you
see 4.5

207
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,780
based a decision trees to detects covert
timing channels to detect protocol

208
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,829
channels

209
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:56,310
weekend evaluates bpm and a a business
process iz

210
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:00,730
by modifying a a by by transferring them
into some kind of

211
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,959
I'm Colored Petri nets and evaluating

212
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:07,270
difference I'll

213
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:10,660
circumstances so Boston but by research
group

214
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,470
off from University of high book I think
a

215
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:19,209
we can introduce spurious procesos
enough for us to computing base stats

216
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:23,930
I'm to stir up local channels an
operating system

217
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,940
arm we have statistical approaches

218
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:32,380
especially for network timing tryouts on
there are many statistical approaches

219
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,770
um we have qualifications and so on

220
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:39,949
II I wrote a book about it and I wrote
very very detailed about all these

221
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:43,380
things so I think it's even available
for download on some

222
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,430
shared web sites um pick you can
download it's a

223
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,860
as an altar you don't earn much money
with to book nevertheless but so if you

224
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,730
cite me i'm happy

225
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:57,320
okay

226
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,130
so in summary for his first part

227
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:04,790
on we have a lot of Texan techniques to
have messed up this covert channels

228
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,890
we have a lot of techniques to heights
to detect limits

229
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:11,310
and to prevent covert channels and most
of what we

230
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,900
already have is very or up to 30 years

231
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:19,880
actually called a chance where down
first introduced in 1973 so it's

232
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,570
its forty years okay

233
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:29,270
um not come today to the main part of
the day off to talk

234
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:33,329
this basically you some some extract of
my life PhD thesis

235
00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:37,570
ion ants um

236
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:41,250
I'm I'm not on a personal work working
in that area up

237
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,310
a few other people do as well

238
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,380
arm we have

239
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,540
so with give you a very short
introduction about a related work just

240
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,750
one slights

241
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,650
I'm with internal control for the course
we use did a hidden area of the coach

242
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:59,660
anna & introduce a protocol like a i
connect and network protocol had a

243
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,430
a Ramos was it that in 2008 and they
introduced to a

244
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,770
its protocol school realize some

245
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:10,010
reliability transaction-based a

246
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,520
a communication we have natural
selection a value

247
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,900
to evaluates on

248
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,200
I went up for the Colts acknowledged

249
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,160
on art and we view be talking dates
survival scores for protocols

250
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,230
to select the the most useful

251
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:32,120
network protocols for him communication
with adaptive covert communication Way

252
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,230
wash skin that are they on

253
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,530
if it's out non-root its a block

254
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:41,160
network for the court so let's say you
have a covert channel using ICMP

255
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,620
you block its and China not too far not
Isis that you broke

256
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,920
I simply can't switched to another for
the call so you change your firewall

257
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,720
configuration

258
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,870
but the coach and a chains as well and
then you have to book and find it again

259
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,940
that's that's that's that's pretty cool
an already done 2008's

260
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,990
on my

261
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:04,020
my research focus was on protocol pink
what channels

262
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,870
I

263
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,620
for a quote hoping coach and switch to
protocol

264
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:13,610
transparently for you so you do not
notice it I did that already in 2007

265
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:19,460
I'm and some so you have many the proper
because I some of them with

266
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:24,070
arrive so even if you block a subset of
its there are still remaining at this

267
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,560
still remaining said you can use for
communication

268
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,270
they have internal sequence number so if
some pickets

269
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:34,990
got lost all rocks your message will be
received nevertheless

270
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:40,080
on there's also a concept called for a
coach an ounce

271
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,390
at because I need Gulf um terms later I
was just explain

272
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:48,240
of approaches and a protocol China

273
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,970
you assign a bit where you to a protocol
so if you want to transfer that

274
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,040
a message 1 2011 and once

275
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,200
oneness transferred by autocrats of an
ICMP packets

276
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,880
and 0 are is based on YouTube P then use
enticing pupi simply ICMP

277
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,120
it's very basic idea but hot to to block

278
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:12,500
on and the protocol Chan on the other
hand it's

279
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,900
on who

280
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,060
s I independence a from the

281
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,990
use protocol so you can use every put a
call out but you high payload in it and

282
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:24,990
you put on my prof

283
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:29,700
control protocol in the covert channel
that takes care about some

284
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,870
the the right liability and so on you
can also use

285
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:37,400
up for instance error-correcting I R
error detecting coats your

286
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,860
for the proper channel butts I just want
to give you an overview

287
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,180
um so what what we can do now is

288
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:50,260
that we can bit coach an overlay
networks with different access points

289
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,690
at the Conexus the overlay network using
different protocols we use to heights

290
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,510
the data in

291
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:59,670
rights and some so we

292
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:04,160
being on at once called a chance weekend

293
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,430
s mention switch to protocol we have
adaptive communication if we have a

294
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,140
so-called

295
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:13,070
network environment running foss in and
Danielle

296
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:17,050
on PST to mind to saddam

297
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:20,830
possible communication options between
each other because

298
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:24,270
a clearly they do not know which
protocols they can use

299
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,630
or maybe to use different coach in the

300
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:31,610
software versions on something like that
so what's what I introduced

301
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:35,440
is um might control protocols with
Russian numbers with different protocol

302
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,220
sets

303
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,920
and that allows me I go back one step

304
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,290
for instance let's say I i upgraded this
part of the coach and overlay

305
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:48,400
with a new version and px associate with
a different version

306
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,440
but Dez to a system scan um to can

307
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,160
agree on one supported version of
protocols they can use

308
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,840
even if some protocols a blocked but
that's based on the web of

309
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,840
of your question is i because state that
that already early I just

310
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,950
improved it's because this actually a
two army problem within the

311
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:12,600
Ennio father on and its the

312
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,730
really cool stuff is that we can make
these internal control protocols

313
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:20,010
there is space efficient because if its
space officials

314
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,020
we need to transfer the testator what
rises

315
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,870
less attention each but we have to
transfer that can

316
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:32,490
can um the to the detection of talk
about china and that song called me with

317
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,360
we do not want

318
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,020
anybody to detect us and also

319
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,140
weekend to built a very dynamic head as
I will show you later

320
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:44,270
but first I I need to introduce to
terminology we developed

321
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:49,170
it's very very simple on down the line
for the call I think it's very easy to

322
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:51,980
understand its just a protocol be
utilized for the question

323
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,250
if we hide data and IP version 4 than on
the line

324
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,640
because I P pushing for in

325
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,560
this area we um in the protocol we'd
find up so-called core protocol area

326
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,640
a choice this time because it's conform
to information hiding

327
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,170
terminology to the existing terminology
on

328
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,310
for instance we use to TT at you with a
TS m2ts

329
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:17,910
like and I P and Dez three bits to get a
form the core protocol

330
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:21,370
at in the cove a protocol we

331
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:25,160
puts the micro because that's the coach
and the internal control protocol

332
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,510
it's called micro protocol because it's
tiny

333
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:33,540
only have a very limited space that this
is why the meet very space-efficient

334
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:38,180
up for a course because dis basis not
just for the Michael because also put up

335
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,900
a lot if you have on this rivets

336
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,210
you don't have much space for a protocol
and

337
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:46,750
if you also want to transfer payload you
have a problem so you

338
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,640
you to develop very tiny protocols

339
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,770
I'm one layer is usually in that case
not group

340
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:58,160
enough to provide enough space so we
combine multiple as:

341
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,620
21 pick up a protocol

342
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,640
of course depends on whether you need
routing or not so you

343
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,490
cannot probably not always use the
senate

344
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:12,660
this those really I really like that
slights

345
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,940
um because on

346
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:20,260
I wanted an approach to ensure that the
Cointreau Michael protocol rice's

347
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,770
as few attention as possible

348
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:27,860
and I was looking for for

349
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,970
technique to to ensure thats to Michael
protocol

350
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:35,650
conform to the to them utilize protocol

351
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,940
so desperate week we do not want to
violate the rule it soft on the line

352
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,060
protocol

353
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,960
the Michael protocol behavior within the
the utilized for the court must be

354
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,420
exactly at the same it should its

355
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:50,310
E you should not be able to distinguish
above protocols

356
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:56,710
so um II it took me long to get a good
idea I played around with pete King

357
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,530
thats and the

358
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:01,750
lotta lotta means that the answer for my
grandma what's the solution

359
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:05,210
I found it in Proceedings also from the
70s on

360
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:09,330
I they were not digital ice and I had to
order them by Ave Maria

361
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:13,630
Mayo not electronic I had to wait two
weeks and

362
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,710
though there was some approach by a I
think of hong

363
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,530
causal from nineteen 77 and he models

364
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:23,840
protocols using regular line
context-free grammar

365
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,110
and subdued and then which inclusion
test 22 test whether

366
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:31,100
for calls all conform and I applied that
approach

367
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,180
so on its divided into laos in six steps

368
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,350
and the first day we have two underlying
protocol

369
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:41,780
so we define the coop for the call in
the underlying protocol

370
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:46,600
and evaluate occurrence rates of the
pits after underlying protocol

371
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,970
and then we define the Michael protocol
ants evaluate our estimates

372
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:54,000
accordance with of the its within the
microparticle and MEP

373
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,280
both lists what we achieve as

374
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,200
thats the that is this nearly equally
like we're

375
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,390
for micro protocol bits to accord then a
bit with and on the line for the core

376
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:09,680
so it's it's hard to distinguish after
wats of protocol someone else

377
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,950
using um phonogram I would

378
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:16,900
we've with what are the whole behavior
you can connection dependence even a

379
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,360
ross

380
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:23,280
everson implementations justice I'm
dissipate butter IEEE year to a

381
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,330
a secure encrypted security and privacy
year

382
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:29,440
and in a few months and will be
presented data to saying but they

383
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,860
presented now

384
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:34,850
we present it it's already in September
but for protocol specific

385
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,990
I covert channels so they tits

386
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:41,740
agenda little bit more general for the
pics taken over a few

387
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:45,760
but we got no citation a what's what's

388
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,100
the I really don't like that but some

389
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,490
by ensuring that states our microphone
to cause a producers

390
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:57,010
the drama produce a sandwich subset of
two of the corpus just conditions given

391
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:00,110
we do not violate the rules of the
corporate to call

392
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:03,390
so we rice again on a very very few
attention

393
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:06,910
why I michael protocol is operating

394
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:10,780
and that I think that's really cool okay

395
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:15,080
and again at the next task was to shrink
the size

396
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,640
often after he of two

397
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,070
Michael protocols so again fought

398
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:25,140
what can I apps I and II a first

399
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,860
I always first look on a very old stuff
and I found

400
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:32,640
compressed slip that that's you do not
you know stuff

401
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,900
it's it's all that and PPP very oilsands
see slippers from The

402
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:42,080
effing from 1990 and I just combines
idea of IP version 6 saying

403
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,980
see slip um to status updates

404
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:51,770
um status updates arm

405
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:55,190
modify a connection based on

406
00:24:55,190 --> 00:25:00,550
and update of a status for instance if I
want to change the destination address

407
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:04,730
of my um coach and the connection I sent
a status update

408
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:09,470
but I only transferred to work once to
configure it hard to change it

409
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:12,510
I don't transfer to source or
destination address again so I say for

410
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,880
the space

411
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,520
I mean an accord China over there you'd
usually do not use IP addresses with

412
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,679
some so two trumpets

413
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:22,370
its it's so you don't have so much space
so you have

414
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:27,770
on your own address and um

415
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:32,030
all PS share a table of status updates
status update this combination of tough

416
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,220
to type and it's well you find since
here's a type from

417
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:39,730
01 a and two meanings to destination up
dress update and

418
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:42,840
um of well use followers

419
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:47,419
so at first do indicates the how to
interpret the value than the

420
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:50,700
follows the well like that's

421
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:55,450
um is a court in a proxy use a receive a
and I want the proxy 24 what's

422
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:58,910
um some payload ABC to the receiver

423
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:02,870
and therefore I set the destination
address using status updates

424
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:07,730
and that's it and after what's the proxy
for what's all the information

425
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:11,060
I can cents thousands of Paleo pickets

426
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:15,560
here without again that specifying the
destination address

427
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:20,210
and that dis approach to a that this
approach saves a lot of space

428
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:26,700
I can combine them to %uh sequences and
one pick up to if I have enough space

429
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:31,150
and its to show that it's really
efficient with reassigned already

430
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:35,000
efficient its bit Michael product caused
from Ray in this car

431
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,630
um I stooped to head out into

432
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:43,310
cause I headrests a the first thing you
said toup its type update its

433
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,740
I extract at the start and stop look for
the transection

434
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:52,100
to start and to to enter transaction
into and put it in a separate had a

435
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:56,210
so I only need to transfer 7 it's just a
fake tits

436
00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:00,410
in nearly all cases and a transaction
comprises at the

437
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,560
comprises at least 6 bet pickets

438
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,679
with Huffman coding forty oh you are 7

439
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:10,540
packets of North I think 6 pickets
without Huffman coding

440
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:14,300
I we on wall space officials however

441
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,590
it's not perfect because for initial
connection set-ups

442
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:20,610
when you transfer a lot of status
information we have overhead because

443
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:23,890
when you transfer to: you to type of
update will use

444
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:30,410
so %uh it need some it's not sufficient
for transactions with only a few pickets

445
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:33,720
but we can improve up

446
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,150
over the existing approaches and or
other case

447
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:42,360
ants um the rain this republic was
already very very special efficient if

448
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,919
you apply that to ping tana

449
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,880
you you are more space-efficient from
the first packet on

450
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,370
but thing to us very very space wasting

451
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:54,980
and not optimized on

452
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,990
okay I'm done um next

453
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:01,000
interesting thing us um I was okay I'm
not

454
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,060
got so the masa students who a

455
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,510
um uptight the status updates approach

456
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:12,310
to build dynamic routing in the coach an
overlay network

457
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:16,340
he discovered um thats um coach an
overlay networks

458
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:20,400
I like that of networks at hoc networks
because

459
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:25,800
up our on the live network topology can
change at any time we cannot control its

460
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,810
and we have true arm

461
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:33,210
a we have to we want to functioning
dynamic routing nevertheless all we have

462
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:33,810
to

463
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:36,900
on finds some approached to handle

464
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,230
the circumstances the first um to

465
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:46,000
presents dynamic routing on actually not
so dynamic routing well a

466
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,790
where research group from Paul on sands
on day used random walk algorithm

467
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:54,110
to achieve to routing and a coach and
overlay network

468
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:58,690
um get a boxing a he used some

469
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:01,870
up to my sling State Route are so

470
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:06,080
we want us to obscured the requirements
we wanted to reduce the size

471
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,850
after routing message just to rise as
few attention as possible

472
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:14,780
therefore status updates waiting list on

473
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,810
we want it on if you all the hats that
was done by using

474
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:22,030
optimizing state routing and we can use
our own address

475
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:26,550
address this we do not use IVC or
something like that it's to pick

476
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:29,669
um the student decided to use

477
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:33,010
%uh must link state routing on cuz its
its

478
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:36,470
a very a suitable for mobile ad hoc
networks

479
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:41,300
and produces small routing overhead and
this was again reduced by using status

480
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:45,169
updates

481
00:29:45,169 --> 00:29:48,360
and the really cool thing as he came up
with a

482
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:52,360
really good idea you all know quality of
service up but she introduced quality of

483
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,270
covetousness

484
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:56,669
saw weekend optimize to think for

485
00:29:56,669 --> 00:30:03,040
the coldness and that that that's really
really cool I mean you can you can

486
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,169
terrific I think that the real over the
network with covert channels

487
00:30:06,169 --> 00:30:09,890
as you can optimize the covert miss

488
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:13,300
I skipped the the math part of order for
the

489
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,510
previous topic but something we already
can

490
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:19,780
when you must a picket califican
minimize the overhead of the connection

491
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,350
between Pierce

492
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:24,450
and done but a I think this is even

493
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:27,510
so much cooler because it just did if I

494
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:32,410
even like a charm on he both an
extensible architecture

495
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:36,380
where can exchange to Coachella
techniques

496
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:41,550
on a transparent way so you can at lots
of lots of new technologies

497
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:45,800
can at San you hiding technique for
issued if you are new timing channel or

498
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,100
whatever you want

499
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,140
it doesn't but I i show you later on

500
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,310
him implement its my concept of protocol
pink what channels

501
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,630
internet work environment learning fast

502
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:00,110
arm and its this also

503
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:03,580
um a really good idea of him

504
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:07,560
um I think the initial idea what came

505
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:11,580
%uh from from the great work that team
they did a lot of covert channel

506
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,030
research and a

507
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:17,820
I forget also that you could use to its
like the Google Translator to

508
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:22,300
the kwacha I'm was outs um

509
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,960
the needs that the pool difference that
as a way of the covert channel

510
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,940
communication

511
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:30,050
saw you urich for instance um a

512
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:34,450
agents are on a West communication and
two draws like the Google Translate

513
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:35,470
sarens

514
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:39,850
at agent 1&2 want to communicate um
using a drone

515
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:43,429
on if this is the Google Translator the
agent request so

516
00:31:43,429 --> 00:31:47,530
a and /url from agents to using the
Google translator translated

517
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:51,690
translation nobody cares about it but
the hidden information is in DeLand

518
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:55,320
HTTP address so it forwards its but is
not

519
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:00,240
aware of Tacoma China and a is not part
of the covert communication

520
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,250
actually of two of two routes faulting
process

521
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:09,880
arm we had some um updates type updates

522
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,940
to um inform the Pierce about stupid

523
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:17,110
Pearson up his an overlay network about
a routing

524
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:20,550
topology and

525
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:25,700
we owning he he only weak right forty or
use for that purpose so it's it's

526
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:30,010
its very efficient you own a niche tube
it's actually if you want to implement a

527
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:32,169
routine

528
00:32:32,169 --> 00:32:36,750
just a architect of the 20 you have a
command line interface

529
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:40,770
I'm yes the routing them I prefer to
cause subsystems

530
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:45,300
and a unified API he's AP I can control

531
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,940
all the technology issue implement here
so a few at

532
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,120
want to add to your collection on the
you know you just

533
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,179
at is here just write a module for it
and

534
00:32:55,179 --> 00:33:01,740
done its it's used five by the but
system

535
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,980
but some

536
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,890
I'll interesting question why us to find
out

537
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:11,950
what can we do to prevent

538
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:17,170
to counter these covert channels I found
it to a call to do you think that's

539
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:21,090
I'm that was actually but that's a small
pearl to

540
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:24,950
to simulates a network data loss in

541
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:28,660
metropolitan area networks and some

542
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:31,730
at you I think

543
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:35,090
show I it uses I P Q to

544
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,270
I

545
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:40,090
to redirect packets in userspace anti
they it

546
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:43,140
this packets so I thought why

547
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:46,580
shouldn't I introduced to face on for
the house which is because all these

548
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,420
covert channels

549
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:51,320
apply protocol switches if I'd

550
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,320
introducing today I can um this

551
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,290
probably destroy the hidden message
especially for protocol channels

552
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:03,540
and it it works well so here's an
example we want to transfer data message

553
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:08,310
this message using a protocol China and
we'd say we introduce a large Chile f1

554
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:09,000
seconds

555
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,580
on a protocol switch so you typically
comes in

556
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:16,379
and as for what its now protocols which
happens ICPA

557
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:21,600
picket debates next I simply pickets up
creates no protocol switches directly

558
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,250
for what its

559
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:26,369
and so on and then message

560
00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:29,629
s corrupted after what's saw

561
00:34:29,629 --> 00:34:33,540
approaches for you and some

562
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,540
weekend limits

563
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,230
mx1 error-free bench with of two coach
and the very efficiently

564
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:43,710
using either constant or random us today
to run the most today s

565
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:48,560
even more efficient I

566
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,730
and some

567
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:52,870
just and yes it's not a recession
problem um

568
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:57,280
between usability and security like and
so many cases because you

569
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,570
administrators to configure it is a on

570
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:03,920
however this one problem and that this

571
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,240
particle hoping for a chance with
sequence number us because

572
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:15,240
they can we sought the the hidden
message okay

573
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:30,869
anger um if you are for internal
sequence number

574
00:35:30,869 --> 00:35:34,279
the receiver can resort the packet
sequence and can

575
00:35:34,279 --> 00:35:37,529
recalculate origin the payload so if we

576
00:35:37,529 --> 00:35:42,630
I'm destroy the original packet sequence

577
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:45,709
it doesn't matter if you have interna if
if a

578
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:50,819
for microphone call with a sequence
number I okay

579
00:35:50,819 --> 00:35:54,849
summary is some we can do the protocol
hoping we can

580
00:35:54,849 --> 00:35:59,390
I to overlay routing its dynamic we have
a chance on drawn swift upgradeable

581
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,959
covert infrastructure

582
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:04,529
we can access to over the network and
the more by mana

583
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:09,420
I'm we can optimize to my property costs
rise as few attention as possible

584
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,420
using for my grandma we can minimize the
size

585
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:17,299
using status updates weekend it's a nice
mood to call the house for corporate a

586
00:36:17,299 --> 00:36:17,950
cause

587
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:21,279
and there's one active one but that
cannot count are really quick micro

588
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:22,029
protocols

589
00:36:22,029 --> 00:36:25,690
so and at the moment we can do nothing
against

590
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:29,779
these techniques this just no approach
available because

591
00:36:29,779 --> 00:36:34,160
each technique you block you can just
implement a new one where you can use

592
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,509
them

593
00:36:34,509 --> 00:36:37,630
we cud you can use one of the set of
protocols

594
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:41,479
or coaching techniques we currently
cannot love because it up

595
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:45,559
are hundreds of techniques work what
channels if you consult served as if

596
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:46,609
it's just us

597
00:36:46,609 --> 00:36:50,039
twenty years you find so many

598
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:54,190
I mean for from nearly every night for
protocol you have some hiding techniques

599
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:57,890
and it's all easy to spot you hiding
techniques and and other protocols

600
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:01,569
this it's just not complicated if you
understand that once you can do it

601
00:37:01,569 --> 00:37:06,049
again for every new protocol okay

602
00:37:06,049 --> 00:37:10,150
last part of the

603
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:13,640
talk is about to date are

604
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,680
the kitch and covert channels in the
building automation area

605
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,059
because I fought how can we I X for
trade data

606
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:25,089
in future that's a new

607
00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:29,769
systems come up to block I'll hit phone
communications and the usual it is

608
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:30,680
packed networks

609
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,039
why not use to building automation
network 2x for trade data

610
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:37,229
and an interesting aspect was also too
upset of

611
00:37:37,229 --> 00:37:40,499
data because on if you cite channels

612
00:37:40,499 --> 00:37:43,650
on such as %uh defiance

613
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:46,900
a escort janice was not intentional send
the so they leak but

614
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,979
there's no intention that they dictator
out if we have such an ass

615
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:54,329
in the building automation area we kind
of stuff everything in the building

616
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:57,930
and for instance if I'm nm for you

617
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:01,959
and I want to steal a document a from
the manager's office

618
00:38:01,959 --> 00:38:06,039
I can check such an awesome the Beas and
up surf

619
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:09,999
whether my my my boss is currently in
his office if he's not

620
00:38:09,999 --> 00:38:13,670
because light is turned off temperatures
slow on

621
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:17,549
no presence and so are detected sup
person presence in the room

622
00:38:17,549 --> 00:38:21,440
so I can go in studio I'm I'm on a
burglar II

623
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,140
I want to go into the basement because
I'm there's no light turned on and

624
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,319
everybody is in the

625
00:38:26,319 --> 00:38:30,430
on the second floor or something like
that does getting really interesting

626
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:33,969
fewer I'll think about ambient assisted
living and he health

627
00:38:33,969 --> 00:38:37,440
already many a pilot projects

628
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,789
I know at least one in Austria out that

629
00:38:40,789 --> 00:38:44,079
Texas since 2000 you Nevin well

630
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,699
el duce are up surfed and because

631
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:51,609
that that their science connection
between health data like

632
00:38:51,609 --> 00:38:55,259
that pressure on so on and building
automation system because the building

633
00:38:55,259 --> 00:38:57,319
automation system if you get sick

634
00:38:57,319 --> 00:39:00,989
really ill really sick then the doctor
was caught and

635
00:39:00,989 --> 00:39:04,539
that stunned by the building automation
system so if we have a such an on a

636
00:39:04,539 --> 00:39:05,890
building automation system

637
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:10,619
we even know health data is really
really I'm

638
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:13,630
arm critical a

639
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:18,049
my point a few for the court shall we

640
00:39:18,049 --> 00:39:21,049
um at the attention I'll send a and we
want to

641
00:39:21,049 --> 00:39:24,749
expert red dates sooo point to it we had
date on the trip reports

642
00:39:24,749 --> 00:39:28,859
or and abstract behavior of the building
arm

643
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:32,009
week we can either

644
00:39:32,009 --> 00:39:35,319
sniffed the expert rated data between
buildings because they are

645
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:36,569
interconnected usually

646
00:39:36,569 --> 00:39:40,749
by a simple issue 2p encapsulation of of
knex or back nets

647
00:39:40,749 --> 00:39:43,859
and its never encrypt it

648
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:46,890
yes there's a standout for backing up
for instance that's

649
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:50,259
allows encryption but I talk to the
companies in this ain't nobody wants to

650
00:39:50,259 --> 00:39:50,969
encrypt its

651
00:39:50,969 --> 00:39:53,969
you the companies will submit since HS

652
00:39:53,969 --> 00:39:57,069
they had never one customer wanted
encrypt it back in its

653
00:39:57,069 --> 00:40:00,190
because the the persons who

654
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:03,640
do that ministration of two buildings
they say

655
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,329
cryptography a that makes everything
more complicated I don't want it

656
00:40:07,329 --> 00:40:10,989
just put that put its in my in my house

657
00:40:10,989 --> 00:40:15,119
like always was and I don't want to care
about in the future since complicate its

658
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,699
I just wanted to run that is perfect

659
00:40:18,699 --> 00:40:24,029
and all week connects directly to be a
SN sniff today to their because in fact

660
00:40:24,029 --> 00:40:27,089
that everything is broadcast its nearly
everything and

661
00:40:27,089 --> 00:40:30,499
so we with its it doesn't really matter
where we collected data

662
00:40:30,499 --> 00:40:34,089
months we get all the information we
need

663
00:40:34,089 --> 00:40:37,529
so um what's

664
00:40:37,529 --> 00:40:40,680
happens if a coach and is a step is to
be a SS

665
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,859
but I for either writes down or REIT up
is taking

666
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:48,359
facts so my bosses temperature in his
room is written down to

667
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:52,009
low use a meet them for you I'm

668
00:40:52,009 --> 00:40:55,529
I'd shouldn't all other temperatures
from and I shouldn't be able to request

669
00:40:55,529 --> 00:40:56,749
its

670
00:40:56,749 --> 00:41:00,869
so that it would be read up on joint
work with

671
00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:05,329
with a student and a professor Knox Polk
we developed a on

672
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:09,509
a actually very simple solution to be a
foster back that's why we were so it's

673
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:11,769
an open source software

674
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:15,059
on

675
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:18,160
and ideas as follows: we split

676
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,779
the occurs and violence into up

677
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:25,229
which he never secure so ons

678
00:41:25,229 --> 00:41:28,499
saw we find some staff and every hour s

679
00:41:28,499 --> 00:41:31,940
at the secret lever for sales

680
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:36,749
and confidential ever for some research
project or something like that and we

681
00:41:36,749 --> 00:41:40,940
config your the security I'm

682
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:45,839
policy on the secondary your arse so
that they are basically just fit a ring

683
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,160
requests and a response messages knock

684
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,400
not some have that what's break them

685
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,449
the security policy of to be open with
our

686
00:41:55,449 --> 00:41:59,269
and some the primary BFR just us

687
00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:05,119
about to take care about the routing arm

688
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,529
in that case it is just an example the I

689
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:11,630
the secret device tries to on

690
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:15,079
a at the top secret device a top-secret
network

691
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:19,140
tries to write on information are you to
turn on heating in a secret never that's

692
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:19,900
here

693
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:23,979
what's the top secret lover bf are I'm

694
00:42:23,979 --> 00:42:27,150
prevents the right on so it when that

695
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:31,239
even reach the first-ever bf are it were
not for what the data

696
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:34,690
um with an hour senario

697
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:38,309
de sus second lever be a boss always
responsible

698
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:43,410
for to for down filtering

699
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:46,839
on so

700
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:50,799
to conclude that part of we we can say
there are

701
00:42:50,799 --> 00:42:54,619
so I think a chance and building
automation systems they are

702
00:42:54,619 --> 00:42:57,839
a far higher relevance because of the
health data because up to of servation

703
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:02,069
stuff people and events in buildings

704
00:43:02,069 --> 00:43:06,319
I we can prevents covert channels at
such an ass

705
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:10,309
both with the same approach in buckets
by introducing very simple

706
00:43:10,309 --> 00:43:14,979
topological chain using an open source
software

707
00:43:14,979 --> 00:43:17,989
but to give our is on stable its
documentation

708
00:43:17,989 --> 00:43:22,920
this more let's not existent and two
configurations a mess you need to stick

709
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,949
adds a lot of XML you have to write and
you have to creates Tex

710
00:43:26,949 --> 00:43:30,959
and two related documentation spat so if
if

711
00:43:30,959 --> 00:43:34,329
there's anyone in Tia end audience wants
to

712
00:43:34,329 --> 00:43:37,559
right and the a useful software got

713
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:41,630
back their firewall software I would
really appreciate it said let me know if

714
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:44,269
if you do thats and

715
00:43:44,269 --> 00:43:47,910
ever may be included in my next talks if
it's stable

716
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:54,910
saw but the BF are is really really crap
into I think the last release was 2007

717
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:59,199
on but what can we concludes

718
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:03,679
for the whole talk first thing us

719
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:07,410
we have many many techniques for covert
channels

720
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:10,900
not all of them can be detected we have
so many techniques to detect covert

721
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:11,299
channels

722
00:44:11,299 --> 00:44:14,859
yes became the midterm weekend detect
them

723
00:44:14,859 --> 00:44:18,460
and we can prevent them some of them

724
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:21,559
but even these approaches I mean nearly

725
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:25,410
all of the techniques up coming from
academia

726
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:29,279
week we can detect covert channels and
packet traces but we cannot some fun

727
00:44:29,279 --> 00:44:30,369
says detect them

728
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:34,289
just in time we we r mmm we have a lot
of

729
00:44:34,289 --> 00:44:38,029
of means for detecting covert channels
and software

730
00:44:38,029 --> 00:44:43,099
and cold spots but network of a chance
are not so easy to detect

731
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:46,849
as long as they do not arm

732
00:44:46,849 --> 00:44:53,009
Heights States an HTTP version 8.9

733
00:44:53,009 --> 00:44:56,599
and its dis dis approaches a very
valuable for

734
00:44:56,599 --> 00:45:00,729
future militias communication for
botnets but also for journalists but

735
00:45:00,729 --> 00:45:01,859
journalists

736
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:06,229
are not aware of it so they don't use it
if John analysts

737
00:45:06,229 --> 00:45:09,239
would be aware of of using these
technologies they would be much more

738
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:11,679
safe but there's no good software
available for them

739
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:15,289
to do that that that the paper I mention
started the

740
00:45:15,289 --> 00:45:18,469
S&P paper that will be presented i think
im in June

741
00:45:18,469 --> 00:45:23,190
day a analyzed all these tools go to
network steganography day

742
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:27,210
try to look let traffic look like Skype
traffic on so on

743
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:30,339
but they found for for all of these
tools difference a

744
00:45:30,339 --> 00:45:33,719
detections because they were not conform
to behave

745
00:45:33,719 --> 00:45:37,429
not xx a conform to the behavior of to
report a call for instance

746
00:45:37,429 --> 00:45:41,839
that didn't really implemented the
original a Ross and implementations

747
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:45,069
and and thats a loss to distinguish

748
00:45:45,069 --> 00:45:48,259
rear protocol and data hiding protocol

749
00:45:48,259 --> 00:45:51,499
using the former gramm approach on the
other hand

750
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:55,219
that I just showed you I'm enables

751
00:45:55,219 --> 00:46:00,119
um exactly that go up

752
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:06,130
so I'm maybe we should focus on on such
technologies

753
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:10,150
we have court in such an awesome
feeling. automation systems

754
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:13,400
but we can prevent them thats basically
using

755
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:17,979
but nobody would do that because you do
not change the topology including

756
00:46:17,979 --> 00:46:21,739
do you do not see people do not want
them they are not interested in it so

757
00:46:21,739 --> 00:46:22,359
you can

758
00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:25,940
for the next ten years probably you can
extracts

759
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:29,329
extra trade to it confidential data
using the Beas

760
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:32,679
nobody will ever notice

761
00:46:32,679 --> 00:46:36,420
but I'm since is a professional yes I
usually give to give talks

762
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:39,999
a to the academic audience with or gave
talks to academic

763
00:46:39,999 --> 00:46:43,179
audience within the last year's so I
fought I'm

764
00:46:43,179 --> 00:46:46,699
this is a really good chance to true
I'll send the message

765
00:46:46,699 --> 00:46:51,219
to professional audience to people
really do that stuff in practice and and

766
00:46:51,219 --> 00:46:54,779
in my opinion you are that the people
who can really

767
00:46:54,779 --> 00:46:58,049
enabled the technology you can bring it
to you to join us

768
00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:01,869
and if you want to become very
well-known

769
00:47:01,869 --> 00:47:05,249
you could probably already work on the
future partner detection because

770
00:47:05,249 --> 00:47:08,890
you know know what the botnets will do
in future and if you're

771
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:13,719
find a way to counter the botnets you
will be the stock

772
00:47:13,719 --> 00:47:17,670
for botnets and five or 10 years because
they were find out what we did in

773
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:18,299
research

774
00:47:18,299 --> 00:47:21,509
and they would do it so I'm that's my
message

775
00:47:21,509 --> 00:47:28,509
thank you for your attention

776
00:47:30,299 --> 00:47:35,319
here are some a purse and books and so
on be published so if you if you want to

777
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:38,989
with them most of them online on the
website

778
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:45,989
stuff with thank you very much other
questions

779
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:55,210
hi

780
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:59,440
you mentioned that machine learning
techniques have become popular in your

781
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,780
a Aries for yes the search so am

782
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:05,860
as I see it they also have also become
popular in

783
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:08,900
image processing and audio analysis

784
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:13,040
could you and elaborate more on the

785
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:17,430
and application of machine learning
techniques like are you trying to fit

786
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:20,960
some sort of caution model to identify a

787
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,980
delays like delays in binary

788
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:27,310
covert channels or something 00 how to
use the

789
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:30,590
those machine learning technology I only
known

790
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:33,800
to machine learning-based approach isn't
they all

791
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:37,540
you see 4.5 to detect um

792
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:41,860
a covert timing channels based on the
Intel rival times of packets

793
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:45,020
and stand a did it take to parents is
basically

794
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:48,370
the first one is some the the

795
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:52,580
time between the packard so between the
packets and

796
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:55,640
the number of packets which is for

797
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:59,360
a and pickets I've and that's enough

798
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:03,610
we we also did such a mission running
approach using c4 54.5

799
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:07,240
um a presented at last year's LCN

800
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:10,610
and I'm I to the paper s

801
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:11,780
arm

802
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:15,500
that one I weekend to take for a Cause
switching

803
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:20,170
covert channels I based on the time
between the protocols which just look at

804
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:22,020
what the time difference between the
packets but have

805
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:25,500
the time between protocol switches and
for use to number of protocols which a

806
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,140
spur of 5,000 packets

807
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:31,980
I'm we own it is true values and move to
China has four bits per second using two

808
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:35,200
for the course for pro coach and a week
have fun across here from my

809
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,810
ninety-eight percent also butts I'm we

810
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:42,500
units traffic recordings and and that's
not really practical the

811
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:46,270
a pliable I think at the moment butts
butts there's no

812
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:49,490
I'm I'm not aware of of

813
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:52,820
much other mission dining approaches in
question detection

814
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:56,930
a suspect's a some to come up I'm just
asking because I

815
00:49:56,930 --> 00:50:00,200
as it looks to me you have strong
statistical dependence

816
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:05,570
and machine learning techniques are very
fishing fe2

817
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:09,940
motto this so yeah I I think

818
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:13,610
a.m. some some new research will come
off in that area

819
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:20,510
trip on I really expect that okay more
questions

820
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:24,650
arose breaking for lunch right

821
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:30,350
I okay so stephan thank you very much
for of other interesting talk

822
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:34,100
and don't take that remember the German
a laws a

823
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:37,900
does a paragraph telling you not to to
break into computer systems so

824
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:42,160
take that for good purposes to just a
mess just before lunch
