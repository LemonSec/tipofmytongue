1
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,640
okay welcome everybody a.m. any worse

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,940
already introducing on or work our talk

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,679
and ourselves um very detailed so

4
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:17,980
thank you very much an oath talked on
everything told

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,480
so by on enjoy lunch pretty good so

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,870
I pretty good summary yeah but some I'm
I think it's much more interesting to

7
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,400
to get in some more details a but frost
a.m.

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,899
transaction um much just an IRA we r

9
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,480
rocking with all that stuff we're doing
penetration test code reviews

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,480
a.m. sometimes audits on to

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,920
the goods rose engineering and very
often we have the problem

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,970
that our customers are asking us okay
how critical is a problem

13
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:52,230
and then we have to say okay it's pretty
good all it's not critical

14
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,989
its some kind of medium rated that to be
a question

15
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:59,720
and some we gots lot of experience

16
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,079
over the last years and doing that and
such was the main reason

17
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,659
why I'm the idea popped up okay I'm we
need something

18
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:12,189
%uh and special to to do it very good
rating

19
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:15,409
aunts the talk is about or

20
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:20,560
ideas and results and mobility is if you
want to have

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,299
to some introducing growth

22
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,639
to will yet thanks for the sect

23
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:30,899
production I benefits but yes we will

24
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:34,590
split this talk civil arts also want to

25
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:41,590
at a because I have to be really close

26
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:47,359
to speak up a little bit um I also want
to come back to an O's introduction as

27
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,969
you mentioned became up with a

28
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:53,299
metric that describes ability is
actually we came up

29
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:57,770
were multiple metrics you that we
changed over time and this is

30
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,490
one of the topics want to research
topics

31
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,189
at the NW probably s one of the

32
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:09,039
longer lists durations until we

33
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,439
came to a somewhat final result um

34
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:15,569
and securing this process we

35
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:20,340
came across several pitfalls that you
have to avoid when you want to rate

36
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,540
vulnerabilities

37
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,709
so there are two made Marius

38
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:29,129
on that you want to cover Shetty's
pitfalls with you to tell you okay

39
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:33,890
what you should do should not do when
you want to rate vulnerabilities

40
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,750
especially on a large scale and then we
want to present your our

41
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:41,989
approach on it is based on a lot of
experience that we

42
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:46,909
gotta both from assessments penetration
tests on its whatever we

43
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:50,860
arm did you customize advance
experiences

44
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,239
customer sites like Twitter with a fast
guys think about

45
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,480
thinking about this problem but I think
we

46
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,560
got some rather good ideas in their

47
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,000
and a very good summary everything we
saw

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,560
up experience so um

49
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,969
this sehn duffala talk for us we will

50
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:16,040
if you /url slightly I'll more
comprehensive problem statement

51
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,989
them with it so far like other village
Creek rating is difficult there are

52
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:20,730
pitfalls

53
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,400
we vote tell you about those those
pitfalls

54
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,430
that we'll have a look at existing
approaches

55
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,469
conceive holiday to you all on

56
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:34,739
deal with those pitfalls you have
several

57
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:37,810
Devils India I'll and

58
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:44,739
we will require your heavy index up to
ready off so that means the second day

59
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:47,739
it was to deny yesterday but its

60
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:50,969
late in the morning so I hope your fit
for them into action

61
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:56,780
and after that potentially outlining
some shortcomings of those approaches

62
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,659
I'll we want to show in your direction
that we were going to

63
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:06,489
and to be honest also outlined some of
the limitations

64
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:11,329
almost as approach arm but I'm pretty
sure you will be able to figure this all

65
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:11,769
out

66
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:15,120
buddy at the store so I believe

67
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,130
pretty interesting a.m. Michael me it
will be like

68
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,880
week what's up to talk to us during the
development of our approach we

69
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,580
probably you of disagree it's then we
agreed

70
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:32,110
I so it was hard work to comes to a
conclusion in the end

71
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,650
ever followed the keynote we've always
fighting yes over trade fight

72
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,150
but this is like the the end of a long
period I

73
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,980
what else Flobots writing several emails
before troopers like

74
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,790
was blood sweat and tears yep I'm not
sure about the auto but there's like a

75
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,880
waiting in them we'll see that

76
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,900
alright so when we first came up

77
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,080
worth the questions at all rating
vulnerabilities

78
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,410
efficient large-scale wat that also

79
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:07,430
last August I guess when we

80
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,490
accidentally is somehow hurts

81
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,720
the question from different sites I'm
okay how can we do this how can we

82
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,570
trekked vulnerabilities how can the rate
goes

83
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:24,330
arm and went to deal with this question
because so far we well using CBS

84
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,140
using it basically also recognized

85
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,140
different shortcomings of this metric so
Gaza

86
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,780
have our own interest in developing
something better and to analyze this

87
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,880
question set

88
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,660
so one very basic problem is

89
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,650
even though many key notes that how you
don't have an idea about environment

90
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:47,770
I'll usually you still have a lot of

91
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,340
just call it other abilities yup um

92
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,820
that you get off in your environment
they can results all

93
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,890
Yuka revealed them because of
penetration tests

94
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:03,160
audits arm you also doing automated
their abilities getting

95
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,340
and some probably one of the biggest
sauces to maintain

96
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:13,230
a succulent and now this is a seam a
solution that is also generating a lot

97
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,320
of

98
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,210
just call if other abilities yup arm

99
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:22,050
so huge list of stuff that you have to
take care of

100
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,640
so the next problem in this process

101
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:30,340
is this just as an awesome on the
vulnerabilities

102
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,410
usually is not in the list other
database full of stuff that you have to

103
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,750
take care of if you have a database for
that

104
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,720
and now of course you have to decide
okay I'll what do you want to address

105
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,030
at all what they want to dress for lost
I'm

106
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:48,810
a regicide got how they keep track of
that

107
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:52,900
so the to bigger problems associated
with

108
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,610
you don't have enough resources to take
care of all abilities

109
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:00,350
at the same time i think thats pretty of
US one

110
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,810
the job familiar with

111
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,890
the the next to one so probably less
obvious but

112
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,580
from my experience thing from from all
of our experience

113
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,730
they also called a cool and the most
environments

114
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:18,210
so typically also level that lack of
information

115
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,950
abilities of existing problems

116
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:25,360
for example on you get a penetration
test report maybe

117
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,380
the description in them is not answering
all of your questions

118
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,400
all those just metric based approach
others from

119
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,640
bought others liked 5 process of three

120
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,940
so you don't have enough information
abilities to assist

121
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,770
you and

122
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,790
also very big pitfall that we came
across multiple times as

123
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:50,360
that but the findings belong to
different

124
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,990
on departments at least when it comes to
fixing bills

125
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:58,390
so we also have to have a kind of a

126
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:02,830
the some degree of protection between
the different departments

127
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:06,970
inaudible artificial fixing and even if
not I'll

128
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:10,120
so you're the internal security
Department

129
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,680
I'll you have all the information
understood the vulnerability

130
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,260
but then operations department the
database depart

131
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:21,520
whatever they get this finding in
whatever format you provide them

132
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,020
and they have no idea how to fix it so
this is also very common problem

133
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,750
it is all the perspective of the
internal security risk

134
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,860
up are there there are coming to a smart
guys from the outside

135
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,680
a also have to tell you something they
provide you the old way

136
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,969
beltway with information let's say five
other villages

137
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:44,470
whatever so as to bring all of that to
get up

138
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:48,660
and in the end just have to make a
decision

139
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,710
just is either which one abilities to I
want to fix

140
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:55,070
not all medium to long laid up

141
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:58,170
whenever notices I never

142
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:02,580
yep on Eva the might be buffeted by the
great reasons to

143
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,770
never fix other bits

144
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:09,870
will discuss bodies of I'll their of
beasts

145
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:13,280
so mom in this program s

146
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,600
be identified its to relevant suspects
which are the most interesting once I

147
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,090
know what the net

148
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:22,200
on the ship back to give up just
bresnahan

149
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,580
Charlotte what's us we really appreciate
it

150
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,520
a lot of feedback because as much
experience as we have

151
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,730
I think its many custom environments as
we saw many

152
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,680
other abilities piece of I'll they can
still dream of

153
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,230
substantiated opinions top so

154
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,440
if you have an additional disagree or
agree with something

155
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,310
in free to privacy so the first part

156
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,870
as the prioritisation of liabilities

157
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,100
of the better way bureau

158
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,160
realization of fixing those cities

159
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,670
this is one aspect missus obviously
closely

160
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:05,990
related operating of severity for their
abilities

161
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,180
and second aspect you want to arts up

162
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,440
all relevant Asma questions

163
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,840
and in doing so you need to take into
account the different

164
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,060
both parties need to know and what they
can provide

165
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:25,070
so this only so much penetration test
that can provide

166
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:28,110
reports but these other

167
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:31,480
most relevant um aspects in our opinion

168
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,310
and fast outline of the topic so

169
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:40,450
speaking about vulnerabilities is always
nice but we actually want to look into

170
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,490
some

171
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,230
actually existing approaches and holiday

172
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,990
approach this operating problems and you
will have some concrete

173
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,779
a specific examples of other abilities
to

174
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:55,980
discuss yeah um that's because we are
doing

175
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,640
um service rating arm based on metrics
since years

176
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,260
I think we started about 2007 2008

177
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,170
um to put metrics for severity rating in
our

178
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:12,400
and pen test reports um because it's
quite a big problem

179
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:17,660
um to say something like okay I think
this vulnerability is a critical one

180
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,240
and the administrator on sauce over I
don't think so

181
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,410
and I'll yaa arkansas again discussion a
fight

182
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:29,310
yeah but um to half reliable rating of

183
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,440
a of severity of finding survivability

184
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,760
I'm you need something more then like to
I think it's pretty cold units

185
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,970
metric approach so we were starting
looking around okay what kind of

186
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,090
security metrics are available

187
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:49,690
ansa in about 2007 there was just one
metric available that's was usable for

188
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:50,580
this kind of

189
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:55,279
a information and that most CVSS common
viability

190
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,630
scoring system so from

191
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:02,190
we started to you to use this metric no
reports

192
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:06,500
ants CVS s is a wall the false

193
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:11,360
metrics dealing with at least by the
abilities and findings

194
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,500
but some a.m.

195
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,670
the basic idea of a CVSS walls

196
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,570
related to pets management decides

197
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:25,170
which pictures have to be installed
frost

198
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,800
other was intention for CBS s ants

199
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,660
we said okay lot of other villages are
about pitching so this might also be

200
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,000
used for useful for penetration testing

201
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,410
so I'm we started to use it and nowadays

202
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:42,839
CVS s is really widely used a lot of

203
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:46,330
up companies are doing um

204
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:50,220
severity rating of viability space on
CBS s

205
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,720
Nestle's provide CBS as informational
findings

206
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,279
um Microsoft to does it and a lot of
other companies

207
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:02,270
a providing this information boats on
this company's

208
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,440
are also dealing with patches for the
software

209
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,870
you know soul but some as a sets

210
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:12,500
in the pasta um there was nothing else
that whilst

211
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,130
almost usable so um we decide it's too

212
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,580
a.m. to CVS and and you notice quote
about

213
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,589
when you have a hammock everything
starts to look like a nail

214
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:25,839
yeah look that's right

215
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,850
yeah anthems CVSS false Crites

216
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,570
interesting because some when we were
talking about

217
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,670
um vine abilities um

218
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:39,089
one other problem is that's

219
00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:42,700
companies have different opinions about
the criticality

220
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,750
of findings um some companies think

221
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,260
this sequel injection is for critical
finding

222
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:54,040
and another company %uh and has opinion
all fall

223
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,210
this finding for for our business

224
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:01,399
a is not so critical sold out different
views

225
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:04,950
on um on defining based on

226
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:08,190
on the business purpose of the company a
so um

227
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:12,330
another interesting point loss that CBS
was introducing some kind of

228
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:15,980
environment to view um to the
criticality

229
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,730
is was not just like sequel objection is
always bet

230
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:23,050
a.m. it was like okay this sequel
injection

231
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:26,690
might be best for this environment all
this company

232
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:30,910
so what kind of company a.m. relate its

233
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:34,440
um you want and of course from

234
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,370
because he is a small soft focus and
scope on on patch management

235
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:42,240
you had some for it on Sat some time to
pick questions like

236
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,980
what is the impact of of the viability
what is the target distribution

237
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,330
if a 1000 when the Service are affected
San

238
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,790
it's clear you have to install as pets
but quickly um

239
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:58,520
if you're talking about some let's say
one system

240
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,149
basement a.m. but almost everyone has
already forgot me

241
00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:05,170
I'm might be not so important to install
this kind

242
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:09,200
the pet on this kind of system that but
this was related to

243
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,529
um Petrus and the guise of

244
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:16,649
arm CVS s hats a quite interesting from
law

245
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:21,029
um strong moth a.m. I'm not

246
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:25,180
the biggest and a strong of I think a
simple formula might be

247
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:30,899
more helpful yeah but I'm that that the
formula and

248
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:34,209
the especially the they had three
categories yeah

249
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:37,310
Wildcats Rick category they called the
base metric I'm

250
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:40,500
with related to the characteristics of
the finding of the phone but it

251
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,620
availability some kind of temporary
metrics

252
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,410
related to the exploit ability and Petra
availability

253
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:52,040
of the viability and then the already
mentioned

254
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,260
and environmental metrics

255
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,740
information related to the customer %ah
company

256
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,790
environment the base metric never
changes

257
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,800
no characteristics of finding a
viability

258
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,970
temperament tricks might be subject to
change

259
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:12,260
for example because an export becomes
available yeah

260
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,450
and a the environmental metrics a.m.

261
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:20,000
i think thats shouldn't change so often
yeah but there's also the possibility

262
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,990
that song

263
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:25,250
some stuff in the right environment for
change and

264
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,310
a.m. the rating especially the following
up

265
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:31,740
a.m. it uses a concept that's

266
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,230
%uh the temperance call that's cake
related is based on the results of the

267
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:35,620
Mets

268
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:40,380
a of the base metric and environmental
school office also based on the temporal

269
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,690
scoring on the

270
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:45,270
base core and environmental score this
also the

271
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,670
find a school that's the concept behind
the formula

272
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,990
we have some questions that are on certs

273
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:55,320
a.m. the CVSS from concept

274
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,080
like in defector six of the findings
basement recall the base

275
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,430
met a group excess Victor are the attack
are

276
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,870
is a viability accessible from the
internets term

277
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:09,059
from a company that brought or is this
just a

278
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:12,529
local problem yaa on the excess

279
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:15,589
complexity love it it take complexity

280
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:20,749
um you need lot of know-how to exploit
this issue all can everyone don't know

281
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:21,879
the to learn to

282
00:17:21,879 --> 00:17:25,079
run it do need to be authenticated its

283
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:29,549
time to explore its viability and was
what is the impact for confidentiality

284
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,739
integrity and never

285
00:17:30,739 --> 00:17:34,100
and availability are then

286
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,210
a.m. the temperament to poop a.m.

287
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:40,279
exploit ability which means is a prick
exploitive able

288
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:43,379
reliable have on something like a
wal-mart a

289
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:47,379
just like module or is that just a
proof-of-concept

290
00:17:47,379 --> 00:17:51,299
Rs no proof of concept all no kind of
cold

291
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:55,369
avaible at this for downloading from the
internet

292
00:17:55,369 --> 00:17:58,649
um what's a repudiation never our
pictures available

293
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:02,100
official fixes workarounds and that
stuff

294
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:07,580
and report confidence how reliable
kansas also off the hook by the ability

295
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:12,970
someone claiming in a news group a I
found a zero-day for iis6

296
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:16,899
yeah and I get so um local system um

297
00:18:16,899 --> 00:18:20,350
privileges was almost a cut which

298
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,669
on this comp it true because of the
architecture but anyway

299
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:29,779
yeah Rs um vendor publishing a security
advisory describes the viability

300
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:33,239
thats what report confidence is about
and then

301
00:18:33,239 --> 00:18:36,929
the environmental parts what the
collateral damage potential of the

302
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:38,649
viability for example

303
00:18:38,649 --> 00:18:42,419
um maybe the ap photo/frank falter will
stop working

304
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:47,610
you already know that so us know seems
to be this kinda viability for Frankfurt

305
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:51,259
yeah I what's a target distribution I'll

306
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:54,649
a all systems affected some systems
affected

307
00:18:54,649 --> 00:18:58,580
and what up the requirements regarding
the

308
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:02,919
security goals confidentiality integrity
and availability

309
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:07,169
of the assets um

310
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:10,999
where r ratings of by the abilities so

311
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:14,470
interesting approach approach up um

312
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,070
but at least we had its some problems

313
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:21,100
over the years because as are already
set

314
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:26,940
and CVS is related to pets management
and not for kinda find abilities

315
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,940
that you would get when you do a
penetration tests

316
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,519
so um to dig a little deeper into CVS s

317
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:36,799
me for belts small deval with some

318
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,970
interactions so time to wake up again

319
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,639
even if lunch is not so far away anymore

320
00:19:43,639 --> 00:19:47,669
aunts where we started to work with us

321
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:51,059
CVSS of course the first thing we did
balls

322
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:54,980
writing a cake you later and some

323
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:58,989
for now I have rewritten the cake later
that's a new roth Mississauga metric

324
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,509
multiple versions of

325
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:03,700
different calculator yeah and to have
fun

326
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,149
1202 to all the metrics stuff we're
doing

327
00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:10,629
W the what we want to do now is this

328
00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:14,419
um we have chosen the viability

329
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:17,570
thats I think well-known to the
community

330
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:22,720
it's called sequel injection so someone
who doesn't know what single injection

331
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,029
mean starts that's great

332
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:29,899
okay ants what we want to do now is some

333
00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:33,679
we want to do it's a view to rating

334
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,960
of a single injection problem based on

335
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,859
CDSs draws in true by the way um I
noticed just some work in progress

336
00:20:41,859 --> 00:20:43,090
working on CBS as

337
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:47,749
versus three what's this focus still
relates to those into

338
00:20:47,749 --> 00:20:51,539
still it seems like that addressing some

339
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:54,720
yet we will see it's a long way to go
maybe view of Ostia

340
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,799
so let's see I so um we want to do 730
rating for CBS

341
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:03,330
s a.m. some facts yeah

342
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:07,200
we have webshop so it's %uh for us from

343
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,999
the second section problem a again
that's shop in Florida

344
00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:15,999
with and enjoy when someone is suffering
for example the spectral

345
00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:19,899
so we have a secret injection problem in
a webshop

346
00:21:19,899 --> 00:21:23,190
I'm in the power metal it's a in a in
its your permit of

347
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:28,200
doesn't matter and

348
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:34,809
sorry did get from

349
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:38,570
close of a I okay so I'm

350
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:42,529
see prediction problem and the first
thing is a it's a workshop

351
00:21:42,529 --> 00:21:46,460
so first you have to decide what's your
take effect of

352
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:50,649
possibilities are

353
00:21:50,649 --> 00:21:53,779
is it local problems Boca means only a

354
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:59,950
an authenticator its a user with Tom in
excess something as can convert

355
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:03,659
is the kind of Justin network which
means

356
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:08,190
from the DM's that all from from a
company while Islam something else

357
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:12,669
on network means from almost everywhere
so

358
00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:17,059
what have you to suggestions suggestions

359
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:21,119
defense webshop network

360
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:27,600
other opinions guy good

361
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,039
I get it stays relevant parts up

362
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,940
if it is a subset of

363
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:38,100
see yeah

364
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,929
such field okay up every measure to
europe

365
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:44,980
from yeah your rights that some

366
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,169
some some of the problems a.m. when
doing this cut if

367
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:52,690
of rights yet %uh and that's also the
problem if you are doing this kind of

368
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:53,419
rating

369
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:57,159
sometimes some other questions pop up
that Yukon on saw

370
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:00,809
in that easy way like okay it was such a
treat

371
00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:05,149
okay know I know I'm successful from the
Intertek announces a question

372
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:09,859
now some time some other questions my
pup that are not so easy to answer

373
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:12,970
good you little bit faster for the next
Jones

374
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:16,600
okay so okay let's rock it a complexity

375
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,340
no medio and high

376
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,879
we already loaded lot depends everybody
I

377
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:26,889
knowing all because advanced

378
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:29,989
I alright okay so

379
00:23:29,989 --> 00:23:33,269
we agree on low a.m.

380
00:23:33,269 --> 00:23:37,070
do we have to do health education it was
such cute

381
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:41,720
0

382
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,960
nuns okay so is from facilities

383
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,729
a zara.com potentially impact

384
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:54,429
no partially completes

385
00:23:54,429 --> 00:23:58,919
everything's gone

386
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:05,919
see

387
00:24:08,749 --> 00:24:12,909
me

388
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:16,269
but okay Disney it's a very interesting
point from

389
00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:23,269
from with from the dismiss that's right
yeah

390
00:24:24,249 --> 00:24:27,820
ok if we have a lot of giants yeah
that's right

391
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,919
that's why we have chosen this a this
example yeah

392
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:34,320
because a.m. it raises a lot of question
no

393
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,070
I'm it divers if you're talking about
let's say

394
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:42,879
my personal secrets over 2,000 yeah or
something like your approach to seek to

395
00:24:42,879 --> 00:24:43,840
solve a

396
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,049
yeah that's a big difference and

397
00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:51,049
at least by be its

398
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:55,019
it's a problem to answer the question no
so um

399
00:24:55,019 --> 00:24:59,059
but finally our job now is to do single
injection rating

400
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:03,009
with CVS s your a.m.

401
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:07,679
maybe read okay we were able to extract
some of the data from the database

402
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,279
so let's issue that we didn't have to
I'm

403
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,729
operating system excess so

404
00:25:14,729 --> 00:25:18,779
partial complete and remember on the
slights

405
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:23,309
in the AM if to make a decision now
that's right

406
00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:26,519
withstood okay

407
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:30,109
at red jobs posso

408
00:25:30,109 --> 00:25:35,769
completes overruled I

409
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:39,009
I okay integrity

410
00:25:39,009 --> 00:25:42,649
okay I i think none is not an option %uh

411
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:46,340
maybe yeah okay so I'm again the crests
apostle

412
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:50,220
and completes posso integrity

413
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,700
it completes see conviction your

414
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,049
0

415
00:25:57,049 --> 00:26:02,039
me it depends what kind of exploded its

416
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:05,269
yeah it's a question of the
proof-of-concept

417
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:09,779
yeah maybe

418
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:13,080
I or okay asked again

419
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,580
possibly completes

420
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,769
okay I think complete wince little bit a
little bit

421
00:26:20,769 --> 00:26:24,309
even though I die I don't see why we
have confidentiality possible

422
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:27,779
equity lead yet for this example

423
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:34,009
okay availability democracy

424
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:38,070
villages affected yes or no

425
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:41,220
completes possibly okay get the arms

426
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:45,320
posse completes

427
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,749
okay complete rinse but someone

428
00:26:48,749 --> 00:26:52,729
essential mind yeah that's a also
insisting yeah

429
00:26:52,729 --> 00:26:58,149
because no one asked one interesting
question that's my dress up later

430
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:02,190
I'm availability is some that you can
access the data

431
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:06,769
whenever you need it

432
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:10,100
the tip it depends yep it depends to

433
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,429
and thats points a little bit into the
direction where the problem is

434
00:27:14,429 --> 00:27:21,429
okay this question yep

435
00:27:27,629 --> 00:27:32,379
I

436
00:27:32,379 --> 00:27:39,379
here sec

437
00:27:39,899 --> 00:27:43,299
so

438
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:50,299
yep that's right

439
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:57,419
with execs that's one of the problems

440
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:00,639
yeah you actually actually to like

441
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:03,979
this slights fuzziness

442
00:28:03,979 --> 00:28:07,940
us and the layering text I think we
should missus of course

443
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:13,499
likability let's say a we have some kind
of proof of concept

444
00:28:13,499 --> 00:28:17,379
also am hi I mean so it's a kind of wall

445
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:21,259
or be destroyed more do you want me okay
this information is publicly available

446
00:28:21,259 --> 00:28:24,340
in the Internet as lot of documentation

447
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,580
but because it's this rupture of

448
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,720
to us it's only

449
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,309
one particular yeah song maybe it's more

450
00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:37,320
kind of proof of concept to but

451
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,809
on the other hand it's the attacks are
well-known

452
00:28:40,809 --> 00:28:44,710
so sequin texan sects

453
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:49,919
sex rings as proof of concept I won't

454
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,220
room but we're talking about the
congress

455
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,340
specific

456
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:00,669
it is a Juicy Couture of course

457
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:04,499
Gulf Coast checks

458
00:29:04,499 --> 00:29:08,049
know but I am it depends on the a text
string because %uh some

459
00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:11,739
I think other the question is about this
some sick or cells that are not so well

460
00:29:11,739 --> 00:29:12,679
known

461
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:16,809
but these were related to other to their
Secret Santa

462
00:29:16,809 --> 00:29:21,479
%uh let's assume it's an arkansas

463
00:29:21,479 --> 00:29:24,700
okay what do you mean

464
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,460
hi functional

465
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:33,139
raise your arms functional hi

466
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:36,720
okay functional winds

467
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,369
remediation level what we have

468
00:29:40,369 --> 00:29:44,869
office to fix temporary fix bug
Roquemore fix available

469
00:29:44,869 --> 00:29:48,029
we don't talk about undefined

470
00:29:48,029 --> 00:29:53,559
its Auriga I

471
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:58,399
if temporary fix a favor

472
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,470
okay if and

473
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:05,090
okay office for official fix

474
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:10,639
Chris I of ok a temporary fix

475
00:30:10,639 --> 00:30:14,679
woo block routes I

476
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:18,159
okay interesting loss options yup

477
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,690
know if it's available I

478
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:25,820
I'm okay I think workaround realz thats
very interesting yeah buddy in those

479
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,950
affix again seek

480
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:31,159
injection to somewhat surprised I

481
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:35,619
I pick

482
00:30:35,619 --> 00:30:40,359
adds up I

483
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:43,970
where are you you know a but I i think
you saw another pro

484
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:47,509
again its yep

485
00:30:47,509 --> 00:30:52,590
custom is

486
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:56,279
itself so if

487
00:30:56,279 --> 00:31:01,820
great the music

488
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:06,340
makes with interest the other
penetration tester from our point of

489
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:06,789
view

490
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:10,299
said custom us customer okay

491
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:15,139
usually the customers to pay for these
kind of assistance

492
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:18,139
okay then we have report confidence
unconfirmed

493
00:31:18,139 --> 00:31:21,379
uncorroborated confront

494
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:25,080
okay I think that we have to answer this
question because it relates so the

495
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,919
quality of all confession testing
methodology

496
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,149
so I say it's confirmed

497
00:31:31,149 --> 00:31:34,549
of course okay a.m.

498
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:38,950
environmental school or this information
to be comes from the customer

499
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:42,519
so it's about the decision he has to
make and

500
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:46,409
I'm using my mic um

501
00:31:46,409 --> 00:31:49,889
collateral then its potential

502
00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:54,419
yet it no medium medium-high a high

503
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:59,099
and there are some kind of the
explanations about this

504
00:31:59,099 --> 00:32:02,659
Heinz 57 Val babies i catastrophic

505
00:32:02,659 --> 00:32:07,340
whose or property damage and Los

506
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:12,940
catastrophic yeah

507
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:16,389
is catastrophic

508
00:32:16,389 --> 00:32:21,210
kids your business remember the keynotes
doesn't really tell your business

509
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:24,379
might will affect it depends

510
00:32:24,379 --> 00:32:28,289
right it depends yep

511
00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:32,249
his yeah but I'm

512
00:32:32,249 --> 00:32:37,249
if you have a sequined checked in OK a
sonya is still there

513
00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:40,710
yeah I yep

514
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:43,710
yet Evans animals still

515
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:47,229
also depends cost them to go out of
business a

516
00:32:47,229 --> 00:32:51,340
um a Muslim

517
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,219
do you think an awesome go out of
business if that would be a single

518
00:32:54,219 --> 00:32:55,190
injection

519
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:59,409
I don't think so to be honest to

520
00:32:59,409 --> 00:33:03,049
yah so but that again

521
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:06,859
another interesting discussion yeah
because I'm

522
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:10,669
is just

523
00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:14,950
so okay value to kind of kind of settled
is a little bit so this this

524
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:18,719
follow-up integration test subjects
all-party honest information that is

525
00:33:18,719 --> 00:33:22,879
most difficult yeah especially we don't
discuss it if you say

526
00:33:22,879 --> 00:33:27,019
for from our point of view a I would
take this information

527
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:31,149
no say if you say from my point of view
its high

528
00:33:31,149 --> 00:33:34,179
when you get too high because this
information

529
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:37,539
relates to your business and if you
think

530
00:33:37,539 --> 00:33:40,710
its high than its high yeah

531
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:43,849
so I'm we can't help a.m. I'm

532
00:33:43,849 --> 00:33:47,419
explaining what's as soon as they do
means a

533
00:33:47,419 --> 00:33:51,109
a.m. them to give you a better
understanding on how to fill out this

534
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:52,009
information

535
00:33:52,009 --> 00:33:55,989
but finally it's your decision and if
you don't agree

536
00:33:55,989 --> 00:33:59,549
to be with me throughout this the spot
and if you don't agree

537
00:33:59,549 --> 00:34:03,219
you can change it as you like because
this brings

538
00:34:03,219 --> 00:34:06,809
your business scope into the rating

539
00:34:06,809 --> 00:34:09,810
and also if you remove the keynote

540
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:15,169
follow slights um problem of Minnesota
guys dick

541
00:34:15,169 --> 00:34:18,589
us to test to operations or something
like that

542
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:24,319
Security Department so this also cap of
Understanding between business

543
00:34:24,319 --> 00:34:28,299
operations and so this questions also
very hot concept

544
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:35,299
okay let's move to the next one target
distribution of the laptop

545
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:41,599
sequel instance yet seem insincere

546
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,020
1 of 1 with one bird one workshop

547
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:48,049
we always taste that 61 its one

548
00:34:48,049 --> 00:34:51,200
Repsol of one tested workshop so

549
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,950
a.m. if you're dealing with that
applications from 0.2 it's always one

550
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:56,359
hundred percent

551
00:34:56,359 --> 00:35:00,319
yeah the other approach would be okay
count the number of that trumps

552
00:35:00,319 --> 00:35:04,450
hectic a operating in the environment
maybe you can say something okay it was

553
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:05,069
one of

554
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:10,099
of 5 web shops a.m. but doesn't make
sense from 0.2 few

555
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:13,500
yeah so just a horrible but okay we say

556
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,170
it's 100 percent what are the
requirements for %uh for the

557
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:19,839
confidentiality

558
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,829
I think these these although are kind of
depends west side

559
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:27,599
to schools with a high to Aunt greater
demand for tension hai

560
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,549
than reissue that integrity availability

561
00:35:31,549 --> 00:35:35,089
is also a hi

562
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:39,180
and finally with gets

563
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,510
the CD is as fine school on 9.5

564
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:46,140
10 is a maximum a looks good

565
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:50,579
possible injection right

566
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:54,200
okay what um

567
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,500
what you want to to to demonstrate was a
song its operating is

568
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,619
I'm especially CVSS is raising lot of
question

569
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:05,730
its not so easy and to fill out all the
options

570
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:09,089
I'm getting a lot of things to know from
the penetration test

571
00:36:09,089 --> 00:36:13,010
and a you had a lot of things to OSC

572
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:16,289
so um was first approached

573
00:36:16,289 --> 00:36:20,609
boats was lot of open questions from all
sides

574
00:36:20,609 --> 00:36:27,390
okay I will switch back to the slights
what else

575
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:31,799
alright um I think we have the big
demonstration year for CBS ass there are

576
00:36:31,799 --> 00:36:33,190
several

577
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,970
this one the other approach this forum
complete metric

578
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:40,430
which is see WSS you see they

579
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:43,619
on chanced upon their ability to
weakness

580
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:47,329
a.m. which is an interesting thing
because I was referred to by their

581
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:49,750
abilities in the first place from all
the inputs is

582
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,819
salsas if you remember that and
vulnerability

583
00:36:52,819 --> 00:36:56,680
is not always a very accurate arm for
everything you discover

584
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:01,119
responsibility usually relates is
something that you can exploit

585
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,849
some all so they also

586
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:08,630
claim to be able to school weakness us

587
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:11,849
we will have several examples later what
the difference

588
00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:15,930
is exactly I'll idea it's

589
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:19,559
to elect brought a few the publication
they want to follow

590
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:22,970
automatic scoring process um

591
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:27,029
12 loll more custom

592
00:37:27,029 --> 00:37:31,230
um rating of own by their abilities and
to be assess

593
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:34,760
all kind of security to let the problems
Mike cool

594
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,430
a lights on the cross and it includes
also

595
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:41,480
just a CVSS characteristics of two be

596
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,589
sales of like environmental requirements
and they also for

597
00:37:45,589 --> 00:37:48,630
three groups at baseline a group that
takes office group

598
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:52,029
and environmental group arm

599
00:37:52,029 --> 00:37:55,900
there is another relevant thing at this

600
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,319
currently versions the robot 8

601
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:03,020
and it is dis worsened since two US I
don't think the ups

602
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:06,599
updated their website on very much so

603
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:11,089
they are kind of not making progress you
so

604
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:15,520
the difference are only just on all of
that both the fine just

605
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:22,520
sometimes it difficult understands what
it say what exactly is the meaning

606
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:26,270
and if we cover

607
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:29,510
score ranging from 0 to 100 bounce

608
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:33,869
def four categories for each finding
which will show you dislike it so this

609
00:38:33,869 --> 00:38:35,430
is basically the options

610
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:38,740
you can chose from for every for each
peron it up

611
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:41,900
that I showed you ants there's

612
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:46,339
one big thing that I see as a problem is
to quantify its

613
00:38:46,339 --> 00:38:49,869
factors acreage effective from 0 to 1

614
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:53,119
will always refuse discussions about
this victim's

615
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:58,470
then yes like finding confidence proven
true prove locally true proven false

616
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:02,329
um in this case it's somewhat in tutus

617
00:39:02,329 --> 00:39:07,480
I don't think um I directly get the
meeting approved local in true

618
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,099
me that we in all cases and there are

619
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:14,710
are on it up examples to 'em

620
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:18,890
even lead to more confused like got it
with CVS

621
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:22,440
its comparable thing there are some
around a dozen

622
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:27,609
their with think a really relevant but
select overall handling

623
00:39:27,609 --> 00:39:30,940
s follow it far away from of

624
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:34,710
so SP running out of time I believe it
that way

625
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:38,349
you have problem similar to see Jesus
fearsome good approaches and that

626
00:39:38,349 --> 00:39:41,660
but unfortunately the work going on so

627
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:46,359
um and some environments we also like
rating of other abilities on the

628
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:47,819
risk-based approach

629
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:52,960
that's you is distinguish between
threats and vulnerabilities

630
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,650
which is a very good idea again save you
a compact

631
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:01,380
laid up and generated using the three
basic

632
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,819
run it is likely that vulnerability and
impact

633
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:09,359
which somewhat you which is applicable
in a very broad scale

634
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:12,609
but yes not very much information

635
00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:16,640
you want us to a long like explain the
vulnerability effect explained like the

636
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,220
it factor

637
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:20,329
explained impact factor up which books

638
00:40:20,329 --> 00:40:23,859
but then you always stuff like go high
degree of

639
00:40:23,859 --> 00:40:27,930
subjectivity falls in us the right stuff

640
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:31,390
so I just a very general approach

641
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:34,500
but might books for might work for
several things

642
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:38,410
but a few actually went to rate specific
vulnerabilities

643
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:41,930
all it's too difficult each

644
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:45,589
then of course because assault so a
customer brought us home

645
00:40:45,589 --> 00:40:48,839
but the Houston very big environments

646
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:53,089
obliterating fun abilities they take
some time sorus base

647
00:40:53,089 --> 00:40:57,470
brought into a call havel so impact
scoring

648
00:40:57,470 --> 00:41:01,260
on and then the end they also like
medium-high

649
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,799
on although rating just like um

650
00:41:04,799 --> 00:41:09,210
sub several other on scoring systems for
the Decatur ecosystems

651
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:13,829
like the usual well as engineers also
provide see this as quality as over 125

652
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:14,529
school

653
00:41:14,529 --> 00:41:17,700
available though criticality a

654
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:21,329
I criticality om the

655
00:41:21,329 --> 00:41:25,039
there are a lot of different approaches
of I think with I'll CBS as we had a

656
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:26,680
very good example

657
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:32,029
up hotels booked wat already some
pitfalls of

658
00:41:32,029 --> 00:41:36,539
but it's just summarized as up up

659
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:40,380
to summarize such a real problems with
the lack of information

660
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:45,329
for a lot of Parana us as we saw we had
a lot of depends

661
00:41:45,329 --> 00:41:48,609
we don't know what is it about so this
is a custom software from

662
00:41:48,609 --> 00:41:51,769
what is it aunt

663
00:41:51,769 --> 00:41:56,740
what do you want to rate um I will again
postponed is a little bit sorry for that

664
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:01,410
and was filling it in we dentist us with
interest Department

665
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:05,690
what information can the penetration
tester provides what the state interest

666
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:08,740
up Security Department want to know

667
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:12,420
rations want to know these kind of
problems

668
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:16,309
and once a good value of its for example

669
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:19,809
we would be incredibly happy with the
metric to this very easy to fill in for

670
00:42:19,809 --> 00:42:21,359
us

671
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,539
you have no idea how much time I am

672
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:27,599
by their ability ratings takes take
follow reports

673
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:32,619
as actually one of the except for like
cleaning out of the typos from our guys

674
00:42:32,619 --> 00:42:36,769
I it's one of the most time-consuming
parts

675
00:42:36,769 --> 00:42:41,150
of the report generation we would love
to have a very simple metric

676
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:45,569
some accurate results but is to read it
and is it okay this is critical why is

677
00:42:45,569 --> 00:42:47,309
that

678
00:42:47,309 --> 00:42:50,430
it's hard to get that yet mean take
another test

679
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:53,940
and you get a lot of phone calls for you
get asked about different

680
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:58,180
other ability rating so it's also no
interest to provide that information

681
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:02,230
onto the custom I'll suburban this a
question to ask

682
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:05,990
term also for also pointed out the
problems of

683
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:09,869
except of a web metrics

684
00:43:09,869 --> 00:43:13,329
alright so we also the okay

685
00:43:13,329 --> 00:43:16,960
what he wanted to hear you take you

686
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,130
excellent schools okay I'll

687
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:23,559
so of course we try to come up alone
approach and

688
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:28,440
we soon noticed some Hall

689
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,589
similarities are just little comic strip
some of you might know it

690
00:43:32,589 --> 00:43:37,039
another already totally got a lot of
meeting since last August movie

691
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:40,049
basically every meeting came up with a
different approach

692
00:43:40,049 --> 00:43:43,650
and at the end of each meeting with yet
business got this will book

693
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:48,130
and then two weeks or four weeks of the
we look that is a

694
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:52,150
yeah we have to adjust some

695
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:56,450
and so we went on

696
00:43:56,450 --> 00:44:03,450
dick

697
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:10,059
like this

698
00:44:10,059 --> 00:44:15,329
walls up I'm that's also one of our main
advantages

699
00:44:15,329 --> 00:44:21,230
um the experience and lot of I'm
examples for for the rating from from

700
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:23,240
all the assessments

701
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:27,869
okay so um design goals on symmetric
balsa and provide a superior to you

702
00:44:27,869 --> 00:44:31,200
rating that can be used for proper
privatization

703
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,200
I'm off on abilities because that's a
small

704
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:38,410
one of the most important questions okay
what kind of our abilities to have to

705
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:38,890
fix

706
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:42,260
first I'm okay sometimes

707
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:47,260
I'm I have some problems as my present
are not able to use it and pressing the

708
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,140
wrong buttons

709
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:52,619
sundress and the prop I'll known as a
very

710
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:56,599
although I'm running a personal firewall
a.m. when I'm located in the

711
00:44:56,599 --> 00:45:00,680
nuclear conference network and the wrote
some warning so

712
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:04,250
maybe some of the guys are playing a
role in trying to a computer's

713
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:08,019
to not today guys I

714
00:45:08,019 --> 00:45:13,440
okay a so it was about writers Asian ans
the question what kind of fun ability to

715
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,299
have to fix

716
00:45:14,299 --> 00:45:18,470
for us yet it should be lightweight
approach

717
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:21,869
was easy questions clear questions

718
00:45:21,869 --> 00:45:26,420
I am that can be all that gives some
interesting information related to pen

719
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:27,510
test results

720
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:30,690
maybe all that results from also
discussing a

721
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:34,289
to his magic for of all results and easy

722
00:45:34,289 --> 00:45:38,589
and efficient to on saw questions clean
your questions results

723
00:45:38,589 --> 00:45:42,269
a lot of a dependencies and to our

724
00:45:42,269 --> 00:45:45,500
questions that are popping up so um

725
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:49,849
we decided okay um what are the
questions we should answer

726
00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:52,869
um from all sides and from the
customer's perfect

727
00:45:52,869 --> 00:45:56,390
perspective ants finally

728
00:45:56,390 --> 00:46:00,480
after a long fight sry agreed to five
categories

729
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,109
early I'm still not particularly happy
with the names of them

730
00:46:04,109 --> 00:46:07,740
its yeah but that but the newest fabric
325

731
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:11,890
I so make me because that's a huge
problem I

732
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:15,519
as a maybe you can't come to continue
our fight later on answer

733
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:19,359
that's it so I'm the first category was
about characteristics of the

734
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:22,529
viability um exploit ability

735
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:26,289
impact mediation what's with

736
00:46:26,289 --> 00:46:30,339
is also questions asked very very often
and of course again

737
00:46:30,339 --> 00:46:34,569
the environment are because arm that's
important

738
00:46:34,569 --> 00:46:37,869
to get some kind of individual rating
I'm

739
00:46:37,869 --> 00:46:41,490
customer related rating looking at the
characteristics

740
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:44,910
we also have the excess Victor yeah

741
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:48,170
we have something we call required
privilege

742
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:51,359
level compromise

743
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:55,619
level I'm roots show the

744
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:59,559
the things we can fit into those points
later on the 20 and the question

745
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:02,690
is a qualified proof of concept so

746
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:07,010
it's the pen tester really exploit the
vulnerability or is it okay I have fun

747
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:08,010
of my tits ken

748
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:12,099
Anza let steps God is telling me there's
a significant problem

749
00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:15,500
okay check secret sexual problem

750
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:19,700
which might be notes a a good source for
that lately

751
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:23,470
then expert blood's ability on

752
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:27,410
basically all also what we always get
asked is okay and who is able to exploit

753
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:28,319
that

754
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:32,319
what he fought um so after required
skill level

755
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:36,039
as it like an automatic to will simply
use a script kiddie that can exploit

756
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:38,660
this vulnerability or is it a very
skilled and motivated

757
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:42,269
attica and with the time to exploit
along

758
00:47:42,269 --> 00:47:45,339
does it take them as a skilled and
motivated

759
00:47:45,339 --> 00:47:49,230
take out that still to implement Siro
the exploitation

760
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:53,769
because there was like a known problem
problem but no home

761
00:47:53,769 --> 00:47:57,490
solicit develop exploit code because is
nice but code available

762
00:47:57,490 --> 00:48:02,680
will take them at least two to four
weeks to you develop this exploit code

763
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,980
aunt the city to buy hardware

764
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:09,809
any other equipment inflight
entertainment systems

765
00:48:09,809 --> 00:48:13,809
cannot detect the cross occurrence apply
the plane for dim sum

766
00:48:13,809 --> 00:48:17,089
kind of research spot right to commence
an offer that

767
00:48:17,089 --> 00:48:21,630
yeah I then this is some

768
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:27,559
the last one insider know how require
yep

769
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:30,880
some so

770
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,319
human resources that website where we
want to clearly distinguish between

771
00:48:35,319 --> 00:48:39,029
results just yeah it's a certificate the
differences

772
00:48:39,029 --> 00:48:43,329
spend time versus have a lot of money
for example to buy

773
00:48:43,329 --> 00:48:47,440
a play you or something else

774
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,519
as well as like inside on the whole do
you need to know intelligent user names

775
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:52,250
are you need to know

776
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:55,599
source code of custom developed
application something like that

777
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,000
and the most relevant item in here
enabling

778
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,519
mother ability pressed if required is a
vulnerability in

779
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:08,119
the cat only be exploiters part of a
chain:

780
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:12,579
like to you Jeff like other Realty that
gets a system access and then you can

781
00:49:12,579 --> 00:49:18,819
on local root exploit something like
that to change vulnerability is

782
00:49:18,819 --> 00:49:25,059
its its it's also about the naming of
the description of the finding

783
00:49:25,059 --> 00:49:30,509
your and the cold but also a strong
fight because we're discussing okay

784
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:33,849
I'm what about this kind of change
exploits

785
00:49:33,849 --> 00:49:37,720
your and how can we solve its use stuff
like this

786
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:41,769
or a.m. gif if the soft another name

787
00:49:41,769 --> 00:49:45,480
but it's also about the testing
methodology yeah for example you looking

788
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,569
for cross-site scripting looking for a
single injection

789
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:52,779
a and of course might maybe you can
combine some other findings to

790
00:49:52,779 --> 00:49:57,990
fully compromise the system I am

791
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:01,549
is its useful a.m. to to write another

792
00:50:01,549 --> 00:50:06,660
by the finding like combined cross some
secret action whatever take

793
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:09,740
for um

794
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:12,869
I'm leads to system compromise

795
00:50:12,869 --> 00:50:16,859
of focusing on the on the more the
turbine abilities and finally

796
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:20,420
a.m. to stop the fight we agreed okay we
were put the stuff

797
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:24,690
insight no so we have we have both
possibilities

798
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:28,829
we can use this um um for for making
some kind

799
00:50:28,829 --> 00:50:32,329
of a relationship to another fallibility
some kind of change

800
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:35,539
exploits but we also have the
opportunity to say

801
00:50:35,539 --> 00:50:39,670
we're talking about a system compromise
fire crisis gripping and single

802
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:41,380
injection and whatever's injection

803
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:44,420
and a local root exploit and so false a

804
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:48,740
sobils options a possible the lysozyme
rocks the channel on so if this is a

805
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,650
very very simple such

806
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:54,609
because as a still for incredibly
complex problem to address

807
00:50:54,609 --> 00:50:58,660
we didn't want to have actually CrossRef
references

808
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:01,910
like reference into other findings
because that's not maintain

809
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:05,769
that's really not maintainable soviet a
single switch

810
00:51:05,769 --> 00:51:08,980
if this an ailing mother on their
abilities present

811
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:12,890
yep this finding is more relevant
because we actually be exploited

812
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:16,619
after a hurry up a little bit so a the
next one is impact

813
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:19,660
to make it wrought um we set okay

814
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:23,890
we don't want to talk about
confidentiality and the level of

815
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:27,829
a in and the level of from

816
00:51:27,829 --> 00:51:32,109
a section of a confidentiality it's just
on so the question is compensated

817
00:51:32,109 --> 00:51:32,750
effected

818
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:36,450
yes on No we don't care about how much

819
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:39,619
yeah because what again one of the
Court's well was too

820
00:51:39,619 --> 00:51:43,009
on so the question quite easily

821
00:51:43,009 --> 00:51:46,740
so a.m. and that relates to come for the
cells integrity and

822
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:50,420
availability than mitigation effort

823
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:53,910
basically how much time do you have to
spent fix it

824
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:57,680
and does it depend on the phone party

825
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:01,730
yes to ask the window for a patch to
outsourced development for eventual

826
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:03,390
something like that

827
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:07,130
now you might wonder why this does
increase is a the grid is a severity you

828
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:10,470
of a vulnerability system comprises a
system

829
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:14,329
mice middle like fix but is also very

830
00:52:14,329 --> 00:52:17,579
struggle it in the end to custom also
wants to know

831
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:22,069
what do they want to fix August so if
you can

832
00:52:22,069 --> 00:52:26,160
supposedly you have to completely
identical on their abilities

833
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,339
resulting critical impact

834
00:52:30,339 --> 00:52:33,869
left same other abilities want us to fix
within one day

835
00:52:33,869 --> 00:52:38,180
but the other one you need for weeks 621

836
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:42,049
that you could fix within one day fast
because it increases your

837
00:52:42,049 --> 00:52:45,539
secured to the immediately you don't
have to wait for for weeks

838
00:52:45,539 --> 00:52:49,150
so that's but dislike increases the
criticality if you can

839
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:52,940
live sex easy you want to

840
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:58,210
have to security benefit now not in four
weeks and then again like to one day if

841
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:02,210
and praxis because you can like parallel
book

842
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:05,930
still wants sis elementary approach

843
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:09,130
okay that's one loss the environment

844
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:12,190
a the first part I'll throw things trust
level of

845
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:16,279
accessing entities what kind of users

846
00:53:16,279 --> 00:53:21,039
are using a.m. the applications a system
whatever

847
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:24,640
for example the people all the people in
the brought

848
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,170
external partners just to enterprise

849
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:31,849
your or only a department in your
enterprise

850
00:53:31,849 --> 00:53:36,099
%uh so-and-so what what's the kind of
trust Washington

851
00:53:36,099 --> 00:53:39,970
trustworthiness the trust level of this
accessing entities

852
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:43,450
its easy out to have some policies and
guidelines and your company and tell

853
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:44,279
your people hold

854
00:53:44,279 --> 00:53:49,039
a how to behave yeah then have contracts
was part nurse

855
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:54,480
and regulate that or evening a.m. try to
to introduce some kind of guidelines for

856
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,450
the world

857
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:58,559
for all the users outside in the world

858
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:03,130
then very important from all sides the
data classification of the assets

859
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:08,559
your um are you dealing with public data
I was confidential date up

860
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:11,980
yeah and a.m. the expression this

861
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:15,440
is a target or the acid a critical call

862
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,839
business service how important this is
stuff

863
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:25,210
for you then and to soccer 11 problem if
you are on site guy okay

864
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:29,529
and this availability important for your
application yes

865
00:54:29,529 --> 00:54:32,970
so it's always the same answer so we
tried to

866
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:36,059
22 to to make a question like 10,001+

867
00:54:36,059 --> 00:54:39,200
our outage be tolerated it's a

868
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:43,220
and some across its Rick was again a lot
of Finance

869
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:46,700
eff ort I'm to my computer on some okay
no

870
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:50,910
justices again missus like the most
accurate version of this

871
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:54,240
yup there's a lot of us in this but this
from our experience

872
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,740
this is the idea where you like get an
idea how critical the application

873
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:02,749
that system actually yes last but not
least other external or compliance

874
00:55:02,749 --> 00:55:04,859
requirements that relate to your

875
00:55:04,859 --> 00:55:08,249
education services like PCI and for
false

876
00:55:08,249 --> 00:55:11,609
so I'm that was also one point

877
00:55:11,609 --> 00:55:14,930
then um went to do something lighter I'm

878
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:20,509
a great Fecteau wrote how important are
the individual questions for the rating

879
00:55:20,509 --> 00:55:23,809
some are more important than other us
%uh

880
00:55:23,809 --> 00:55:28,140
I'm to hurry up a little bit that other
values I want to I'm

881
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:31,829
and discuss them in detail and finally
I'm

882
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:36,130
we ended up with a from 0.2 few quite of
simple formula

883
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:39,410
that's only the complex representation
yeah

884
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:43,119
so I'm if you remember I'm optimistic
not a smarter

885
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:46,839
yeah it's just about I making
multiplication

886
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:49,960
of the wait and a.m. the results

887
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:53,749
a summarize values your ansa

888
00:55:53,749 --> 00:55:57,999
by the flood was hundreds divided to the
maximum possible results that's also

889
00:55:57,999 --> 00:55:59,579
again some rice

890
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:03,079
um we try to keep up the formula quite
basic

891
00:56:03,079 --> 00:56:06,930
because I think and complexity also
kills is this kind of

892
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:11,650
um I'm ma such a putting into the
application

893
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:15,420
okay next short the mall

894
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:18,650
you up I'm of course we have

895
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:23,630
also another lunches waiting but nooo
said we can go over time for 10 minutes

896
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:27,869
I area

897
00:56:27,869 --> 00:56:31,619
yeah we dunno not well trained by and oh
so we are not guilty

898
00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:36,480
it's alright let me know if you let
tumko leaks some that are known to like

899
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,609
Choi hear themselves talk I

900
00:56:39,609 --> 00:56:44,690
that's what happens we help

901
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:47,720
okay to tell you that have to do with
time on Friday

902
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:51,950
I okay let's %uh let's go to lou that
you have

903
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:57,319
W I it's because you always calling me
the other two

904
00:56:57,319 --> 00:57:01,789
I up

905
00:57:01,789 --> 00:57:04,880
that's a bit of hot sauce on a social
wasting your time

906
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,180
so I I let's have a look at a at the
metric

907
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:12,039
um the RW Rep it rating system

908
00:57:12,039 --> 00:57:15,099
that's a %uh how we called it yeah

909
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:18,319
year five characteristics exploit
ability impact

910
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:21,499
environment mitigation a and to

911
00:57:21,499 --> 00:57:25,999
nice and fancy the graph to visualize
the stuff

912
00:57:25,999 --> 00:57:30,039
%uh the options offers the access
Victoria internet business of Business

913
00:57:30,039 --> 00:57:30,940
Partner Network

914
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:34,180
corporate network not network segment

local system required privilege level

916
00:57:38,509 --> 00:57:41,960
of indicated authenticated user
administrator

917
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:46,460
compromise Leveaux which this one of the
most important things from our point of

918
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:47,499
view

919
00:57:47,499 --> 00:57:50,970
privileged system compromise which means
root access

920
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:54,410
untrue system compromise which means
something like

921
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:59,109
excess was use a nobody owns we have a
major Dolce mine a Dolce

922
00:57:59,109 --> 00:58:03,230
are we talking about major information
disclosure my the information disclosed

923
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:03,940
I'll

924
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:07,109
or stuff like best practice violation

925
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:11,009
there's a book that tells you that you
don't use HDTV

926
00:58:11,009 --> 00:58:14,119
that you have to use the it should be
only attributes

927
00:58:14,119 --> 00:58:18,890
when setting cookies a not looking at
your requirements maybe want to deal

928
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:20,609
with the quickness and job creation is
up

929
00:58:20,609 --> 00:58:25,920
world-famous trace yup

930
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:32,920
way yeah

931
00:58:34,999 --> 00:58:38,079
that we have a a lot of yes and no
questions

932
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:42,880
was a qualified proof of concept
document we have to exploit ability

933
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,200
take a skill sets scripted user IT

think about Capt salt site there

938
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:04,349

all required

940
00:59:08,269 --> 00:59:11,789
well as a set confidentiality develop
effective

941
00:59:11,789 --> 00:59:15,079
related to the process state on the
assets

942
00:59:15,079 --> 00:59:20,150
%uh with have some kind of relationship
to the data classification

943
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:25,509
on the system you see the trust level
department at the price partners public

944
00:59:25,509 --> 00:59:30,470
data classification up the process state
of which also requires that you have

945
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:32,980
some kind of data classification to all
tools

946
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:36,730
question a hopefully you have

947
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:40,220
and then just call to the business of us
can run all

948
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:43,249
tolerated external requirements lock

949
00:59:43,249 --> 00:59:46,799
mitigation for again less than one day
and more than one month

950
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:51,230
and I'm the checkbook depends on
third-party software

951
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:54,279
and I think now let's just have assault
lookouts

952
00:59:54,279 --> 00:59:57,440
sick with injection again yeah because

953
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:02,999
this might be much more easier a too and
so is he so our point of view

954
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:07,460
excess vector ok it's the same yet
because we're assuming the same

955
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:08,589
viability

956
01:00:08,589 --> 01:00:12,220
yeah so its Internet required privilege
level

957
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:17,210
wasn't so it fits oats authenticate

958
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:24,210
another ticket sorry compromise lever

959
01:00:24,759 --> 01:00:27,869
that we have a system compromise

960
01:00:27,869 --> 01:00:32,690
no that we have a denial-of-service
scenario

961
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:38,069
no a.m. that we have a major information
disclosure

962
01:00:38,069 --> 01:00:42,950
yes now by the way to make the thick
stuff much for easy a

963
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:46,249
if you own a troy if you want to fill
out major dos all major information

964
01:00:46,249 --> 01:00:47,279
disclosure

965
01:00:47,279 --> 01:00:50,640
its rated at the same leather so on to
switch

966
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:54,390
also makes the stuff much more easier to
fill out

967
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:57,829
so what do you say its major information
flows

968
01:00:57,829 --> 01:01:01,099
it take a stance that Snooki use

969
01:01:01,099 --> 01:01:04,630
IT professionals good motivated to take
up

970
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:07,690
scripted time takes yeah

971
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:13,480
its a.m. time to exploits

972
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:17,180
less than one day okay

973
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:20,930
financial F or private feasible everyone
agrees

974
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:26,180
know if not then and not everybody who
present inside an are required

975
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:29,440
no company says he defected yes

976
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:33,279
integrity yes availability

977
01:01:33,279 --> 01:01:38,140
yes trust lever

978
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:41,740
public or workshop

979
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:45,730
up data classification

980
01:01:45,730 --> 01:01:48,880
public who went on

981
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,799
confidential strictly confidential

982
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:55,869
it depends but at least you

983
01:01:55,869 --> 01:01:59,170
should be able to answer this question
up so

984
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:02,539
let's assume that's a confidential

985
01:02:02,539 --> 01:02:06,890
some credit cards data it's not so
important report from my point of view

986
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:10,099
um social five dollars a.m. and you get
five

987
01:02:10,099 --> 01:02:16,049
after Sony XO

988
01:02:16,049 --> 01:02:20,759
yeah that's right okay is a cooperative
Business Office

989
01:02:20,759 --> 01:02:24,039
again it depends spots you can answer
the question

990
01:02:24,039 --> 01:02:27,119
to okay we assume the same

991
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:31,499
environment as to CBS so is a
cooperative Business Office

992
01:02:31,499 --> 01:02:35,269
kenya oo to tolerate its

993
01:02:35,269 --> 01:02:39,769
in all or yet okay no checkbooks

994
01:02:39,769 --> 01:02:43,559
external or compliance requirements PCI

995
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:46,609
yet mitigation

996
01:02:46,609 --> 01:02:50,299
before less than one day okay

997
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:53,299
depends on third-party yes

998
01:02:53,299 --> 01:02:56,420
yes okay

999
01:02:56,420 --> 01:03:00,099
so mmm

1000
01:03:00,099 --> 01:03:03,859
we get all rating looks family law

1001
01:03:03,859 --> 01:03:08,619
yeah with charm all CVSS rating

1002
01:03:08,619 --> 01:03:12,299
also a super-injunction we feel that's a
critical problem

1003
01:03:12,299 --> 01:03:15,980
your metrics s as a critical problem and

1004
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:20,029
just two end up this example let's
assume

1005
01:03:20,029 --> 01:03:24,509
that we have a sequel injection problem
on the public system

1006
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:28,309
um that just gives you some catalog data

1007
01:03:28,309 --> 01:03:32,890
no credit cards are processed no
confidential data processed

1008
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:37,140
is a sequel injection problem still a
critical problem

1009
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:43,180
in that case who thinks it's still a
critical problem

1010
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:48,200
that's true %uh some does not

1011
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:51,660
the song no no clear decision

1012
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:56,749
of the and raising yeah but but let's
assume from from look for the better

1013
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:57,410
part

1014
01:03:57,410 --> 01:04:00,999
we have internet yes I'll
unauthenticated

1015
01:04:00,999 --> 01:04:04,380
its might be not not

1016
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:08,230
a major information is close up anymore
because it's about the catalogue

1017
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:12,009
and you can browse the kid looks so you
would get the data anyway

1018
01:04:12,009 --> 01:04:15,579
so it's all only a minor information
disclosure

1019
01:04:15,579 --> 01:04:20,079
a.m. is confidentiality effect it's

1020
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:23,420
no public tater catalog

1021
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:27,670
isn't equity effect it's

1022
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:31,730
if you can change its too okay
availability effect it

1023
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:35,739
might also be true but me something to
tell if you change

1024
01:04:35,739 --> 01:04:38,920
then we have to change the data
classification

1025
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:43,630
its public up if it's just the capital
of

1026
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:47,019
might this be a critical business
applications it depends spots

1027
01:04:47,019 --> 01:04:50,730
to be I would be what assume that is a
is one

1028
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:54,559
about at least you're you already get
the state yellow

1029
01:04:54,559 --> 01:05:00,039
yeah just changing the pair which gets
of which creates more familar with a

1030
01:05:00,039 --> 01:05:04,049
sequin texan problem um address only
effects

1031
01:05:04,049 --> 01:05:08,069
the system with peptic data ants

1032
01:05:08,069 --> 01:05:12,579
finally with alt a privilege system
compromise

1033
01:05:12,579 --> 01:05:15,930
which would change the situation of
course if you can take over the break

1034
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:17,630
the system

1035
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:22,859
so it's reasonable the small point of
view

1036
01:05:22,859 --> 01:05:26,470
the sort

1037
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:30,519
yeah all that's right so we are 67

1038
01:05:30,519 --> 01:05:34,079
no all yeah not

1039
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:38,160
tech I okay okay that's as this as a
shot

1040
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:41,890
I'll do then we have to amend points

1041
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:44,920
finalize so

1042
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:48,460
I'll if you wanna do if much more

1043
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:53,499
index not this point we have a %uh CVSS
and I think we already

1044
01:05:53,499 --> 01:05:57,670
I'll laid out some of the relevant
points you so

1045
01:05:57,670 --> 01:06:01,869
you see that was easier to fill out with
the same results

1046
01:06:01,869 --> 01:06:05,680
you able to adjust most of the stuff but

1047
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:09,160
yet two examples are you can say we
choose to man up

1048
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:12,700
a nice way actually be prepared more
examples

1049
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:16,519
some of them most of them fit of course
because be giving a presentation

1050
01:06:16,519 --> 01:06:20,099
yet I pots

1051
01:06:20,099 --> 01:06:23,160
there are something at the beginning
because of

1052
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:27,470
audit findings something like a week
past month policy

1053
01:06:27,470 --> 01:06:31,009
um on if you if you stumble into that if

1054
01:06:31,009 --> 01:06:34,150
and so it's official backup but they
still need it

1055
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:38,150
even though this is not necessarily the
focus of a penetration test would still

1056
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:38,920
matched

1057
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:42,089
order to increase overall level of
security thing

1058
01:06:42,089 --> 01:06:45,660
that will help them so such let's just
call it

1059
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:49,160
audit findings you will not be able to

1060
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:52,980
school like 100 percent picture with
this metric

1061
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:57,069
we are out of touch we don't think it
will fit that into that metric

1062
01:06:57,069 --> 01:07:00,150
will come up with other one you'll see

1063
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:04,009
because we're break the usability
finally and trying to

1064
01:07:04,009 --> 01:07:08,460
and to to everything was was one
approach it will break the usability

1065
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:11,650
and that false 100 megawatts was to make

1066
01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:14,779
ought to construct a usable one

1067
01:07:14,779 --> 01:07:18,630
I think what we make the entering the
talk with metrics a hot

1068
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:22,299
be discover that the hard way I mean
it's not a big surprise but still

1069
01:07:22,299 --> 01:07:26,380
few thoughts if you discover it and

1070
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:29,720
have a clear understanding of the
questions that both sites

1071
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:34,069
arts months there are several questions
in this metric

1072
01:07:34,069 --> 01:07:37,690
a pretty sure some of you want at West
is in this category was that formulate

1073
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:40,859
it that way waste is increasing or
decreasing the stuff

1074
01:07:40,859 --> 01:07:44,910
arm actually to try to two approaches
from

1075
01:07:44,910 --> 01:07:48,069
doing nice categories and using
information you know one group that

1076
01:07:48,069 --> 01:07:49,059
together

1077
01:07:49,059 --> 01:07:52,950
um you will miss some points always at
the question in mind

1078
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:56,579
both sites can on so and want to months

1079
01:07:56,579 --> 01:08:01,119
and the singles at least between
directly exploitable vulnerabilities

1080
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:04,299
single injection on not directly explode
on

1081
01:08:04,299 --> 01:08:07,400
vulnerabilities audit findings
insufficient backup

1082
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:11,960
sup stuff this request if watch

1083
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:15,960
an hour really still really interested
in topics

1084
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:19,230
there's probably more to come chrome the

1085
01:08:19,230 --> 01:08:22,370
conclusions again got metrics our hearts

1086
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:25,630
a he saves that produce hot fights

1087
01:08:25,630 --> 01:08:28,780
bottom learn to

1088
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:33,260
but there were traded for doing the
sites up but from our point of view

1089
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:36,350
I'm we are in the face if you could say
okay we are trojan

1090
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:39,720
a old of nine to and

1091
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:42,820
I we think that's it's more usable are

1092
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:46,840
at least better usable than CVS as at
the moment and of course more intrusive

1093
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:47,550
than

1094
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:50,660
a CWS s um

1095
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:54,780
which didn't have any kind of
improvement since almost two years

1096
01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:58,270
a.m. it's a kind of starting points the

1097
01:08:58,270 --> 01:09:01,859
to work for example was some kind of
intern custom metrics

1098
01:09:01,859 --> 01:09:05,830
error um if our concept doesn't work for

1099
01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:10,310
this for you a.m. we are rather might be
some

1100
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:14,910
special cases a.m. where are our
approach

1101
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:17,950
won't work let's say the best way but

1102
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:21,310
be tried to test it Rhys all these kind
of

1103
01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:25,100
a special cases looking at trace

1104
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:28,570
HTTP trace method and a bird looking at

1105
01:09:28,570 --> 01:09:32,220
findings like HTTP only attributes not
sets

1106
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:35,990
yeah this kinda fading fine except all
always discussed

1107
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:39,270
if they are real findings or on I'm

1108
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:42,420
how to deal with them Orantes a

1109
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:47,630
for now I'll as we said that we have a
lot of example findings we can use for

1110
01:09:47,630 --> 01:09:48,540
the rating

1111
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:52,980
but at least a metric need some kind of
experience from the field

1112
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:56,720
and that's why we have produced a strong
this tool will be

1113
01:09:56,720 --> 01:10:00,470
ever able not shortly after the
conference because as one

1114
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:05,850
other thing that I want to put into the
true the possibility to say if your work

1115
01:10:05,850 --> 01:10:09,870
yeah not just have to cater data like
putting in OK

1116
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:13,000
I'm reading a sequel injections a
statement

1117
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,740
safe so you have the possibility to
loaded again

1118
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:21,530
and to another rating or at additional
ratings and

1119
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:24,900
after implementing this functions it
would be released

1120
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:28,640
and together with maybe blog post on
news that we will see

1121
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:33,190
and earthed will be for free so you are
able to download it

1122
01:10:33,190 --> 01:10:37,350
and the tour will be available for Mac
OS X Windows and Linux

1123
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:40,850
a not only and it's not based on Java

1124
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:45,750
I yeah I

1125
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:49,620
I okay and finally

1126
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:55,200
a.m. thank you for asking questions
during the talks I like that much more

1127
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:56,410
than done

1128
01:10:56,410 --> 01:10:59,700
asking for questions after the talks so

1129
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:03,190
thank you for interaction and if you did
notice that

1130
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:06,250
breaks moment and hopefully this

1131
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:09,420
that ants maybe you notice thats a.m.

1132
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:13,320
would give you one minute to think about
it and the terms of tokens

1133
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:16,450
and before ending up with all slights
just a short

1134
01:11:16,450 --> 01:11:20,760
didn't okay and thank you not suggest
over lunch
