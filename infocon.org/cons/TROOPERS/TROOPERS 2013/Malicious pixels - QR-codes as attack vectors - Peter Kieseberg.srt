1
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:05,800
so in a few cases

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,890
ok case that back and I'm with SB
research

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:13,390
that's a small nonprofit research SFU

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,500
in the end up I don't want to talk about

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,170
quite a court security actually what's
this talk about

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,730
all it's about a collection of things

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,960
that all we thought we had two ideas we
had during a loft

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,860
your son all things were sold from other
people so everything I'm

9
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:37,650
presenting as made by us well mention
what stop us yeah that's a good rough

10
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,050
again there are what we are doing well
well %uh

11
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,879
come teach topic a hearing to talk it
was the population

12
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,170
are some what was before small see you

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,399
at least we end up croco to getting more
and more popular

14
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,920
everybody has to have a to the bar code
summer if you like the company

15
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,640
you're not legend without having a
product putting some some

16
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,870
Co summer often but I think it's

17
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,240
thing s thereof not human readable okay
obviously but people are buying into

18
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:08,630
them

19
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:12,120
so you see people actually scanning some
by me using them

20
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,820
goal of our let's I Maurice for me
companies using down

21
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,490
on yourself obviously working when there
was a poll

22
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,009
we are talking Paul called abuse by FX
phone fail it

23
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:27,810
I'll let you all know I think most def
con 16

24
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,009
where he howl of fun with I won the
National Mall coats

25
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,350
and also mentioned are the pub
possibility of extending this to

26
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,490
two-dimensional or

27
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,590
Marcos yes and then there was a sumsung

28
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,850
the bike Oh what their DB cooper problem
with some some phones home 12

29
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,450
are with the USS these very could
execute

30
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,740
are things on your phone are

31
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,689
justice peacoat on the phone well are
remotely

32
00:01:55,689 --> 00:02:00,119
so picked on background about choir
coats

33
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,189
what we've planned when using crock oats

34
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:06,530
actually work run run to but that is
away from Japan

35
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,649
1994 and remember

36
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:13,760
never ever defiant for putting them some
work

37
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,610
out in the public and I think people
scan these things director for logistics

38
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,129
for confidence for Toyota

39
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:23,530
arm why arm

40
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,560
especially if you cross the creek
complex machines but

41
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,790
especially the aircraft I fit specially
for airplanes

42
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,900
if something fails you have to be a law

43
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,840
for pract back AFRICOM Pontifical
screwing the screw is decide to hold for

44
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,890
ten thousand dollars

45
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,209
it phase of the two thousand dollars you
want to go back no

46
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:46,040
where and when did we produce two screws
the screws that would produce at the

47
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,610
same time do we have to same problems
and on and on on

48
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:52,530
yep to store all of the time thats whats
the reason for the croco to actually

49
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,690
to help a machine-readable coat but come

50
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,450
can contain quite a huge amount quite
large amount of a

51
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:04,129
so what issues now they say actually are
still used in that

52
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:08,299
the chief State's but now there's still
more commodity

53
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:12,150
paying yet been well with his/her

54
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:18,019
think up backs we have to call coat some
with some nice nice

55
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:21,110
I'll link or someone else

56
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:25,810
advertisement obviously often with some
a colorful elements inside

57
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:31,049
to have a bit more arm out but to add a
bit more for the advertising company

58
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:35,409
and now last 30 min a korean with the
name pratt was a member of croco diffuse

59
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:36,180
Carrasco

60
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,730
I think you're are directed to the main
suffered violence mince

61
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,150
meant factory well

62
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:48,340
what these o'clock ok actually go up for
forty different versions of croco that

63
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,489
security code

64
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:53,129
are worth 21 277 models

65
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:56,720
with discussed or quite a large amount
of data

66
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,060
so and it allows for different sources
coatings

67
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,750
taken store numbers you can store of
America set off some of america's some

68
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,400
balls which mostly used for

69
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,849
I links are you can store

70
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:16,340
some HP Director beta they can even
store can geez

71
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,750
arm nah that's there's a desire to some
both the

72
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,140
the chinese symbols used by the Japanese

73
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,200
you're fully call upon in this are

74
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,250
coats and also other coats on

75
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:33,360
its giant rolling stock industry
standard industry leading coatings

76
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,620
and it's possible to have your own molds

77
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,760
if you're like if you want to define but
this possible actually

78
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,250
same its from overcome

79
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:48,860
later this for mixing bowls well some
other characteristics

80
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:53,620
very mean to rip Ayesha and we can cope
with a fair bit of distortion

81
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,740
I that's needed if you want to print
usually I say it was a plan to print

82
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,000
them on posters

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,240
was planned to print on all parts on
packagings

84
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,970
there so they have to arm be able to
cope with this portion

85
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,980
of to provide your corrections for
different levels

86
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,250
seven-percent 1525 30 at least

87
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,080
so you should the pink coat are you get
the bit more

88
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,710
error correction out of them on

89
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,850
it's a free standard still on but that
it's on't and

90
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,890
up a them too but benzo what the f are
so that

91
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:31,690
us be allowed to free use of the
standard underskirt removal of

92
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:35,560
a fair amount of the course available

93
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,560
well what the structure of such as
karach code

94
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,680
actually the most baller fingers to find
a pet on

95
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,200
the razor fine various Ford scan to
identify the Colt

96
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,580
to identify with patient amongst other

97
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,950
so there's although methods to but this
is one do is a first for

98
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:00,390
second rock separators between the

99
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:03,890
arm any the

100
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:07,410
aren't its final patterns

101
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,710
third-worst timing parents are these arm

102
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,190
to rose here they're always looking the
same

103
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,350
there for your forearm and the evening
to device

104
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:22,050
to fix to coordinate system it uses
internally for

105
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:26,050
decoding the cold also arm

106
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,150
additional used additional arm
information on the

107
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,930
on on diversions years cost-conscious
can't count can count

108
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,380
the number of pixels here and
furthermore

109
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:42,250
arm it's used for of a cock leading the
pixel with

110
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,480
gonna do a liar and patterns if you've
got beer coats you've got too much more

111
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:45,770
in

112
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,370
of them in the first person you've
gotten on Amanda

113
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:54,080
to up to six version you got one and
then it starts getting more more MORE

114
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,600
kills your four on distortion for up
main the forearm

115
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:05,110
going for coping with extortion then
you've got to 41 information here

116
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:11,450
your its source arm where things like up
version of the car coat

117
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,900
and a mosque in I'll come to this layer
in use

118
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,170
around are they are a correction

119
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,710
and here's here if they are the data
part

120
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,380
actually there were no terror it's it's
simply sport systematically

121
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,980
a first for the store to you then it
goes up biggest on again

122
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:32,090
corpse so it's just some kind of sick
sec line

123
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:36,230
great start of the worst years stick
error correction bits

124
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,500
an awful under some remain the pits to
me depending on the

125
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,030
or self to cart

126
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:46,100
well a set for my asking arm

127
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,240
it's important that up the distribution
of

128
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,940
black-and-white modles justice pixels a
cold s

129
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,890
first equal and its equally distributed
about the whole cold with exception of

130
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:57,530
the

131
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:03,140
finder Petrus and that's why San they a
set of 8 mosques is used

132
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:07,120
so first if you jar croco to you can
call to make a source encoding of a

133
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,990
dater

134
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,460
animating calling inside the invite the
choir mosque

135
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,520
off the wall trick so walk all 8 mosques

136
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,480
on your cock out and then you take the
wall you select the one

137
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,940
that are at the best distribution fur
coat

138
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:27,040
so slight changes in the underlying arm

139
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,080
information course of a complete change
the

140
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,539
cold in the QR code and the resulting
due to another

141
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:37,419
mosque being used even though this is a

142
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:41,060
systematic echoing okay

143
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:45,610
the first thing that's nothing with it I
think it's a roommate all

144
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:49,370
well know maybe on this issue secure
peacoats

145
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,150
your fifties all stripes a supplementary
service they aren't so the finances

146
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,450
under standard and it

147
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,440
art some way for getting communication
between cell phone

148
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,410
I'm the provider on a three-time
connection

149
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:07,010
and you can do things like phone cover
it configuration retrieving

150
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:10,800
showing hearings the and such you remind
such things

151
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,810
arts also used for mobile money services

152
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,430
and it was a really quick call choir I
wish on cup or cone coffee Robbie

153
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,900
on the fuck's sake they on Tuesday worry

154
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,180
our way to the Big Dipper in the because
of using is a star Dr

155
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,870
you assistant coats for various

00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:24,740
just of printing out militias croco its
put them somewhere on the wall

187
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,990
and wait for people to scan

188
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,510
when you have fun or not they don't

189
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:36,380
okay that's one thing yellow thing

190
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,590
nice is fishing with QR codes so what
what's the idea behind all these

191
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,770
advertisements you have no work has been
to secure our court let's say

192
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:47,860
login with your Amazon account and
because cold love in with your Amazon

00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,580
and/or sits credentials unlocks inside

197
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,779
but questions as large cock alleged I
mean users have learned

198
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:10,470
to look at or I believe users have it
learns at least to look at

199
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:14,330
%uh the hyperlinks if their face if
they're well it or not

200
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:17,950
but some cock or something you're not
human readable

201
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:22,120
because can enter Skyfall them you don't
maybe don't look maybe have a centrist

202
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,990
it looks a bit similar

203
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:27,390
even if especially if you've got a small
device just follow it

204
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:30,400
on your fished

205
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:35,120
okay that's maybe not really interesting
for the cake a fish people who can fish

206
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,890
people using hyperlinks that's true

207
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,550

225
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,100
payments overdoing payments today
there's existence since 1991 and they do

226
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:50,390
it

227
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:53,690
that things like online banking in all
strains on and on and on

228

standards

229
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:02,860
so and every bank in Austria is part of
this so they all will accept this

230
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:06,800
and they are currently pending arm I
don't then also wasn't able to tried

231
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,240
really

232
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,400
really with the bank account coast is

00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:17,350
and/or online system on butts like my
bank

235
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,710
and since they all say to all started in
I'll

236
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:24,110
second part or so second part of of

15 but OK they will do it

239
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,720
that's just an Rx for it so if we if we
have a look at this

240
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,910
arm missus or 30 that's just a
fixed-wing while you're basically saying

241
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,710
this is a payment

242
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,980
other share it's just a version of the
document renowned

243
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,180
for system 1 I'll bottle ever 11 and are
small changes like changes the first

244
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,260
version

286
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,209
black screen arm

287
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:29,220

00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:52,480
additional encodings or some some
cryptographic

294
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,040
I do you say that actually there so they
also provide you with a

295
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:00,040
toll

296
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:04,190
444 checking

297

302
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,400
although they are and put in a strain
encoded with a

303
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,630
quark alive are you half of its core

304
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,660

323
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:07,909
arm or some

324
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:14,909
other security mechanisms on added

325
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:21,140
to this al amanecer de actually what

thank you arm so

331
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:41,330
okay are things we look at rehearsal
look around everybody ever suffer

332
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,639
specter company now they split the
Crockett summer

333
00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:47,639
look at train they're stuck at the city
of a train thats connecting ran out to

334
00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:48,510
be an airport

335
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:54,570
to expand the farm I mean it's to defer
all rights for 15 minutes it cost ten

336
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,269
euro

337
00:20:55,269 --> 00:20:59,159
but you can do a check in at the train
station so I mean you to i've been

338
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:00,500
offering cost about euro

339
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:05,019
10 so welling up in long line picket
complaint on tickets could think rock

340
00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:07,630
also if answer the really big truck
repair

341
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:12,019
men's is this really your name and your
number or I with okay we

342
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:17,010
alt some of that we've all fallen for
went to the train went for the airport

343
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:22,889
arm if I think of when they saw a guy
came for controlling technique tickets

344
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:27,190
it took aim of a second to talk to take
it that give it up

345
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:31,190
back to us so don't even check a car
coat I we look at what the concept is

346
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,679
crocodile

347
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:37,320
this some now it does some pepper in the
number access a number that's printed on

348
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:37,600
the

349
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,700
on the beneath arm there's a pattern in
the model number about direction and

350
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,080
they

351
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,100
but ass sure they're still looking on
these

352
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,120
tickets I'll thing to do some really

353
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,889
tricky POSCO except is a some kind of
cyborg scanning

354
00:21:52,889 --> 00:21:57,100
my my croco but actually I think that
just it's just there for 45 min just

355
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:57,760
therefore

356
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,970
are looking cool and sexy you are and
whatever

357
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:06,409
our well production on snowy set

358
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:09,409
the origin of the call call the lost
production lines

359
00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:13,549
or actually with logistics but 24
produce for for pops

360
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:16,659
so actually a ship in Houston production
lines

361
00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:20,860
promised us know we'll stand that for
really looking saying yes this time ago

362
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,880
and gun faded everybody more or less

363
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,250
or ya proprietary systems we're
currently at

364
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:31,510
trying to get our hands on water action
there's a big goal strum

365
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:36,600
way for machine bevel Ophir and fisting
this way for machines

366
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,720
arm for for ice cream we force on

367
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,409
and they've got to acquire and quite big
scholar system for actually

368
00:22:44,409 --> 00:22:48,039
and I hope we get our hands on this test
system

369
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:51,549
and try to have some fun there with and
you see maybe

370
00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:55,240
machine coats or something so there's a
complete appropriate are and what

371
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,860
are wouldn't be able to transform this
to some but yes well

372
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:04,230
for we go back to our

373
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:08,029
advertisement posor with about would be
cool

374
00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:11,830
just fishing with up pencil I mean
you've got

375
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:16,190
all these nice post sister what what
happens if I just woke up to Wall

376
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:19,960
change call so some of the white fields
black

377
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,649
go away can do something interesting
with this character something some

378
00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:25,620
fishing code to some

379
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,889
a change us may be changing even funny
yeah

380
00:23:28,889 --> 00:23:32,120
was a force that certain way forgot to
say first took something is I'm

381
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,200
expecting for effort and money transfer
their

382
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:39,720
of higher expect this will be a huge
thing and why are two years when

383
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:44,379
in Austria when all arm when all these
of fundraising companies will start

384
00:23:44,379 --> 00:23:45,059
putting it

385
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:48,289
on their advertisements I'm so Ref
number:

386
00:23:48,289 --> 00:23:52,200
I've never comfort Wong today to head up
to make up neo

387
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,120
I would be fun having this in a real
real advertisement okay official with

388
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,600
the past

389
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:03,110
well first socially useful part or parts
want to change

390
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:08,000
miss the mosque demoss the single in
moscow use its in Co Limerick Rocco

391
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,070
actually what the store default
information

392
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:15,770
are there are eight different mosques
I'm there you stop us at: can regenerate

393
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:17,649
is 50-50 distribution in yen

394
00:24:17,649 --> 00:24:22,909
the for getting a better scanner on
changing the moscow obviously changed

395
00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:25,990
large parts of data and error correction
parts

396
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:29,460
it's in cold separately with a really
strong PT

397
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:35,909
BCH code on action within reach a care
about this much maybe it's useless basis

398
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:37,169
for further attacks for

399
00:24:37,169 --> 00:24:40,580
just changing the on maastricht let then
launching additional

400
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:45,379
tax nothing's jumping calling I lie to
you wanna say it

401
00:24:45,379 --> 00:24:49,230
they are simply store terrain in the
studying the status actually

402
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:53,369
actually it's containing blocks but
spoke to Ken usually have

403
00:24:53,369 --> 00:24:56,690
what you see if one day a POC this first
description what so

404
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:00,659
how these they tourist has to be
interpreted as an american theater isn't

405
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:04,020
of America data is Kandji

406
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:07,119
than doesn't hurt the condom iCare and
then

407
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:10,570
the data falls so you can take both

408
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:15,470
maybe manage I think owing well may be
interesting

409
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:19,299
may be interesting for Kevin Cohen
checks or changing not sick not so

410
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:23,440
not solely changing to captain Colin
month in addition to

411
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,549
are changes that could be really cool I
could pick a recall 12 next maltz

412
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:32,119
yeah I will pick up the company care
well

413
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:35,309
this lhasa block is so lovely the fact
that

414
00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:39,649
bike up to come to care there's no
terminating symbols

415
00:25:39,649 --> 00:25:43,220
forty a plug for else so it could

416
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:48,220
change this and you some kind of
overflow or underflow

417
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:53,010
before although before cuoco a flow on
the flow attacks

418
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:56,480
still want to do this is the one thing
really want to do with the production

419
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,760
line so

420
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,379
really have a shingle there because this
could prove really prove interesting

421
00:26:01,379 --> 00:26:04,490
if you've gotten mixed mode I

422
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:08,190
cooked on string encoding

423
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:11,889
are a car bomb to machine of the warts

424
00:26:11,889 --> 00:26:14,899
a beta part containing the actual

425
00:26:14,899 --> 00:26:18,350
of things to are that the actual

426
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:21,409
they are that sent the machine could be
radical

427
00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:24,470
but still we don't have hands-on as a
production and your rather expensive

428
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,740
effort

429
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:29,830
so the what's lettuce mayo lettuce what
causes a large part of your coat

430
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:33,500
actually they apart in the air
correction and

431
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:38,270
the pits the remaining bits make up the
lost part in the day doesn't code using

432
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,889
a rate so long coat so what's right so
long coat

433
00:26:40,889 --> 00:26:44,520
or its over the summer long coat source
of many of PCH coats

434
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,230
aren't there decided to defect incorrect
random

435
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:51,500
change s around mare assemble a rose

436
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,720
and their Optimo and Summit on
systematic cold for the systematic main

437
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,809
systematic means that the ok rex rabbits
are at

438
00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:01,970
art simply a pen that at the end so the
first part is your

439
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:07,169
original message not have got he your
personal

440
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:11,470
on that's why you have a date or they
are

441
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:15,200
section in the basin in the car coating
of the wats if got

442
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,500
the section with the aircraft from its

443
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,539
Iraq tomorrow maine's for the given
characteristics

444
00:27:22,539 --> 00:27:26,200
or for the account for 60 don't find the
code that's better

445
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,049
and they are here with four different
levels for a correction actually can

446
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:33,440
up this I read Psalm on calls with
completely different

447
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,090
of characteristics to so nothing special

448
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:41,059
so for space this age coats pch hope
also Caldwell the

449
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:44,770
ok sorry Hopkins ham

450
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:49,080
Colts and okay these are actually
there's or simply

451
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,080
coats working off or with polynomial
multiplication multiplication

452
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,789
or division can choose and

453
00:27:56,789 --> 00:28:00,850
support all tippit multiplication and
I'll divisions Rob Lowe

454
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:05,220
fast on fifth with characters to choose
or are commonly used air for example cue

455
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,809
used in the form of routes all my calls
for example city in Kolding

456
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:13,090
way after compact disc you know these
things before mp3's to go or

457
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:16,929
this small things that you put somewhere

458
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:20,340
the plate music or whatever so

459
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,399
actually did calculations well for

460
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:26,830
getting the whole telling cause you have
to charcoal and on that note that's a

461
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,820
primitive polynomial about the

462
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:32,750
base fan you have a sourcing coordinator
okay they wait

463
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:37,679
I get Junko day that by some to modify
so 3.fast

464
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,359
well now say okay for change

465
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:44,929
okay I think it to sign up by 20 to
scientists light

466
00:28:44,929 --> 00:28:50,289
okay disarm will have difficulty watch
along we want to change one caught so we

467
00:28:50,289 --> 00:28:50,710
are not

468
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:54,799
if we change arm a simple change around
a bit

469
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,399
around mobile in our our data section or
in the air pressure section it doesn't

470
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:00,309
matter actually

471
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:03,440
your equal with respect to this on

472
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,929
man a lot of other pixels change and

473
00:29:06,929 --> 00:29:10,429
some will turn to fund black to white
males fraud to book so we can't just

474
00:29:10,429 --> 00:29:11,570
simply over

475
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:16,590
right within data we want Oct we have
to. correction and their collections

476
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,149
helping us

477
00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:22,429
why well let the way of

478
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:25,720
a message in your channel Kraken with a
message queue Wong

479
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,690
I want to recheck West Quay a message QX

480
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:33,500
we don't really have to change models in
order

481
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,679
darkly it quacks when they have to reach

482
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:41,369
the my sanity ready error correction is
taking over

483
00:29:41,369 --> 00:29:44,549
so just have to reach a car coat

484
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:47,659
microcode its in here make your ex

485
00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:51,190
but some slightly wrong

486
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:54,389
cold that's only a bit wrong and

487
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:57,940
not trawl so it can't be correct with
the air crash in and that's possible

488
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,450
actually

489
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:02,990
on so we don't need a dark it

490
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:09,220
here

491
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,260
so for the attack outline it's the first
one that's our of

492
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:15,349
yeah yet sex casting call court on a
street

493
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:18,539
and retrieves the messages the message
and Zach

494
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:21,570
well what we can do most simply generate
to

495
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,659
a set of message just looking alike

496
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:27,669
with fishing you also maybe we'll want
to

497
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:31,230
half message us that look really really
a

498
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:34,240
close and then yes the representation so

499
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,629
if the qua Colt to cope idk what the
code is showing you don't think you may

500
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:39,690
be just click it

501
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:44,490
cuz looks familia Birkenstock to change
metrics

502
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:47,580
welp the thing it just makes tents or

503
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:51,590
you're puttin our wall if there's a
change from white to black

504
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:54,809
I want my apology from October from
black to white

505
00:30:54,809 --> 00:30:58,260
and a $0.50 no change just metrics

506
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,530
for each message we construct our
metrics

507
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:05,289
of containing the changes

508
00:31:05,289 --> 00:31:08,879
way to battle where move will be
impossible solutions

509
00:31:08,879 --> 00:31:14,119
if the number of models that we have to
change from up from

510
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:19,109
for black to white F back to white it's
better than your correction

511
00:31:19,109 --> 00:31:23,789
well have a stop or we have no changes
chance of hitting just the circle

512
00:31:23,789 --> 00:31:27,730
we were always lie outside in I'm pissed
this feature is a bit

513
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:32,559
biggest just for illustration purpose
these are all the o'clock or so I'm not

514
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,720
are uniquely decodable tu wong

515
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,809
real solution or that we don't care
about

516
00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:45,220
well so we can follow them away for
remaining which Thornton

517
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,849
with a police dept Fort from white to
black so

518
00:31:48,849 --> 00:31:52,490
and that's what like an ascending or and
the recall orbiters take the first in a

519
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,000
recall or origin of

520
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,010
croco targets order with patch for
example

521
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:02,520
okay so maybe

522
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,669
so to have it here we have few are we
have we often hear your chin like dr.

523
00:32:06,669 --> 00:32:11,659
croco the Yahoo that a we for example
choice

524
00:32:11,659 --> 00:32:16,309
our close a similar in a small screen
let's put it that way

525
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:19,559
we generate the difference here

526
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:22,740
that's only two different scoping the
black pixels

527
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,369
the pics we have to call a black in this
in this

528
00:32:26,369 --> 00:32:29,820
so these are typical swift to change
here to black

529
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:33,659
not in order to generate this but to
generate a crock alt

530
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:37,109
thats bit colder by the air correction

531
00:32:37,109 --> 00:32:40,929
how it's this car coat

532
00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:45,099
yup done we simply and coat

533
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:48,240
our then we simply change our

534
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,619
core could hear okay that was swan dive
your furious this

535
00:32:53,619 --> 00:32:57,049
affecting this out we could do it the
other way around why not just simply

536
00:32:57,049 --> 00:33:01,340
change random mobiles & ok well code and
look what happens

537
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:06,539
possible to was just scan QR code
retrieved a message from zero

538
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:10,230
ground on which us we have to metrics of
all the mobiles how do you cope

539
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:13,889
let's change but see a bit more than
your correction you have to change

540
00:33:13,889 --> 00:33:17,389
romp around dont think oh it again look
what's the what's the what's what pitch

541
00:33:17,389 --> 00:33:18,799
for example

542
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,980
do is 100 times for example are at times
and it gets results actually

543
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:28,960
and can you choose one for example for
example if you're up for a quote

544
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,359
down we that's yellow dots I think all
yeah I did call

545
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:38,399
on here this a list of let's see an
Xserve hunger at

546
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,770
are different changes which simply
changed

547
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:45,750
pixels here and yell correction and be a
part actually

548
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:49,529
didn't change it in this part of history
so and the coen again

549
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:52,529
so get simple set of completely

550
00:33:52,529 --> 00:33:57,119
I'll random are my friend or something
simply change randomly changed

551
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:01,039
address ok from partner

552
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,889
you may want to select here's an excerpt
of some but a respected think

553
00:34:04,889 --> 00:34:09,020
number in the brackets this always how
many mothers had to be changed

554
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:13,710
so this was no where Kercher five months
six miles

555
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:17,060
and you can you choose one and

556
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,419
look at what money is you have to change
in the end

557
00:34:20,419 --> 00:34:24,049
can do this this way

558
00:34:24,049 --> 00:34:27,379
well

559
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:32,319
okay have to change cold here for
example

560
00:34:32,319 --> 00:34:36,319
okay there's another approach want to
put the outline

561
00:34:36,319 --> 00:34:39,419
I do remember when we had the money

562
00:34:39,419 --> 00:34:43,639
thing money to apply a thing for
start-up some parts where r

563
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:48,560
free for us to configure so if you want
to change is on some parts we had to

564
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,529
really change some pics for top i won
the I want to be my i buy the not some

565
00:34:53,529 --> 00:34:56,889
a bomb but of you folks on file cuz I
want

566
00:34:56,889 --> 00:35:00,520
to get money obviously so these are
fixed

567
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,240
actually there are the fix for some from
the structure like the line breaks

568
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,910
or the old if they'll fix things in the
stock

569
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:12,589
are what you could do done actually
that's on

570
00:35:12,589 --> 00:35:15,839
related to work to the work here to his
work from

571
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:19,720
Coco Arcos welcome to Beckley their est
up

572
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,400
you can use utilize Wong are

573
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,270
thing from you from a one characteristic
of QR codes

574
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:32,290
its they are arm is more there was more
pic with respect to

575
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:35,420
force for example socks or something as
amorphous me on this

576
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:40,060
if you're if you've got your to message
us to a different color box

577
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:44,700
and this is the BCH code and code
beseeching coating of these blocks

578
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,190
ban doesn't matter if you for six or

579
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:51,529
today a blocks and take the BCH in
calling

580
00:35:51,529 --> 00:35:55,650
or you just have the BCH in colour saw
oil flow day blocks

581
00:35:55,650 --> 00:36:00,299
exhorting of what's source are sold on

582
00:36:00,299 --> 00:36:03,710
so it's all on cold is armed

583
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:06,900
stable with respect respect soaring

584
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:10,029
you could use this for example to

585
00:36:10,029 --> 00:36:14,990
arm to you could use for someone cause
of cost or denomination

586
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:18,080
that's what you do if you find the basis
for

587
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,230
each you but we find basis base rack for
a for changing

588
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:25,020
for doctor changing elements in your arm

589
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,480
near-field on that's works arm

590
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,020
cause it to you because this whole whole
right so long cold

591
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:36,220
arm is some kind of vector space defined
basis for the vector space

592
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:40,369
and then you look what's change by
workspace if you change one

593
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:44,690
are one core when whether mental back
for

594
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:50,000
actions based on C on QR codes work
quite cold as ice homepage so if you're

595
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,330
13 which rhetoric may have a look here
here to pick

596
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:56,380
is target this arm design a qualquer

597
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:00,140
courts qualcosa for some over to black
and white motels

598
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:03,980
were some ball or face or a picture or
something else and its route the toll

599
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,380
it's really cool

600
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:08,470
its the other way around and we need we
need to get

601
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:11,779
the cold that we need that we needed in
order to achieve

602
00:37:11,779 --> 00:37:15,290
s13 paper it doesn't but the other way
around

603
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:19,339
but still its arm three interesting

604
00:37:19,339 --> 00:37:22,850
on downsides of this approach in that's
wired already

605
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:27,330
weed or a half implemented it on it's
not possible to change

606
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:32,100
single molecules and you're not able to
change all modules

607
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,750
cost-control cause control

608
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:39,580
in order to control modules you have to
with have to change or do you have to

609
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,020
have

610
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:44,029
complete arm control over your of
debater

611
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:48,490
inside the first stop and inside the
first part and obviously we don't want

612
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:51,109
this want all live on in there

613
00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:55,000
furthermore arm the mosque King

614
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,630
of up collation recall collision of two
thing

615
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:03,310
small changes in the cold could resolve
the with different masking for example

616
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:06,589
when the end comes down to for forcing
again and the other for two approaches

617
00:38:06,589 --> 00:38:08,390
volpert forcing approaches with your

618
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:15,390
simply faster in my opinion so it should
stick with the old approaches

619
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:19,420
well now we can accept question

620
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:23,250
okays actually now up

621
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:27,049
it's a it's a bad but questions of and

622
00:38:27,049 --> 00:38:30,450
what we do here is now it's over what
we're currently doing

623
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,470
is some kinda feel study arm

624
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:36,740
acceptance of Qualcomm and use awareness
concerning security

625
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:43,299
I Cup this from the funding proposal so
please forgive me

626
00:38:43,299 --> 00:38:48,850
the cloud language arm what we want to
do what we're doing currently is public

627
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:51,589
of course would think to a study in
public places

628
00:38:51,589 --> 00:38:56,850
I wish to us LEC 25 cities at the mass
housing to Paris Tokyo and %ah

629
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:59,880
why those five and not others

630
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,520
are simply because we have to support
you guys there also support guys there

631
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,310
so if things were forward-deployed at to
in Helsinki Paris

632
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:11,500
on cuz we all got some first results

633
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,950
Indiana we are currently deploying rose
a bit late and info care we have

634
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:19,069
here which ethical issues on with it
path don't know if we can do

635
00:39:19,069 --> 00:39:22,569
this kind of its study in Tokyo arm

636
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:27,000
I'll show you after arts art I'll be
looking like plain stickers

637
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,730
%uh stickers with some small arm

638
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:34,440
small-arms description and qualcosa a
pic

639
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,869
on Japanese ethical commissioner told us

640
00:39:37,869 --> 00:39:41,180
that this what all three of them

641
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:45,000
with me tricking people into things

642
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,230
go into action of the maybe don't want
actually I see the point

643
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:52,970
after I have to admit on the other hand
just in Europe it's it's not that

644
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:56,680
you're not so concerned with Epicor
issues maybe

645
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:00,650
and we now have some propose that we may
be use a cover-up

646
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:04,730
leave so we have to call coat arm a
sheet of paper

647
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:08,810
and a motion of paper if from the fit
with that

648
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:13,619
right thing are something like do you
want to participate in a survey

649
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:16,619
recruitment discussing if this is
ethical enough

650
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:20,259
if this impasse a for the Ethical tests
if not we'll just forget it

651
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:24,369
cuz some yeah so we've got plaster

652
00:40:24,369 --> 00:40:28,609
ok with a sticker with on with the
question

653
00:40:28,609 --> 00:40:32,549
participate in our secure a survey a sec
11 the third one there are several

654
00:40:32,549 --> 00:40:35,210
pictures with my skates

655
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:38,710
whatever balks while

656
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:42,470
what's inside the court so every caucus
make

657
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:47,200
obviously confess you make it with the
and additionally the city deployment I

658
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,660
been linked to a survey

659
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:53,710
why arm okay like to serve is obvious
cuz want people to fall this

660
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:57,920
but whites in the plumbing pipe with
people deploying the stick while Coles

661
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,160
they up we don't always want to follow
if the mix up the sheets just just

662
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,869
be able to scan it and look where chill
long where it belongs

663
00:41:05,869 --> 00:41:10,489
deployment yeah we go for for for
several profiles of people so with bus

664
00:41:10,489 --> 00:41:12,029
stops that's nice

665
00:41:12,029 --> 00:41:15,680
point that's arm with Seema action
that's that's just five thing but there

666
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,029
are

667
00:41:16,029 --> 00:41:20,210
E if you gonna pop it to a toy that you
always see just nice writings on wall

668
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:23,500
and recently which were first found
people putting stickers with

669
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,230
quotes there so we thought maybe that's
maybe there is a business case since

670
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,319
taking pictures

671
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,549
a cropper support let's i'm ok if you
could wish for a bit

672
00:41:31,549 --> 00:41:36,049
with it outside okay and I'm on the
campus

673
00:41:36,049 --> 00:41:39,850
and that some random places 8 p.m.
vending machine machines such in Minot

674
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:40,660
machine

675
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:44,220
a parking machines and such things

676
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:47,869
welp what happens if the click of a
study

677
00:41:47,869 --> 00:41:50,989
will automatically locking that you scan
it okay

678
00:41:50,989 --> 00:41:56,270
are we love the caucus can't I'm and two
or three some information using

679
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:59,480
you will all it takes conversate a proud
the

680
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:04,109
if its current deploy correctly yes
fifty US but we for the way

681
00:42:04,109 --> 00:42:07,640
with the service provider with over the
way and just a possibility do it and

682
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,970
find you wasn't there so maybe some

683
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:13,830
process will be that happy to have to
serve you want click it they want to do

684
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:14,830
it three times

685
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:18,930
I'm story that was just a sport
everything no person they disarm all

686
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:20,170
forget

687
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:24,330
I'm Dennis a redirection to you for two
years a survey

688
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:27,380
I'm sure this claim I'll what

689
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,799
who we are what we want to and that your

690
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:34,839
that we guarantee anonymity show so we
have some questions

691
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:38,619
a measure pot complete survey I was
measure how many people

692
00:42:38,619 --> 00:42:43,779
click our Skype call coat and then
filled out the survey

693
00:42:43,779 --> 00:42:47,440
so that's a silly question song the
roster for what

694
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,299
takes three to four minutes currently to
scan to complete survey

695
00:42:51,299 --> 00:42:54,750
why did just gets all multiple choice
but his cancer car coat

696
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:57,759
if you have any doubts omissions
expectations prefer sense kind in this

697
00:42:57,759 --> 00:42:58,730
cold

698
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:02,210
up to check the web address before we
stick the link

699
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:06,400
ever been there knowingly of course the
victim a phishing attack

700
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,089
and of new skank Robertson under some
age gender

701
00:43:10,089 --> 00:43:13,920
I'll Murph or thing arm

702
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,839
that's near 44 of to watch for having
some really nice that this

703
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:21,319
lot of knife of plots so we can I

704
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:24,489
to yeah at that site to mumbo-jumbo
around to

705
00:43:24,489 --> 00:43:27,650
but slice for assaults know we have no
results

706
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:31,670
as it sold its current down our Carling
Cup on face

707
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:34,790
it called the takes three to four
minutes to complete the survey we have

708
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:38,480
serving with a high accept them so more
to 50 percent of people coming car could

709
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,920
actually complete survey

710
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,170
a very nice my pain we expect the ball

711
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:47,609
2 percent I saw I don't know and current
accounts a bucket this seems to be

712
00:43:47,609 --> 00:43:48,080
waning

713
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:52,009
that's the clock out that skate come the
most of actually

714
00:43:52,009 --> 00:43:55,480
okay accomplished against fishing on

715
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,980
group left to give it faster arm

716
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:02,029
or shootings what would you have a
problem cork

717
00:44:02,029 --> 00:44:05,869
a what you do you should always show the
links wife of a

718
00:44:05,869 --> 00:44:09,619
be interesting some kind of additional
blacklisting that doesn't mean a review

719
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:13,700
blacklisting of farm offer insights but
maybe to some kind of pattern matching

720
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,970
song lyrics

721
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:18,529
so if you just have to go with are 10 or
so that it's just

722
00:44:18,529 --> 00:44:21,619
want officially water the customer

723
00:44:21,619 --> 00:44:25,799
of looked yet detect for detecting
tempering after some stick up

724
00:44:25,799 --> 00:44:30,970
a covering the car quote with mike
rucker maybe this is not legit

725
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:34,830
I hadn't what's nice is he could also
mean that some technical parts maker

726
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:38,850
you could also checked the mosque older
color things I showed you

727
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:42,310
the change the distribution of like a
white models of obviously

728
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:45,549
so could affect it but just

729
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:50,270
looking at the distribution I for fifty
percent over it really close to 50-50

730
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:53,880
then it was time for involved um

731
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:58,040
for his st. stats are there have been
proposed menu

732
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:02,020
many other confirmations also a forty
payment or so I think it would be cool

733
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:05,060
to have some additional verification
procedure

734
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:10,290
step high-performance I want social but
more fun you can have karach oats

735
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:14,080
also what's what's the main thing is you
i'd like I said before use

736
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:17,580
at technology the side for storing

737
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:20,730
really large amounts of air for storing

738
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:24,799
baby both www the call the call no I
don't have nothing else to go here yet

739
00:45:24,799 --> 00:45:25,619
but

740
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:29,730
it's a short link: its this worship 4

741
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:34,730
low lol ok Papa no means that slow I was
shown that seven-percent Air Corps

742
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:38,299
correctional still cuz 46 r-fort for
four debates

743
00:45:38,299 --> 00:45:41,730
an awful night mode that's what her 14
characters thats

744
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:46,279
still 100 more characters than we used
here actually

745
00:45:46,279 --> 00:45:49,680
numerical OC more so

746
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,920
webspace lineup usurped

747
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,369
I see actually after some approaches

748
00:45:56,369 --> 00:45:59,619
the first one they up skin day

749
00:45:59,619 --> 00:46:04,290
with picture they hit information call
cold but that didn't hide it in the

750
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:07,480
baidoa of the car coat but in the

751
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:11,489
picture so the at that that this arm
they hid in the

752
00:46:11,489 --> 00:46:15,600
are the least significant bit of each
arm

753
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,690
each each color channel of Chicago so
the car coat

754
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:22,180
got a bit like great but the data was
stored with classic

755
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:25,580
picture shifts to cover to Mexico to
Buffy

756
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:28,819
was quite close to two same

757
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:32,089
I was quits it's pretty worth crossing
well

758
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:35,450
are may be the most interesting is

759
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:40,380
this one Detroit they are using your
actual daring killing

760
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:44,150
arm the date and the croco than than
hiding the Koala cold

761
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:47,290
in another picture so if you know if
you're the RIA

762
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:51,950
got cryptic oh there you can simply scan
the bark collar coat but for a normal

763
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:55,710
percent looks like a picture legend
picture 3.net interesting but something

764
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:56,450
different now

765
00:46:56,450 --> 00:47:00,730
we want to do okay with support us
that's just the link I mean

766
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:04,619
what we could do for example in mind
that's treviño

767
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:07,850
after think we can store I has tech I'm

768
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:12,420
store information oh well it's quite
obvious if a scan this code it just sent

769
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:17,109
everything next thing is I woke up mixed
modes

770
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:22,359
on Gras coats or let's say based on the
turf caucus allows many things that many

771
00:47:22,359 --> 00:47:25,540
encoders are not able to I've never
falling colour

772
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:28,799
on the web for lefties the Franco era
than calling robbery that's

773
00:47:28,799 --> 00:47:32,900
arm giving you the whole thing that
cause actual ship

774
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:37,660
be able to do and while things is mostly
left out the possibility of

775
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:41,529
F having miss moore than one beer truck

776
00:47:41,529 --> 00:47:44,640
and you can have different modes in his
cage ox

777
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,700
source for example it could have a day
that junk

778
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:51,250
of Americ containing this one mentions
some

779
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:54,739
no merit parts okay that's still main
it's a bit better but still

780
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:58,259
stuck with you what about the %uh
correction

781
00:47:58,259 --> 00:48:01,970
first we use no a correction to get a
total change picture

782
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:06,430
changing underlying information why not
you stepped up its

783
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:11,109
of deer creek channels that's the
correct Manny way to store information

784
00:48:11,109 --> 00:48:14,250
and on folks of all time

785
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:17,529
and then the beer crock ot I I can do so

786
00:48:17,529 --> 00:48:21,589
what kind of 100 years 100 error on a
spit sons are still getting too cold to

787
00:48:21,589 --> 00:48:22,720
their origin player

788
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,759
so have good harvests for

789
00:48:25,759 --> 00:48:29,290
for hiding information for example so
what what what

790
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:33,500
you know your your half okay and yes
folks Ohio High Court you have to none

791
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:38,270
you have planned to use I air correction
echoed a real Bettencourt

792
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:41,830
your some kind of cover date on the QR
codes to something that's displayed his

793
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:43,529
cum car coat

794
00:48:43,529 --> 00:48:47,160
I call you real they are an your
correction

795
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:50,970
in not in the air Christian bits but in
switched

796
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:56,529
aircrew I was sure your first so what
you do weigh 138 is coming cold

797
00:48:56,529 --> 00:48:59,509
you create a call call with same
characteristics on the same message as

798
00:48:59,509 --> 00:49:00,670
he read it

799
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:04,759
from the calibrator uncork a way to
change my efforts should be shown before

800
00:49:04,759 --> 00:49:08,819
when you know it but you've got to put a
respite representation for us

801
00:49:08,819 --> 00:49:12,700
so what can do it too so you can for
what the character issue could totes

802
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:13,619
Justin Cote

803
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:18,460
your day to start of the car coat that's
a problem because distribution again

804
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:22,540
UF you will have for our run into arm

805
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:26,020
maybe are large black females at the
start of tea

806
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:29,369
of your call code and thus give see a
problem with the coding

807
00:49:29,369 --> 00:49:33,810
also remember the mosque is here for
getting the encoding done but decoding

808
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:37,319
second scattered through the cold when
we do I simply

809
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:40,779
are a core switch from black to white
them erroneous switch from black to

810
00:49:40,779 --> 00:49:41,690
white

811
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:47,319
so a plaque I white symbol instead of
the quick buck wanna cerro

812
00:49:47,319 --> 00:49:51,380
and one for the other way round Bangkok
lead to change my pics

813
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:55,119
hurry to buy your purse a presentation
so there's pros and cons suppose I saw

814
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,080
its not the text for Koreas

815
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:00,319
cause a simple to be a correction part
that's what the character chance to sign

816
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,819
for

817
00:50:01,819 --> 00:50:05,609
links on something looks worse like
always

818
00:50:05,609 --> 00:50:09,650
arm it's real easy to the cold you don't
have to do some cuffed or

819
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:14,339
of the promise of much capacity capitol
city so far version A four

820
00:50:14,339 --> 00:50:18,650
or cold with high your correction gives
you two are four debates

821
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:22,500
well sullivan also I guess its first
five it would be enough to store

822
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:26,359
affect key for encryption for example
too frisky

823
00:50:26,359 --> 00:50:30,250
and that's much more doesn't utilize the
auto correction

824
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:33,380
so if any of the store for to beat this
changed

825
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:38,440
it won't be correct cause your
correction is working on the cover up

826
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:42,190
message not on your it anesthetic double

827
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:46,410
a step Saints all the masking the
masking is getting the description of

828
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:49,089
moscow's may be getting lost

829
00:50:49,089 --> 00:50:52,450
so let 70

830
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:56,170
look at the Terminator up K there's also
what's not to love

831
00:50:56,170 --> 00:51:00,330
of course but there's always another
Terminator each caucus process one

832
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:05,089
arm awful FBI Brock this attorney a book
on paying for serious

833
00:51:05,089 --> 00:51:09,520
or less so if the if the message is long
enough to fill out the whole croco

834
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,049
there's no telling if

835
00:51:11,049 --> 00:51:14,230
and if it's if this want to forfeit

836
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:18,509
for are bit left think almost zero

837
00:51:18,509 --> 00:51:21,619
and all of the time now to block this
the beta sigma simply

838
00:51:21,619 --> 00:51:26,170
pet purpose these two sequences
ultimately

839
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:29,589
well high payoff to pay off the company
then

840
00:51:29,589 --> 00:51:34,630
having

841
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:37,989
from Costco also saw are many fold the
rear shock to

842
00:51:37,989 --> 00:51:41,410
should and decoding of a tornado that's
according to spec

843
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:45,670
so every colour obeying the spec won't
simply because I won't look for at their

844
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:46,250
pending

845
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:49,940
a having patter the links looks again
workable

846
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:54,069
looks at work so I course its even
easier to the code to encode and decode

847
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:56,930
you have to find determinative for
specialty coating

848
00:51:56,930 --> 00:52:00,190
just searcher call Kolkata defined
tornado

849
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:03,319
and get it over with readout they

850
00:52:03,319 --> 00:52:07,880
on next thing is your hidden they a
stalker is still protect buddy up for

851
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:08,460
action

852
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:12,609
safe if got error for faults there are
for example cause of tort

853
00:52:12,609 --> 00:52:16,839
it still got the same protection cause
it's still

854
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:20,119
still a even the padded I even

855
00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:24,410
having is guys Isis is sent for the %uh
correction mechanisms

856
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:27,970
to their their hit song cop and last but
not least

857
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:32,380
the distribution of luck but no this is
not destroyed custom of Kings supplied

858
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:36,140
after all it's maybe a different Moscow
virtuosi

859
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:41,060
but coming up but did suspicious or
their

860
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:45,310
yup on the other hand you don't have to
do

861
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:48,560
have matching up for company but still

862
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:53,150
okay what's coalition yeah

863
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:56,330
actually all the techs are all too real
what you're doing you want to trick you

864
00:52:56,330 --> 00:52:56,930
22

865
00:52:56,930 --> 00:53:01,790
scan some croco done to bad things you

866
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:05,029
but steered you attack for the snow for
example there are new did you attend

867
00:53:05,029 --> 00:53:06,270
their attacks against

868
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:10,560
new kind of people people who go around
three-ton well see a nice car coat

869
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:14,549
scan it I see is people the link the
paper at stage to work

870
00:53:14,549 --> 00:53:20,080
and part are unsuspecting use or
something sums as a certain customers

871
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:24,660
and they're getting more interesting 11
trusting as more what the Cape occasions

872
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:27,989
are bomb that are based on call coats

873
00:53:27,989 --> 00:53:32,170
I think its own start this now for into
European commit a commissioner

874
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:37,049
for star station I'm a broke at European
standard and I think economy and nice

875
00:53:37,049 --> 00:53:43,180
many nice things been done with this
your corporate companies from my things

876
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:46,890
what would be nice to do in future work
/url

877
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,170
we haven't said up maybe some

878
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:55,270
looking but more special you define
encoding arm

879
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:59,160
continues call coats it's possible not
only to have data stored in one call

880
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,099
could you can have

881
00:54:00,099 --> 00:54:03,190
up to 16 call courts for example

882
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:06,580
are but are linked to go see scan them
in an arbitrary

883
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:10,250
direction it doesn't you don't have to
have to do with an inline

884
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:13,259
among the carcass can together form

885
00:54:13,259 --> 00:54:18,549
information on usually more learned my
I've never seen a free vertical encoder

886
00:54:18,549 --> 00:54:20,330
being able to be incapable dove

887
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:24,130
signs such calls I don't think there's
and decoder for this currently but I

888
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:26,529
mean there are the cold is for industry
but

889
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:31,480
of up for not for commodity say what's
with the buff on the role of Los

890
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:36,449
and hopefully in the next month I will
be working payment types and i really

891
00:54:36,449 --> 00:54:39,710
were really fun having have to look at
them

892
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:43,589
efforts to go to cover part I think I
would like to do with some pics to my

893
00:54:43,589 --> 00:54:44,029
face

894
00:54:44,029 --> 00:54:47,750
implementation of term anything on a try
to have to run through

895
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:51,730
Austin graphical detection mechanisms

896
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:54,810
yes last but not least to some thanks

897
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:59,699
Sabah still over there are katherine is
currently in Japan doing

898
00:54:59,699 --> 00:55:03,370
iron fighting against ethics

899
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:07,380
and John S from Greece was able to

900
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:10,520
get justice for purse and all the
friends &

901
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:13,690
House Inc offense housing for stock
Indiana for

902
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:18,400
up enough with the fit study thank you

903
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:25,199
%ah

904
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:32,199
thank you Peter other some questions

905
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,710
so %uh first of all thank you for the
talk

906
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:40,900
and them I really appreciated the
research you did on this

907
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:44,059
a magic marker tech would call us do so

908
00:55:44,059 --> 00:55:49,089
making up of black pixels but the one
thing which I think

909
00:55:49,089 --> 00:55:53,000
is missing in this idea is that it's
totally impractical to

910
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,230
so let's say I have like the Red Cross
is asking for donations on like

911
00:55:57,230 --> 00:56:01,230
1000 flyer somewhere I'm nobody with

912
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:07,000
use like a moscow and wouldn't use my
two mA current like to a 1000 pixels on

913
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:07,910
these of two things

914
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:11,410
he would just like order 1000 stickers
for

915
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:14,970
10 box of something and dictum on them

916
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:18,670
so you happen here I Jeff

917
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:21,960
that through I'm four-day actually
that's also why didn't

918
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:26,480
a pic to peep into up to three
systematic recalculation

919
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,890
of of of arm this to our payment coats

920
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:35,640
since it doesn't make sense applying too
many of them I actually get you was more

921
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,019
or less like some kind of

922
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:41,549
neglect guerrilla gardening is not
popular in then then in Indiana so you

923
00:56:41,549 --> 00:56:42,240
have some maybe

924
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,359
people I would just want to add to a
true

925
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:48,630
trick trick other people so you got this
app

926
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:52,380
scan the QR code policy of what five
pixels a change in you do it simply

927
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:56,750
I do it not systematically in order to
gain money by the alert us to

928
00:56:56,750 --> 00:57:00,289
yeah I'm get to know more

929
00:57:00,289 --> 00:57:03,359
your people for example

930
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:06,460
but you're correct for the for the
payment part that's why we

931
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:11,559
left at them more questions

932
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:15,539
so

933
00:57:15,539 --> 00:57:19,799
them I have a question of the what about

934
00:57:19,799 --> 00:57:23,180
from implementing encryption

935
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:26,829
to know if they are are some

936
00:57:26,829 --> 00:57:32,180
steps to what's this actually there or

937
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:35,240
arm crypto crock secure cuellar

938
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:39,579
still arm I look at once

939
00:57:39,579 --> 00:57:44,119
arm actually have for thing is the
Cooper said just

940
00:57:44,119 --> 00:57:47,990
now there's hearings advertising thing
you're really playing co R

941
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:51,349
according to cost on the there are some
kasich a car

942
00:57:51,349 --> 00:57:55,799
arm still they don't do internal
validation

943
00:57:55,799 --> 00:57:59,430
so it's not about the it's not about vet
like

944
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:03,559
like using hash values for Intel
validating at nope it's got changed

945
00:58:03,559 --> 00:58:07,069
what's more like if you link to external

946
00:58:07,069 --> 00:58:10,440
up password if if if works for example
exchange passports

947
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,609
if you link to external that's what
stores but you

948
00:58:13,609 --> 00:58:17,990
have got some kinda quick shooting over
or are what the main part is it's

949
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:22,029
just a standard for I efficiently
encoding

950
00:58:22,029 --> 00:58:25,299
encrypt it beer by its not

951
00:58:25,299 --> 00:58:28,460
arm it's not a sanity check

952
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:31,750
they don't implement sent to change
checks if the data

953
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:34,970
it's awful temper that's not in Scopus
secure

954
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:38,200
sec car secure course probably you know
that the

955
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:41,440
hardship on a use SQR coats

956
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:45,200
in the course am are ass so

957
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,490
I I would have ask you if if a

958
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:51,510
you know if they are using some

959
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:55,160
some lay off $6.30 I really have to say
I'm we don't know

960
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:58,880
arm I was buy the tickets were able to
terminate

961
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:03,260
bro where they're all string are real
guys and they don't have to simply half

962
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:06,680
I'm strict looking guy in the

963
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:12,200
train was looking for ticket looks legit
okay more questions

964
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:15,700
so a

965
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:18,860
them we have for lunch thank you another
time

966
