1
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,430
okay 500 also going

2
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,690
I as any scale yes

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,809
on so I hope you all enjoy as a

4
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:17,939
whose things conference so

5
00:00:17,939 --> 00:00:22,060
just stop yeah we will make a

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,470
I'll foo so heroes

7
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,039
I'll for you own stuff but also

8
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:34,199
firestorms in a while home

9
00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:37,360
world go so many gay he's

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,350
so okay Ohio

11
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,940
does back of it was very important for
me

12
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,430
arm where r arm really

13
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:52,960
may move I'll does okay so sources on
with you

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,019
vendors somos whether on

15
00:00:56,019 --> 00:00:59,830
vigorous sign sometimes wrong

16
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,979
mindset harm how to mitigate thank you

17
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:07,340
on how to mitigate device attacks so I
will try to

18
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,039
arm clean this up a bit um

19
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:14,350
what we do some if busting and the
number arm

20
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:18,219
important point laws early warnings okay
whole can you

21
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:21,320
arm predicted us attacks okay

22
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,759
arm what kind of media it can you use to

23
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:28,310
arm head 22 arm to

24
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:34,070
early warnings and something like that
okay so first about myself

25
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:37,789
arm I'm a security obsessed white hats
our I'm working

26
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:41,969
arm at the German railways to business
till where I'm responsible for be on

27
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:44,429
network and telecommunications security

28
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:47,659
I'm so yeah coca-cola positive

29
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:52,340
arm as a nose I'm really call addictive
so be careful if you show me a caller

30
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,429
arm I might go for it on

31
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:59,759
during my free time I analyze know where
hunting botnets

32
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,359
yeah for fun and research proposes and
sometimes for beer and pizza

33
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:06,740
I'm as I have no sponsor okay

34
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,429
every comments regarding vendors we got
any mitigation techniques

35
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:14,200
or anything arm you might want to step
in

36
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,220
you are welcome to do it anytime yeah so

37
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,310
just all records every statement but I
made during the slide

38
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,920
I'm doing this talk is only present my
very own experiences

39
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,170
okay so some statements may find
constant

40
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:36,700
IRAs may not okay arm experience that
often statements

41
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,319
I'm mind regarding firewalls and IPS
result in a panic

42
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,349
at but arm Michonne I'm you shouldn't
care about me miss much

43
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:47,610
so I'm last but not least I'm

44
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,739
all opinions are mine and do not
represent both of my

45
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:54,920
employer okay arm for the scope and for
the time given

46
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,189
I have to arm yeah I have to from

47
00:02:58,189 --> 00:03:01,340
resize the scope a bit because

48
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,379
weekend talk for days about the dose
okay for

49
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,950
about specific attack types mitigation
techniques and so on

50
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:12,189
so I had to concentrate or focus on on
major types of attacks

51
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:17,670
and and also assuming that I'm everybody
here is from above TCPIP and basics of

52
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,689
of of the dose okay so we won't be able
to cover it here

53
00:03:20,689 --> 00:03:24,519
okay let's start so

54
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:27,590
if you look at the evolution of the does
became be don't speak

55
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,599
about anything new okay armed does as
well known

56
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,680
for years it was covered in invariant in

57
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,680
various early papers in the ATF there
are many consider considerations made

58
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,159
arm so also we

59
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:46,480
the first and only to lose appeared in
the nineties okay

60
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:53,480
like teardrop and land so in the
nineties we had if it

61
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,579
talked about Tossa de dos on we took
very

62
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:01,209
mostly talked about weaknesses in TCP IP
implementations

63
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:04,540
okay so in the nineties me and simple
packet swing coat

64
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,099
arm but it still working today okay arm

65
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:11,180
burn all reliable re other blue

66
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,700
arm command-and-control structure does
botnet or something like that

67
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,940
so in the nineties or in the early
millennium dedust was considered as a

68
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,790
side effect

69
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,000
okay another as a serious straight

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,950
so but some reason why we have to read
awakening today

71
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,950
okay if you look at the most ISPs arm

72
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,690
maybe really don't care about

73
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,620
armed security best practices at where
various papers

74
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,550
I'm from the ATF and security
recommendation to say okay prevent IP

75
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,130
spoofing to ingress filtering and so on
and so on

76
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:49,740
but on I think the most ISP's and
managed service providers just miss to

77
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,190
implement mitigation techniques

78
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,810
okay arm met some reason I'm

79
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,460
way we have been kinda rude awakening
today and

80
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,480
the significant growth of Banff if hair

81
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,940
arm has as a huge

82
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,720
impact on the on the arm on the risks
and

83
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,730
attack vectors okay arm on the other
side we have the industry

84
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,520
arm which is still playing very it
reactive

85
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,670
okay so arm will mention this later
during the slights but

86
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:24,270
arm most well-known vendors arm still
failed

87
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,530
to combat de dos in an appropriate way
okay and

88
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:32,510
if you look stew into organizations into
very large organizations very still

89
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:36,420
yeah I'm lech of InfoSec with saucers

90
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:41,200
or still arm lack of knowledge about
dedust attacks and how to prepare and

91
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,900
how to mitigate them

92
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,210
so today the game has changed yeah

93
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,890
like I'm the like probably mentioned

94
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:53,270
I'm yesterday at the activists and
animals entered the game

95
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,920
we we r arm facing the sophisticated
botnet

96
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,510
utilizing hundreds of thousands of
clients or victims

97
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:04,190
arm sometimes as victims I'm not

98
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:08,070
lets a customer clients yes we are also
utilizing

99
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:12,590
confirm my service at powerful hosting
facilities to say more powerful where

100
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,080
arm attack okay so what we can say two
days

101
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,080
arm from today's perspective he does has
become mainstream

102
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,570
arm also be a text sizes here I'm

103
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:30,030
if you look but don't worry okay we talk
about 100 gigabits

104
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,690
in size for India's attack which is
quite

105
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,830
very very you to tech I think even I S
peace will have

106
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,100
problem arm will have problems too

107
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,340
yet to combat such kind of attack yeah
on

108
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,610
but the question is what

109
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:52,310
generates such kind future tech okay
what kind of motivations are sitting

110
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,440
behind fed

111
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,060
arm as you can see here the average size
of Adidas attack today

112
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,360
is about to get its but we have I'm

113
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,170
pick up 100 gigabits so if you look at
the

114
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:08,840
common threats are and and motivations

115
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,200
I'm it is not surprising but a text
what's customers

116
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,390
at data centers and hosting facilities
arm

117
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:21,070
as the most or are leading militants
threaten the category okay

118
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:24,500
but what was very surprising for me

119
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,750
was met misconfiguration is in place
free

120
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,500
okay so that means met

121
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,040
today's company still knocking out for
self due to miss configuration

122
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,370
I will give you an example for this arm

123
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,800
for a deep a cloud-based he does provide
a aa on

124
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,930
but it it it is quiets surprising

125
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,790
from my point of view witness
conflagration is is I'm still present in

126
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:51,160
the

127
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,150
in this category if we go to the
motivations

128
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,740
I'm I think it is important to clarify
what we have here

129
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,950
arm on the first place political and
ideology

130
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:06,990
driven attacks okay arm

131
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:11,970
as you can imagine ideology or political
driven a tax haven

132
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,300
emotional compliment so that makes

133
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,750
most kind of attacks unpredictable okay

134
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,510
you can not can't calculate you can and
do I'm

135
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:26,190
Kevin reliable early warning mechanism
something like this

136
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,190
it has a very very on big emotional
component

137
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:33,469
are in it and we have to deal with it
today

138
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:37,800
so now I think we have enough background
so we will dive into be

139
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,800
arm a tech types

140
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,930
I'm if you going to be

141
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,990
deals phiri where r 100

142
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:51,629
different types of attacks okay fancy a
he does it take here fence he looked at

143
00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:52,620
as a tech fair

144
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,620
but if you go into a wild and and face
would-be attackers

145
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,870
arm you will see but there are only four
types

146
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,139
of major attacks okay arm

147
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:07,360
first we have we application-layer
attacks application

148
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,509
many application their attack is
typically

149
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:14,709
from targeting the system itself on the
application itself

150
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:18,399
okay trying to extort memory CPU and
sockets

151
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,930
something like this on

152
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:26,819
often used if application flooding like
HDPE or something like that

153
00:09:26,819 --> 00:09:30,870
arm on the second place we have
political state attacks

154
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,120
and which are trying to exhaust state
table since

155
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,819
and stateful devices like firewalls and
load balancers and so on

156
00:09:37,819 --> 00:09:41,490
and in typical political state attack
Asus INF lot

157
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:46,800
rst flood or something like that it is
just trying to X of the state claims

158
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,160
on on 3rd we have some

159
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,980
volumetric attacks volumetric attacks is
from my point of view are we

160
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,379
most primitive attacks because we are
simply brute force

161
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:01,300
yeah you don't need very are much
intelligence for this year

162
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,430
just two figure out I'm how you can

163
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,490
generate most traffic to arm exhaust the
Banff if

164
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:13,670
arm of a target okay on so

165
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:17,389
due to a fact vents evening if when
banks fish

166
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:20,649
arm benefit costs have decreased from

167
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:24,889
take a point of view arm volumetric
attack is the most expensive

168
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:29,709
attack okay so met some reason why arm
competitive other

169
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:33,050
attack types volumetric a text and
decreased

170
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,649
yet arm my favorite here

171
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:40,040
a multi-factor it X multi-factor
attacked isn't

172
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,050
actually attack itself

173
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,819
arm it's more a bland of all the tech
types mentioned before

174
00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:50,029
yeah so we should and you should in

175
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:53,509
in the wild focus on beast typeof a text
because

176
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:56,709
we saw very arm increasing

177
00:10:56,709 --> 00:10:59,839
and most difficult to arm

178
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,970
mitigate Saints value me

179
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,749
different a technique to is used

180
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,949
so when we take a look it via arm

181
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:13,120
a few tools arm available for

182
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,899
yeah for generating some some some some
dedust attacks

183
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:21,430
arm will see some I'm activist to its
like Lloyd hanukah number

184
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,249
very very boring press f5 to its okay
miss to lose

185
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:29,519
I'm nothing sophisticated but just two
press if I for you press a five until

186
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,730
something goes down

187
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,730
up so there is nothing really
sophisticated in it

188
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,829
so but if IG goal for be arm

189
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:40,860
you all will be reared will cement on
also

190
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,730
benchmarking and diagnostic tools are
utilized by take us okay

191
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,810
arm but dockside open source scenes
record pace for the storms like

192
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,790
Apache Benson a spinning by the way it's
being as as a very powerful tool for

193
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,639
testing in generating assimilating some
deals attacks

194
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:58,819
on the scope base is also used by the
attackers

195
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:02,350
okay so don't don't be confused

196
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,569
confused by it me a mound of arm

197
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:09,589
tools available if you arm look indeed
to win

198
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:13,149
and miss tools you will discover that
all tools regardless

199
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:17,110
what we do arm utilize same attack
vectors

200
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,620
okay so we have application flooding
let's say

201
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,160
HTTP request funding or something like
that we have to packet funding

202
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,120
mechanisms

203
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,079
yeah but be important point days

204
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:33,449
none of boast two weeks are exploiting
vulnerabilities

205
00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:36,480
we are speaking about beat force attacks

206
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,430
okay think this is a very very important
point

207
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,959
I'm when we look at look at a spinning

208
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:47,279
arm it's a very easy to use

209
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,899
to yet but very powerful arm during a

210
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:54,639
testing sense in 18 innings I E

211
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,790
I he mad mean I made very bad experience
with my

212
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:04,059
hosting provider and because I just
fired up my VM so que se

213
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:07,360
let stimulate some some dealers attacks
and I'm

214
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,949
yeah the whole hosting facility went
down

215
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:15,160
a it it was not amusing because a

216
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,559
just got a call hey what are you doing
fair our firewalls

217
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:22,149
and less stable devise load balancers go
down and we are trying to figure out

218
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:22,709
what is

219
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:26,470
what what is going up there so you have
been warned

220
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,519
if you are playing with a spring in the
cloned

221
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,370
just be careful I'm I have added miss
light

222
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:36,470
sends my end the eighth checkpoint XP it

223
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:39,699
just today what luck I'm

224
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:43,689
so I have made many tests on

225
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:47,649
awards okay so when they're XO Brenda y
que miss A's

226
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:51,459
okay my firewall my system is
bulletproof

227
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:55,069
against he does yeah so you take just HP

228
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:59,189
fire up round about 150 alt 150 kilobits
per second

229
00:13:59,189 --> 00:14:02,730
he will break every file in place okay
we got was what you meant to say so just

230
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:03,689
way too self

231
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:07,110
take the biggest ASAP lines take the
biggest check point declines

232
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,350
and fire missin flood okay so

233
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,119
in the last four weeks on I want to give
them a check point

234
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:19,100
to on to implement some mitigation
techniques do something testings

235
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,170
and I'm checkpoint confirmed that

236
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:26,269
arm their products well when the berlin
default configuration

237
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:29,480
revolt additional hot fixing okay so

238
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,110
bed if you go to a to a ban on say your
product is willing to listen no

239
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:36,230
we have some cookin place you have be
skipped bows but

240
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,759
it doesn't work if you really tested
okay just go for your own

241
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:42,999
and tested and don't believe the
Security benefits a message I want to

242
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:45,480
transport it

243
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,939
so on the contras is

244
00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:52,939
on one side you have H being which is
really good force attack

245
00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:56,850
okay flooding flooding the system on the
other side have a very small

246
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:00,490
if and and on very slow it takes like
slow loris

247
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:05,329
oslo HDPE attacks okay arm when we talk
about slowing GDP attacks

248
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:08,699
arm missus just two

249
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:12,670
to 22 cents in um nature to be request
bite by bite

250
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:17,180
okay but never selling carriage return
so arm

251
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:21,129
the request will never be completed in
fact

252
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:25,019
yeah so been slated to be a tech will
try to exhort

253
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:28,069
also quit available on the summer so on

254
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:31,889
which will result in an denial of
service arm

255
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,309
situation I'm now

256
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:38,470
one might can finger on might think that
missus

257
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,790
kinda woman ability know it isn't

258
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,829
it is stunned art and conform

259
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:49,249
I'm HTTP behavior so Apache doesn't care
about

260
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:53,300
yet you have to fix it yourself and
there's a rule-based to fix it

261
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,670
but my recommendation is such kind of

262
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,990
low him slow or no attacks

263
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:04,189
yeah are very very difficult to fight on
the network play on it what are in the

264
00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:04,929
central

265
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:08,139
int arm my recommendation is to

266
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:11,170
mitigate such kind of attacks on the
somalia

267
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,600
yeah let's say with some kind of pets
you want to use

268
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,860
or some I'm time optimization on your
summer

269
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,610
yet the syntheses no

270
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:26,100
you know were is ago I'm you say

271
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,179
love you I questions up

272
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:33,230
you my opinion that you

273
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:37,170
piece of software Loughborough involving
Yahoo

274
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:41,670
arms any one thing which you know they
want to see

275
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:45,759
is not over up to the

276
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,759
I agree but the patch it doesn't

277
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,990
and met Mets Mets million point if you
read the news groups

278
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,999
arm newsgroups a full as some people say
okay why doesn't the patch to fix this

279
00:16:56,999 --> 00:16:57,889
and so on

280
00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:02,990
and Apache tried it but arm if you dig
into his time as a change this

281
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:08,180
I'm you will army you will arm get other
problems and other side effects so

282
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,220
Apache SASE go and fix yourself

283
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,560
but I totally agree with you week %uh
what Microsoft

284
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,320
or yours for the change of policy more
on it since

285
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,650
about 3 who is not for you

286
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:25,080
is the with vendor issue 3 for

287
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,240
we have to a get eastward for

288
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,850
up about think so

289
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,210
yep arm so

290
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:39,750
if you use slow loris for example

291
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:44,310
just too so its own example you can talk
to seven say okay find the best time old

292
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,970
values to keep us up a busy

293
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:50,450
I'm solo as will go arm through tested
test the time of values for you and say

294
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:50,890
okay

295
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,910
I recommend you missed I'm not value for
example to five hundred and thirty

296
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:54,850
seconds

297
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:58,470
I'm the really nasty failing ace

298
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:02,180
arm if you if you are under attack

299
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,670
okay arm you won't

300
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:09,040
see anything on your server

301
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,750
first okay you have no CPU arm

302
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:16,520
you won't see nothing in the locks
scenes Apache doesn't lock

303
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,170
incomplete requests you won't see the
slowest attack

304
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:23,550
your locks yeah so medicine

305
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:27,000
really something that makes me crazy

306
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,090
so as we not talked about

307
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:34,090
most attack types at arm

308
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:38,470
I think it's no important to cover are
mitigation techniques

309
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:41,890
so what can we do to prevent such kind
of

310
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,250
arm attacks or mitigate fam prevention
is afsane

311
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:49,890
me wrong but for this because and it
does matter we can only talk about

312
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:54,290
mitigation not prevention at all so

313
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:58,190
this is a very very primitive arm
picture

314
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:01,480
whole a scrubbing Center works

315
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,620
okay arm I building the sly 2 to

316
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:08,290
just to illustrate arm what is

317
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:11,850
the best practice approach to doing
scrubbing

318
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:15,200
Rd dust mitigation yet I'm

319
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,030
as I mentioned before in my slights be
mitigate in response lights will be

320
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,250
covered from there

321
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:25,260
arm very large enterprise perspective
running its only s

322
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,500
with the whites arm range of dynamic
applications okay

323
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,980
so if you only have static applications
are streaming sites or something like

324
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,540
this:

325
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,840
you can i cum ice yeah or you can uses

326
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,380
a CDN and you are fine but let's not be
reality

327
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:46,070
let's not be a real-world scenario K two
days implications are very sophisticated

328
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:50,890
a unique back and communications you
have mean so all structures and so on

329
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:54,650
so you can't arm just rely on

330
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:58,050
non-static applications so if you look
here we have an

331
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,630
from example of a new homes on customer
okay

332
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:05,960
so what happens here in case of attack
is arm

333
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,870
the traffic and only the traffic for the
attack IP addresses of ramped

334
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:14,260
okay of ramping arm is an isn't

335
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:18,010
yet as a stand-up term Indian meaning
beyond de los

336
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:22,640
on medication world ordeal spirit so

337
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,360
what what is done here is my traffic is
redirected a few

338
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,260
kind of threat mitigation device okay
aren't we don't speak about

339
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:34,580
arm some some gas fi awards or load
balancers or

340
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:38,190
or any I'm and say

341
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:42,110
legacy security devices in place aren't
we speak about

342
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,850
purpose-built solutions and
purpose-built hardware to count adidas

343
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:49,890
okay so what happens in traffic goes for
communication device

344
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:53,210
arm communications solution is cleaned
and scrubbed

345
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,890
and paid back to your arm infrastructure

346
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,900
and in this case we are talking about

347
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,770
on ramping okay so we are offering the
traffic to clean it can on running back

348
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,250
to the normal routine puff

349
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:09,600
thats how was climbing center regardless
arm

350
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,960
way you look is working today

351
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,650
I'm the first question in counting de
dos is

352
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:21,930
make or buy as always yet the first
question a faceoff all will be OK

353
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:25,430
do we have to build up stuff knowledge
something like that or it can be just

354
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,870
buy it

355
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,980
am I think it's an almost religious

356
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:34,360
arm question yeah and my opinion is

357
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,120
I met you have to do with your own

358
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:43,990
because I'm if you have a very complex
infrastructure

359
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,960
cloud-based solutions or managed
solutions

360
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,210
of not always but often don't really fit
your needs

361
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:54,230
okay so if you look at the approaches

362
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,400
arm of cloud-based solutions marrow

363
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:02,170
Mary always using to kind of approach
okay we have a DNS based approach

364
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:05,580
when they act as a arming DNS server and

365
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,950
arm and I'm using reverse proxies

366
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:12,770
for your applications yeah so the
customers connecting or be a taker is

367
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,500
connecting to the reverse proxy

368
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,570
Andrew S proxies connecting to your site
but just imagine

369
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:22,260
I'm man several issues with it okay army

370
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,970
just think about this is so certificates
would you like to give

371
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:29,320
your pillow pace provide all the SSL
Certificates is it legal

372
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,110
in EU yeah or in germany so but raises
some

373
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:37,010
legal questions and the second is the on

374
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:40,880
BGP based approach yes I am like
Prolexic does

375
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,950
so way off from the traffic to their
data centers

376
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,510
scrub it for you and pipe it back to you
over agree to a lil

377
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:51,680
or any leased line or something like
that but business faces the same issues

378
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,400
okay

379
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,480
arm if you think about data protection
or something like that

380
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,090
army I think this raises

381
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:03,790
really major questions another point
this

382
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:07,640
if you use cloud-based solutions missus
my personal

383
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,220
I'm opinion on it I'm you are going for

384
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:15,720
single point of failure okay arm if you
read in the press

385
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,430
arm last week's there was a major outage
of CloudFlare

386
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:25,790
okay taking down roundabout 800,000
customer sites

387
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:29,550
yeah so if you remember my slides before

388
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:32,700
as I said misconfiguration yeah

389
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,960
was on place free this major out to
cheer

390
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,590
was cost with some kind of
misconfiguration

391
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:45,630
running into a 20 per pack okay but we
will cover it

392
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:49,610
arm later on on

393
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:53,720
if you going def you will see that there
is no by only

394
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,580
or to make only solution okay you have
to team up with your ISP

395
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,720
so I'm speaker Visp

396
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,320
and I'm set up your ISP to come to
volumetric attacks

397
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,830
okay you have to you have to shake down
I'm the kinda volumetric attack to an

398
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:09,680
appropriate

399
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:14,210
Banff if but you can handle it but you
have also from a compliment

400
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:17,400
okay I'm one have to build up stuff

401
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,520
really it is it is a very important
component

402
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,080
if you try to handle this default a
house knowledge

403
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,390
you will fail it's my personal opinion
yeah

404
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:30,510
I'm on the what it was also

405
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,660
very important as visibility I'm

406
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:37,720
if you try to come to deduce attacks or
any kind of those attacks

407
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,240
vote Jane invisibility or analyzing your
traffic during normal operation

408
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,070
you will fail okay so my recommendation
is go for NetFlow

409
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:49,210
collect not flow inflammation
information watch out for unusual

410
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:49,960
traffic

411
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,460
and on how your network works okay how
where cast miss came from

412
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:58,910
um yeah I'm analyze gateway IP
information

413
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:02,530
and all those stuff like this and
important point is

414
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:06,580
you have to team up yeah am establish
some kind of

415
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:10,660
link are mitigation plan with your
provider team up with them

416
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,980
because revolt involving a provider arm

417
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:19,680
your ISP it is very difficult to come to
do this

418
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:25,110
so iffy take a look at the must have
come to measures I have collected here

419
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:28,910
arm will

420
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:32,590
see vet both kind of mitigations

421
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:37,200
communication techniques are not
implemented in two days

422
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,920
security devices or legacy devices okay
so if you

423
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:45,190
Ste look take a look at his medications
can you imagine

424
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:48,820
to do something like this with your
legacy devices with your

425
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,660
of firewall or load balance or any kind
of

426
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,870
device you have today in place it won't
work yeah

427
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:59,690
best reason why we need purpose build
hard to

428
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:03,410
which can do for us flood detection and
mitigation types

429
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:07,570
okay arm TCP policy-based blocking for
example

430
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:10,840
I enforcing timers enforcing met

431
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,960
a specific amount of bytes yet

432
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,560
has to be sent during this data
connection is being established

433
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,710
just for example to prevent slow attacks

434
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:23,980
I'm we need application the
rate-limiting and this is very very

435
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,500
important to rate limit

436
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,460
HTTP request DNS requests and all
application there

437
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,000
arm stuff and last but not least

438
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,690
is very important you need DPI
capabilities okay

439
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:41,870
I'm sometimes one type of medication
alone

440
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:46,830
doesn't work you have to combine them
yeah and bis is very purpose built

441
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:47,800
device keynesian

442
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:52,620
because eat maybe you will do some gear
I P filtering the load balancer okay you

443
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,570
can def do DP eye on you I P S

444
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:58,010
but you don't have the spawning send the
new purpose-built solution that can

445
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:02,160
do all the things together yeah on and
that's important point

446
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,940
and its and some point you have to go to
arm

447
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,520
really into the in the payload player
for example to filter

448
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,620
arm yeah lets a motive Victoria Texas
something like that because

449
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:18,170
packets or packet based authentication
or gay with filtering

450
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:21,910
won't work always okay I'm

451
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:26,710
so sometimes on my colleagues I'm a
social than the presentations in OK

452
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:29,950
why didn't you list back holding yeah

453
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:34,260
I'm from my point of view black holding
isn't actually mitigation

454
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,400
okay at least from the customer's
perspective I'm

455
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,940
various coming in with the committee
does an ISP can they call the customer

456
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:44,110
okay everything is fine but the
customers debt

457
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:48,190
so it's not mitigation and met some
reason by

458
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:51,670
in didn't include it is kind of
medication and

459
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,810
if you look at all these countermeasures
I think it's

460
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:58,430
it's really clear why would he need why
will need

461
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:01,940
purpose-built equipment okay

462
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:07,810
so I have so many many or movements a
tech types and mitigations and so on

463
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:12,480
and know you may ask okay you're talking
about purpose-built solutions

464
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,510
what is it about okay what is a
purpose-built solution to counter the

465
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,190
dose

466
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,620
so I don't have any vendor affinity okay

467
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,720
on but note don't hesitate to army

468
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,010
yet he had to talk about vendors doing
bad

469
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:29,060
we'll talk about the know sinning doing
good and

470
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:33,900
my experience was very good Arbor
networks okay

471
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,120
those guys I'm a focused

472
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,460
Inc in combating de dos mabel
purpose-built devises

473
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:44,460
which is company based in place on site
in your data centers

474
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,780
or on your let's say on their upstream

475
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:51,920
I'm and important point is that

476
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,730
are more follows a best practice
approach as we mentioned

477
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,020
before okay make an off from traffic for
you

478
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:03,010
they do BGP announcements of rent to
traffic for you

479
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:06,170
clean it and pipe back to infrastructure
okay

480
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:10,880
be important point is you don't have to
redirect all the traffic just imagine

481
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,800
you have a 10 or 20 Gigabit

482
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,170
internet connectivity here and doing
deals attack URL

483
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:21,580
really under pressure okay it is not
practicable Bay

484
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:25,640
to redirect all the traffic so you need
to redirect only be attacked

485
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,240
on the train and sorry be I'm traffic
will be

486
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,960
IP address attacked only um

487
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,970
are always teaming up with arm

488
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:40,630
many ISP's world by so we have test
established in in global

489
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:45,380
arm strength measurement system are
global monitoring system which may call

490
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:48,560
aplus and Atlas is am

491
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,580
getting feed it by about net 300 ISP's
worldwide

492
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:56,900
so may build up some kind of signal
intelligence to to detect

493
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,490
in global activity botnet stock nixon
something like that

494
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:03,690
and what I can't say about the solution
is

495
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:06,780
it works okay

496
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:11,260
I'm and thats whole mitigation consul

497
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:15,200
has to look like at I'm

498
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,260
so as you can see you have several type
of

499
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,980
litigations here ok let's take
countermeasures okay

500
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,590
I'm depending on your attack you will
struggle with it

501
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:31,690
you will activate arm some of them you
will deactivate some of them

502
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:34,770
and it is it is depending on a tech type

503
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:38,020
but without such kind of consul

504
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:42,020
or such kind of I'm countermeasures in a
purpose-built device

505
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:47,600
okay it is very very difficult or let's
say impossible to count adidas

506
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,730
am

507
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:54,320
so when I talk to endorse

508
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,740
or other customers ISP's I'm

509
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:01,100
I find that are very arm

510
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:05,780
is some kind of a pic myths as I
mentioned before

511
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:09,820
one thing is that people or vendors

512
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,830
tell you okay my firewall and IPS

513
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:16,060
can protect against the loss no

514
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:20,200
don't even tried okay so regardless with
10 saves

515
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,650
going to appeal to see just tested it
will fail

516
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:27,270
and now I'm a thing is that CDN
providers like I come I

517
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:31,250
at arm came to me and said okay with
assault already does problems

518
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,520
just Akamai's your site and all the
problems is gone here

519
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:38,320
if you have only static site if you have
a streaming site known dynamic content

520
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,560
or something like that

521
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:43,410
this will work here on but it's not a
real-world scenario

522
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:47,810
okay on last but not least

523
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:51,530
we have ACL automation okay when I talk
to some

524
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:55,420
I'm some some networking space is OK I
don't need purpose-built hardware

525
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:59,110
I have my geeks Afghan acho que

526
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:02,210
I have my ex waters and I push scripts
okay

527
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:07,010
so I'm if you

528
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:10,520
I'm remember be all types of CloudFlare
yeah

529
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:14,050
cloud fair did exactly fat

530
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:18,190
okay we have such kind of I'm straight
analyzes funding

531
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:23,160
bet analyzes an attack and profile said
and believes is dis such kind of

532
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,680
arm

533
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,090
script is generated for peace

534
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:32,760
specific tech type okay so the clout
fair

535
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,160
outage what was called arm

536
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:40,700
E let's say by juniper back okay the
perfect script I'll put it and I'm

537
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:44,250
arm let's say I am

538
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:47,320
politic mitigation stripped script on
which

539
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,690
try to try to arm catch

540
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:55,370
all IP had us with a size about 90 K

541
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:58,490
okay there is no IP packet in the wild
with 90k

542
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:01,890
and as the script generated some

543
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:05,280
this profile and the profile was pushed
to all cheaper

544
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,900
routers yeah by cloud fair arm we went
down

545
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,160
at in over 20 countries are

546
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,660
a twenty data centers so ACL joking

547
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:20,190
as I call this doesn't work okay and
will lead to misconfiguration

548
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:23,900
really to outage and you will not go to
self before the echoes

549
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:29,160
before the attackers can do I'm

550
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,200
when we talk about early warnings

551
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,280
it is important to understand

552
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,900
your position in the community your
position in be

553
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:43,630
arm in the society okay from me from a
business perspective

554
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:47,440
I'm it is clear but ordinary Press

555
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,100
and ordinary news doesn't work for it
okay so

556
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:55,050
you have to join some kind of I'm
information sharing any insist

557
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:59,550
like FS i sec like it. I say go
something like that because

558
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:03,010
arm those guys um

559
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:07,200
bone told talk to averse which are not
members of

560
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,270
any kind of I sick group okay so what I
can really recommend this

561
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:14,630
join such groups it is we're and

562
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:18,370
on you will be able to arm exchange

563
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:21,720
and getting stuff for companies in
business we have

564
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,340
the same problems that view and you can
go for sure but

565
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:29,890
you meant if you talk with somebody
about your problems and it pains and so

566
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:33,410
so on on it won't go to the press okay

567
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:38,370
on think that is a very very and
important point on

568
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:41,660
another point is use social media yeah

569
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:44,660
its unbelievable but Twitter's awesome
an

570
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:47,900
I'm you can detect some shit storms

571
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:52,000
with Google Alerts on Twitter before we

572
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,980
I'm let's say before midtech really
starts okay but you need some kind of

573
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,370
intelligence really people

574
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:01,890
they care about me doing research okay
arm

575
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:05,270
configured Google Alerts to detect
pastebin needs yeah

576
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,830
if you go back in the past most of the

577
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:11,830
largest attacks yeah arm

578
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:14,880
were announced weaver announced but

579
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,410
not just started and where they were
announced

580
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,870
so this is very very important on to
cover first

581
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:25,690
so but was it from my point

582
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:30,339
after any questions

583
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:33,690
all first all also

584
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:39,160
the most common their pilots law little
of both Russo

585
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,839
he said basic like a as

586
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:46,410
house over romance up

587
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:51,150
on no not really because

588
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:54,849
I'm v the attackers are concentrating
are focusing on the

589
00:35:54,849 --> 00:35:58,170
on brute force type attacks on because
it is the

590
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:02,140
simple way to which to to get success
ovitz

591
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:06,390
follows the go long national affairs

592
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:09,990
is I'll

593
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:13,250
don't get the for me laws

594
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,450
up pass top I

595
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:19,869
Gatos yes your

596
00:36:19,869 --> 00:36:23,540
business honors ass baths

597
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:27,300
also okay of

598
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,930
sup the the

599
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:34,970
all he you no not really

600
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:38,599
not really maybe even for other
companies something like that

601
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:43,910
but in the years arm but I arm company
indeed 07 and paying 50 does and and

602
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:47,330
mitigation techniques I didn't
experience it to be honest

603
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:51,130
0 law 00 over

604
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:56,020
onslaught or I'll homes she useful

605
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:59,050
overall Albany

606
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,280
heart she be she's well is

607
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,540
solos was just for show thoughts

608
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,740
and for all also soul year

609
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:12,310
if you out up up also

610
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:16,200
or just 40 raver

611
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,119
whatever little you for all in the for a
while

612
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:23,780
so it's alright whirls along that

613
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:27,040
or so just your overall its

614
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,140
although he's

615
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:34,500
yes miles yes yes dust-up

616
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,160
Longhorns action saw you shop

617
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,420
movies here of way yes

618
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,750
so or he's JS

619
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:49,070
just Nurses Week its vision

620
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:52,760
all diagnose all yes I totally agree
with you

621
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,200
so you have to implement arm Lynn

622
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,290
let's say arm several defense lines

623
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:04,400
okay but depends on the infrastructure
so if you have a pet form for example or

624
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,210
something like that

625
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:08,220
I'm it make sense to implement such kind
of monitoring yeah

626
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:13,330
but I'm if you I'm I'm if you talk about
boolfalse attacks like

627
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:17,790
zine flooding yeah maybe we won't break
some on the first line of defense that

628
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:20,440
say a fire was IPS in something like
that will break

629
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,700
before you before they even get to your
service so

630
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,240
you have to do monitoring and on several
times penis those

631
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:33,320
this

632
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,400
whose says

633
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,080
you its I'm US

634
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:46,390
both SF or other

635
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,600
UT good you

636
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,450
okay a

637
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:58,030
I say was a well

638
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:01,430
okay this past weekend I on

639
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:05,540
him hey

640
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:09,410
suggest I your mouth okay

641
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:13,660
arm no now I think I think it's okay

642
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:17,420
on let's say about to give it on

643
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:21,200
just to have a number arm yes

644
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,950
about to give its on me and its

645
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:29,340
just to give you number I'm we have
analyze the attacks

646
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:33,560
from the application I'm perspective

647
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:38,150
and found about 9 thousand different
broza agents

648
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:42,180
user agent strings okay on so

649
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,420
that means that the attackers a spoofing

650
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,490
generating their own use agents on but

651
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:51,940
during our attacks we have to let's say
about

652
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:55,310
22 two Gigabit tech and bout the

653
00:39:55,310 --> 00:40:01,470
10 20,000 baht involved yes whether

654
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:05,320
I'll while all

655
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,810
yeah morning a

656
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:12,830
I A he s

657
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:19,830
it it was yet so an anonymous guys go
sip a spin and say is OK

658
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:23,410
arm looks for example German railways

659
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:26,550
full 1 I've one of us overtraining
because

660
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,710
he would mask okay so

661
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:33,460
but this is difficult trigger on his own
mentioned before

662
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:37,670
yeah watch out for pastebin watch out
for any kind of a new Space Pen

663
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:40,820
arm or earnings pasting sites on

664
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:44,130
those guys are announcing yea they want
on

665
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:47,170
publicity I'm you we want to change

666
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:50,190
full course on what they do they want to
do it in the dark

667
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:53,450
so it is it is a good they also to watch
out arm

668
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:58,320
for the sky Nov announcements on the
Internet is

669
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,510
yes another story

670
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:07,020
this day whose the

671
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:11,910
there yes he's

672
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:15,130
from yes anyway

673
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:18,310
yeah someone just

674
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:21,820
break is store

675
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:25,590
name as I mentioned before I didn't
experience it yet

676
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:30,050
so arm I'm only here talking about
things that I really experience myself

677
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:34,000
okay so if you if you go in the deepest
fear we will find several

678
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,340
100 types of attacks but be I'm the four
types I mentioned before

679
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:41,820
I think it's the arm major pain of
industry today

680
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:48,160
and me

681
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,180
her yeah p I'm

682
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:54,270
regarding as the up

683
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:57,850
does the offer no I don't know service

684
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:00,960
version up as the

685
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,940
yes brief were 16 through

686
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:11,940
especially with a lighter just get

687
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:14,990
last sentence can you repeat it please
sorry bit louder

688
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:19,400
yes a want to experience this week thru
is this a

689
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,770
of up well you know it's a is

690
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:29,770
providers how to say

691
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:34,290
okay so I am as I mentioned before

692
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:38,280
arm the cloud and I on bond become
friends

693
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,700
okay so to be honest I don't trust them

694
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:45,790
because I'm I know from my perspective

695
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:50,630
I'm how hard it is to 22 Medicaid
application there takes okay

696
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:54,980
and memory X or Y comes up and say okay
I will handle the whole hold ito's fing

697
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:59,040
for you I say okay I'm it is even
difficult for me

698
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,420
when I know my applications and behavior
in detail to mitigated

699
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:07,940
I'm and it is kind of not realistic

700
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:11,920
been a vendor tells you I will mitigate
every type of attack

701
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,980
for you okay so I didn't

702
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:18,640
do a comprehensive testing for cloud
providers

703
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,450
I just don't use them actually it
doesn't matter if you think a

704
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:26,000
outsoles or your home the sea is

705
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,050
well be I pm0

706
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:32,700
up and I'm network security we need to
know about and I G

707
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:37,260
warranties on my essay whatever excel on
of

708
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:40,740
with our live in Utah haha and the

709
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:43,870
though you perspective I

710
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:47,860
what's your what's your point on these

711
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:50,880
gustaria how is the the No

712
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,840
and up argue I should go and see

713
00:43:54,840 --> 00:44:00,270
louise is rewarding yours is nice

714
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:04,290
okay you mean for a cloud-based
solutions the visual

715
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:08,060
you should do your own then gonna this
you see

716
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:11,900
I lead $200k of think we've movies

717
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:15,080
she procedures and it's a great sorrow

718
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:19,090
reason with worthless it's for this
reason

719
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:22,270
of course because I'm if you testing arm

720
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:26,330
you will see that the data sheets
datasheets and marketing driven

721
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,540
and do not reflect the I'm on reality

722
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:32,570
I'm I can always recommend to arm

723
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:35,980
invest in in testing equipment yet
testing

724
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:39,490
arm your dedust protection of security
measures

725
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:43,360
is always Burford so that's my personal
experience okay

726
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:47,190
I'm in the past laws many

727
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:51,020
now many times a trusted the vendor a
commander said okay if I will can handle

728
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:54,670
300,000 connections per second no it
can't it can't even handle hundreds

729
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:56,600
thousands connections per second okay

730
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:00,590
so and then no cams and Cesar came by
deep Manti dust protection can handle

731
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:04,080
let's say forty thousand fifty thousand
bucks per second okay then you have to

732
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:04,650
test it

733
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:08,020
and since always wofford West

734
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:12,550
there when you missus is this is your

735
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:16,310
sush we man just say

736
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:19,510
owns you teddy's yeah are you

737
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:24,080
yes hollow yet okay so we use traffic
generators

738
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:28,150
for example capable of generating 10
Gigabit stateful traffic

739
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:31,330
from capable of simulating four million

740
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:34,610
klein's and arm

741
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:37,830
you have to spend much money to

742
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:42,790
to comprehensive testing and we have
talking bout $200 fee 100

743
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:46,230
cable invest to test such kind arm

744
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:49,980
but you can go whenever for approach
okay you can go to a cloud-based

745
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:50,610
approach

746
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:53,830
to mention before fire up 100

747
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:57,050
200 arm the M's in the clout

748
00:45:57,050 --> 00:46:00,490
and just %uh XP okay but

749
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:03,720
as a mentioned before be careful yeah
I'm

750
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,970
most hosting providers I

751
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:11,390
aren't amused if you fire up such kind
of little simulations

752
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:14,610
army it is amazing but it will evening
break

753
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:17,940
uge hosting facilities okay II

754
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:21,820
Google from experience you don't know
euros I'm

755
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:25,070
we've never ever the that the

756
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:30,870
all reports or compacted even when we
have friends in the mesh networks

757
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:34,420
we never ever while all seem to live
your life

758
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:38,090
ec2 nice I'll threats like all those

759
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:41,520
I everyone wants it is very hot we went

Jens wiesenthal as the we never

761
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,490
ever a single one which said this is
Google

762
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:52,660
all seem to use traffic very you faulty

763
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:57,260
motorists were asked us for more than
forty maybe I should use a provider

764
00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:00,410
I okay

765
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:03,490

up they missed by us

795
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:57,550

799
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:12,840
make but maybe we should have to be laid
on

800
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:19,840
I'm very interested in your bulletproof
hosting provider so on

801
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:22,490
I

802
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:25,630

forcible all ball or

812
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:03,420
at see horse y eso

813
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:07,320
for us I'll good

814
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:10,810
serious I this whole you're really not
serious

815
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:14,360
%um all weaver reveals

816
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:18,110
just saw Paul you just I agree

817
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:21,400
agree but we don't have it on the end it
is Mina

818
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,540
men don't we have a overall its overall
problem I think

819
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:28,690
but but just imagine okay you you are
sitting in your office and and and and

820
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:29,200
and

821
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,350
I'm all the lights going red because you
have any doubts attack okay

822
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:35,650
the sea associate oh and CX why whatever

823
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:38,760
Casey and says you have to solve the
problem now yes to solve it

824
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,340
and you don't have time to establish
contracts yeah do some

825
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:45,850
some kind of negotiation you say okay
there is somebody who can help make

826
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:49,510
just give it to me you to put in place
you mitigate and that's it

827
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:52,860
am if you have a chance 22

828
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:55,990
on to a long-term plan I totally agree
with you

829
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:59,480
okay but in most cases be dismissed
incident driven you have an incident and

830
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,280
you have to react

831
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:05,540
okay this is a your through yes

832
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:10,490
the with my cause I'm the 08 humans is
that it doesn't work

833
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:14,020
you his

834
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:17,330
was are though my the this

835
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:21,080
want okay so for many reasons why it
won't work

836
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:24,510
okay jobs and just imagine you have
kinda um you need

837
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:27,840
some kind of profiling okay you need to
pull finalize the attack

838
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:31,000
Jane visibility and see okay what kind
of

839
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,010
on blocking mechanism I can implement
okay so

840
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:37,760
I'm just being able to speak to tech
yeah if you have a speech to text

841
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,890
probably even be out 10 20,000 baht
involved

842
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:43,990
they will probably use the compare IP
space okay

843
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:47,010
so if you have an automated scripts both
houses attack it will

844
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:50,560
flow than ACL but the book the intended

845
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:53,710
I will be on love with her come from
these

846
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:57,770
compromise both days directly addresses

847
00:51:57,770 --> 00:52:01,270
or whatever his

848
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:04,850
showed world it doesn't it doesn't work

849
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:08,750
even if you take just for example if you
take in let's say and also our

850
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:12,940
um 9 than 9,000 router yet from Cisco
for example and say okay

851
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:16,830
I have here in such kind of guns in
fighting with spoofed on you will get

852
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:17,600
probably

853
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:21,280
arm fall to of free billion

854
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,260
on ACL entries oases so you can put it
on your own

855
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:28,390
year XP know what are these providers

856
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:32,480
who present because I assumed they were
something to say about this

857
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,570
lots of pieces a.m.

858
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:38,670
I also convince them to you

859
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:42,080
well yet okay so

860
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:45,150
my experience for us um if you if you
tried this

861
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:50,450
yet as as you as I mentioned before with
with ACL joking and profiling the attack

862
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:53,570
um we run into several several problems
arm

863
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:57,380
miss configurations knocking out to self
and so on

864
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:00,800
and and and that's really the reason why
you needn't come sometime

865
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,340
I'm some kind of centralized in a
purpose-built solution there but that's

866
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:05,140
that's just my

867
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:08,180
my experience because as I mentioned
before if you try to pull for such kind

868
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:08,830
of attack

869
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:12,470
he would not be intended things were in
danger

870
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:17,130
because you have to understand fully the
attack what's going on

871
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:20,220
you ought to make precise I

872
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:23,600
perfect yes but you can't do it manually

873
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,220
so the alternation is a problem yep

874
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:31,170
place so or

875
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:35,170
if you Service issued

876
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:39,310
you miles his

877
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:42,700
your he injured

878
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:46,700
he spares there the same sold

879
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:51,050
so sued bingo or the airlines

880
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:55,920
always waits for their few people who
are you

881
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:02,270
he said all any use your assumption is
also up

882
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:05,580
for where you whose all

883
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:11,020
he said days he'd

884
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:14,160
he wears UK wallet

885
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:18,740
you who help on my opinion no

886
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:22,290
because of such kind attacks okay arm

887
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:26,330
if you use our iffy a facing facing with
multi-factor attacks

888
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:29,720
there is not such kind of lay a free
ought therefore signature

889
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:33,290
you have to go deep at and you have to
combine

890
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:36,380
on several mitigation I'm techniques

891
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:39,430
at miss I'm brutus

892
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:43,600
can handle just for example you can't do
any kind of payload regex

893
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:47,360
your router something like that you can
safely if free information and therefore

894
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,720
information that's it

895
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,010
are a packet length or something like
that yeah but you can't

896
00:54:52,010 --> 00:54:55,700
outlook deep in TV I'm into the
interview packet

897
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:58,830
to make sophisticated mitigation

898
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:03,210
arm of the attack assist personally my
experience i

899
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:07,600
I try it often to handle it if he's ACLs
run into several problems not help

900
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,260
myself

901
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:11,630
and say okay get rid of it we will we
will need a purpose-built solution

902
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:16,090
yeah maybe as I said before some
statements may fight cons and others may

903
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:16,510
not

904
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:20,000
on this is my personal experience which
I made during fighting

905
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,810
in combating de dos and on I bones

906
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:27,040
give miss purpose-built solution away

907
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:30,590
for any role to base Torres ACL based

908
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:34,810
arm solution never no

909
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:39,420
yep

910
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:42,710
yup in or

911
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:46,500
whose you you I was

912
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,540
or you it the

913
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:53,590
good is of course are although

914
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:56,620
yes yes I'm just

915
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:59,880
I'm talking yesterday befits if its
chief engineer arm

916
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:03,810
on on this and we have agree okay I'm
going to make a publication on don't

917
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:09,320
I'm going to and they said okay just
give us one day 22 vanity fair winnable

918
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:12,580
and they committed today I'm firewalls
arm

919
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:16,210
file releases arm before of income

920
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:19,920
7 r75 on a woman but such kind of
attacks

921
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,140
if you to not special kind of
optimization like

922
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:29,350
moved to Q drive us hierarchy
optimization and something like that

923
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:29,600
K
