thing said hopefully make once you leave

50
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,720
once in the fight at Barca on the maybe
tomorrow maybe on Friday

51
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,889
you really fighting back in a in many
whites ate when it comes to your

52
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:28,780
thinking on

53
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,220
some the feeling about security and

54
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,879
but so this is what we what we strive to
a to provide virtual parts I'm

55
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,000
topaz is not about high profits are out
there was no we we don't make any money

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,780
off of it

57
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,260
with with faux pas some bf we never made
it and

58
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,699
maybe I'm and that will never change but
this is not important

59
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:53,220
that was out parties so suddenly making
money but of us are

60
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,049
they know it and I'm say peak in the
crossings so this week

61
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:03,220
but tour buses about some education it's
about aligning

62
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:08,120
lying about security about latest trends
and both protection and a tax

63
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,459
to a buzz is about having fun aside
having fun always helps

64
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:16,049
fr say education assira if you have kids
stuff

65
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:19,530
with saline school they were they will
know and you might remember that

66
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:24,159
having fun ups with fur lining and two
buses about and this is a very important

67
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:25,810
part it's about interaction

68
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,710
it's about paper talking to each other a
paper

69
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,159
I'll discussing ideas people mixing of

70
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:36,529
and all this with one ultimate goal that
s

71
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:40,710
make the world a safer place I fully
serious about this this is what will

72
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:41,560
process about

73
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,650
and to make this interaction happy to
make it to happen

74
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,620
making the world a safer place there is
something but which we call the

75
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,889
magic focus for me out that s simply
cite as that is you

76
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:57,550
odd idea says hi to people like he had a
people who makes up for it discuss their

77
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,340
ideas

78
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:02,800
and you give me an idea a trip %uh side
that was larry is

79
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,010
different groups that will pass there is
some I so its information security

80
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,210
office us from Bariloche organizations

81
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,300
actually there's many of them here %uh

82
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,169
Postmedia community industry meets

83
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:20,930
ackhouse meets omits to dance and to

84
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,870
and shot its of us about up it's a lot
for bus meeting to a bus

85
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:29,889
arm to do some number of us about one
thought oh you're so

86
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:33,260
thus AM engage about us organizations
sub out:

87
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,950
a 1-of-8 of USA assist you dont and

88
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,810
there are certain amount we sought us
and to make the same direction happen

89
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,909
from these different very different
groups we strive to it

90
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:48,949
up keeper for bus lim et so to a certain
size

91

93
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:04,050
and keeping the lights out for next year
to a process probably

94
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,180
it's always going to happen hype about

95
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,870
that's the reason for this up first of
all I but has a reputation of being a

96

137
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,510
I must admit as a person in my favorite
weakening as the carnival

138
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,710
what's one of my favorite to weeks in
the air

139
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,589
so I'm here to talk I'm in the middle of

141
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,820
we're not solving a security problem so

142
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,760
I hope you don't mind but that's going
to mean a lot of critics

143
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,460
on the industry on the way that we
manage security incontinence

144
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,680
and I hope I will create a lot of
terrorists and I will give you are so

145
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,010
many as a sum counterpoint some cock
counter-arguments

146
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,620
not all of their I what a great way for
myself

147
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,600
what they think it's so important it's
always important to discuss

148
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,760
and it should look into all the way so
really

149
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,490
also have the problem and the approach
the problem

150
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,490
so secure its 810 its a field that is
growing

151
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:45,900
we know that so up more more attacks are
becoming like public

152
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,240
a cold ones are trying to change the way
they behave after the attacks

153
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,330
the counters are changing the way they
react on the way that they actually

154
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:56,420
dog attacks by themselves and out

155
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,430
this whole system is changing so we need
to look into that to say

156
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,730
call we participate and how can we
enforce that change

157
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,350
solved for this stock West I'm going to
miss

158

some reasons for this kind of talk to

159
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,029
happen and is open discussion

160
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:17,160
to happen I will explain later with the
wealth

161
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,320
the difference between work for a minute
I'm our research

162
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,430
I the difference in approach lol

163
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:27,709
I will give you some ideas why people
can't find a 10 minutes

164
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:32,310
what we're not we're fighting for
welcome our I'm going to show you know

165
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,360
their protest completely different for
finding what I mean it's called

166
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,630
professional we are

167
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,190
in a sense of finding 10 minutes and how
a lecturer

168
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:44,110
we are in a sense of fighting against
lower and I will

169
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,370
study discusses some missing points I
will try it reports like

170
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,430
y te compagnia it's not raining I'll
helping you lots

171
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:55,380
I'll why the research community is so
far away from their

172
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,390
from there actual implementations for
won the companies are using

173
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:03,280
why does kinda fights are happening why
is this family

174
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,430
and that's based on economic to resume
format so there s

175
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,760
no economic motivation for names here to
fix the problem

176
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,450
so we need to know something not waiting
for and having our strong don't that's

177
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,520
and now when we ask us a lot of laughs

178
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,209
on the security a mystery as a whole
okay so

179
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:25,900
just arts the objective of this fall
castro question

180
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,940
troops okay a lot of things are now

181
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,870
in the security industry as a %uh
something of a certain

182
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,520
something that a strong have not or
something that's the case

183
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:41,300
so we got like question that's I we also
failed one some current problems that

184
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,079
way all

185
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,570
what grade they are problems and I will
crack some terrorists as I say

186
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:50,640
not all of those tears I will agree with
them myself

187
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,740
whether we have better anyway so we can
actually have an open discussion about

188
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,680
this terrace

189
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,290
sergeant just like this just talk

190
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:03,350
so we all know we all heard about like
the asian-pacific try its

191
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:06,420
or and critics I

192
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,560
we're not going to say if it says that
the best I repairs just saying that

193
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,640
and iraq's playing like a I during a
tall

194
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,850
why I railing can't say and act as an
advance on attack

195
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,950
we're gonna have a few pics tomorrow
I'll

196
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:25,990
torrent today today at 4pm and I'm this
debate are going to have the opportunity

197
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,570
to discuss a little bit more of a bit
AES

198
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,610
went well I will start with a Terry

199
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:35,709
everybody here knows about the man's
hands report them of their

200
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:39,010
attacks coming from China at about an

201
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,870
heard about this report so basically
they wrote a report something that

202
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,220
complete investigation on

203
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,130
some of the attacks and then wrote a
report saying yes the attacks are

204
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,940
finally coming from China

205
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:54,140
think 45 like some events on the par-5
like to make an enzyme called the

206
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,449
attacks are performance

207
00:12:55,449 --> 00:12:59,459
and holding date 5/ like this that's ok
that tax so we're going to explain how

208
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:02,620
the attacks from China work and why they
then find those attacks

209
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:06,350
as coming from China sold the report
link to Mills

210
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:10,870
so the pentagon was supporting their
reports and has the report as

211
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:15,449
really clever they were showing ever
free so I have the first Eric

212
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:19,280
now a counter that wants to attack some
other country

213
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,910
or lyric what the report says the
Chinese are doing

214
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:26,610
and now more and more tax year we have
to protect chechyna

215
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:30,650
rights if I want to know an attack and I
went to Disney is

216
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:34,819
on that I can stuff coming from russet
or charming and one defector ok coming

217
00:13:34,819 --> 00:13:35,980
from some other country

218
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,940
now I have all the stops I have a report
that helps me to know that

219
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,089
and there is a what I'm saying it

220
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:46,699
another cause I want everybody to start
looking like Chinese

221
00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:51,190
what their status after reso is so very
hard and i te security

222
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,959
sold there is no such a thing as a
because this facts

223
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,100
attacker coming from China or not that's
very heart so

224
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,910
actually say that and as long as we
think that does more attacks new look

225
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,850
like that

226
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:06,810
because other counters are selling them
we will elect dole's attacks

227
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:10,190
so this is the kind of reports various
senseless

228
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:14,250
in my opinion okay solve sorry guys from
Mint

229
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:20,579
yeah I conceal like it we hear about a
lot of males of mass allen wrenches

230
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:24,390
rights so we hear that I can big
companies are getting on it

231
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:29,050
all the time so Apple Microsoft well it
was interesting because Microsoft same

232
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:29,300
the

233
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:34,400
at Boulder is our of their got on a pink
never admit to the Microsoft Windows

234
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,920
and got on it went well that's another
points to discuss

235
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,949
so all the colours are getting our hands
and that's becoming more and more call

236
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:42,360
on

237
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,449
and and then minus always playing the
Chinese

238
00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:49,750
are out basically blaming the authors
nobody is actually say hey

239
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,920
I did something wrong right everybody
always say yes

240
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,350
the attacks are very advanced very
advanced and there were no ways for us

241
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,990
to fight this attack so my well when I
was a child

242
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:05,839
say always isn't so tell me when I said
hey man buying this to me that's very

243
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:06,680
cheap

244
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,270
she's always saying well ext ultimate
shape depends on how much money you know

245
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,310
half

246
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:17,650
rights wetzel want to find cheap or
expensive

247
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,550
soweto in generalized his knowledge to
advance so that I love how much

248
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,060
knowledge and you'll have

249
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,900
so when I say like a cold money like our
say it coming in saying

250
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,860
hey his attackers are just only if sales
there ran fast

251
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:36,689
and when I look at that I can I say it's
really a single attack

252
00:15:36,689 --> 00:15:41,250
yeah well I'm not going to make a
statement here

253
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,620
I so reply so yes

254
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,120
well that things aren't going so well
they said no they all have colin is no

255
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,220
ans

256
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,000
bases on two million dollars because the
media is always claiming attacks are

257
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,060
advice on the right

258
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,220
or are they win its first

259
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:01,209
I will request showing how expensive
those attacks are we looking to them

260
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:05,870
or not we're just like claiming the arts
fest because it's very convenient

261
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:09,650
and it's actually convinced to everybody
so if you look at the new house

262
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:13,030
okay like all the data breaches
sophisticated attack

263
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:18,449
sophisticated attack rate oMG I Cesar
cut the rate on the same cyber chance

264
00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:19,220
was like

265
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:24,220
grainy walrus-like /url of cyber attacks
but no I can certainly look into the new

266
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:24,720
house

267
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,810
went into that work how industrious

268
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:32,680
K dollars those same polls Verde of its
K

269
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,540
yellow so it's really tryna

270
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,490
china doll it culture with president of
barefoot cerebral actor

271
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:45,699
over if interest for a risk no other
country from welfare for me there

272
00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:49,110
there so

273
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:52,630
well that's bullshit rights we all know
that

274
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:56,030
rates soft right on sorry

275
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:59,790
I hope I don't mean to work from there
for girls colin is it really hope

276
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:02,270
because I don't think they will hire me
ever

277
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:06,760
so I so just don't like I do anything

278
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,360
I will make it clear that I always work
another fundamental research

279
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,929
saw like a finding bags and exploiting
their lost my job and I have a lot to do

280
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:17,089
that

281
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:20,569
and no I got some point in my career
like a

282
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:24,750
somebody told me that so I am like I
something for other

283
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,280
what I know how to pronounce what
basically means that somebody home and

284
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:28,929
Joyce

285
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:33,260
when the owners are suffering I

286
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,380
saw I they had a quiet I rare

287
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,200
I read it was something that I kind of
enjoy I where right others are suffering

288
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,230
that says of course

289
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:46,190
over security so I decided certainly
will start looking to them our problem

290
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,110
so that's that's there is such a thing
current

291
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:54,770
going for like three years so the first
place welling with like talking to them

292
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,059
our problem

293
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:59,910
I miss I don't show covering day off
okay what is the difference between the

294
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,710
Environmental Research

295
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:05,770
and knowing our research so I kinda
thought is coming off the gaps

296
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:09,590
rights or what they were missing because
I was sure that the one with the

297
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,490
researchers

298
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,929
are very effective refining bucks all
the time

299
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:17,870
when we may have liked hundreds of
thousands of bugs in different kinds of

300
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:18,870
soft or

301
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:22,370
so while our researchers are not finding
this

302
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:27,490
a solution to the problem like we know
life while I first always bypassing the

303
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:28,500
protections

304
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,770
and welcome to the bypass they always
simple

305
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:35,470
various toppings like well I forced
vacation here call with a hint of

306
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,919
catching you anymore

307
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:40,130
so I really don't understand that so

308
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:43,730
well looking to like ultimate ultimatum
10 minutes counting

309
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:49,390
all walks Asok fathers so when generex
test case for how quickly reversed of

310
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,440
glass case to test the software

311
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,390
if we're not going to love me yes it
makes no sense to talk of another minute

312
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,780
hunting

313
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:01,820
well okay door them our problems was
sick always like Gus press can they say

314
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,330
there is a 150

315
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,429
calls on all our samples per day

316
00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:10,309
50 towels and samples per day

317
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:13,940
well look at the books what sort of 0.8

318
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:18,740
10 same ballpark time so call the way of
doing that as of this specific sample

319
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:23,220
call or write a bowl game for the minor
chocolate doesn't start of them at SS

320
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:27,370
no doubt of like a whole we analyze
millions of samples

321
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:30,520
that's kind of weird rights they on the
same time

322
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,940
and what is clearly there is like close
of polls shows up we'll say it was every

323
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,790
day

324
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:38,179
what will they all the way to the oil
cleansing one part of this step

325
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:42,600
or when a menace of a sample so looking
to all the framework set to have like

326
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,470
caucus and walks and separate framework
for analyzing samples

327
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,720
wet interweb 01 allies while at a time

328
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,669
know it's a lot built a mission to
analyze millions he only took up like

329
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:54,730
infrastructure to analyze maintenance

330
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:58,730
so its kind of weird rights

331
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,320
call you expect to generate them know
what's ifill

332
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,290
I'm not analyzing like in of to actually
and they're saying something about the

333
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,760
attack

334
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,780
and that's the problem that I same with
the morning industry

335
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:14,700
like then a cold one is of course they
don't have like a lot of machines

336
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,640
I have like clusters of machines and
analyzing like millions of samples every

337
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,230
day

338
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,860
when they don't wear share that
knowledge

339
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,850
they don't show as the results think
adding and when they put in a cellophane

340
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,559
it's very weird like to say like
researchers for like a big goal one is

341
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,890
big and Nicolas

342
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:35,990
they say well this folder we're not
going to like I could also say it was

343
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,770
only for like 10 percent sales is this
the correct

344
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:42,820
a hundred thousand samples it's less
than one day rights

345
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,919
that does not make sense at all

346
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,280
rights so a while they're hiring

347
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,630
their researchers don't have access to
their platform remake

348
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:57,480
or they don't have a person sharing
information

349
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,860
and call it good then yeah we're
actually keep up is becoming I don't

350
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,720
have access to the samples because

351
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,340
although school was a share sale with
each other when they all share

352
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:11,580
samples with Nick other researchers no
sir samples of the coming year

353
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,970
and it may start showing the same course
we're going to have to share power

354
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:18,700
charger and also feel that

355
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,370
that's why when we look into their
condemning the security failed

356
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:26,419
like a lot of the papers like
unfortunately wall stove the papers make

357
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:27,200
no sense

358
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,720
I'll there and don't apply they don't
think I'll

359
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,960
will apply at some point in time which s
y de Camino excess

360
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,540
so week we have this get when they got
was quitting because the way the

361
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,120
industry is behaving

362
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,820
per se up it's not there I response with
the coming year

363
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,610
and its well especially with us
customers a security researcher

364
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,730
Mike Sando surfing and French a change
that

365
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:56,040
when Mitchell for stuff a nurse and the
only way to force a manner as raising

366
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,020
facts

367
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:00,440
an actual fighting against their so

368
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,760
the first listing point in here yes
macadamia and researchers in general

369
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,150
not only because they want for example
when I started doing the research or

370
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,140
something like talking to them our
product

371
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:15,350
and his father hey I it's a false
hollowing 01 hours are doing fine don't

372
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,410
have lower

373
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:20,090
whites so I saw that asking people to
sign in Marana

374
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:24,030
that was not the case we know there is
some initiatives like a puzzle down

375
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:27,650
may try to share samples well that's
okay well as they're very

376
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:31,169
very very intimate like a hick share is
like up

377
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:34,780
up very nice project so they sell it for
me know saint paul's

378
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,860
for researchers what formula samples

379
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:42,650
it's not three muchas what's amount of

380
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:46,080
so when I love you know that I was like
okay well i

381
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,669
is actually a little got access to those
samples ensure

382
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:53,510
come to share power China liza samples
willing to change that

383
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:57,720
so keep in mind that if you worked
structural play with lower if you really

384
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,080
want to understand lower

385
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,059
in nature have like millions of samples
for me to have the same power

386
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:06,330
trial I snow samples

387
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:10,460
so whatever pressure is a this fame

388
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:14,020
ever in fact that we say at wing attack
that we say

389
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,850
the Acer has a new XK astronaut catcher
rights

390
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:22,360
as I say well this is perennial are just
58 that specifically address

391
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,950
some medicare was playing like a Wall
Street guys that were starts Jornal

392
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:30,360
for manufacturer actresses say that
right some other was like a

393
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:34,030
we're not in your sink all the features
of our products

394
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:37,799
well if there are other test selfish are
yall

395
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:41,970
even let the customer is a poet if they
don't that's

396
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:46,720
or actually saying your responsibility
to protect the customer to customer

397
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,120
it's really not fair it because I got a
false positive

398
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,169
say whether he will say yeah you have
the option to disable that feature

399
00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:57,850
what a customer what gets a lot less
than what they were saying yeah

400
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:02,090
you know it we're not using that stature
that's really not fair game

401
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:05,250
that's where on the way that they're
playing with a customer right

402
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:09,610
okay I know that's because well which
%uh they also have

403
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:12,809
on the article was are doing exactly the
same

404
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:16,030
it will have a way to escape from thats

405
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:19,250
so I like looking up stuff it's Matt's
well flame

406
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:23,840
stocks last they always staying around
for like five years and are being caught

407
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,120
now it's interesting because lol I told
them of like how one's business tax net

408
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,890
loss right

409
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:32,330
they assert a lot just say it was really
really its vast

410
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:35,710
they have like several days they were
explaining I will face a while they are

411
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:38,169
read by some our cyber weapon

412
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:42,500
government-sponsored with okay what's
that's not the hands

413
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,770
that bypasses Amy

414
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:49,940
it was all-weather research to wipe as
they have a

415
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:53,049
they basically espy to the lower a job
SS

416
00:24:53,049 --> 00:24:56,320
okay I'll components and older

417
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,650
so where will they try so won't some
pics some part of them our

418
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:04,350
like new the overall system will say
look at their well-being well thats does

419
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,370
not exist

420
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:09,860
when the KO component will load it
anyway so basically what made it was

421
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,390
like this

422
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:13,490
whether the lower in charge different
sections

423
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:16,679
and then hits we're not say what your
cat

424
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:20,539
lol tell you they are not going to be
able to get expresso

425
00:25:20,539 --> 00:25:24,919
because most of the vase if not all of
them what actress all of them but I look

426
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:26,169
at that

427
00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:29,510
they have like fair process wanna Tory

428
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:32,870
social adjustment process that's
together we'll go something like this:

429
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:33,460
just

430
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:38,129
they have no way to relapse they just
don't

431
00:25:38,129 --> 00:25:42,950
so I material there is a all signatures

432
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:47,009
rights everywhere they say they have
like a behavior-based detection

433
00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:50,559
Mitchell high school the behavior that
the defect does my initials

434
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,299
they're not really evolving naturally
they're not great running that this

435
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:56,389
behavior is one this is on this
environment

436
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:59,460
so to me they were detection and they
say aren't they are like

437
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,799
call signatures that are not purely
jacks what if

438
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,070
I think I still signatures and they want
this this and this and this

439
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:11,509
it's a lower if it doesn't it's not the
lower but still it's just a signature

440
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:16,009
all the first is always on sale at Rs
and at the same applies for IPS

441
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:20,429
I yes a hit farrell's whatever we always
make sure no

442
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:24,080
hold up that looks likes in order to
protect the attack

443
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,129
rights we'll just the film technology
nowadays that actually looking to our

444
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:30,129
network and try to read a

445
00:26:30,129 --> 00:26:33,909
find something that s different and we
know that those

446
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:37,539
those technologies are not me why they
spread the right now

447
00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:42,120
so almost over defense are all over to
France are based on sale at source

448
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,590
hokkaido all their security guys are
saying we're going to really understand

449
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:48,049
call to attack

450
00:26:48,049 --> 00:26:52,600
if another soho to attack her 11-year
traction looking for the signatures

451
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,389
and no way for the signatures are in of
or know if there really is no more

452
00:26:56,389 --> 00:27:00,620
or no if we're catching my curators say
attacks are not

453
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,830
because we're not looking to the way
that tax return work like

454
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:07,870
yes to this occurred guys they sell I
don't mention also a box of tricks with

455
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:08,490
Asher

456
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:12,320
I'll let you know how to write lower if
they'll say hey I we're not talking

457
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,990
about my culture right lower

458
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:17,470
there was a while we're crazy a picture
able to write an hour

459
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:21,480
well that's so important knowledge
understand that the bad guys will let

460
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,519
anyway it makes no difference if I am
going to pitch or not they will learn

461
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:25,870
its

462
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:29,409
anyway well the good guys mitchell also
have the knowledge

463
00:27:29,409 --> 00:27:36,169
otherwise they were just make a
socialist I completely wrong

464
00:27:36,169 --> 00:27:40,169
/url so doesn't also took effect
everything

465
00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:43,850
excellent slots okay so Fred Kollar I'll

466
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:49,149
87 already has a like a dire I have no
argument some ways to help prevent that

467
00:27:49,149 --> 00:27:52,700
okay for lower and knowing if a process
is money shots

468
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,649
is don't know if this is the same
problem as the door in for example

469
00:27:55,649 --> 00:27:58,269
performed in the summit of the halting
problem

470
00:27:58,269 --> 00:28:01,750
so think about that if you have a
problem that we're saying is important

471
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,620
other province a fence my Michels are
not

472
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:09,080
militias brother in Kenya's desperado
air if this low since my Michels the

473
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,590
financial spyware just accept

474
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:17,480
rights as well if this privacy is their
mitchell school there's not one ish us

475
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,450
maybe it will go to my Michels thing
rights so is the same problem

476
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,820
of a summit of the halting problem this
a solvable

477
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:28,769
there was no way just solve this
question with a computer

478
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:31,820
so no way no way a cold weather will
know for sure

479
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:35,399
if something is my michelle's Arnott's

480
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:38,659
what we can tell somethings we can
arrange your face

481
00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:41,669
we go farce that Tekonsha some
situations

482
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:45,490
will also cell characteristics on issues

483
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:49,350
want to go only for signatures we're
going to war for hey

484
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:54,139
when old is lower is one ish us we can
start affecting the comics numerous

485
00:28:54,139 --> 00:28:57,990
we can start thinking like specific
points and empower women should do

486
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:01,370
and we can try to force them our to a
simpler

487
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:05,710
nowadays it's very weird because we're
looking for the industry

488
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,879
and like up everyone is saying hey the
mall is are packets

489
00:29:09,879 --> 00:29:13,580
Mrs office can't dance why isn't it is
the same way

490
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,860
and lowers ears XD burning it's crazy

491
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,159
well if the lower rate and don't want to
be the fact that

492
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,860
and also pose a very simple and also
also have enough and also wasn't just me

493
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,720
money shows

494
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,120
well initials fame but not try to avoid
them at SS

495
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,159
because of lighting and ISS government
Miller

496
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,870
of the comics judo lol million of the
connects

497
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:39,580
so when president burger truck so you'll
find that that is the same way

498
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:43,799
it's a little out of the comics if they
have a nice very effective

499
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:47,120
we went to in effect in this that
connects for a long time now

500
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,269
so we're always going to have like ours
like Stuxnet

501
00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:54,039
that no I don't really try to hide
themselves they just don't want me to

502
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:55,649
know

503
00:29:55,649 --> 00:29:59,049
and now it's a problem that way don't
have a way to fix

504
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:03,399
so we can say that all told the industry
naming this is like 15 years old

505
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:08,220
they still don't like the basic stuff
they were supposed to

506
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,740
so I can do that why K hasn't won

507
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:16,159
Yana is not willing right yaaa he's not
catching everything are also other

508
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:16,659
things

509
00:30:16,659 --> 00:30:19,830
or things like a rare having a good
fight

510
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:23,059
bike that was also the cats and rats
game right

511
00:30:23,059 --> 00:30:27,179
with cats and rats game is so it was
like okay the guys there is a lower now

512
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:31,019
and Joe effecting at another five years

513
00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:34,090
rights went just like a souffle aspect
mats

514
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:38,309
so welcome to thats everywhere if they
win tickets ever faith

515
00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:41,059
they go out of the business writer
because they don't have a way to sell

516
00:30:41,059 --> 00:30:41,889
anymore

517
00:30:41,889 --> 00:30:46,059
so it cannot wait a baltimore is because
there was no way

518
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:50,440
because they are all the business so the
only thing I can do is actually survive

519
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,850
and for survival

520
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,960
and survival of what they want is
basically a cell the same things

521
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,629
i cant in again and the customers don't
really have a lot of off so they kind of

522
00:31:00,629 --> 00:31:02,269
quick question that's

523
00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:06,690
and I'll explain it later why I think
this was accomplished so that's

524
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:11,120
and I i where he is like someone else
for economic Santa Ana paper card market

525
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,330
for lemons

526
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:16,139
but just a Wrestlemania there's a
statement okay

527
00:31:16,139 --> 00:31:20,730
is not lying so friends call him with
this statement arrive in 2009

528
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:24,620
so the guy who s Sharapova thats air can
solve the problem

529
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:28,879
so yesterday we had this discussion

530
00:31:28,879 --> 00:31:32,679

rights and you've got like thousands of
softwares for iPhone

599
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,040
you have lots of opportunists and lots
of oral soft result there

600
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,280
well they're very difficult to exploit
they're very difficult to be reliable

601
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,180
exploits

602
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,390
they have like a lot of layers of
protection they have wish I was worth

603
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,130
getting

604

you do don't mention all the hills are

607
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,510
fast

608
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:11,470
playing a game with let you know if they
think you're sending a mail

609
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:14,890
is a good thing chrome officials link
you know it you know how to look into

610
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:15,500
their

611
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:19,500
into their protection of the browser
just do whatever he wants to do

612
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,030
and is good with that so that shows

613
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:26,230
it's possible to do that and still be in
business

614
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:30,010
why others are not doing it

615
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:33,760
many calls they will kill a whole
industry which is like the security

616
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,630
industry

617
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:39,410
that's if cultural rights

618
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:43,640
well no I if they'll avoid the mistakes
of his eye is still have the other way

619
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,520
for tomorrow correctional spratt

620
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,510
it were a bit exploitation and that's
becoming more and more common

621
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:52,540
okay sale thanks like in Java job I'll

622
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:56,880
you guys all know Java rights just
another 10 minutes announcements

623
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,100
so everybody knows Java rates sakar

624
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,480
so i i think everybody pairs so that the
sava

625
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,560
is increasing welfare rights it's just
because of Java

626
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,230
if it were not know it's all over with I
think it was going to be okay

627
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:15,470
so but I S was saying there is no thanks
there are what I mean is that they don't

628
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,869
have patches for

629
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:20,720
and I like the ex-wife can send them our
altars are starting to explore the more

630
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,350
and more of those 10 minutes

631
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:27,130
so that's why you say what many more
hours is spreading faster and faster

632
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:31,480
and in the past usually they explain
that we say ex-wife case where various a

633
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,430
balding LFS protection

634
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:37,050
what now they are evolving they are
learning well

635
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:40,460
I have nothing else that's just going to
get worse with time

636
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:44,210
fights when they retire for now to learn

637
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:48,210
in the beginning when they start going
like exploitation they had no knowledge

638
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:53,540
well now like five years later when they
started raising a for 61 skates

639
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:58,369
well they have time to learn why I think
this is not really keeping up

640
00:37:58,369 --> 00:38:02,630
experiments contraceptive that they're
like we still have like a slow process

641
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,630
for fixing

642
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:08,110
we still have like colin is not caring
about like security reports

643
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:12,950
we still have those problems were
supposed to fix it in for a long time

644
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:16,510
but we didn't so they still making money
right

645
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:20,990
if they are making money with flower and
actually using exploits just told them

646
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,880
our and make money

647
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,270
well they work at learning if it will
help already if so if that fixes this

648
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,170
problem

649
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:32,110
i while ago they want to say hey there
is no one here anymore

650
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:35,140
okay a little something else

651
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:39,810
what when events so as long as we thank
to fix the problem

652
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:44,700
I was more just got it will get your fix
it and that that's a bad males

653
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:48,140
so it was just like a mix white-out
sausage and brought us well

654
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:52,060
after percent error Chris let me finish
income in like we're watching

655
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:55,780
so it doesn't have the toilet share
which is basically computing couple

656
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,420
minutes of your software

657
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,610
where progress flights are something
else something there is a nice thanks

658
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,330
Dennis

659
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:05,250
when it works it's not the registrant of
the Salters not intentional state of

660
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,130
this offer

661
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:09,260
it's on real estate of the softer that's
a weird washing

662
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:12,440
so one attacker will actually when the
point where a shame to get whatever

663
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,770
access for once

664
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:17,300
air job bypass all things gay shown to
get going as a cash

665
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,840
onto whatever family group Terry

666
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:25,520
this going to have some princess so he
has access to sell things assign a shame

667
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,100
as he wrote them together together to
referring to what she wants

668
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:33,700
so exploitation is becoming harms

669
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:37,300
it's not as a use it to me that's all

670
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:41,100
like we have all the operator says it is
a vote against exploitation

671
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:45,380
against exploitation so into it and
we'll say it's much more difficult to

672
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,230
exploit

673
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:51,020
then windows xp well that's all that
does not solve the problem right

674
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:55,300
after nails are of their there is a 10
minutes after they were residents want

675
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,030
enough time hours ist halt

676
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:01,500
still assail problems remain well have
ways to check in time to process than

677
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,230
where they'll have resigned to waste of
light installation of this

678
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:08,810
making his enormous savings will have a
waste should know if someone is stealing

679
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:10,930
our information on what's

680
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:14,020
protocols are still up open a safe so

681
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:17,369
of well it was between a proactive and a
technic

682
00:40:17,369 --> 00:40:20,590
in the past I've had like baseball
technics all let's think about

683
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:24,640
one specific one like that they do it it
is not a collector's played like shit

684
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,990
overflows also my wrists

685
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:30,480
so hey we're going to have a similar
foreign soil iris

686
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,030
if you're well as the chunk of the
mammary in this process go away

687
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:37,280
and it's so eloquent than the way ever
getting to a point

688
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,320
entertainment for show a religious
sectors such a better way to write for

689
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,440
myself

690
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,450
beta that so-called row it a location
that there weren't

691
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:50,140
so if you have a white for so it was a
picnic

692
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:54,290
if you know that lol interesting tales
of what is going on just nature

693
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:57,700
got the Chongqing that's for months and
you will have my career alright for

694
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,740
primitive

695
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:03,550
and all rights for is a primitive if you
have it the game is over

696
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:07,430
well as well it's a mess there were a
man to specific

697
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:12,250
like how I roll call gotta write for
primitive in a specific software

698
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:15,690
well if you don't really have a picnic
should know that that's going to be very

699
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:18,609
specific to the 10 minutes after playing
with

700
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:23,760
so growing together play itself does not
turn in structural exploits of for

701
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,880
what's if force well it seems to be very
hard to achieve

702
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,180
or very unreliable their you have more
chances to win

703
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:35,859
I one example is address space layout
randomization what is a via

704
00:41:35,859 --> 00:41:39,090
and is there a changing the layout of
the member of the problem

705
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:42,930
and we'll make it much more difficult
for the attacker to explain the broader

706
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:46,230
finance now in there to have something
that is not localized

707
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:50,190
or have some lack of information of
something that is run the lies about

708
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:54,390
Nick information back to them so they
can actually know the avaricious

709
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:57,840
other no thats they're just not forcing

710
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:02,510
and the brute force it does not work
well for client-side exports

711
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:07,450
mice so well thats why we're not using
its

712
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:12,859
like why we're still using Windows XP
Service Pack 2

713
00:42:12,859 --> 00:42:17,290
it's like I don't understand I read
notes well maybe you have a compliance

714
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:19,380
requirements some specifics of for

715
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:22,410
okay I really don't think you have the
specifics of turning your whole

716
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,970
organization

717
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:28,090
so if you're using Windows XP Service
Pack 3 wire

718
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:31,150
why or not isn't a big

719
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:35,090
and now if you're using that why don't
you just go like to win all seven with

720
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:37,440
address space layout randomization I
will say it's

721
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,300
also have Mac to the latest specials
which will have a better in those Asian

722
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,130
already looks

723
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:46,740
with backs which is open source packed

724
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:50,790
so well hey ho let's take a mix Hall
always investments we're making the

725
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:51,790
finals

726
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:55,480
no matter how good the researchers are
improving the first

727
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:00,660
the colours on yours then that's not
going to change anything

728
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:03,880
rights so

729
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,850
wedding collection schedules I always
same people say yeah with domain names

730
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:10,910
water stuff for the first for sure

731
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:13,980
when we return private affairs what's
right now

732
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:17,310
the most important point is we want
people to start using what we already

733
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:19,980
have

734
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:23,080
where we say like a security lane or a
big second trailer

735
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:28,720
using Windows XP Service Pack sure all
day pay at all

736
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,710
that's a shame and it's a shame why oh
why displaying their

737
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:38,290
what can lay out of the incidents and
I'll talk a specific of our essay here

738
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:41,740
why did you let me out of that thing
going to customers say hey

739
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:46,160
now in no way be changed well this again
said no we know everything about the

740
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,150
subject

741
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:52,970
how that's possible by the way fors a
sponsor Stoppers like Sarah

742
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:57,070
don't tell their name that's a good one
right I

743
00:43:57,070 --> 00:44:00,830
Kirk I yeah

744
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:05,400
so this kind of questions are the ones
that their bonus to start asking

745
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,580
okay how cum laude week Monday also
something that they were supposed to

746
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,260
mean very ashamed of

747
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:16,700
that's a good question and anus so I
decided to look into the world

748
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:21,240
so yesterday ice I said no I was like
okay let's look into the data coming

749
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:21,940
from different

750
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:26,800
rare earths so I'm sure it's very nice
like a all the maps okay so if you meant

751
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,130
to write a report

752
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:32,010
it's always good to have the links so I
like different way or so in different

753
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:32,710
maps

754
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:36,390
of how the world has right now that was
it was a yes

755
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:41,380
know where to find a match so I don't
because I know it all as I think

756
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:44,640
there but this is not going to clear
something don't wanna say home in

757
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,140
assesses the morning three

758
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,260
i think thats for combat still resist
well for example

759
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:53,450
I'll cusp rests a zero percent of our
attacks

760
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:57,420
and entire money well I work is
basically Germany went to it there okay

761
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,400
like I colitis seem like a

762
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:04,240
6.2 percent and grace where it says %uh
lott's alright just like six percent

763
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,400
more than there are no I don't know what
is going on with the 110 6.2 percent

764
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,520
more than zero

765
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,680
as another sign me a lot I south of

766
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:17,510
I care and other less like shuttle
service same time one is a victim

767
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:20,690
solving you guys are being attacked when
the world

768
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:25,870
wow it's interesting because Brazil what
is like i neva hit counter has not a fan

769
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:28,960
of they don't have customers there
because they don't make promises

770
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,400
that information rights West was there
is famous for being like a source of a

771
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,010
lot of attacks

772
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:38,050
I don't know so of lol

773
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:42,390
Air Canada Centre I wanted I don't know
i think is the third world war

774
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:46,440
rights for so you're around the site
answer is the new york's

775
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:51,290
I can say germany morsel bro if that
means there was a lot of attacks happen

776
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:53,840
in Germany and different than the zero
are different enough

777
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,300
6 percent and have won

778
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:00,750
so race known a customer that having the
card right now

779
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:04,970
her for the point here is not that the
information is not nice its recall the

780
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,880
publisher this kind of maps

781
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,470
wet so what is the scientific data
behind it

782
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:13,800
rights holiday less savings how the
collecting its

783
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,870
what is the database and on where the
faculty details of that

784
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:20,940
with salt technical details this is just
marketing

785
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:26,060
hollow when or if it's not though Ajax
interface generating random numbers

786
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:30,500
rights why I don't know i selling it
live it

787
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:35,430
okay so if they're open till all the
world's

788
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:40,200
like it's a blessing because like if you
know if that's your thing I don't like

789
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:44,090
how long it takes until the first attack
happens and then all the machines are

790
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:45,710
being attacked

791
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:49,080
its order for war crimes it's well 10
minutes

792
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:53,170
so in 10 minutes if so how I can why
would they want a bill that swings like

793
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:54,760
after the first attack

794
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:57,820
leos all the questions I want to record
a must

795
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:01,580
so fail of according to specs lacked
states rather warm

796
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:05,940
a couple minutes rights and it was
special like a specific okay shut up our

797
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:07,090
end the way I don't know

798
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:11,110
but apparently well thats planning a war
on the right thing in fact a lot of

799
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:14,370
other questions and it was really aware
that was fixed

800
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:17,760
already okay the world even though it
was fixed already

801
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,480
but still worth spreading like crazy
infected cultures like US Brazil

802
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,810
rights what brazil has to do with works
right for you don't go towards

803
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:29,940
with its so we got a factor so

804
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:34,310
it wasn't just say that's because like a
up the researchers are saying

805
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:39,410
it's going to think in the last time we
have character in the very near future

806
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:43,250
if so call center like twice I've
exploits we can say that

807
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:46,760
rights shallow well jet that's all I
wanna be with it was out there all day

808
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,630
it was spot on the wilds

809
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:53,770
like after awake you know I have like
all ex-wife skates with this whole day

810
00:47:53,770 --> 00:48:00,770
and what how long it took a our
quarterbacks Java

811
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:04,830
well so X 30 X

812
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:08,170
well so it's always change rights

813
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:11,910
they don't really call for a min already
have like a high standards

814
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:15,820
sewing thread a pass well the problem is
it's always thanks for finding the ex

815
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:18,370
wife gets to develop their exploits

816
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:22,440
and that's because they exploit was 13
when they don't know why I don't

817
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:26,260
if they will have access to the x-pipe
itself that was going to be much faster

818
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:27,570
for an

819
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:31,350
to have it and so well not this white
where is the exploits

820
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:36,170
Next Day Air saver exploits on the
exploit kits

821
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:39,550
salt thats not win again right

822
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:43,290
that's why I like Apple decided to
remove Java from

823
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:48,330
from the max rights yeah

824
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:53,160
skirts so with it will also have a
zero-day

825
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,830
well just a little from here it's a she
say so

826
00:48:56,830 --> 00:49:00,300
it's okay to hold your air stay with
your silly like

827
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:05,710
trailer for this day is an average and
the worst days of my life and Ace

828
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:10,330
with that 0k think a lot of and once you
commit a crime

829
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:14,520
hello there all day wanna stay with it
for I air

830
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:18,150
it was KS freelance este people

831
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:22,620
that's because Oracle the site and I
think take some time to fix even after a

832
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:23,960
spot it

833
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:27,680
so the letter for researcher Paris and
games this year away

834
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,980
charcoal or to any other call for they
still want to thank some time to fix

835
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:35,630
and I don't understand don't vote don't
think that I'm blaming their

836
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:39,880
okay I less than a week surpassed they
have metal platforms they have like

837
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,150
it's just before then I'm doing this
then but still

838
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:46,920
if there is no the only wild already
know something

839
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,430
and well it's just I don't blame them
for not doing it

840
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:53,610
or NHL ethnic customers

841
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:57,320
are not actually there was doing a plane
that's not going to change

842
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:00,600
anything FAA as a researcher cultural
paulk

843
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:04,590
and I say shaped about that that's not
going to make a difference they have a

844
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:07,660
much more for marketing saying over
there

845
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:11,710
thinking when it let me know they can
actually when it went ok so bad thinking

846
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:12,820
the same thing

847
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:16,230
what if all accounts or start blaming
their

848
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:20,490
they were having a lot so they were
going to change something

849
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:26,140
%uh so don't have lyrics Soko sorry we
have those lips rights

850
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:30,060
well the ones I like more as the expert
me if

851
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:33,100
it's interesting because all the sales
guys

852
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:37,000
from there secure its main course all
the sales guys for secretary nurse

853
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,210
their college experts feather thing
right

854
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:46,250
their sales guy parents let their water
sales not their security how come

855
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:49,730
but still they're called expert so
they're the security experts on the

856
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:50,910
minor

857
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:54,310
well-liked 12 like the market for a loss

858
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:57,550
I think you guys really want to say that
customers are complicit

859
00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:02,710
with that situation well a senator
Ludwig laying the customers

860
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:07,040
okay that charger curl of wrote a paper
cut on the market for a once

861
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:10,460
okay when I'm off okay some other comics

862
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:14,830
and now actually its okay like six wells
for the paper to be approved in any

863
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:17,230
conference because the paper was so
simple

864
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:21,840
that a lot actually have adhered to the
paper I gotta bring them up but less so

865
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,380
if you want other nobel

866
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:27,580
in economics because of that paper
basically a paper crane looks into the

867
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:28,790
car markets

868
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:32,160
okay car sales marketeers if car sales
market

869
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,700
okay toys R Us okay wire yes car

870
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:39,700
roses the value rights your car just
what it

871
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:43,340
Bradley or just take it out from there
for the cold weather just bought it

872
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:47,480
let us I don't feel like it's I don't
know the caller is not fit anymore

873
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:51,440
or you're divorced so now you need a
fancy car to get like my stars

874
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,990
or whatever I skirts

875
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:59,990
though I rights lol site so lol I'm a
car anymore with so if you try to sell

876
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:00,750
its

877
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:05,140
carlos has its price like percent 15
percent rights

878
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:09,020
there is a is because the guy who is
buying your car

879
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:12,390
don't have as much knowledge as you
don't on the reasons for her to sell the

880
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:13,540
car

881
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:17,230
so that I don't know if you're wrestling
because they're just want offense so

882
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:17,960
well

883
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:22,370
and just changing their minds or society
because there was a spot on a problem

884
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:26,220
maybe the water has a problem every car
has a specific problem maybe

885
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:29,460
you know there will be in there were
coming in the next week

886
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:32,590
so that's why on the site to sell so
there is a separate

887
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:37,200
in allâh between course at me and who
is buying

888
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,600
this asymmetry knowledge also exist in
the security industry

889
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,760
ok if they were real estate office
products

890
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,050
he knows everything about this product
and if there's anything I lofts

891
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:52,100
about the markets and they are playing
with there are several of the attackers

892
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:56,010
well think that they're like cosplay
escaped Ryan SIMATIC they went they will

893
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:57,640
you have a really good guys

894
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:01,890
or a immigrant back to bass Laura miss
are working there

895
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:05,630
I can really are this well the iris

896
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:08,780
rather stay they also said the
competition

897
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:12,440
so they want no way no way it should be
as best as they can

898
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,650
just want to be better than the other

899
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:19,450
and they have this cell technology so
they can is to convince people here or

900
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:21,370
by

901
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:25,080
its efforts are made to the cemetery
rights because they'll watch all the

902
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,120
cold process

903
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,500
and the vendors are the ones doing this
pitch

904
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:34,380
rights so they won't go away so hey
we've got this brazzaville technology

905
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:38,600
now it's all day run on likes Magnifico
so the public and say hey we all have

906
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,410
signatures anymore

907
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:44,290
its okay her where magic

908
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:49,510
lol a softer and when your magic to me
know what is my missiles and what is not

909
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:53,390
that's crazy rights well that's the way
it works

910
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:57,130
I thought so if there is a serious
threat and it's really not

911
00:53:57,130 --> 00:54:00,920
a visit to fix that in the same paper
George Akerlof

912
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:04,150
group thats even if you have good
intentions

913
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:08,120
event if you don't have good intentions
it went there once a spell

914
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:12,720
to tell the troof hey there and all
surviving the market's

915
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,070
because that's the way the market for
lemons happens

916
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:19,530
it was thats X 457 the paper

917
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:22,700
okay well thats economical it for over

918
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:26,140
that NFL player wants to play well in
the markets

919
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:29,170
crew probably mid stride by the other
players

920
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:33,850
recalls financial crisis change the
market Anoka the amount of money that

921
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:38,950
all this occurred trainers have also
there is something bigger Kompany's

922
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:42,980
their billing themselves but they're
inside even bigger components

923
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:47,590
so it's a very harsh a player turns the
market's alway

924
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:50,590
s F up like a source

925
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:54,460
actually remove this symmetry so with
all the code area:

926
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:59,040
what felt like an acacia although we
have a way to fix the problem

927
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,830
okay so s it's just a possible

928
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:06,350
there were no way that we got a goal in
congress Symantec are

929
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:09,440
any other vendor and I said that I have
nothing against them

930
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:13,120
at that's the way that's manage to
survive right and the colours are

931
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,400
important for

932
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,430
for your health right away women women's
employers

933
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:23,060
so father like a lil really blaming
their it says the way this

934
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:26,950
and its color that's the way it is
that's how economics work

935
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:30,580
so if we brought with us so far the
company now if we don't want to support

936
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:33,940
the education is a real don't wanna
share knowledge

937
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:38,210
nothing will change because of this
symmetry Fars

938
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:41,570
they can to watch by themselves

939
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:45,680
it's important that we we know it's
they're really can so much

940
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:49,310
even if they weren't so there's a lot of
problems

941
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:54,550
air and computing and computer security
which is like the ass factor

942
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:58,760
lol I felt so I love the aspect when I
was 9 hand

943
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:03,340
I remember like my very first thing I am
rights Anna they have like like this

944
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:07,300
this I this guy who was it the same
question jim you're a really high

945
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:10,800
position a career-high technical
position and I'm here

946
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,550
and I got him to give up a presentation
to the mail ate my ass

947
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:19,140
s starting on the engineering rights so
the answer I was expecting him

948
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:23,910
to talk about how good it is to work for
IBM and the whole good is there

949
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:28,560
%uh why career right so you can be if
the Commission and being really high and

950
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:31,270
I never was a really great summer and
all that

951
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:35,980
whether in fact there was important
lessons that he gave was the ass factor

952
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:40,440
aspect the works so I says I gotta say a
question about credit

953
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:45,170
why somebody buys from line here

954
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:49,730
salt well 100 employees arrive saw what
they say

955
00:56:49,730 --> 00:56:54,320
wow it's a grave call for me lower lol I
don't think in our lives

956
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:59,230
wow it's F dominates all their
production factors of the technology

957
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:00,130
whatever

958
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:04,580
rights don't lie the group answers and
I'm not just saying no

959
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:09,250
it's more expensive it is all Kompany
it's a boy or a classic

960
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:13,580
not recited the best guys will be there
was more a lecturer serve you

961
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:19,220
but so there is the ass factor well they
fired for buying I'm here

962
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:22,650
rights recycle all happened so how
badass

963
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:26,160
and it's not your arse I

964
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:30,730
the so that last factor sorry but that's
not right of

965
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:33,740
I her of various

966
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:37,950
there is also the current that in
economics so gary becker

967
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:41,060
she wrote a paper like a collar crime
and punishment

968
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:44,400
right place que was like the first guy

969
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,680
to have like a the college to come out
and say hey

970
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:52,140
there as well assessing trying to fix
all the crimes

971
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:55,110
because like everybody wants to be a
good guy right everybody wants to have

972
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:57,230
like 100 percent

973
00:57:57,230 --> 00:58:01,000
no crimes right lol you don't want
people getting killed on this threats

974
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,910
reno its people getting like a Rob s
assaulted or whatever

975
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:09,750
rights it wants to have no crimes life
well first I'll let me call us to look

976
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:12,030
into that and second what that was
visible

977
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:16,790
okay well the first one to say there is
no hope for some security

978
00:58:16,790 --> 00:58:20,050
we don't let them know where that came
from

979
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:23,640
life there is no hope percent security
so that goes from this guy

980
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:28,380
gary becker and what was that if they're
watching another person security

981
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:32,620
rick ross also hi exchanges the whole
industry

982
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:37,180
express all other so many other problems
that the crime starts rising again

983
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:41,840
as a sailor security if we actually
affects let's imagine now

984
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:47,490
now there is no soccer drugs anymore
nor'easter exploits wax no lowers

985
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:50,740
what we are going to dinner

986
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:56,110
retire well I don't have enough money to
retire email nearly a job there

987
00:58:56,110 --> 00:59:00,200
cold weather yeah so the various

988
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:04,510
will likely have a problem rights and
the ball is now and I have like a very

989
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:06,970
smart to secure its people

990
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:11,260
that there was a lot of the court was
they work for some as well as security

991
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:12,270
researchers

992
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:16,290
so crazy was it is a current researchers
as somebody they don't have money

993
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:18,660
anymore what they will go

994
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:22,140
they're finding your way s rights

995
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:26,440
I lol that's why there is one hundred
percent security

996
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:30,450
so what training we can resolve the
problem with parents that's a tough

997
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:34,120
the following day when the way it is now
a days is ridiculous

998
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:38,780
rights god-like then they were this
Sunday May work there's all this hacking

999
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:40,170
stuff

1000
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:43,580
that was a also be like that supposed to
mean that's is a

1001
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:48,110
write me rather suffer for a long time I
don't just say that scope are agree it's

1002
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:49,360
been shut down all

1003
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:52,890
because like sound kids decided it right

1004
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:56,780
if information with a lot of Wes arse
and they have a couple minutes ago when

1005
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:58,670
they also will be punished the rights

1006
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:02,520
for doing it and we'll also have like
their the way back they have like

1007
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:06,410
face shows the ball is now a vast estate
of security this

1008
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:10,720
anybody can go whatever that's what we
can offer sapped

1009
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:14,220
because they respect all there that have
nothing to loose

1010
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:17,310
anyway can do whatever presso

1011
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:24,050
all bad things will happen right so we
know one that's their job security

1012
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:27,050
air for your love the aspect of him

1013
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:31,000
well we buy from a specific event or
just because everybody is by

1014
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,430
thats really not good when Chara to make
assessors I do understand this factor I

1015
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:37,590
don't listen to what he wants to get far
it's

1016
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:41,260
what we have like a smarter smarter ways
to make an essential thing

1017
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:45,310
a cold mornings lol yes

1018
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:48,870
my mother left is like the cold
confessional power Gulf

1019
01:00:48,870 --> 01:00:52,820
so I'm not only is the security enjoy
ice then we're still all

1020
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:56,770
writes the computers are getting faster
we have mark up a bit short

1021
01:00:56,770 --> 01:01:01,170
do like inspection so like the gateway
will survive and we're gonna go

1022
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:05,600
sample packet inspection ever wear a it
was still trying to claim that

1023
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:10,340
well let's not throw okay security and
does not enjoy the worst law

1024
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:13,780
and there is always a simple as water
confessional power

1025
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:17,970
do we have as well dollar we have I was
your

1026
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:21,740
cold lacks the protocol stack recalls
the oil and coal pressure

1027
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:26,060
or whether encryption to the protocol
layers of course there will be no that's

1028
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:30,660
because the battery its is not really
growing us passes the computer power

1029
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:34,760
soco so security which always when the
heinz

1030
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:39,680
we always going to be like the weakest
link is a little respect everything

1031
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:43,590
whiskers second semester man that any

1032
01:01:43,590 --> 01:01:47,830
slots there's no way we're gonna fix the
problem so that's an important lessons

1033
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:49,100
for academics

1034
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:53,050
because I can tell it just felt right to
say no went bowling performance like a

1035
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:54,290
higher computers

1036
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:57,960
so the new generation of cold others you
may watch ok ok if thats

1037
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:02,240
knowing your sorry that's not going to
happen

1038
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:06,290
and yellowish of computers will have
like what is writing a little crazy are

1039
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:07,090
softer

1040
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:10,250
little crazier like encryption or it was
a crazy

1041
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:13,920
compression algorithms in the coming
years all the computer power

1042
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:18,290
there with nothing left for inspection
secure does not drain battery

1043
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:23,460
it's a good looking battering a softer
we're not going to be able to security

1044
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:28,740
don't count on your cell place really
don't

1045
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:31,850
it's all okay we know how many ways to
wear

1046
01:02:31,850 --> 01:02:36,050
thats RAID driver we're gonna service so

1047
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:39,190
I not sure if it's like a %uh sic
transit

1048
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:42,220
is like for nosers I don't like to lose
RK

1049
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:45,260
so i right away what I like to wear as
well Latos

1050
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:49,560
I don't expect to win a war with respect
to fight until the last man on earth

1051
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:52,680
rights I yes so

1052
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:57,780
sprout also have the same rights a if
somebody has a girl emailed ons

1053
01:02:57,780 --> 01:03:02,200
rights qualify for the guy well because
I got no don't try to the weather how

1054
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,450
strong you are how fast you are

1055
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:09,720
well we can always wear and moving right
interim order for him to certain you

1056
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:13,120
spoke that's what they're like this
occurs when you try to their

1057
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:16,660
was a little intense that we have over
or

1058
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:20,720
opponents is the fact that we know are
in parlance

1059
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:25,760
we all its so lol are 00 violence batter

1060
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:30,070
that's the first mistake we are making
if you guys think you don't wanna know

1061
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:32,100
we are in parlance

1062
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:35,740
and making a big mistake so that's the
first thing we need to change

1063
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:40,430
therefore else fail okay I will buy a
product or whatever

1064
01:03:40,430 --> 01:03:43,890
fail okay how it's playing all
everything I have

1065
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:48,110
everything that I L if adults

1066
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:52,700
you will have your only advantage that's
always meant that so half

1067
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:57,890
and doesn't let his way with a strong
when you look into some specifics estas

1068
01:03:57,890 --> 01:04:02,480
go to the bank a chance a bank a few is
not supposed to change

1069
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:06,060
it's a specific device if you know it
different

1070
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:11,100
know it's you can make it so safe that
nobody will be able to change than tear

1071
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:14,170
the same for SCADA networks for sale

1072
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:18,200
other devices was also close to change
its not a general-purpose

1073
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:21,250
if I since defining user and machine

1074
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:25,100
feel so ashamed us while you're having
quite the US and UK

1075
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:29,660
have like to acknowledge that we respect
that will really try to understand

1076
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:33,560
while a shame that will try to win this
thing called the machine fix that

1077
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:37,840
and you can check that so if deliverance
like it they always mess that they will

1078
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:38,550
have

1079
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:44,330
you will have anyways to win okay their
results

1080
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:48,300
well with your appliance ice rights up
computer

1081
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:52,450
and computer security is supposed to
make like a a science

1082
01:04:52,450 --> 01:04:56,650
its suppose to mean something that their
pearls something that surpassed

1083
01:04:56,650 --> 01:04:58,070
something that there are no

1084
01:04:58,070 --> 01:05:01,650
not so that they'll think are willing if
rights

1085
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:05,610
that's a little to change in this
industry up

1086
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:09,810
so I'm going to join samples of like
I'll also pay it was all I was holding a

1087
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:11,810
paper that's why it shows the examples

1088
01:05:11,810 --> 01:05:15,590
but never like not force over the
precipice like science on it

1089
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:21,190
so it was 10 I was on black which was
basically like trying to attract

1090
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:24,930
they collect them all US sure why the
faction

1091
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:29,990
so thats paper came out from the INS
eyesight electrochemical our problem

1092
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:35,330
and recycling calculating our analysis I
ask it to myself okay

1093
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:38,560
if I want chocolate and everybody out
there is saying

1094
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:43,890
hey lowers are defecting to hear so
hallway ultimately years of samples to

1095
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:44,550
run

1096
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:48,390
if I went around andrea was Saints
that's really bad

1097
01:05:48,390 --> 01:05:53,520
rights with everyone will say hey most
of the samples were looking to have him

1098
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,860
technology music

1099
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:58,760
also sobils don't run on Van I select
some failures right

1100
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:04,160
say hey entails or sandbox because it
does not have a VM technology we are

1101
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:04,740
like

1102
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:09,790
super smart sorry menace to run knows a
sample some time away

1103
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:13,010
are a lifesaver but that's only one
machine and we can do that

1104
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:16,260
they are super smart I was like wall are

1105
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:19,910
as that's really what's not to like what
are the numbers for such a look at the

1106
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:20,640
numbers source

1107
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:24,420
signed into effect like them out of
samples using your Twitter detective him

1108
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:25,500
technologist

1109
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:28,980
Irish also love the numbers you guys
gonna laugh from that

1110
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:31,990
her well later I saw okay if I go

1111
01:06:31,990 --> 01:06:36,330
if they wear like not really telling the
truth about severe and technologists

1112
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:39,690
well-off other acknowledge that the more
employers like it's the burning earth

1113
01:06:39,690 --> 01:06:41,110
does the same way

1114
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:45,240
by confiscation so it's not like
collecting all the pickling salt I am

1115
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:47,860
trying to protect this perfect picnic

1116
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:51,510
with I thought the security industry the
Emir

1117
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:54,980
in this so we're going to be doing for
airs was a

1118
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:58,920
really interesting because there were no
documentation for most of the Technics

1119
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:04,060
the plantation was like basically one
guy solemn hour using specifically exo-k

1120
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:05,670
like a blog posts

1121
01:07:05,670 --> 01:07:09,140
and the black balls was focusing on how
to bypass the picnic

1122
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:12,330
and not call the picnic actually worked
so they were like a lot of fun

1123
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:17,670
a mistakes and Air Force or what the guy
a silver the clinic was about of

1124
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:20,920
and a so there was like a paper data on

1125
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:24,270
here and some friends we reserve the
paper I cuts

1126
01:07:24,270 --> 01:07:27,850
and the paper-based estates all the
techniques that we minister fines

1127
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:31,720
and together with the paper trail we
provide like a I'm example of England

1128
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:32,330
intention of

1129
01:07:32,330 --> 01:07:36,140
eight of the picnic okay so if you guys
want to develop the Lower

1130
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:39,760
now have all the connects their frm a
makeover and now you don't have an

1131
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,310
excuse to not the fact that the connects
anymore because of that same goes for

1132
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:47,150
eight of them salt no excuse to anybody
anymore

1133
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:51,610
and I basically want to wait what I was
expecting with the paper was

1134
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:57,690
to force although our altars so fall
back to not sales in Packers not using

1135
01:07:57,690 --> 01:08:01,540
I confiscation not using as the banking
solve my life was going to be much

1136
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:04,340
research on allies them our samples

1137
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:08,210
that happen but you know main FL points

1138
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:11,450
and have no idea where is very stop in
presentation

1139
01:08:11,450 --> 01:08:14,630
I'll it was like for us a call for us
her

1140
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:18,060
is already very stubborn excellence if
it's it's an important point what

1141
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:19,889
basically what really it was like

1142
01:08:19,889 --> 01:08:23,500
we got up some of the so-called

1143
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:28,250
a painting attacks and we got a Windows
machine a windows box

1144
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:31,759
that that Texas anything else writes so
that way just like

1145
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:36,270
upgraded to the latest service a backup
when dole's really with like DP

1146
01:08:36,270 --> 01:08:40,000
which aims at some options offered no
brainer let us that this

1147
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,299
variance offensive attack yes though a
sacred software just

1148
01:08:44,299 --> 01:08:48,259
every day and change in like 10
something I don't worry there one of

1149
01:08:48,259 --> 01:08:48,759
something

1150
01:08:48,759 --> 01:08:53,960
offs and saw it all this flow lines
vessel attack something work

1151
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:57,350
Ondo it's like really crazy like

1152
01:08:57,350 --> 01:09:01,659
no money spent really no one aspect of
whether that's in the presentation

1153
01:09:01,659 --> 01:09:02,650
member

1154
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:06,600
I gas that everybody was going to be
using that hand

1155
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:10,609
computer networks at some point but
still not the case

1156
01:09:10,609 --> 01:09:15,259
so ok enter into our problem other
information like in that paper was like

1157
01:09:15,259 --> 01:09:16,440
a look into like

1158
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:20,179
what does that well from our that
actually dole something bad gonna try to

1159
01:09:20,179 --> 01:09:21,529
protect themselves

1160
01:09:21,529 --> 01:09:25,900
so the in a paper I the comments like
what or what was their past days that

1161
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,920
that's a bad call within the past

1162
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,969
ever face the comment on the paper care
I am just seem to find a day to just so

1163
01:09:31,969 --> 01:09:32,850
you guys know

1164
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:36,850
so we analyze like for me know samples
like for this presentation

1165
01:09:36,850 --> 01:09:40,230
so it's interesting that everyone to
start off like a

1166
01:09:40,230 --> 01:09:44,690
unpacking lower and I like a how complex
it is to run back wall or

1167
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:47,739
and when you talk to have a nice day
always pointing out

1168
01:09:47,739 --> 01:09:50,960
unpacking the colors they have and all
that works

1169
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:54,750
from the mall is that we look at
sixty-five percent we're not back at all

1170
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:59,040
soul smarTrend doesn't really matter if
they're packing are no articles

1171
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:03,179
majority were not author of course 34
sister a big number

1172
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:07,489
butts I don't really believe in a cold
one is and whether I can't remember that

1173
01:10:07,489 --> 01:10:08,469
I don't like

1174
01:10:08,469 --> 01:10:12,429
I tried to rob papen remember to say if
I started liking it

1175
01:10:12,429 --> 01:10:17,870
I so going okay for you're saying that
16 percent of the Packers are

1176
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:22,040
actually LPX went just three hits
running back

1177
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:25,980
fixpoint 87 percent are are 10 it's all
rather have a

1178
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:31,590
I the program to unpack to 0.06 erbakan
packed with all have fax have like

1179
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:33,260
buddhist right back

1180
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:37,190
well 1 percent were like %uh stop until
I can tell them packer and then they

1181
01:10:37,190 --> 01:10:40,130
like a total of one percent of the
samples and

1182
01:10:40,130 --> 01:10:44,500
that just goes down so we're all just
facing backers

1183
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:48,510
that I get to me i've while now there is
a rare chance but while that's

1184
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:51,790
they're not really fast sorry guys but

1185
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:56,170
that's the case up if you're looking for
sale marlboro sales are very it's best

1186
01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:57,070
that I like

1187
01:10:57,070 --> 01:11:01,179
Whitehall Earth Fare very important how
perfect the mars in Roseville

1188
01:11:01,179 --> 01:11:05,460
during his backers wow that's why we're
famous my writers

1189
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:08,630
her well general right

1190
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:11,830
88 percent of them are worse

1191
01:11:11,830 --> 01:11:15,300
do have some a collector of one
defection

1192
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:19,120
that's interesting why because like we
were going to like %uh 15 technics

1193
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,179
fifteen different economics

1194
01:11:21,179 --> 01:11:24,650
its eight percent of them our have
something like that

1195
01:11:24,650 --> 01:11:27,820
that make less if there were only
detected 50

1196
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:32,600
speculates that exist older already
effect 8.96 percent of

1197
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:37,929
all lower it's very easy to detect the
lower right

1198
01:11:37,929 --> 01:11:41,980
prowess although our were supposed to
not

1199
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:45,790
years protection because using a
protection mechanism is actually

1200
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:49,330
something that is very clear that you
have just a few member of the comics

1201
01:11:49,330 --> 01:11:52,719
events very likely that you are lower
okay

1202
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:55,870
it's just as well over 400 problems that
me

1203
01:11:55,870 --> 01:11:59,389
there's this kind of economic so I own
or Skype may be there

1204
01:11:59,389 --> 01:12:03,210
there are others but I only know Skype
okay

1205
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:06,909
yeah sorry her also Mrs

1206
01:12:06,909 --> 01:12:10,570
well let this guy has a different kind
of lower right

1207
01:12:10,570 --> 01:12:13,650
kar so the various

1208
01:12:13,650 --> 01:12:17,600
bill went nowhere if they're really
looking toward becoming separate like

1209
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,300
start to look into spin to the false
positives

1210
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:24,440
because some of the things that could
generate false positives I S errant

1211
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:27,550
it was unprotected by the number is
actually higher

1212
01:12:27,550 --> 01:12:32,070
okay so we'll get back to on wall so
ninety percent of them are so they're

1213
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:33,920
all worth fifty picnics

1214
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:37,989
well thats goals ever worse for the
airstrip

1215
01:12:37,989 --> 01:12:41,330
if they're really start to look into the
protections than yours

1216
01:12:41,330 --> 01:12:44,750
like 81 percent sears is entering a row

1217
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:47,860
say it like a full schedule for entering
the burning

1218
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:50,909
am NOT 12 percent there's and his
assignment

1219
01:12:50,909 --> 01:12:55,030
of course some love then here's Paul
frites that's why there is like a

1220
01:12:55,030 --> 01:12:58,570
that's more than 100 percent and it auto
thats kind of obvious

1221
01:12:58,570 --> 01:13:02,239
but there was a 10 points essay Davis
we're not flying above

1222
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:05,560
into the air they were telling the truth
of

1223
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:09,400
says I don't like that's I really wanted
them to be lying

1224
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:12,949
so I decided to have a temper no
comments ever

1225
01:13:12,949 --> 01:13:17,130
it's interesting because 99 percent of
those flowers are actually defecting

1226
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:18,810
amore

1227
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:21,969
specifically him or so

1228
01:13:21,969 --> 01:13:25,909
overall size walks beckoning for certain
looking terrible that

1229
01:13:25,909 --> 01:13:30,489
like Trend Micro has a product that no I
don't think that beckons inspection in

1230
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:31,600
Rome our

1231
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,889
in a sale rocks and that's how it is.

1232
01:13:34,889 --> 01:13:38,570
were talks I live for

1233
01:13:38,570 --> 01:13:43,199
so federal worst thing lol all the
Wailers are actually using

1234
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:46,770
like a firm to Fox San came here

1235
01:13:46,770 --> 01:13:50,929
they just know someone special summer it
was a using it because I felt that

1236
01:13:50,929 --> 01:13:55,850
so they're not magical and testing like
put on marketing way area and involve

1237
01:13:55,850 --> 01:13:57,760
the market square with what they

1238
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:02,130
we all know okay so basically like a you
can say I can sum up dancers like

1239
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:02,730
defector

1240
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:06,330
specific over 20 per se some of them in
years in like the killings of

1241
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:09,550
I settled into a which doesn't work with
Sam so

1242
01:14:09,550 --> 01:14:12,860
basically if you have like a came here
with Sam

1243
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:15,949
I rock AM they're gonna be okay

1244
01:14:15,949 --> 01:14:19,239
ok analyzing our and they're not going
to tactic you

1245
01:14:19,239 --> 01:14:24,920
K Dalton doll by like this bank very
expensive sidewalk they selling

1246
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:29,010
her I get there there's a sale at the
clinic all told her like mary that

1247
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:29,530
connects

1248
01:14:29,530 --> 01:14:34,010
are looking to wait oh they're like
expecting that we look at the Michael

1249
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:37,239
basically there's lecture of them and
that's it

1250
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:40,929
so it's not like a the guy is looking to
lower and there's a and it is the same

1251
01:14:40,929 --> 01:14:41,580
way

1252
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:44,889
and now he thinks forever it's very hard
to analyze no

1253
01:14:44,889 --> 01:14:47,940
its quite simple okay

1254
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:51,790
if there are no economic they're just
there like right turns us on record

1255
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:57,100
and now a regrettable so it's not really
like my hours are very complex us

1256
01:14:57,100 --> 01:15:00,530
poor trying to appoint for identifying

1257
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:04,850
they'll have something which is also
funny seventy-one percent of them

1258
01:15:04,850 --> 01:15:08,940
yes I like a soft for sure for detecting
the burger

1259
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:12,270
wow if Microsoft thank you are here
rights

1260
01:15:12,270 --> 01:15:15,300
her everything that goes like so is one
percent

1261
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:18,520
that that's why the south and then the
like sell a 10 percent that's another

1262
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:20,199
feature of Microsoft so

1263
01:15:20,199 --> 01:15:24,389
but basically then really really count
on the support of the process into

1264
01:15:24,389 --> 01:15:24,929
effect

1265
01:15:24,929 --> 01:15:28,010
burger its very nice of Microsoft

1266
01:15:28,010 --> 01:15:31,820
helping wake good guys of sorry there in
the bed was by

1267
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:36,510
ok so the guy from Microsoft on it was
funny as well

1268
01:15:36,510 --> 01:15:40,460
kirker for the same goes for
confiscation technics

1269
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:44,270
okay walls but no full-scale Shumway a
small so the way that they're both

1270
01:15:44,270 --> 01:15:45,030
states

1271
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:48,940
are very simple to actually a return
date fi so

1272
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:52,420
they're not the way it coating on
complexity

1273
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:57,120
make most of the samples are using like
want to connect one specific to connect

1274
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,900
differences are really high

1275
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:02,030
as I love then there's like two or three
together butts

1276
01:16:02,030 --> 01:16:05,739
everyone saw that means they're both
really ensure right

1277
01:16:05,739 --> 01:16:09,330
Festa techniques for detection refiner
no

1278
01:16:09,330 --> 01:16:13,750
15 Iran's really good to go when they're
going to that act like ninety percent of

1279
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:15,199
the samples

1280
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:18,350
Sol it's interesting rights because why

1281
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:22,170
they're not doing it I dunno

1282
01:16:22,170 --> 01:16:26,510
I remember nice if they when they close

1283
01:16:26,510 --> 01:16:29,610
so I i'm not limited

1284
01:16:29,610 --> 01:16:33,590
just say that this alone will solve the
problem rights of course if they start

1285
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:35,570
acting what's going to happen yes

1286
01:16:35,570 --> 01:16:40,040
an hour alters will fall back into their
stop using that that connects

1287
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:44,250
our spot using a protection mechanism
well then it's life or physical form now

1288
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:49,659
analyzing so lol transgender their
actions

1289
01:16:49,659 --> 01:16:53,900
but we know that knowledge there are
lower that when they are start

1290
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:56,999
they get information about their share
their running

1291
01:16:56,999 --> 01:17:01,940
ever yes to run a different machine sold
the flashback Mauer for Mac

1292
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:05,820
was a good example of that so when it
well it gets us although she would

1293
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:08,059
collect information or so it doesn't run

1294
01:17:08,059 --> 01:17:12,170
anything else so it takes quite some
time for people trying to figure out of

1295
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:12,980
an hour

1296
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:16,749
because risk if there were saying the
same poll there are trying to run it

1297
01:17:16,749 --> 01:17:20,909
it's not going to run it's not going to
do anything on this shows so you believe

1298
01:17:20,909 --> 01:17:24,789
it's okay it's not the initial site
rights that price for the fair today

1299
01:17:24,789 --> 01:17:28,380
and dynamic analysis so he has a
proposition

1300
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:32,550
instead of trying to look into what we
need to including parliament's

1301
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:36,179
in order to relax on the analyze the
samples are instead of trying to do

1302
01:17:36,179 --> 01:17:39,519
ready or not is on those samples or why
don't we

1303
01:17:39,519 --> 01:17:45,230
just right so the killings and attacked
the ways their strength and find a shame

1304
01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:49,030
and then we have affection of until they
mimic analysis couple minutes

1305
01:17:49,030 --> 01:17:52,269
so that so %uh something that we need to
research more

1306
01:17:52,269 --> 01:17:56,880
because it's very easy for us to just
say yeah I know I think and do whatever

1307
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:01,320
yeah but while they act I think it's
always find a technical extraneous

1308
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:05,050
we're gonna have a good way to go I can
assure

1309
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:08,809
they all went to a serious this
scientific start analyzing

1310
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:12,440
I really don't like the researchers
going down just a half now we have this

1311
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:13,300
other proper

1312
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:16,489
okay let's put science on it let's look
into them member of the correct that

1313
01:18:16,489 --> 01:18:17,539
exist so there

1314
01:18:17,539 --> 01:18:20,749
while they are using if there is waste
want for the comic

1315
01:18:20,749 --> 01:18:24,329
if there is worry nations and what's the
tag then as well and they're looking for

1316
01:18:24,329 --> 01:18:25,889
them over samples older

1317
01:18:25,889 --> 01:18:28,909
analysts say was the prevalence of
course that connects

1318
01:18:28,909 --> 01:18:33,079
and then we the fine if it's worth to
try to call up there or not

1319
01:18:33,079 --> 01:18:36,909
and when a mysterious explain all this
is more like a

1320
01:18:36,909 --> 01:18:41,679
I'm marketing game rights I doing
whatever makes marketing

1321
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:44,719
I don't know whatever is really
important or whatever

1322
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:48,480
ex-government and I'll

1323
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:53,849
just so-called clearance they have the
talk was a second that's a very random

1324
01:18:53,849 --> 01:18:58,420
Joe throwing I some problems so throwing
a guy so many s

1325
01:18:58,420 --> 01:19:01,519
to tell you that the attack is us

1326
01:19:01,519 --> 01:19:06,260
adverse events as the defense it's not a
war it's best that offense

1327
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:09,869
rights because a ranch offers the first
financial attack

1328
01:19:09,869 --> 01:19:14,860
saw it on your system up so they attack
and to have de peso the bypass a pic

1329
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:18,849
so there is such thing as investors are
two fires so

1330
01:19:18,849 --> 01:19:22,530
if the guys are saying the attacks that
with same our advanced

1331
01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:25,940
that mean stingray in a sec a failing
ran

1332
01:19:25,940 --> 01:19:29,849
sorry FXR not advanced record them much

1333
01:19:29,849 --> 01:19:33,949
much worse so we don't know if they have
a couple minutes

1334
01:19:33,949 --> 01:19:39,469
nichols we're not defending well up with
new ways to look into the problems

1335
01:19:39,469 --> 01:19:44,219
I am sure about that am about how we
gonna person economics change

1336
01:19:44,219 --> 01:19:48,090
I don't know but already interesting

1337
01:19:48,090 --> 01:19:51,369
fraying and something other rare want
their guys to think about this

1338
01:19:51,369 --> 01:19:54,989
how will help academia we're lost

1339
01:19:54,989 --> 01:19:59,150
if they cut their does not help us what
force me to help them because they're

1340
01:19:59,150 --> 01:20:00,769
completely lost

1341
01:20:00,769 --> 01:20:04,639
like we have a lot of talent so a lot of
smart people
