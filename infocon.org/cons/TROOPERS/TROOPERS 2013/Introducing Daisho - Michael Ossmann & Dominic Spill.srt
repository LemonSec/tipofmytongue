1
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,970
so the first time we spoke about it and
up

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:11,240
this mostly and instruction talkin and
to explain why we're doing and

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,889
what we're doing and its own site of up

4
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:19,830
23 this so now just

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,670
so I the startup entries in the teams
involved

6
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,790
I we've got jared has put a lot of work
into the RF project for

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,189
I with Marshall he's quite I well known
for a

8
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:33,760
dick strange things with and 64 video
games

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,199
a building HDMI adapters for and 64
thanks a lot

10
00:00:37,199 --> 00:00:41,040
Micah showing my number to struggle on
from kismat

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,420
up the sting of a lot of two ha but sign
another

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,449
work with us says Michael Stein

13
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:51,780
me and then we've got Benjamin who is
just set up there actually destructive

14
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,659
course gives away his wife okay sup is
that so he's seven of us

15
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:58,920
you can ask about the project anytime I
for the next couple days

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,839
if you look at the other guys on have 30
so some but so much to this message

17
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:07,020
project came from something that just
right side

18
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,690
which is that security will not get
better until tools for practical

19
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,409
exploration at the tax office

20
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:16,260
made available and I

21
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,090
and we take this to we we text how we
text i mean that

22
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:24,540
you know the we know going to look at

23
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,240
the security of communications parts Co
about the kind of thing we're in see

24
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,990
communications price goes and when I can
look at the security and tell

25
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,500
you can look at it from the physical
layer or up

26
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,900
you know we tweet on this for politics
with the above text

27
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,410
got it was too to get into the lowest
level possible so that we can explore

28
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:48,409
up the stock I miss the same idea behind
are often

29
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:52,510
thinks about so you know what

30
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,270
how did how do we get to the site we are
and what's a wifi encryption right

31
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:00,680
we start off with open networks and we
had WEP if you want it secure

32
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,360
and wifi help with from from day one

33
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,600
had ultra packet up monitoring

34
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,060
modes and we were able to you as a
community you stop

35
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,670
to discover the floors and wept and we
got a BPA and then we read to use the

36
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,799
same process to discover the flaws in wk

37
00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:21,860
now have to pick a tuna everything's
perfect okay

38
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,879
and the same thing happen for to play it
safe

39
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,140
up to a certain extent and that I the

40
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,950
analysis on the the pen was a
theoretical tak

41
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,130
by will and Sheffield checkered

42
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,400
check it for a killer I'm sorry %uh

43
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,980
ands and then we're able to show that
that's actually practical

44
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,360
with tools like BT crack with some that
your Bluetooth stuff

45
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,520
we were able to look at it is possible
to brief of pens

46
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,280
now have secure simple pairing and

47
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,160
Mike Ryan is currently using projected
to

48
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,750
to explore the pairing mechanisms at the
physical layer in

49
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,680
Bluetooth Low Energy and he's already
demonstrated last month that they're a

50
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,599
flows that

51
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,790
need to be addressed some type of on

52
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,599
on this is great and this is something
that we could do really well at Wallace

53
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,209
because you can build a sniffer

54
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:16,380
or mom to and you can monitor these
things out soviet

55
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,750
for we quite curious about how wall

56
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,640
washer white particles be any different
I y Fuego

57
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,819
as: grade encryption on your wifi
connection

58
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:30,040
and nothing and everything that
connection ans

59
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,910
we think it's going back to watch it
right side it's because they're not

60
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,099
practical tools to explore the security
of some of these particles

61
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:39,250
on I and something at speeds that we'd
like

62
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:44,140
so wanna physical at as you can see

63
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,220
from I'd rather complex tied up %uh

64
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,480
we gonna go in out but as low as
possible at the lowest possible layoff

65
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,010
because the lowest light physical way
caps lights all of the highlights

66
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,370
so if you can start to observe packets

67
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,580
physical at you know that you can
investigate the security of the link

68
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,160
layer

69
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,709
all of a various other liars about

70
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:09,830
something months complaint about the
lives in the house on

71
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:14,170
I am but big if you're if you're looking
at a high level you

72
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:18,039
you can't look at the lower layers from
that point so so we try to go as low as

73
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:18,479
possible

74
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,650
that's what we've always done with with
other particles another one today for

75
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:22,049
this

76
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:26,710
up high-speed what particles site

77
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:31,000
turning so there are certain target
technologies that

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,419
that we are focused on in this project
in particular we are building

79
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:40,279
a device that can do monitoring Gigabit
Ethernet

80
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:44,900
USB not just USB 2.0 over USB 3.0
SuperSpeed

81
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,379
HDMI and RS 232

82
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:51,770
RS 232 my sound like a little bit
hardball here

83
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,639
mostly were were targeting high-speed
communications technologies that have

84
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:58,279
previously been more difficult to
monitor

85
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:01,809
up but RS 232 still around

86
00:05:01,809 --> 00:05:04,830
and it has some characteristics that
make it

87
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:08,559
I useful test platform for us

88
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:12,029
that we can validate our platform works
for the los be technology before we move

89
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:13,870
onto its on a higher speeds

90
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:17,020
but ultimately we're trying to make
something that can

91
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:22,979
attack or defend are be used to explore

92
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:26,569
any wired communication technology

93
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:32,490
and these are just the first four that
we're trying to target

94
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,189
I there are existing monitors out there

95
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:40,689
for example to monitor Ethernet you
could use my phone star lamb tap

96
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:44,719
and it's just a simple passive

97
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:48,349
electrical connector that allows you to
tap

98
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:51,529
and to internet connections marjoram

99
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:55,889
but it has some drawbacks it only
operates at 10 base-t

100
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,939
and a hundred based TX

101
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:03,569
so it can be used for Gigabit Gigabit
Ethernet monitoring

102
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:07,589
there are a number of other passive lamb
taps on the market or home

103
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:10,809
build circuits that accomplish the same
thing

104
00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:15,279
more commonly people use a mere report
on a switch

105
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,460
to monitor Gigabit Ethernet

106
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,639
and it has some drawbacks too for one
thing

107
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,139
a switch is typically visible to all the
target network

108
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:31,149
so it's not a particularly stealthy way
to monitor

109
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:35,990
a any Internet connection people also
often use our software tap

110
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:39,289
you like just generating a peek at file

111
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:43,080
on a host computer I wanted to the
connection for example

112
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,189
and accept that really has a lot of uses
but it's at a higher layer protocol

113
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,909
stack

114
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:51,050
and we want to be able to the lowest
possible where

115
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:54,479
we want to be at the physical layer we
want to be

116
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,539
undetectable early says undetectable as
possible

117
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:02,219
and we want to do this all and a
portable

118
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:06,589
open source low-cost platform I

119
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:12,339
USB there aren't as many tools out there
for monitoring USB and I

120
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:16,300
they're really not very popular this
time in the information security

121
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,379
community

122
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:22,119
there is a product line call beagle from
total phase

123
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:25,179
and these are some a really nice boxes

124
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:28,550
but they're pretty expensive and close
source

125
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:33,080
the entry-level SuperSpeed USB

126
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,270
monster from total phase is

127
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:39,809
I'll like three-year four thousand
dollars

128
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:42,899
its up not very affordable

129
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:45,990
there's also the USB

130
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,159
I however you pronounce that that

131
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:53,069
is a a lower-cost commercial

132
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:56,919
box that you can buy two monitors USB
connections by I

133
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:00,619
think it only works at low speed at full
speed %uh

134
00:08:00,619 --> 00:08:04,559
I don't think is a support high-speed
internet the starsight if

135
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:08,389
per high-speed USB they definitely don't
support

136
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:12,029
SuperSpeed USB I 10 most exciting

137
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:15,110
things that i've seen is the open be
slow

138
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:18,159
project which is working on I'm

139
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:21,929
a I monitoring devices open source

140
00:08:21,929 --> 00:08:26,699
monitoring device for hi-speed USB

141
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:29,749
and this would be really great if they
would actually ship

142
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:33,399
but they haven't yet and they've had my
money for over two years

143
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:36,469
so I'm going on paper where for now

144
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:39,700
but I have high hopes but even even

145
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,260
if they succeed in their goals they
won't be

146
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,709
supporting SuperSpeed USB and we think
that down the road

147
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:50,800
that's going to become a very important
capability

148
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,230
HDMI is a technology that hardly anybody
doesn't

149
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:59,700
monitoring of by its becoming more
interesting from a security standpoint

150
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,340
on not only does HDMI Terry video data

151
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,650
but it also carries a low-speed

152
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,760
serial communication and

153
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:16,890
also going forward is going to be able
to start carrying things like Ethernet

154
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,020
over HDMI so it might be useful

155
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:24,530
to actually be able to interface with
HDMI

156
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:28,630
for security research and there are a
few

157
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:33,400
interesting projects out there there's
any TV made by buying long which is

158
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,910
I a little FPGA platform that does

159
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,180
HDMI man in the middle stuff that's
pretty cool I'm very similar to what we

160
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:40,910
want to do

161
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,120
I except it doesn't really have any
monitoring

162
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,530
capability that we can tell arm

163
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:50,890
out a box it doesn't have a I'll

164
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:54,590
very much RAM it doesn't have a offer to
store

165
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:59,150
any data that it would its there with
the poll from the wire

166
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:03,410
and it doesn't have a a high-speed
connection to host computer that you can

167
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,780
use to top that data off so

168
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:09,740
it's good for certain things like
injecting

169
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,940
I'll video into a connection maybe but

170
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,130
it doesn't itself focus our complete

171
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:20,480
monitoring solution and it only operates
up to certain

172
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,250
pixel rate HDMI runs out I'll look very
wide for

173
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,650
variety of speeds data rates up a video

174
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:33,330
signal and any TV operates just fast
enough

175
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,890
that it came to 1080 I resolution

176
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:41,160
well 1080 P is very common and it's not
supported by

177
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,420
any and so it'll be nice to have
something that support steny

178
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,670
P and up the bus hire

179
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:52,890
is a very low cost very useful device
that can be used

180
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:56,580
Adam Lori pointed out his blog recently

181
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:01,300
for monitoring the control signals based
in miami is a low speed serial

182
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,370
control lines missus pretty cool I

183
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:08,440
and and definitely useful but it's
totally limited to just a low speed

184
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,400
control signals

185
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,150
not them the video data which is part of
a package

186
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,750
the video ghost is the only affordable

187
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,300
HDMI monitoring device I've been able to
find

188
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:25,500
an it only captures still images
periodically it grabs a still image

189
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,570
and stores it up this is gonna call but

190
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:35,050
it doesn't really me the news a security
researcher I don't

191
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:39,210
I all these all these existing
monitoring solutions have certain

192
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,730
drawbacks

193
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,970
Muslim a close source most of them
perform inadequately in some way

194
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,250
most of them are expensive not portable
and

195
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,460
most of them operate at the link layer
or higher

196
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,400
and as Dominic mention we want to get to
the lowest layer we possibly can because

197
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,370
that gets us

198
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:00,290
all years

199
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,830
a particular bottleneck but I want to
point out a particular

200
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:07,420
flaw and the designer many

201
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,200
many different monitoring solutions for
communication media

202
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,710
is the the bottleneck

203
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:18,130
illustrated here if you have a Gigabit
Ethernet tap

204
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:21,230
and you put it on and Internet network

205
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:25,250
now that target network is full-duplex

206
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,110
thousand make a bit full duplex so it's
got a thousand make up it's going one

207
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:28,540
way

208
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,810
at 1000 make up it's going to be other
way or up to a thousand

209
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,530
it's going the other way well if if

210
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:39,210
both directions are very active

211
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:42,580
and close to their maximum capacity

212
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,590
up the tap is trying to deliver

213
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,610
potentially up to 2,000 megabits per
second

214
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,210
to the monitoring station and

215
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:57,520
and all of the new a lower cost more
portable solutions I found

216
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,980
that connection from the top to the
monitoring station is

217
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,200
a Gigabit Ethernet line that can only
carry

218
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,740
1000 megabytes in one direction so
there's a bottleneck something has to

219
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,930
give here

220
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:14,040
what you know what what do they do they
have to either

221
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,680
degrade the performance of the target
network or

222
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,570
they have to drop some other packets
that are supposed to be delivered to the

223
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,600
monitoring station

224
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,620
up or mean the the best solution

225
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,770
would-be to I had

226
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:35,940
a higher speed or multiple connections
from the tap to the monitoring station

227
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,620
and if once you do that it becomes

228
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:44,410
less portable right because you don't
you probably have one Gigabit Ethernet

229
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,850
port on your laptop

230
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,100
so if you wanna portable solution it's
only going to be able to connect on

231
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,300
one Kb connection to your laptop

232
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:57,800
I so this is one of the problems that
we're trying to solve this project

233
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,340
and its up

234
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,290
what are the ways that we're trying to
solve it is by using a USB 3.0

235
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,400
SuperSpeed connection to the host
computer

236
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,140
USB 3.0 is becoming very popular

237
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,470
most new laptops these days have it so

238
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:19,680
if you have USB 3.0 on your laptop why
not use back to deliver

239
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,120
data because it's the high-speed
interface that's available to you

240
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,279
commonly

241
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:31,279
on I laptop that you might be carrying
around your back anyway

242
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:35,970
on so so with all this in lines all
these things we we decided

243
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,330
we need to me advice so we started
writing down ideas

244
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,340
like the first thing that's really
important to both of us and everyone

245
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,600
involved in the project

246
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,420
is is open source all a previous
projects been open source of a

247
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,350
open source hardware up so it was very
passionate about

248
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:55,660
we need the performance built a moment
to a full duplex Gigabit Ethernet

249
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,620
connections

250
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,840
we also want to look at up SuperSpeed
USB

251
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,460
we we want to look at all the things we
we need and and of performance to be

252
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,340
able to get that data back to host one
train station

253
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:10,160
I port 4 be nice snow it's no use to us
if it

254
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,220
you know takes a rack to to still this
thing

255
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,670
ideal a small enough I to move around so
that you know you're looking at a piece

256
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,410
a technology made on a client-side

257
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:23,300
or worker I'm whatever it's easy to take
this thing around.

258
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,420
on now we're not gonna be able to build
something that

259
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,860
the dolls office in one go and he'll
probably unwieldy and huge

260
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,760
and Ste but the amount of I on this
board in front to me

261
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,910
and that wasn't there and when data half
the stuff we on today

262
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:41,779
so gonna build it modular we gotta I
gunners have something

263
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:47,760
the you know I want to I want mom to USB
today of help for PSP frontal assault

264
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,990
rifle from this means we can extend in
the future as well

265
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,620
I ands there's no use in us

266
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,930
building terrible tools to use it with
when

267
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,990
everybody wants onto sayings knows what
jacques

268
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:04,800
right so you want you only get to you
get your data into washout like

269
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,210
unitary I've got it communication
protocol got what shock

270
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:14,360
I just wanna get it from once placed and
asked us what went wrong

271
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,200
so we needed to shower on

272
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,610
to show is a para salts what some are

273
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:26,279
the right yes %uh for the much had signs

274
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:29,970
I was in awe say that I job yeah this is
the day we decided I wasn't an Aussie

275
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:33,990
but I so the plan is to use

276
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:38,070
I standards fight ships that are

277
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:41,700
your network card or you're up just beat
out already

278
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,930
and convert them into from the the
fiscal

279
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:47,960
prescolite a lot to whatever bus they
speak

280
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,410
untimely and a then

281
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,170
tough but later and pullout thanks about
to launch a recession so is close the

282
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,260
physical aris

283
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:00,730
as we possibly can I you don't really
care about the very

284
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:04,870
voltage levels at physical at what you
just one that was the physical bits

285
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:08,529
I because we need to be quite flexible
means a lot of these things

286
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:11,789
high-speed we're gonna put through an
FPGA

287
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:16,049
up back to the hostess yes peace 36 P

288
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:20,240
as mike said its common on laptops it's
coming on desktops now

289
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,209
it's the fastest pole to get data into
your commontranslation

290
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,929
so it gives us their best a best hope
for the future too

291
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:30,980
to continue being up to use this this
platform

292
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:35,179
and up yeah as I said before much less
on sofa

293
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,909
if in a year's time as a technology
launched opts every it's only wants to

294
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:41,460
build to monitor what we can to build a
new front end

295
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,360
we don't have to read is on the whole
board we don't have to change I think we

296
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,700
just get a couple fights

297
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,889
from temple to plug it in

298
00:17:48,889 --> 00:17:51,970
I may get some simple but it's not

299
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,360
up so this is the hardware architecture
its

300
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,999
two boards that work together on the
main board

301
00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:02,789
is what mostly word on it was just
talking about it

302
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:07,590
FPGA with some ramen micro SD card for

303
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,899
the FPGA bit stream the

304
00:18:10,899 --> 00:18:14,210
I N USB 3.0 connection

305
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:17,659
that is intended to be connected in most
use cases to

306
00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:20,720
host computer Davis monitoring station

307
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,139
are connected to the main board is a
module up front and module

308
00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:28,820
and this is where we use off-the-shelf

309
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,590
fi chip physical layer transceiver

310
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,610
for the particular communications medium

311
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,879
and and a connector for

312
00:18:38,879 --> 00:18:42,580
up for that medium and so

313
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:48,519
up we have it in particular to assume
something is important to note is that

314
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:50,210
these five ships

315
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:53,480
formosa technologies we're looking at
I'll

316
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,809
normally you would have let's say

317
00:18:56,809 --> 00:19:00,210
on II Gigabit Ethernet card

318
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:04,269
you would have a5 chip and a Mac chip

319
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:08,690
but does the Mac where and we're just
doing away with Mac chip

320
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,869
and connecting a fight shipped directly
to an FPGA

321
00:19:11,869 --> 00:19:15,700
so that we're going to lowest layer we
possibly can

322
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,259
and are giving you the capability

323
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:23,279
to create tools for monitoring or
injection on this

324
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,509
system up notice that we have

325
00:19:26,509 --> 00:19:30,090
25 stand two connectors for on each

326
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:33,759
are front-end modules and the idea is

327
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:38,200
to be able to plug an this platform in
line

328
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,419
into the middle love became action

329
00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:47,100
it's possible for at least some to these
communication technologies that we could

330
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,909
design our friends to do passive
monitoring

331
00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:54,480
but our main goal here is to create
tools

332
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,929
that let you actually sit in the middle
of a connection

333
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:01,629
and I and so the data

334
00:20:01,629 --> 00:20:04,730
might come in on one of those connectors
through a fire

335
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,869
over the main board into the FPGA and
then

336
00:20:07,869 --> 00:20:11,929
back over to the other five and out the
other connector

337
00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:15,730
and this means that all the data on the
target

338
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:19,149
network is going through the FPGA

339
00:20:19,149 --> 00:20:22,289
that gives us the ability to then
duplicate that data

340
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:28,110
store it in a buffer on a ram send it
over the USB 3.0 connection

341
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:33,070
do whatever we want with it and it also
opens the door to

342
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:37,480
I all sorts of interesting capabilities
where we could inject

343
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,499
on 22 communication medium and

344
00:20:40,499 --> 00:20:44,320
operate as out to operate as a man in
the middle

345
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,909
on communication medium which is
something that ever had a good tools to

346
00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:49,539
do

347
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,629
on a wide variety I love

348
00:20:52,629 --> 00:20:56,249
of physical I wired communications

349
00:20:56,249 --> 00:20:59,710
systems in particular on high-speed

350
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:03,039
wired communication media so

351
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,749
our goal for this project is really just
provide

352
00:21:06,749 --> 00:21:10,749
the the hardware platform and the
monitoring capability

353
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:14,860
but in the long term we hope that people
will be able to use this platform

354
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:20,460
to perform things be on monitoring

355
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,600
smart I which show up

356
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,799
we have no idea whose lives are hers I
up

357
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,159
I on like I said earlier I

358
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,369
open sources is so important to us I

359
00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:36,850
week we believe it's Islip pretty
sensible philosophy for

360
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:40,919
for anyone to to use in in this industry
and up so

361
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:44,710
having said that we use us much open
source

362
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:48,159
I will produce not have a source of iron
how far as possible with this project

363
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:53,549
I love all tools will be open source the
hard but signs are already on get help

364
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:57,100
I the FPGA course the we're writing

365
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,239
are also going to be okay how they were
already on get help

366
00:22:00,239 --> 00:22:04,580
up the only thing that is not open
source all summer 50 genitals and we

367
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,200
don't make it all about

368
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,259
for where we've had to use up close of
tools

369
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:13,649
they are at least up freely available

370
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:18,019
so that that as their cost and it would
be nice if they were open source tools

371
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:18,509
for

372
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:25,509
features buzzing a way of up

373
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:28,460
the mainboard up

374
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,529
the FPGA were using enemy forces Altera
Cyclone

375
00:22:31,529 --> 00:22:34,929
for with about 30,000

376
00:22:34,929 --> 00:22:39,799
logic elements switches not won the
smallest epic year's top 10 largest

377
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:44,499
PGA's it's got some up the effigy is
that are available with free to use

378
00:22:44,499 --> 00:22:45,369
tools

379
00:22:45,369 --> 00:22:48,799
yet yes cut up by I'll moderate sized

380
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:53,799
and we haven't USB 3.0 transceiver

381
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:58,249
just a5 chip on the main board some ddr2
RAM

382
00:22:58,249 --> 00:23:01,309
are small arm microcontrollers religious
their

383
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:05,100
primarily as a supervisor for the FPGA
load the bitstream

384
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,749
stuff like that and micro SD slot for
storing

385
00:23:08,749 --> 00:23:12,200
be FPGA bitstream F running connector

386
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,100
up the the USB 3.0

387
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,700
5 chip is a Texas Instruments to USB

388
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:23,070
1310 day this is one up to

389
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:27,999
SuperSpeed USB 3.0 chips that you can
run out and buy right now

390
00:23:27,999 --> 00:23:31,869
one is this Texas Instruments by and the
other

391
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:35,109
is a an arm microcontroller with

392
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:40,720
up built-in I with a built-in USB 3.0
device controller

393
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,980
from Cyprus and the Cypress Park is
quite expensive

394
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:49,519
we could have used it here we said hey
we can save some cost

395
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:53,909
and use the $5 chip and

396
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:59,119
write our own USB 3.0 device scored a
run on the FPGA to run this thing

397
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:02,409
and if we actually accomplish that

398
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:06,279
them pay we have the world's first open
source USB 3.0 device core

399
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:09,899
that we've just give to the world which
we think is worth doing

400
00:24:09,899 --> 00:24:13,019
so we're doing that and actually a

401
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:17,119
best marshalls job primarily he alright
we just started this project in January

402
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:18,269
he already has

403
00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:21,309
USB 2.0 device core

404
00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:25,269
working I as tested successfully every
single

405
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:29,730
I'll transfer type: for USB 2.0 new
starting on 3.0 now

406
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:32,950
so are back on a project is going well

407
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:36,039
you can I actually the

408
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:39,799
if you look if you have any experience
with these

409
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:43,460
transceiver ICS for us. me on

410
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,789
they the USB 2.0

411
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:50,090
interface that goes between a
transceiver

412
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:54,009
device controller is called you LP I and

413
00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:57,080
in with USB 3.0 just have

414
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,200
a whole one semester pins on to that but
it still retains you OPI for the

415
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,549
for the USB 2.0 functions so we now have
a you LP I

416
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:10,419
capable device controller a even if even
if

417
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:14,139
we work to make any further progress you
take what we have right now taking

418
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:15,519
officiating off-the-shelf

419
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:21,039
you OP Ivy my for a dollar and us to
come together and use our core

420
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:28,039
to implement USB 2.0 device to vote %uh
so this %uh

421
00:25:29,109 --> 00:25:32,239
on platform a its it's up there for us
at the moment

422
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:35,580
up we're at this photo of the up

423
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,649
of the manufactures website

424
00:25:38,649 --> 00:25:42,429
this house a slightly larger siphon for

425
00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:45,690
check on a I just give us a little bit
of wiggle room where

426
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:50,039
down development and so at the moment
with building from 10 votes for this

427
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:54,720
well with designing our own platform a
the same time just unable cycle sexless

428
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,659
to work on the project

429
00:25:55,659 --> 00:25:58,789
same time without having to wait for the
home what's on speed on

430
00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:02,099
insults life of a it's got light so I
wanna

431
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:06,070
we actually also for additional comes
calls that come with it

432
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:09,210
to play around with a so there's a USB

433
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,519
visit you'll be I there is hope your

434
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:15,830
on on the comp card and so we can we can
use either

435
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:20,029
USB to an end think about site both

436
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:23,759
so the moment we're building

437
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:27,039
up this front end modules the first is

438
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,879
everyone's favorite Lt RS 232 have a
board here

439
00:26:30,879 --> 00:26:35,820
just got far ribbon cable I ice Mike
said early hours to 32

440
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:40,230
was just a opportunity for us to ext arm
with a technology that when you

441
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:43,779
we want to have performance problems
with a we were gonna have

442
00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:47,859
on you know trouble understanding its
funny 19

443
00:26:47,859 --> 00:26:50,999
and it was a technology we thought we
could get devices for

444
00:26:50,999 --> 00:26:55,970
I and if any 1s for another stint with
you will know that

445
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:59,909
we were hoping to die talking to an old
I US Robotics

446
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:04,619
serum item Islands thing about US
robotics arm items is

447
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:07,789
must them a bill for everything came
within

448
00:27:07,789 --> 00:27:11,019
also switching power supply so a

449
00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:14,779
we play in my eyes are last night when
we put that to the table 2 votes

450
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:18,629
power Sutter we don't we are however

451
00:27:18,629 --> 00:27:22,019
my timing of but just to let you know at
all to hire

452
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:25,929
up yeah %uh so this has

453
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:29,399
a focal tana weekend montaña

454
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:32,869
to connections at a time today we
actually gonna use

455
00:27:32,869 --> 00:27:36,159
one such connections to monitor the
other because i dont have my

456
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,289
a USB port with me to be able to

457
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:42,879
tobacco tax reviews Bay I didn't have
time to write code for

458
00:27:42,879 --> 00:27:48,549
so a there's a complete connections so
there are there two connections for

459
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:52,369
connect a PC technicians connecting to
device

460
00:27:52,369 --> 00:27:55,970
DT is takes a tough equipment DC stator

461
00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:00,240
Communications Corp up and they just
that he's very similar parts

462
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,869
for the file life a and it's just today
with the direction you

463
00:28:03,869 --> 00:28:07,970
number paid someone has five transmit
and similar sparks a fence

464
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:11,980
son Seif of and in fact you'll see on
this diagram

465
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:17,190
week amass a little better up here there
is my hardrive jumper so you can just a

466
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:20,529
action straight through but we're
actually taking the data now take

467
00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:24,269
couple of I wouldn't pretty much the
same thing within the FPGA

468
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:28,059
its incredibly simple code its

469
00:28:28,059 --> 00:28:32,700
came on equals Pinto all the way down
the list site

470
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,679
didn't to me want to run I

471
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:40,080
this is the tactic front-end I

472
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,730
various only one of them and its

473
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:46,759
got a fault so it's still a colorado a

474
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:50,109
we action abroad in any way yeah did
weekend we can bring with us

475
00:28:50,109 --> 00:28:53,679
has a photo yeah so this is this is what
it looks like

476
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,179
a if you can see the folks then you can
have it I

477
00:28:58,179 --> 00:29:01,379
the it's got that too I

478
00:29:01,379 --> 00:29:05,039
micro I fight on that and

479
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,320
they speak I GM II which is the press Co

480
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,440
that they would only speak to the Mac
lie with against a

481
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,299
when you stop across this high-speed
passing back to

482
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:18,839
up to talk to get featured a and then

483
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:22,239
with we just gonna top flap that level
so that somewhere between

484
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:26,089
level 1&2 on it's it's not quite
physical a topping but its

485
00:29:26,089 --> 00:29:29,349
to disclose us right I

486
00:29:29,349 --> 00:29:32,450
ans will will take that back to the
house because

487
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:36,480
s like we're not doing anything about on
this page I we might as well get

488
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,679
as much data as possible but the highest
on the nice thing about something about

489
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:42,139
level again with this

490
00:29:42,139 --> 00:29:46,070
is the when you cum stain on middle you
can do things like flip it's in the

491
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:46,859
middle of it

492
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:53,859
and see what happens what you can do if
you're talking hola

493
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:58,320
%uh the next waterway designing at the
moment a scientist and I

494
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,119
front-end on now there on readily
available for pulse that

495
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:06,259
do what we want for HDMI so we're gonna

496
00:30:06,259 --> 00:30:09,499
Houston Eric sera session deceleration
ships

497
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:12,789
on and the ideas we will

498
00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:17,169
decentralize the the connection from
their Multiple has a pensive within

499
00:30:17,169 --> 00:30:20,690
acting like action possible to set us

500
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:24,419
into the FPGA and back after a tough one
I don't know why

501
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:28,720
up 340 megahertz we should be able to
support

502
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,369
all the existing resolutions I

503
00:30:32,369 --> 00:30:35,779
it 1.4 speck said last NT that's tight

504
00:30:35,779 --> 00:30:39,220
with the Jew images three-day also stuff

505
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:44,179
and their surprise Coast p only thing
the only feature we went build support

506
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:47,769
in HDMI 1.4 at the moment is

507
00:30:47,769 --> 00:30:52,249
if up now we are interested in
supporting it but the spec has not been

508
00:30:52,249 --> 00:30:52,820
released

509
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:56,789
so we have no idea how operates a
because we can't go to expect

510
00:30:56,789 --> 00:30:59,769
if the strike is released at some point
or for coping with just end up on my

511
00:30:59,769 --> 00:31:00,809
doorstep

512
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:03,869
then I don't see why we will support

513
00:31:03,869 --> 00:31:07,629
if we can score hire a video stuff
officially very similar

514
00:31:07,629 --> 00:31:10,940
a like the company thing technologically
yeah

515
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:14,490
and miss you know it's ok then surely we
might if they don't really suspect we

516
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,659
might have to just reverse

517
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:19,319
engineer offshore products but as far as
I know there's only one

518
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:23,069
product on the market that supports
giving over HDMI and it's like ten

519
00:31:23,069 --> 00:31:25,409
thousand dollars and there's nothing for
2.2

520
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:28,669
so probably not worth trying to do that

521
00:31:28,669 --> 00:31:32,200
yet right running up squarely on

522
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,899
trying like on the cutting edge of up or
just like behinds

523
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:40,269
on okay usb3 now

524
00:31:40,269 --> 00:31:43,569
at the conversation surrounding when
designing this board

525
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:47,179
was with ivory now an I send mike
adelson hey we should

526
00:31:47,179 --> 00:31:52,029
top using USB if they start going on
yeah let's let's do get a battle okay

527
00:31:52,029 --> 00:31:53,429
what we're talking about

528
00:31:53,429 --> 00:31:56,720
and we'll have to just before his back
or because all we should which a top

529
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,529
just be too at the same time then

530
00:31:58,529 --> 00:32:01,779
all when we talk sp3 and just got
escalated

531
00:32:01,779 --> 00:32:04,980
and I got a little out of hand and
that's how we end up with HDMI and USB

532
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,599
three modules

533
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:09,809
and its this is going to be based on
exact the same transceiver chip that we

534
00:32:09,809 --> 00:32:10,950
got on the main board

535
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:15,119
its TI paw and

536
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:18,539
those paying attention you as well
spotted to

537
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:21,909
this is comes with the same problem that
we're describing about tapping

538
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:25,399
connections earlier how can you tap I 5
gigabits

539
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:29,839
for jeep-like signal if you wanna go
five figures back to the house

540
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:33,359
and we completely understand

541
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:37,159
but that's a problem but we don't think
it's going to be a problem in reality

542
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:41,700
because I have yet to see any I just the
three devices that

543
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,460
use the Mac south of data connection
anyway

544
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,799
the only ones that are likely to do it
both directions a potentially hard

545
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:49,659
drives

546
00:32:49,659 --> 00:32:53,579
a I'm not sure on your face support
reading and writing

547
00:32:53,579 --> 00:32:57,169
full-speed fucking visit both directions
at the same time might be

548
00:32:57,169 --> 00:33:00,619
yeah because they're they're gonna be
more limited by be

549
00:33:00,619 --> 00:33:03,629
the actual hard disk itself yeah

550
00:33:03,629 --> 00:33:06,990
been my soul to take strike action in
the future but

551
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:11,220
but again mostly using a for inside

552
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,319
site so we're with Houston issues issues
I

553
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:17,559
we also think if anyone does that it's
gonna be busty

554
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:21,379
so we'll probably get tougher in the
round on the motherboard first

555
00:33:21,379 --> 00:33:24,749
I on the web host the South like an
excuse but up

556
00:33:24,749 --> 00:33:27,990
and then you know if that's not a
problem 10 Gigabit

557
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:31,240
just be three is just being an outsider
maybe in the future will

558
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,759
Malika ways to support a little
something about that for now

559
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:40,779
we think we think we have successfully
topmost fleiss connections

560
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:43,909
on thought should also

561
00:33:43,909 --> 00:33:47,220
on be week we on building at

562
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:50,779
I just be three double for this because
it turns out to have two years the three

563
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:51,490
fights

564
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:55,779
for class more points than any I messing
Excel

565
00:33:55,779 --> 00:33:59,139
step toward can support so we tried to
build one

566
00:33:59,139 --> 00:34:02,339
but there just weren't enough up pass
offense that we need to

567
00:34:02,339 --> 00:34:05,480
get that pipe practical across the
connector

568
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,000
so it's gonna save up for the fun in
front on final board

569
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,009
for we're hoping the time was the 21st
be doing with the other

570
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:16,429
for schools sire by

571
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:19,480
outside but actually says demonstration
up

572
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,440
is Dominics demonstration sound of
creation

573
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,770
yeah I company will come over this
before freak

574
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:30,040
terrible gak I so

575
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:33,669
just explain what's going on while Mike
saying this stuff up on

576
00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:37,250
we have 3 USB to cerro collectors

577
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:40,720
update just like this the USB to ours to
32

578
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,730
I adopt a we have three from plugged-in

579
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:47,389
to are linked back to back through

580
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:50,710
55 the top cover

581
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:55,579
are you doing wasn't a few if you just
go for the first time

582
00:34:55,579 --> 00:34:58,640
and just got to see that we're passing
back to back them forth between

583
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,790
or rusk right so

584
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:06,829
that's not working yet oh yes it has I
was track my focus was on the upper

585
00:35:06,829 --> 00:35:07,480
window

586
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,089
I'm but I typing tech came out on the
bottom yet

587
00:35:11,089 --> 00:35:14,690
the thing tomorrow with does not like a
lacquer yeah

588
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:18,740
no unfortunately or call ago some typing
in one

589
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,910
and the text appearing in the other
window and it's just going out

590
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:25,849
through it yeah that's right what's
happening a serial connection

591
00:35:25,849 --> 00:35:30,160
I'll so always housing for a7x nap a
plugin that happen for

592
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,299
on this that one this is another USB
serial connectors to know it yeah

593
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:38,049
and so now I should be able to type and
see that it appears

594
00:35:38,049 --> 00:35:41,460
him both the destination port and also

595
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:48,360
are tapping port

596
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:52,110
yeah thank you I think I might

597
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:55,290
my farewell first but technology yeah

598
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:58,320
a round of applause I yeah

599
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,230
now we're actually here because we're
using takes back alive a

600
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:06,370
I RS 232 where only using one connection

601
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:10,580
we would have two connections we have
destroyed tonight a up

602
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,650
we can only monitor week I need sign a
month so we can only

603
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:17,360
yet going on from one direction because
we suffer from the same problem

604
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,460
but ours to 32 is a full-duplex

605
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,580
communication technology and so
therefore we come on it's about

606
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,830
connections at same time

607
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:28,260
but their actions time talking with a
single topping pool up

608
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:31,680
I think the camps but that's right solo
per week didn't have time to write the

609
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,050
code

610
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:35,600
between destroying the power supply last
night and this morning site right and

611
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,360
all-terrain ultimately this is actually
kinda weird news case they

612
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,640
right that were not wasn't even our goal
in the first place we for some extra

613
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:48,090
ports on the RS 232 por just because
they were cheaper we had a room

614
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:53,920
I ultimately really only need two ports
on that board not for

615
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,070
and will be up you know passing

616
00:36:57,070 --> 00:37:00,760
this data back over that back and USB
connection

617
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,830
right not over to I'm yet another

618
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:10,830
RS 232 port for spots

619
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,500
so that the software that we're gonna
built for this I

620
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,609
felt the virus cause written for their

621
00:37:18,609 --> 00:37:22,750
PJ but the main one is that 5340 talked
about

622
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:26,319
and most other things will attempt to
get as much data back to the host is

623
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:28,849
possible that no point us implementing a

624
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:33,470
chip Mac lab thanks a lot within the
czech

625
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:37,020
because we want that dates back on the
highest so

626
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:41,279
a we will have the talk shows just to
hand over USB transfer

627
00:37:41,279 --> 00:37:44,309
us poll data back and then in general
almost

628
00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:48,210
everything we can attempt to get it to
wash ok I I think that works from most

629
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:50,319
to the town which were looking at I

630
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:55,299
a a you wash up to

631
00:37:55,299 --> 00:37:59,220
to analyze the data I you cannot plugins
up the washer ok

632
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:02,890
to process that various things that
fiske 11 90

633
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:06,430
currently be supported by wash Oct what
we doing enough for technologies we're

634
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:09,369
looking at we're also working with the

635
00:38:09,369 --> 00:38:12,650
washout thing to extend wash off to
enable it to

636
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:15,859
safe using different up

637
00:38:15,859 --> 00:38:19,309
hardware so the idea is the way changing
capabilities

638
00:38:19,309 --> 00:38:23,079
what the whitewash ACH accesses hardware
to dump data

639
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:26,369
so that it will support I Shire said it
was for

640
00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:30,839
on waiting for take as well site the
washer does work

641
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:34,279
and

642
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:37,630
in the future we hope to support more

643
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:41,039
target technologies in particular we're
very interested in high-speed

644
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:42,299
communication me

645
00:38:42,299 --> 00:38:45,880
because those are the things that we
have had good tools to work with in the

646
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,490
past

647
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:51,220
up DisplayPort is interesting to us TV I
say to

648
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:54,240
I down to get this idea earlier today
that

649
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,460
we should be able to just make phone tap
and not just any phone tap but one that

650
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,529
can capture both

651
00:38:59,529 --> 00:39:03,789
audio and things like DSL that would be
way cool

652
00:39:03,789 --> 00:39:07,490
%uh and really anything

653
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:11,380
that any communication technology that
weekend

654
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:15,470
find a way to air base where I we think
it would be worth

655
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:19,760
making a front-end module for the long
run up

656
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,020
we're also hoping to see some
third-party modules

657
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:27,490
a it's really easy to design a board
that has the connector

658
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,920
to connect to it I show mainboard and so
that gives you

659
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:36,549
%uh FPGA any use USB 3.0 SuperSpeed
connection to host computer

660
00:39:36,549 --> 00:39:39,660
what can you do with USB 3.0 an FPGA

661
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:42,720
up we think this is a really cool thing

662
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:47,779
there are some other open source
hardware FPGA platforms out there

663
00:39:47,779 --> 00:39:53,240
but none of them have USB 3.0 and if
you're going to have a device like an

664
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,740
FPGA that can

665
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:59,910
handle very high data rates of wanna
have a high esteem

666
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:04,380
connection outta and I think possibly K
third

667
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:07,890
wish they'd like doesn't have to be a
tap foreign film like a few any kind of

668
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:08,440
bio

669
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:14,230
sorry I on a bill some kind of camera
roll something that needs huge mounds

670
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:18,720
data back to the house now we've got a
lot of bands amicably sp3 connection

671
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,770
it's right for small amount of our love
to get your dates when to go

672
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:25,700
I system something that's pretty
straightforward I'm not a big deal

673
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:30,400
I'm and you know many people make a new
die so many boards to

674
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,510
I don't know but debut

675
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:37,150
the designs out there it's all open
source hardware Open Source offers you

676
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,220
can do whatever you want with it

677
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:42,750
ultimately we would like to pursue maybe
some wideband suffer defined radio

678
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:46,890
friends for this platform it's a pretty
well so the platform for that

679
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:50,309
this picture is nothing really to do it
I show this is my car

680
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:54,270
project that summer you guys know about
I'm China bill

681
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:58,420
with the actor a project I'm trying to
build all very general purpose

682
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,640
low-cost suffered five radio platform

683
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:07,130
I'll its USB 2.0 not USB 3.0 and perhaps
a wrap on trying to get

684
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:10,299
the most outta USB 2.0 that I can

685
00:41:10,299 --> 00:41:14,020
up but down the road %uh

686
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:18,289
building up on the day show platform we
should be able to build fun and modules

687
00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:20,270
that get the most out of USB

688
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:24,210
3.0 which could be really really cool
like what other things

689
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:27,710
actually dominic and I met because we
were both

690
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:31,720
trying to %uh develop ways to monitor
Bluetooth

691
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:36,029
and one of the first things we worked on
was how can we use of a defined radio to

692
00:41:36,029 --> 00:41:38,960
monitor all seventy-nine were two
channels simultaneously

693
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,359
and we came up with got a good way to do
that

694
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:46,599
but now this may be finally the
opportunity where we can do it the right

695
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:47,109
way

696
00:41:47,109 --> 00:41:51,890
and just suckin the entire 2.4 gigahertz
I SM band

697
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:56,880
I from an Internet through USB 3.0
connection to host computer

698
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,609
and mater all of it we better be really
cool

699
00:42:00,609 --> 00:42:05,619
upside a couple of banks this project

700
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:09,089
is supported by the Darbar cyber fast
track program

701
00:42:09,089 --> 00:42:13,170
and hopefully some you guys have heard
of this CFT program

702
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:17,140
its up very a interesting

703
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:21,069
program from darpa the defense in
Advanced Research Projects Agency

704
00:42:21,069 --> 00:42:26,589
United States to fund work with in the
information security community

705
00:42:26,589 --> 00:42:30,960
and I want to point out that II multiple
projects funded

706
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:36,250
by CFT I its really bad a pleasure for
me

707
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:40,270
to be able to participate in that
program get project of mine but I've

708
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:43,220
wanted to do for a long time but I
haven't had a

709
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:46,690
the resources to be able to pursue them
%uh

710
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:50,759
CFT is enabled me to do that and there
are a couple of weeks left

711
00:42:50,759 --> 00:42:54,130
April 1st is the deadline to get
proposals and

712
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:58,440
if you have an idea if you have some
project you've wanted to do that sir

713
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,180
information security related research
project that

714
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,349
I you could use some funding for them

715
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:09,220
getting a proposal want something a lot
of people don't know about CFT

716
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:13,349
is that you do not have to be a United
States citizen or resident

717
00:43:13,349 --> 00:43:16,380
to submit a proposal so

718
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:20,910
first time ever this is one of the
really cool things about this program so

719
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:23,950
if you have a idea if if

720
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:27,390
if this may be peaks your interest and

721
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:31,640
and you need any help or advice with
submitting a proposal

722
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,770
come talk to me this week I because I've
been through it

723
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:39,160
and i cant I can help you out also
thanks to a bit systems

724
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:42,630
for their help with the server fast
track program

725
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:46,240
they've been really great to work with
be

726
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,900
information about our show a ultimately
I hope to

727
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:54,289
you make these things and sell them
congress guy gadgets Dakar

728
00:43:54,289 --> 00:43:58,329
I'll but right now you won't find any
information about a show there because

729
00:43:58,329 --> 00:44:00,920
this pro this project is in its infancy

730
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,210
mostly the information that we have
available is

731
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:08,220
are get home are repository

732
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:12,420
everything we're doing as I get her and
mostly the developer talk about it and

733
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,259
the daschle channel on freenode

734
00:44:14,259 --> 00:44:18,410
so get home in IRC I'll we bout to

735
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:21,619
and I'll see more people come hang out
ask questions

736
00:44:21,619 --> 00:44:24,730
up Dominic I will be here the rest in
the car

737
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:29,559
and we hope that if any you have I am
just in this project to ensure a lot to

738
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:30,339
talk to you

739
00:44:30,339 --> 00:44:34,029
yeah I'm gonna point out Benjamin again

740
00:44:34,029 --> 00:44:37,230
you're a Benjamin is one of our
developers

741
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:40,589
%uh who was kind enough to make the trip
from France so that we could actually

742
00:44:40,589 --> 00:44:44,099
meet him in person for the first time

743
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:48,319
and he actually the way he got involved
in a project was

744
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:51,930
he just showed up in the Acura fires
each out one day last year

745
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:56,430
and started writing code %uh had a like
wow that's great

746
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:59,900
I would you like to help with this other
project up

747
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,990
so up thanks to troopers and I

748
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:08,059
think we have maybe a few minutes for
some questions if there are any

749
00:45:08,059 --> 00:45:15,059
if there are any

750
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,260
it

751
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,480
sex a you've been talking about these
people actually a

752
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:27,750
what about PCI Express going on said the
bold we had a discussion about 50 last

753
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:28,280
night we

754
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,470
we did thunderbolt is interesting on

755
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:34,950
no one problem with Thunderbolt is that

756
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:38,650
it has up I

757
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:42,070
you can't buy a chip ford of its

758
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:45,349
its only implemented by

759
00:45:45,349 --> 00:45:49,430
a by Intel and II

760
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:52,970
don't think there's any hope of buying
small quantities for research

761
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:56,550
development %uh you know we're not gonna
buy a million of them were probably not

762
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:57,540
going to get any

763
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:00,770
up I only aim way and also its its

764
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:04,890
about twice as fast as USB 3.0 and

765
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:08,770
the only way we could use like that the
technique were using to

766
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:12,570
to interface with HDMI is to use a
generic served as

767
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:15,840
chip which is a little different than
most people do

768
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:21,130
on but there are no generic served as I
sees that I know of that go fast enough

769
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:24,200
to to implement fund herbal the only

770
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:29,220
generic sir does implementations that I
know of that go that fast or faster

771
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:32,960
are on high and FPGA is which require

772
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,670
tools development tools that cost money
so

773
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:39,770
which we're trying to avoid so up

774
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:43,780
ultimately we may at all and even if we
did support it

775
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:47,080
I'll we have this big bottle neck or
China run

776
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:50,349
day over USB 3 that was carried on
Thunderball

777
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:54,910
so there are a lot of drawbacks or us
the roadblocks to

778
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:58,970
implementing wonderful and its we've
also got a big lester

779
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:01,980
technologies where where interested in
and it is

780
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:06,970
on the list up given the amount of
contact to attempt when all of us the

781
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:07,730
landscaper

782
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:11,599
a so verification technologies
connecting but heists

783
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:15,690
and its the polls on various artists it
from the gonna change over time so

784
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:18,359
fumbles on my pass on the next
generation of laptops

785
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:22,400
is that for the next few years and maybe
down the right that the future show

786
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:22,960
which

787
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,960
you stumble as its update about Cole

788
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,119
and maybe support said but right we
don't

789
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:33,099
we don't have access into the technology
to support it and as a tonic

790
00:47:33,099 --> 00:47:36,680
mentioned earlier the the next
generation USB

791
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:40,599
has already been announced which is I 10
Gigabit

792
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:44,250
I it's basically double super speed up

793
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:49,420
it doesn't exist yet by its I assuming
that does come out a couple years

794
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:53,720
we may develop you know like the next
generation daschle platform based on

795
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:54,300
that

796
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:58,470
and maybe at that time you will be more
practical implement wonderful

797
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:01,960
also if we're lucky sp3 tickets will go
from Google

798
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:06,930
when or I any other questions

799
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:10,349
alright

800
00:48:10,349 --> 00:48:15,730
thank you everybody thank you very much
first sight out

801
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:19,160
I'll actually it wasn't who cites
question always

802
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:23,020
since some the bottom that speed PCI
Express 26 persist

803
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:27,220
certainly more doable and you only want
some more Eaton said of something like

804
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:30,589
aids have to text so ago

805
00:48:30,589 --> 00:48:34,280
what about the sizing these parties in
this to is quite interesting actually

806
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,210
intel also

807
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:39,500
hybrids a devices and the ball on top of
that tax was at the emmy

808
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:43,869
yes missus definitely an area of
interest for us sorry I forgot to

809
00:48:43,869 --> 00:48:46,670
mention PCI Express %uh in your original
question

810
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:51,440
I on I I think that there is some
potential there

811
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:56,280
and I'll thunderbolt in particular has
its problems but

812
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,400
but PCI Express is with in the realm of
possibility

813
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,730
about supporting we don't have plans for
fun and module today

814
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:07,770
but it is an edge an area that we're
interested in

815
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:12,040
we would like to work on front-end
modules for and we're very interested

816
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,390
and up being able to support

817
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:18,800
Matt just in line monitoring but

818
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,150
I like you mentioned emad attacks over
PCI

819
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:25,730
up express that kinda stuff I'll

820
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:29,130
we think is really important that we we
hope our project will enable

821
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:32,599
longer on this there's nothing stop
someone else

822
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:36,540
an interested party working on a up a
front end even if we don't have the

823
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,960
capacity to the sudden moment

824
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:42,260
now to wait until they remain what I
double for sunny

825
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:46,440
it's a life in which people willing to
help he was interested in looking at

826
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,390
other technologies

827
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:51,710
FL definitely are

828
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:54,470
okay so Mike Dominick said robots
