1
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,980
Michael I got 11

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,160
just left my slow

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,240
close for yeah

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,220
05 places ok technology and I will 30

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,939
show was official second folded Club of
list of arrests

6
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,900
the just whole almost what's

7
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,050
flesh and how we start using it a

8
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:36,640
special for many many years so we're it
use it to a magnetic

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,400
a recording for most of types of data
will store

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,590
should also know that more than 100
years ago i download still use a

11
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,390
every day a lot of hard drive still in
use

12
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,210
a and the June pure soap for using
mileage record or so

13
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,980
dress become smaller and smaller but to
even

14
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:03,289
is a become a small it's only speech or
a its Israel drive produced in 2005

15
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:08,270
love the technology it I'll almost the
same like 100 year ago

16
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,530
I'll the same general principles 0

17
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,690
when you look deal with my collegiate
record or you could modify any piece of

18
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:17,500
data

19
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,270
almost independently from each other
soul while

20
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,110
usually disc is divided among multiple
sectors but it's %uh

21
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,459
just for synchronization for easily
access Inc

22
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:32,580
the precise accessing data physically we
could address

23
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,610
anything any peace %um here also any
sequence so

24
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:42,330
you could modify data as we lack and up
for many years of use a show of magnetic

25
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:46,190
good recording devices so industry

26
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,630
%uh studied fell to properly work with
them

27
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:53,690
and the how to handle sensitive data
that stored on magnetic dry ice and fell

28
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,950
to destroy the data and their outdated

29
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,300
raisers Thundercats exists the

30
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,250
allows people make sure that they that
date and that well

31
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:08,239
would be able to read by buy anything
else actually not many people I'll

32
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,140
use that standard slow ways they need to
delete delete data items are a major

33
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,310
search about those up to follow

34
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:19,820
published already but up several years
ago wolf

35
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,890
im actual in 1948 new technology

36
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,730
came to a life full flesh it will see
invented by

37
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,770
some Japanese get good belief and the

38
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,660
in love 1988 and 1989 two companies

39
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,750
produced so force saw a commercial
samples that were available

40
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,180
for public up so more

41
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,170
Res lows this principle hands they have
two types of

42
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,660
my Maria up and or and am and

43
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,850
their bill base it on doula different
types of logical elements

44
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:59,200
not or not and about to actual is or not
to a big difference between

45
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,280
them well in low in the view of my
presentation %uh flesh torches

46
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,140
electronic device so no moving parts not
parts no mechanics

47
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,340
unknown making it feel to move and the

48
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,569
its the store electric

49
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:20,750
a of charge somehow points

50
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,300
its complex you think I'd I really don't
understand how it works

51
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,660
up love I studies electronics for short
time but

52
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,319
not enough and the modem technologist
save that

53
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,580
data stored in flash memory be available
for reading

54
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,319
the at least then euros and some sample
sale

55
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,240
allows you to read data up two hundred
years of two evils

56
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,480
return inside the flesh and the

57
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,040
searle warts bolt this theory how well

58
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,590
what was the proper tools if less how it
to actually war

59
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,370
its a very different from

60
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:03,400
magnetic drive from government to crack
or yes we could write

61
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,530
any beats independently soul

62
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:10,750
I'll be good modify any piece of data
independent of each other

63
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,849
was one exception re you do

64
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:17,049
erase data dip up before we hear

65
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:20,590
but you're right so so it is no

66
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,449
just modify Inc up 021 all 120

67
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:28,270
we could easily modify it any one beach
20

68
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:33,230
but 20 brittle back do one state we need
to perform a race

69
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,290
and a race perform not therapy

70
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:40,830
not survive by don't block and local
usually several kilobytes

71
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:45,530
sold to erase single beat you read data
from

72
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,970
all also beats from the whole block
arrays that look

73
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,750
and right all youths back so it's not
worry

74
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,750
good idea to look to form such low
operation

75
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:01,810
soul of a some optimization algorithms
involved and I will love to talk about

76
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,169
that a little bit later

77
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:07,970
and another up big difference low of
less memory

78
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,130
in looking for racial reasons the
magnetic drive

79
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:16,470
is limited number of array cycles I was
much needed rescue August modern

80
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,530
good schools high quality magnetic drive
see you good

81
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:24,770
right to the the same sector or vote to
a huge amount of times

82
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,510
and it's still more so fine soul you
will have

83
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,470
no problem with up reading or writing
data to

84
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,790
does that sector with list of your
limited tool

85
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:41,110
small number of erase cycles their blog
so what you looking to raise a

86
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,430
for example for all that's less than
1000 times

87
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,720
you deliver a below

88
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,880
to get all once all all love us

89
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,070
beats I'll sit in one state after I so
love

90
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:59,500
loco consider to be a bad I'm it should
be excluded from later use

91
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,760
%uh Gupta up devices so look good types
of less

92
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,310
the increase the number of cycles to me
know

93
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:11,280
%uh but the actually oh well operating
system

94
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,040
follow like Greenville so work with file
system while

95
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,410
it's slower alright some sectors were
y'all home for example love and you

96
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:26,030
I'll access to some dark story to any
file the doctor you need to update data

97
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,750
about last access time

98
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,440
so a every access code leaked to

99
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,960
write cycle and probably two or a cycle

100
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,270
solo up to

101
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,389
the this problem while makes

102
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:45,490
the musical less completely different

103
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:49,449
love from hunter a point of view

104
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:52,880
place when we're usually divided the
inlet several

105
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,500
banks %uh physical Chiefs and the every
cheap for a healthful multiple blocks

106
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,540
inside it

107
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,550
and every bloke if multiple page for

108
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,370
eases 0 for use a show pays usually
divided

109
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,660
in two parts data for to reach should
represent

110
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,800
user data and so-called spare part

111
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,229
that could be used for storing some
additional information that is necessary

112
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:18,880
for properly can link

113
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,979
%ah everything that happens so his flesh

114
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:27,310
and usually is there are three types of
data could bury two meals for a right

115
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:31,610
it's slow information that some pages
also hold local

116
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,220
already broken so it's could not be
array that anymore

117
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:40,490
up also other could be information about
ever her reaction some types of less

118
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:44,340
use error correction for norinko for
example 1b

119
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,699
for the rice error so if you have all
the while

120
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:53,449
R&B in the page you could still use this
page using color correction algorithms

121
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:58,850
and the sure I'll this the spirit area
could be used for holding

122
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:03,280
the physical the logical my pink
information because so

123
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,039
up there are some might think lehrer up

124
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,990
do you do a physical properties of less
so because we can't

125
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:16,660
rights to all the things that after
every time we need to modify

126
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,310
handle shooter no girl real little Inc

127
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,310
algorithm sconce %uh that elderly khalsa

128
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,639
Z ain't still

129
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:30,940
make ever rich little Inc ever reach

130
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,649
rear end of the whole less on the same
level so

131
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:37,889
every page cole slaw seles you

132
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:42,139
you DL conditions should be raised equal
number of times

133
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:46,179
doesn't matter up reach logical place
you are trying still

134
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:49,619
successful writing the ever reach
numbers

135
00:08:49,619 --> 00:08:53,170
or I cycles should be evenly distributed
over the whole

136
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:56,779
less and if you are achieved that goal

137
00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:00,179
I'll slipped less real I'll serve you

138
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:06,279
as long as possible you fuel up make
this algorithm small primitive falwell

139
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,490
flesh we'll be here destroy it by rising

140
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,470
so

141
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:15,160
much sooner so love this algorithm so
it's

142
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,570
dynamic process when your flesh you the

143
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,230
connected to flash controller something
happens inside the flesh

144
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,470
so love up its trying to optimize

145
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:31,130
so each page 2 a race to be spaced or a
map

146
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:36,110
and the algorithms usually very
complicated to its default by if less

147
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,080
manufacturing company companies

148
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,410
and the usually a it's not public
because there are several public

149
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,250
implementations for relabel income
treatments but

150
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,250
so nobody we shall there it's exactly is
used by into for example

151
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,810
its kind of trade secret and a subtle
worthwhile

152
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,880
logical check 360 flesh device

153
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,860
%uh was there are two types of devices
love just type

154
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,260
is so usual USB flash drives that
connected to USB port

155
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:10,630
it's so so let's play drive it starts
that's the sort to you for the camera

156
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,350
%uh mostly is there a trying to preserve

157
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:18,910
to you of up view jewel hard rights so
what you have for

158
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,200
logical access by sector

159
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,520
level so %uh you need to New only

160
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,850
number of separate unit you want to or
read or write

161
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:33,750
all every single minute think it's is
performing inside the device inside the

162
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,980
flesh cart on site use be drive

163
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,220
very special controllers: a a response

164
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,920
all those responsible for doing such
operations and from user points-of-view

165
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,770
its all inside device 40

166
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,840
solid state drives a people

167
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,960
decided that the up its

168
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,500
good idea to say dual controller let
some pages not to use it

169
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,100
anymore of love because slow file was
deleted from the filesystem

170
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,350
soul up if you're or put up a rating
system

171
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,680
that overall few simple solid state
drive the end you call don't involve

172
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,470
Coldstream call much

173
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:19,030
when you erase some file the serological
sectors that belongs to that files

174
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:24,410
owner is no not use it I'll for sure you
could write some data to eat

175
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,960
but actually from the view of filesystem
sup sector is

176
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,290
empties there is nothing usable inside
the and

177
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,570
file system driver report still flash
controller

178
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,540
lip wage logical place with some number
is not use it

179
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,520
anymore and trust in throat controller
remember this information

180
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,640
and after that when he drank two read
this page

181
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,850
by its logical lumber controller

182
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:52,380
or report all zeros or just

183
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,080
reports there is no such sets are
available so

184
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,670
it seems that for a forensic point of
view for extracting data

185
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:05,020
%uh you look technology into a plastic
knowles a dream poland

186
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,320
allows you to look to raise data such
ways that

187
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:15,100
its impossible to read another type of
lossless devices

188
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,230
embedded devices I'll very slow

189
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,540
mine borked wrong I believe iPhone 4s

190
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,510
so up during development all that

191
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:29,800
the title devices the manufacturing

192
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,570
companies was the already Newell said
the real deal is flesh

193
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:38,360
and a usually is a note to a embed

194
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,020
additional this controller or that so
handle like control inside your flash

195
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,220
drive fall

196
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,530
of les cartes full for the camera the

197
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:51,700
you some interface from central
processor to flash memory

198
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:56,380
and handle all your little Inc El
toritos

199
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,280
and all the stuff that's related to his
my pink between the

200
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,330
logical to physical pages they can
delete

201
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:07,400
inside the software inside the field
where the Tron on that device

202
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,070
and the using ca that knowledge that
you're working for a split

203
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:15,230
flesh it's much easier to optimize use
the show

204
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,440
less memory it and the force

205
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,530
eat dil work longer a and the reduced
number of array cycles ansel

206
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:27,959
this

207
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:31,190
little bit the logical and physical
pages

208
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:35,630
between number of senator and number
physical page swear this sector is

209
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,520
stored

210
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,870
right now it's called list translation
layer

211
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:44,800
and I'll when you look to

212
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,050
on your device a for example iPhone

213
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,990
its read that information about me think
for a lot less

214
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:56,010
hold it in memory during all low
operation time

215
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:59,150
and the perform last night in Co

216
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:03,570
for any request that sector you you want
to read for from the flesh

217
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,070
but you to read of all current might
think

218
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:11,339
story in place a game in some new
patient flesh

219
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:14,339
and the currently closed

220
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:19,380
if you do 200 for your device physically
for example by disconnecting cuz battery

221
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,750
%uh information about my pink youths

222
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,560
not complete solar you will Anita up

223
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,670
additional time when you doing on the
device before operating system loaded

224
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:36,660
to collect information about proper
meetings are at such a late Middle

225
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,060
East's inside the film were usually

226
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,250
up to represents less integral

227
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,970
device was out result errol's in making

228
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,970
and the using flash translation layer up

229
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,150
its a possible tool trip report still

230
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,320
less control a result some patients not
to use its sole some

231
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:04,320
dream called so lots of logical page
number albeit not let the turtle

232
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:09,220
and the central Warsaw both whilst

233
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:14,180
happen when you were out trying to 25
some data

234
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:18,180
old racial standards for migrating Drive
se

235
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,360
the cook usually fades that to

236
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,110
raised thirty they turn up on some
sector you need to

237
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,990
overrated multiple times missile love
templates

238
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:33,030
slowly all some random data in so long
what's happened well you'll just

239
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:37,270
other writing some logical sector of
less stress

240
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,910
actually it as I said earlier I you
can't alright

241
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:45,959
on the same page because %uh tool
modified date all that base you need to

242
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:47,540
erase whole block

243
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,320
but the bloke you I'll hold some also
usable information

244
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,620
and though it you need to or a map that
information to sell

245
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:59,430
also play just or you could just not
remove information right now

246
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:04,079
you could just a lucky to a mule page
that not use it

247
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,530
for yet and change making soul

248
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:11,680
the same logical lumber will map to
other physical page

249
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,030
so do think first so I'll writing for
some sex or

250
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:20,079
for the ample physical place number one
was use it for storing the data

251
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,300
after you're right a game new page with

252
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,650
almost random number a number is the

253
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:31,260
defined by a place to place a layer by
viewing pleasure below the real

254
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:35,589
level in Calgary dance you patients
choose a and now my pink

255
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:40,150
point for all that logical from the same
logical place to absolutely different

256
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:46,190
physical page but Brilz notion of data
that will store it off last

257
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:49,250
it's not to raise it its probably

258
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,980
in the future it would be reserved by
garbage collection algorithms

259
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:58,150
all by remapping tell the Eagles if you
have lots of free space and need to use

260
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,660
a

261
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:02,579
race-based a game and I'll

262
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:06,179
actually you in most cases you can't
predict

263
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:09,230
when it happened so %uh you up

264
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:13,070
have no postrel all a how to force

265
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:17,079
the flesh controller to erased some
specific physical page

266
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:24,079
that in in in little in impost campaigns
so sensitive data you want to race

267
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,560
and the actually do I start

268
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,780
was thinking about less so during
concerts on

269
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:35,110
Isles a curtain alarm what's happened
inside it

270
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:39,200
and the its slow most agree with those
up

271
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,720
selfless translation layer on Isles
devices implemented

272
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,280
you in the field where so the if you're

273
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,600
knew how to look inside the Apple silver
and its

274
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,440
not big secrets are many open source
project to this on the subjects

275
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,620
Sola you have chance still see

276
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,840
walls elderly cancer are use it to the

277
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:07,060
this flesh and the you put try to figure
out how the war

278
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,070
and the 4i iPhone

279
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:13,340
for example and other Isles devices so
I'll

280
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,730
spirit data of every play space contains

281
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:20,470
actually do significant to our values

282
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:25,310
just the value is logical page number
soul is the number of logical page

283
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:28,730
is that maps to these physical page and

284
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:32,480
another a number at use the update
sequence number

285
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,620
soul when you're right in flesh for the
next time

286
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:40,640
any page this number is increasing by
while

287
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,940
its slow this is through for

288
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:48,380
I form for a CDMA modem it deals so some

289
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,649
up youth recently

290
00:18:51,649 --> 00:18:55,990
inventor 200 I don't know how to say
ordered by EPL

291
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:00,149
a blessed i've called bpm perfect
Beijing you

292
00:19:00,149 --> 00:19:04,010
so a its look kind of less typeset

293
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:08,919
bronte said there will be at No us
physically a broken pages

294
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:12,610
I don't know how well the to achieve
that but

295
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:15,830
up there are no but pages on that flesh
from

296
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:20,330
the point of love you for a lot less
control

297
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:23,840
so up when you look pale information to
both

298
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,470
logical page number and the about
sequence update number you could just

299
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:32,190
built lip Inc for any logical

300
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:36,520
page to multiple physical pages in
cortex order so

301
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,590
you could find multiple States of this

302
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:45,080
of some logical page and the facial be
ordered in time

303
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,980
and I believe it's it's very big
achievement

304
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,850
love for a whole point of view for rent
for forensic point of view

305
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:56,250
when you look could find how old this
file

306
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,850
lost change it during time you could
gift additional information

307
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:05,740
of unfortunately not every peach story
in multiple states

308
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:09,960
and some pages r us toward him single
the state last while

309
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,560
because prevails look what this was a
raise that we'll the

310
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,770
up a garbage collection or email pic

311
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:22,570
%uh but anyway you could build the
history and sometimes

312
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:27,980
and the several more sabol how to access
of less controller at the lowest level

313
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,520
up for sure our operating system have
that success

314
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,280
and Carmel half wait to read the
Comptroller

315
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:41,149
and the is there a up a colonel service
available inside the I also the

316
00:20:41,149 --> 00:20:46,010
to a responsible for dealing quiz
user-level applications

317
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:51,050
that allow stool Rizza and right page us
on the flesh

318
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:55,090
and I'll the so I'll

319
00:20:55,090 --> 00:21:00,010
level also was flown to in low I also he
and I also

320
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,540
4 but in all five Apple decided

321
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:07,520
2003 so people who want to use it

322
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:13,169
and as a just remove read support for
read and write requests souls

323
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:18,750
the us carol service still exists a a
tear for external metal so you could

324
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,210
call it but you call it

325
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:24,210
you could call it for obtaining class
Jorma tree you would find

326
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:28,710
was a number of plants number of pages
so the number of bytes a

327
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:32,570
you love up spirit area and so on

328
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:36,000
but you're unable to reads up pages

329
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,540
but the Azera at least to waive the
skull to bypass this limitation

330
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:45,200
a filth lol wat you still owe your
customized with Cornell

331
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,560
from previous morsel of love I also for
example aisles for

332
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,649
up bro you will have some problem we've
flown

333
00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:56,130
filesystem at logical level because
there are some

334
00:21:56,130 --> 00:22:00,760
improvements in Niles fife and I'll 60
related photo aisles for

335
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,960
but you will have the same level of
access the flesh

336
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,860
so you could just read data using hold
yourself operating system

337
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:13,350
and another approach you could just
modify colonel in memory

338
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:17,390
till force it to a already implemented
as a

339
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:20,909
read capability and after that again you
will be able to

340
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:24,080
read the data and the in love

341
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,470
around the school a distributed result

342
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:31,540
I also for more updates file so I PSV

343
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:36,200
a in some other sulser art glance I
publication is this clan

344
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,059
the not into computer and the

345
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:42,100
mobile phone but in Torrance caramel and
user

346
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,100
in in use or you have little
applications that

347
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,260
issues so request still

348
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:52,140
external metal to of layoff less control
or use our client

349
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:56,270
and reads data so you could find samples
how to how to do it I'll to work with

350
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,050
the sorts

351
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:00,070
and the

352
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:04,220
this technique a Los love people to look

353
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,990
Gipson content of less for a long while
all too well

354
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:11,980
a four devices the its slow although

355
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,110
I falls for o2 iPhone 40 I am

356
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:18,460
the first iPad and felt for generations
of people

357
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:24,910
%uh so low it's so you'll to a although
sellable clothes allows you to look

358
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:27,020
custom kernel and the

359
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,140
run an application like soul who are you
have

360
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:33,330
ability to get access to the stifles
over the phone

361
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,830
if you will jailbroken jolt device or

362
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:40,800
owner of the device jailbroken a game
you have

363
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,230
for the chance to modify colonel in my
memory

364
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:47,440
and the a again you could

365
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,760
are you old data from the flesh so but

366
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,070
sometimes you have problem because its
conflict with running

367
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:58,450
operating system and adjustable the full
sole you need to try

368
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:02,280
how to a code to force it war and the

369
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,700
for sure a if your Apple or half

370
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,110
good relationship with Apple for example
you are US government

371
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:13,270
I you could to ask able to sign you're
on these comps and

372
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:18,370
lost your Corolla and the around your
programs that will allows you to

373
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:25,250
read the whole doubles the flesh its
slow process for 64 gigabytes son

374
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:29,460
so devices it takes made 256

375
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,560
our first to read as a whole less but

376
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,720
for its could be da remover you need
just computer and

377
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,180
cable for iPhone and/or

378
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:44,750
up several more Tsubo how foreign stick
it to forensic if the

379
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:48,330
part of for criminal it criminalistics
so that

380
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:51,460
%uh search for proofs for the court

381
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:56,720
soul I'll 0 up general approach 404 s
exists

382
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,090
extract s many evidence thus s possible

383
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:04,240
was ok what defines us or sums evidence
unfortunately

384
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,600
a it's not to forensic a because

385
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,830
when you do that on your phone even
result loading operating system

386
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:15,770
flash controller starts walking and some
pre-made think

387
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:20,950
already called Akure so you could stop
this process actually orkut

388
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:25,360
up opens the device look on soldiers
that the flesh cheap

389
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,560
but in this case a you'll also

390
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,650
you will need to North Face another
problem was

391
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:37,770
all Motorola mobile so files devices so
use cover basic food groups in an all

392
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,500
day to start of flesh is aggrieved

393
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,880
so you could get data but all of the
data will be greeted

394
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,480
and you need to get some groups and keep
and that he is

395
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,310
embedded in process server so you
couldn't reads a key/value you could

396
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:51,780
just

397
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:56,060
run cold on processes up to outperform
operation was that the keys so

398
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:00,580
up early for you with us older the flesh
so you will not succeed

399
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:04,200
anyway but I'll

400
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,370
when you ought therefore reading of the
same device

401
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:11,260
twice you will get different results not
completely different spot

402
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:15,560
multiple pages would be rhamat between a

403
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,680
to let them sell free the date and

404
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:25,220
the main question though youth Vera
secure a way to a raise your date the

405
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:28,550
from the flesh on on such type of device

406
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:31,640
and dorsally for me I still have no

407
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,240
right and sore a not I'm not sure

408
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,690
s AC from the elderly to slurp

409
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:43,040
the more you'll drive its feel to it was
date the souls

410
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:48,230
the less amount of free space the first
or are they to a real return

411
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:51,390
to look a with raisins the whole block

412
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:55,590
but for example real slow some while

413
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:59,980
iPhone 4 the was just use a foot they
stink

414
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:04,940
I find 40 different Korpi solves the

415
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:08,870
a partition map also love the Phil
sector of the file

416
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:13,530
that now belongs to file systems that
false information about the

417
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:19,020
reach parts of flash storage are belongs
to reach logical logical partitions

418
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:25,960
and the I'm not by analyzing that 400
versions so I could for growth

419
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:32,150
I'll what may pink of law space also use
it to do you think I'm still a shelves

420
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,680
operating system so

421
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,740
you could just follow the logic over the
installer

422
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:40,200
just play it by seeing for different for
some because

423
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,280
a lot of free pay just left on the
device and there was no need to order it

424
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,050
rides I'll

425
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:49,180
up early you news that

426
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:52,760
lol modern mobile devices have ability
to load

427
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,910
remotely wipe all data and the

428
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:59,180
they did not by wiping every place on
flesh

429
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:02,180
say why pink only one significant part
of

430
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:06,050
that is encryption key it's a a randomly
generated when installing the operating

431
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,070
system

432
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:10,500
and after you raise it you will be
unable to read all data

433
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,720
and to avoid 20 such situation lamb

434
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,490
up by raisin key you actually not to
move to throw flesh

435
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:21,530
poll up my up some part of flesh

436
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:25,020
to special area called if a simple
storage

437
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:30,330
its motha are controlled by general
algorithms all three or leave a link

438
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:33,940
leveling it's the Campbell in other way

439
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:37,220
answer I'll special pot of flaw

440
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:40,420
I'll scold that up

441
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:44,360
use it to remove all data from that part
soul

442
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,140
no a muppet page sonata no pages up

443
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:52,730
half previous version those that he will
exist after a reason so EPL

444
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:56,740
think about it to the because in the eye
also reveals a

445
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,790
left a they hold he

446
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:03,060
in the last sector although the logical
partition and

447
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:07,030
raise it but it still preserved in
Lowell some

448
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:10,190
page of for summer all copy of some page

449
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:16,440
so I'll I don't know how to race less
properly up by re-installing Co

450
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,460
operating system on the Apple device you
for sure destroys the

451
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,260
friction key so nobody will be able to
create all the data

452
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:29,010
unless he already have your key for
example if he examined curator for the

453
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:29,490
hill

454
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:35,420
device before but a of still open
question love how to do it from software

455
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,110
layer

456
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:41,270
so what comments you need to issue on on
your device to erase that they

457
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:45,700
and I need to mention lol themself

458
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:50,470
my former company I worked for and part
of this research most performant so

459
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:54,960
do with my employment in Eltham south in
lower cooperation with the

460
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,220
111 ca %uh any

461
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:02,320
demand some guys from soviet-era
actually they made

462
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,870
so perfect research almost as the same
time like me and Andre

463
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:10,440
in last summer and the publisher 22 lol

464
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,700
its slow result solely if you need some

465
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:19,720
details or even cold that possibility
dorsally media was unable to compile

466
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,940
I'll souls to a you put just visited the
site

467
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:28,280
Soul Reaper so the article about
low-level love

468
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:33,200
access to Isles devices and the probably
will find additional information on the

469
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,070
subject and I want to thank

470
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:38,330

w/

471

thank you thank you to the truth

474
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,270
I think one of of the most important
question was already on sought because I

475
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,140
think many people are interested how to

476
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:03,930
to whitewater the two flash memory in
the situation but some

477
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:07,250
okay we still have to wait other
questions about the topic

478
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:14,250
looks like everyone is our up wit

479
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:21,270
fight up thanks a lot

480
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,260
where is the mapping tables

481
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:30,020
toward and how is that not %uh

482
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:34,500
you overridden or erase too many times
actually all

483
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,780
might think is stored in two parts tell
sparked you slow

484
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:43,540
US plan and the logical page number
public schools number a logical page

485
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,310
numbers that start in the span

486
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:49,470
area of every page so high readings the
whole class

487
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:52,870
you put reveal that information and also

488
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:56,040
or a special page slow of call

489
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,140
must've lost love varies Ltd chance of
finding such pages

490
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:04,720
as a room at two and the era is use it
to store up

491
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,960
now they thought just correct
information lol

492
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,710
I'll for evolve less but I think many do
not utilize all of that information is

493
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:14,490
updated

494
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:17,700
and %uh next time you boot into %uh

495
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:21,950
plus come to love not to use it to eats
a whole class is just fine

496
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:26,380
the last all Tomas to blow and got also
mission froze up

501
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:45,909
letting tables you just choose new feel
offense for information science

502
00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:50,809
solo its again it's dynamically place it
in class but with

503
00:32:50,809 --> 00:32:53,880
me some limitations

504
00:32:53,880 --> 00:33:00,880
