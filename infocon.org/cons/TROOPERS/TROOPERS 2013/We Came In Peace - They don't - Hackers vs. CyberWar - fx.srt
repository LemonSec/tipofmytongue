1
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:11,650
as a huto a.m. Michael temperatures in a
bit of good to go English term

2
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,980
English okay Sep

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,510
lets which teams ten if serve

4
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,679
I'm done talk about dis moralist new
trends

5
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:26,769
a.m. good is called cyber war

6
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:29,839
I'm the I'm of the opinion dead

7
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:32,850
from dead you know

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,579
people shouldn't say cyber birds um
since this the term that everyone uses

9
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,680
in politics

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,109
um we have to stick with it it's pretty
much like to come hackers

11
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:45,430
right to terminate your use to mean
something different than it does today

12
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:50,760
but everyone in the media says hes
kerwin demeans have a criminal damn

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,120
you know am this is what did word meets

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,890
so term why do I think I'm even qualify
to talk about this

15
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,629
because I'm not from the military from I
actually never been to military

16
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:10,060
from but I'm also never been to
university said that

17
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,030
doesn't make a difference dipping is
deadly the last two years

18
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:18,079
I developed this hobby of actually
talking to politicians and foreign

19
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,189
policy people

20
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:23,040
a.m. in order to inform them about

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,860
realities term dead you know Dave can
eat more and so I end up being the ITO

22
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,560
connector

23
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,899
on on international conferences am

24
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:36,450
and get to hear that a lot of
interesting things so

25
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,530
from let's start with a couple of
definitions

26
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:43,729
because I dicey those definitions of 10
done from

27
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:46,930
and eat the most important one

28
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:50,969
is the definition of a weapon weapon is
a tool to

29
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:54,110
to damage in other living beings
physical

30
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,770
and were mental capacity to act um

31
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,880
which short automatically give us the
first answer

32
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,479
now 2g often pose question to

33
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:08,520
am is an exploit as a weaponized

34
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,680
exploit is that a weapon it certainly
it's

35
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,300
if you're selling exploit 07 weapons
because

36
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,360
and exploit can straightforward some

37
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,269
get out damage do you mental capacity to
act

38
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:26,480
um by simply owning someone else right
saddam

39
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,500
home looking at war am war

40
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,099
is the systematic use of force between
two or more actors

41
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:38,970
one of which is usually a nation-state
so you cannot be at war with your

42
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,409
neighbor

43
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:43,260
unless you're a nation-state right okay

44
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,739
so I am another set of definitions

45
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:51,700
just because I your time so often used
wrong and interchangeably

46
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,690
am dear is a big difference between
buckland ability an expert

47
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,010
am no really Darius

48
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,150
from so 8 a back is simply some form of

49
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,510
Arab from a state failure whatsoever
even ability

50
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,120
in a computer security sense not indeed
ego sense

51
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,530
um is actually a weakness which allows
attackers to

52
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,470
read uses systems information assurance
it doesn't have to be a book

53
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,930
a default account is also fun novelty
but it's not a buck

54
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,489
rate because someone put it in
intentionally

55
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,819
am and an exploit is essentially a
recipe

56
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:34,569
so am and DD distinction is really
important

57
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:39,860
especially in Germany because selling
about ability to someone else that's a

58
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,430
to go back or someone's parked on the
program

59
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,269
um is actually legal selling an
exploited Germany

60
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:52,330
is not you're violating um the stuff
because it's poof

61
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,739
some paragraph to a truce button a

62
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,340
see that is illegal for you to do

63
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,819
go to the UK am

64
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:06,180
box are inherently evil military

65
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,810
am this is d absolute first backfired

66
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,400
um and of course it was filed by a
female

67
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,750
so and talk about hackers and and girls
I'm grace hopper

68
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,110
she found dis bach sure

69
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:25,000
from which is them off um in one of the
relays

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,690
of a computer of a very early computer
and said

71
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,760
well finally we actually found a first
after a case of a book

72
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,620
and then she put into your notebook as
good military people go

73
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,110
also arm

74
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,650
I mean it at the end of the day a.m.

75
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,980
we have to realize stead own inept

76
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,530
d did military built the Internet or
helped the Internet

77
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:56,710
built for us so we shouldn't really be
surprised that the one to back now

78
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:01,460
because now it works and it has lots of
porn and kept images

79
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:07,400
um but essentially I mean did military
howdy internet bill by do our own specs

80
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,550
and then pour me to pick in our there's

81
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,590
there's a reason we have ADSL

82
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:19,420
early networking guys probably remember
dad when ADSL came out to everyone was

83
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,130
like

84
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,510
isometric what a bullshit would never
tease and arrive

85
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,660
routing protocols Fort but anyway so

86
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,080
om dis internet is a military thing

87
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,350
rammed by a private corporations and we
shall be would

88
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,760
also from as hackers

89
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,340
we like to think weirdest shit play we
invented

90
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,330
exploits and you know breaking into
systems and stuff

91
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,380
am him I proudly present

92
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,900
a a hyper wiser colonel exploit

93
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,000
written in 1972 by use air force guy

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,320
and those guys still had Baltz rates so
they voted in fuckin for truck

95
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,030
so if you think virtualization is
something you

96
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,620
I'm no dis is a VM breakout

97
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,870
for a really really old IBM System

98
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,200
so um what about as hackers

99
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,670
well funny enough the the first
documented case

100
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,670
all a irregular troops um

101
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:27,880
or hacker in this case working for a
foreign

102
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,750
from secret service um is actually a
German

103
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:36,160
Marcus s so we invented selling out to
the military

104
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,810
um back to deceased seeded

105
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,080
am and he was later classified

106
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,780
as a persistent computer intruder some
for me

107
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,910
very close to a PT raid am at that point
in time to eat the entire internet was

108
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:53,730
about twenty thousand

109
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:59,200
sheets so them he had a real relatively
easier time than we have today

110
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,620
um and he probably didn't find as many
cat images as we will today

111
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,150
um but its you know from Yakshi

112
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,390
did what we see from Chinese actors arm

113
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:15,310
were Russian actors today you know you
break it one machine and you break into

114
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,140
the next and from there you break into
other sites

115
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,390
does so this is 1890 style apt

116
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:27,070
so nothing you arm we've seen all this
before

117
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:31,310
now um you shouldn't be bit of the
evolution

118
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:35,230
of hacking Ford military so from

119
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,500
if you think that we invented buffer
overflow exploits

120
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,580
arm that is also not correct Indiana's

121
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:46,830
a actually realized at a buffer
overflows can be useful in the sixties

122
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:50,320
and started using them in the eighties
so they owned people

123
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,580
all around the plant which they do today
as well

124
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,990
right that's that's what the primarily
due am

125
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,840
interestingly enough they discovered
buffer overflows 'em as a form

126
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,520
of exception handling and a compiler
optimization

127
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,930
so they intentionally overflowed stake
offers an order

128
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,020
to have exceptions am

129
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,140
so the actors that thing did word
expeditor

130
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:19,640
arm are simply prong it was a very very
short time

131
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,360
in which that was actually true arm and
I was

132
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,490
pretty much like end of the nineties
where own

133
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:30,770
hackers actually had more 'em offense
capabilities

134
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,820
um den any military or secret service

135
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,130
am mostly thanks to you to work a few
people of

136
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:42,080
from namely to diesel group from and do
you invention a format string

137
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,390
exploits am but this all changed in 2001

138
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,570
when d Code Red warm um

139
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,790
infected um about 350

140
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:57,880
9000 hosts from with the message act by
the Chinese

141
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,000
sounds familiar am

142
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,570
and it is considered in in political
circles now that this might have been

143
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,750
also do you nd first show of force

144
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,120
up by the Chinese dead and this was not

145
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,920
a runoff geek writing a warm and then
owning everything

146
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,970
but it was actually a arm stay organized

147
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,590
eff ort to show the world what the
Chinese can do

148
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:26,980
and that they were a CyberPower so to
see

149
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:33,980
right isotype

150
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:39,030
okay um now

151
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:43,690
oh yeah if you wonder what dis a.m. what
does mushroom cloud is that's too

152
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,780
the private key that was used as I'm
flame

153
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,190
am so essentially um

154
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,410
where r we've always been just hobbyists
um

155
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,480
in a professional game which is he's
been an ass

156
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,130
in online what

157
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,780
didn't seize am so

158
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,150
when you look today shoes a presidential
order from

159
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:11,720
Obama issued actually wanted to make it
2-all earlier but that didn't work

160
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,110
because in am um getting back together
is currently not

161
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,450
very much on folk in US politics

162
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,830
I'm and does so he actually made it

163
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:27,270
a executed order in he just says well
what would we do

164
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:31,120
abouts computer security issues and you
will see a lot of things

165
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,930
um you know 10 I'm enhance the
protection and resilience of critical

166
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:39,180
nation infrastructure policy
coordination

167
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,840
consultative process but a Department of
Homeland Security

168
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,850
I'm identification of critical
infrastructure at risk

169
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:50,100
at this point to realize they don't even
know what the critical infrastructure

170
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,340
yes that they're supposed to protect

171
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,450
some then a framework to reduce cyber
risk

172
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:58,550
developing new Aston interestingly
enough a

173
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:02,290
voluntary critical infrastructure
cybersecurity program

174
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:05,390
so if you run the power grid its

175
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,410
arm you can to security ordered

176
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:11,750
you don't it's right um then

177
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,780
you know you're in you need in adoption
by agencies and

178
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,200
cyber security information sharing
that's that's what everyone says

179
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,440
always as first point we need more
information sharing why

180
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,400
it doesn't cost anything and it never
happens

181
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,660
so you can request again and again and
again

182
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,050
am and I am Ryan at the bottom

183
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,080
privacy and civil liberties Testament
and protection

184
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,470
saddam maybe we care about our people as
well

185
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:45,230
but maybe not um

186
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:48,680
to your problem why DS into

187
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,100
infrastructure um requirement is

188
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,850
voluntarily is liability and we cover
did little bird

189
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:00,570
just sitting in a power ready am and
critical infrastructure including the

190
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,260
internet and

191
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,360
is owned and operated by private
entities rate

192
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,910
so own to finger private entities right
now is

193
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:15,270
you can't buy secure computers because
we have in fact figured out how to build

194
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:18,500
that is a problem and so

195
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,420
I'm and because we have zero liability
on software

196
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,650
um you can actually sue someone for

197
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:29,360
writing and secures offer thats that's a
big problem

198
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,720
finding enough some Vera coats I'm

199
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,550
you familiar with the company Vera code
but they do binary scanning

200
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:40,010
I'm for their customers and

201
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:44,180
arm because they do a lot of it they
actually finally produced some decent

202
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,230
metrics on so for quality

203
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,420
trent out the worst software by far

204
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,090
in the waltz securities offered

205
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:58,100
everyone knew dat be four I mean talking
about anti-virus being arrested

206
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,140
I'm however um the it was unclear how
bad it is

207
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:06,430
city failed forty percent more tests
than any other software

208
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,770
even SAT is better I mean if

209
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:13,070
ok like get this

210
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:18,660
am and at this is also the case why do
you Department of Defence Procurement

211
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,430
are mechanisms are relatively complex

212
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:28,000
some so deep average time between
ordering a piece of software and act

213
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,060
getting it in the Department of
Defense's 18 months

214
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:37,070
dad is quite some time and then they
spent how for your testing it

215
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:42,860
because it's you never know what you get
and there's no liability

216
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:48,029
system some let's look around what's
what's tornadoes point of view

217
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:51,080
so the nato recognize Ste

218
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,520
cyber defense as a strategic concept in
2010

219
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,970
tour can relate to the game I'm City

220
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:03,350
defense ministers proofed am a revise
need a policy

221
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,670
focus on prevention of cyberattacks I
wonder what day

222
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:11,080
hard I wanna do that am and a build a
major computer incident response

223
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,270
capability

224
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:15,510
basically is search however in a full
scale

225
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:18,520
assert has to cost $58 million dollars

226
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,730
what euros in this case so

227
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:25,270
um dandy nato communication and
information

228
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:30,630
agency um sold facilitate bring all need
a body Sunday's centralize protection

229
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:34,620
and provide significant operational
benefits long-term cost savings

230
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,339
but we read don't spend money

231
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:41,529
long-term cost savings that's the key
word here so

232
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:45,160
essentially they don't care I'm

233
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,279
they do cyber exercises term

234
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:51,740
when was called cm x 2012

235
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:56,260
with a couple of countries participating
Austria Finland and Sweden

236
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:00,130
only one of them is a NATO member am

237
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:04,779
ends on D&D is like a NATO conference
last year

238
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,010
was it last year yeah last year some the
year

239
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:13,120
den still serving um general for all
things cyber

240
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,080
as said um on the question whether day
would build offensive capabilities now

241
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,160
we have absolutely no need for that

242
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:26,660
I am what that actually means is well we
leave it to our member states to detect

243
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,380
so everyone has different programs

244
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:34,880
now you see how much they all focus on
information sharing and protecting the

245
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,830
critical infrastructure and everything

246
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,920
now don't you go ahead and you take

247
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,930
one request for proposal from

248
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:47,380
Dr force so the Air Force wants to have
new

249
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,410
cyberwar software um

250
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:54,260
and a requirement here is the employment
of cyberspace

251
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:58,290
capabilities to destroy deny degrade
disrupted Saif

252
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,630
corrupt in absorption am adversaries

253
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:06,470
and be able to fight in cyberspace so
cyberspace warfare support

254
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:10,120
and developing cyberspace capabilities

255
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,670
what disconnected um situational
awareness and all died

256
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:18,510
see how that is really really not
defense

257
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:23,250
I'm so essentially what we're taking
will to currently do this

258
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,450
they have very big proposals some in

259
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:29,580
in one two boys weapons

260
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:34,570
offensive capabilities and there's a
reason for that

261
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:38,050
um this is called the offensive
defensive theory um

262
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:42,589
from Steven fun if never know how to
pronounce a

263
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:45,730
am and dis essentially has three points

264
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:49,710
some war is more common in periods when
conquest is

265
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,720
easy or believed to be is so

266
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,990
if you think dad it is really easy to
hack de other country it and you're more

267
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,600
likely to do that

268
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,930
also if you have um either

269
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:05,089
offensive opportunities order defense if

270
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:09,250
one abilities in dis absolutely explains
why

271
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,370
um onto on on one hand

272
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:16,699
earn a ban on says we need to protect
critical infrastructure once we figured

273
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:18,030
out what it is

274
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,059
um on the other hand um

275
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:24,890
Indian the Navy her DD air force and
navy people

276
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:28,439
arm by exploits instead of defense
technology

277
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:32,140
um biggest it is a um

278
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,490
yeah if you're vulnerable it is simply
by scale

279
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:39,270
not possible to fix the fact up to you
as part

280
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:43,720
um I am learned a while ago did

281
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,910
in reinsurance business some form

282
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:50,250
some reassurance companies to US
infrastructure

283
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:54,100
is classified as a developing country so

284
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:58,780
if you want to ensure infrastructure in
the US UK as much as if you were in

285
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,340
Africa

286
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:04,429
however they have a lot more of it

287
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:08,740
so that means big-money goes into
offense

288
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,920
and some everyone else some us me

289
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,110
little it's a dissonance um is left
wanting

290
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:18,630
and gets owned

291
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,940
so what's the what's the international
law situation here

292
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:25,510
same um do you

293
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:29,840
international law is is really fantastic
up the heat or

294
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,860
and it's a lot more flexible than a
national law actually

295
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:39,390
s so international law makes it very
very clear distinction between war and

296
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,700
not war

297
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:45,100
so were coming to answer to question
whether we're gonna see asylum or not

298
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,200
am to regulations for um

299
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,690
894 time of war so-called armed conflict
or use of force

300
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:57,860
to pretty clear a because humans have a
tendency to go

301
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,830
at war with each other so we have a
couple of thousand years experience with

302
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,960
that

303
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,530
am the regulations for peacetime not so
much

304
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:12,220
spying and another country is completely
legal international law

305
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:16,250
it is not legal in national law if you
get caught then you get shot

306
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,920
word you know at least a.m. booted out
of the country

307
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,110
words some something in between
depending on where you're what your card

308
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:27,809
am but international law has absolutely
no problem with people spying on each

309
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:28,790
other

310
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:32,150
because we're doing dad since we had
States

311
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:38,220
am and this obviously makes taking a
really interesting thing

312
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:43,590
because now despite it no longer has to
go into foreign country and gets a rest

313
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:47,910
so they're really really interested in
that am

314
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:52,710
you call actually M yeah it was there
was an idea I had last year

315
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:56,330
in a houston couple of international
lawyers a.m.

316
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:01,590
so now dead um d Americans and Israelis
pretty much spilled the beans

317
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:04,750
on defected yes they vote Stuxnet

318
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,730
Fulton Iran archie go to the
International Court of Justice and in

319
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:09,850
hock

320
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:13,130
and symptom for damages

321
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,549
and you get international lawyers to
giggle

322
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:20,270
madly a dad idea because it would work

323
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:24,170
it would be completely legal to do so
however in reality they are probably

324
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,710
gonna be kicked out

325
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,980
them because they don't care about
international regulations too much since

326
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,710
a

327
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:33,130
you know them go home to your homework
first

328
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:38,330
am also what I found out what I didn't
know and just find interesting is this

329
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:42,910
were is no longer to clear so we don't
declare war to someone else

330
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:47,530
home it is only war if the security
council to you and decides it is war

331
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:52,230
so from depend in depending on how
powerful you are in the security council

332
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,190
you can

333
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:56,840
bomb in Palm land into back into the
stone age

334
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,490
and it would be war it would be and

335
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:05,690
after well self defense is another thing
know it it's probably more like

336
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:09,179
um a product demonstration of urea arm

337
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:12,600
military-industrial complex

338
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,250
which pretty much is word home for
example what do you

339
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:20,450
a.m. what the French the do India a.m.

340
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:23,530
in the conflicts like Syria day

341
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:30,530
just demonstrate airplanes and don't
really fight

342
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:35,600
once I'm a free now so

343
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,370
am what is armed conflict I'm conflict I
actually means youre

344
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:43,600
at war right to security council decided
you're at war

345
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,160
and when you are at war I'm tears
regulations

346
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,340
the most commonly or most widely known
years

347
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,890
um Geneva conventions right so

348
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:57,309
two parts of the Geneva Convention um
make

349
00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:01,290
attacks um using cyber means

350
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:05,820
13 some pretty pretty difficult in times
of war

351
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,880
because the parties I'll arm of a
conflict members

352
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,000
armed forces do not have an unlimited
choice of methods

353
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,870
so it is not okay to use whatever method
you

354
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:21,059
find cool to fight the other guys but it
actually has to be

355
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:24,220
established war-making right in

356
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,500
the other part make sure did you only
attack

357
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,890
military targets you're not supposed to
text civil targets

358
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:35,840
it is a septet that there's collateral
damage bed

359
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,770
the thing that you try to shoot should
be a military target

360
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:44,360
if you face your in you know you had on
the hospital next door

361
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:49,290
and collateral damage however um
intention must've been did you

362
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:52,549
hit a military target some

363
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:55,900
that means 'em if you are in peacetime

364
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,200
I'm releasing something that stocks that
is completely fine

365
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,730
if you're at war with Iran it is not
fine because

366
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,100
due to the nature of self-deprecation
you can't make sure that you're on the

367
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,960
hacking

368
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,970
military targets

369
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:13,030
in dat is bad am because

370
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,820
in you know okay this being law there's
always ways around that

371
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:20,650
I'm especially international law um a.m.

372
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:24,049
to the powers to do you tend to not care
too much

373
00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:27,420
I'm but um is not legal

374
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:31,660
percy therefore

375
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,690
we will NEVER probably see a sidewalk

376
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:39,520
um what we'll see is what cairo's so
nicely called pics click

377
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,600
I'm because nobody has an interest

378
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,059
in promoting a online conflict on to
deliver of war

379
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:51,490
because of the fuckin regulations that
get into no way

380
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:56,100
also you need to ask your Congress for
permission

381
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,190
into you're potentially killing people

382
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:02,370
than an hour as long as you can as you
keep it in

383
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:06,160
as a Secret Service operation everything
is fine

384
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,270
am the nato people is specially

385
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:13,179
don't want cyberwar so a online conflict

386
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:16,200
I'm to turn into an hour to armed
conflict

387
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,700
because object to fight top 25 is

388
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,000
what in Germany is called toobin as five
from

389
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,610
we have nice words first stuff right
some so it means

390
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,760
if 180 members attacked then I'm all of
nato

391
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,650
is shooting back right nobody in nato

392
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:38,669
once be forced into war simply because
the Turkish people got hacked

393
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:42,169
rights like so

394
00:24:42,169 --> 00:24:45,590
and this is why nobody really really
once um in nato

395
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,169
once to promoted into armed conflict

396
00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:52,330
and also am the word which should be
kept

397
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:57,470
um on the radar I'm especially when it
comes to our and targeted attacks

398
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:00,940
is 50 percent of every secret services

399
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:05,049
in the world own fifty percent of the
mission statement is commercial

400
00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:08,640
so their job is to hack to other
countries and steel turbines

401
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,130
intelligence that is dat in

402
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:15,630
just doesn't get you into an armed
conflict

403
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,809
because otherwise a we would be all of

404
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:23,700
you know shooting at each other in
Europe

405
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,419
yeah and then home international policy
gets

406
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:31,040
really really funny so if I would ask
you

407
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,309
a.m. which countries you would think

408
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:38,030
the best to propose a responsible and
peaceful use

409
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:42,600
of the Internet I am sure dead you would
have the same effect as i house you will

410
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,780
immediately come up with China and
Russia

411
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:49,210
am because third most well behaved
online

412
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:54,410
right so which date back to you talk how
russia

413
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:58,370
Tajikistan and Uzbekistan but I want to
act

414
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:01,570
was propose a UN resolution which stain

415
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:05,440
later um degraded to a code of conduct

416
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,590
that essentially says some do not use

417
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:12,500
I cities including that works to carry
out hostile activities of acts of

418
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,150
aggression blah blah blah

419
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:18,140
cooperate and committing criminal and
terrorist activities

420
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,730
ensure that supplies to chain security
%uh Vice City products

421
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:25,799
um and services is you know secure

422
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:30,230
does from time right them i mean they
are to supply chain to concede

423
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:35,130
I'm n respect the rights and freedom of
searching for acquiring

424
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,390
in disseminating information right so

425
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:44,690
'em open Internet from and settle all
disputes in a peaceful manner

426
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:48,750
obviously you go away that's all the
stuff you do

427
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,270
they have why why do you wanna prove it
now

428
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:56,220
dietrich your was this in a very small
poignant

429
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:00,320
the also said well home cribbing
dissonant and dissemination of

430
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,380
information which

431
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:05,270
undermines other countries political
economic social stability

432
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:09,549
as well as their spirit to rule and
cultural environment

433
00:27:09,549 --> 00:27:14,809
cell arm suddenly and you know to
Chinese go like waved is in front of the

434
00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:16,590
American some girl I can have one

435
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:19,790
Aftab am essentially didn't attract

436
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:23,919
they try to pull your was am we stop
attacking you

437
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,380
if you give as um axes to to be
determined to beat a minyan

438
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,890
email boxes on Google once we asked for
it

439
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:35,650
so your that almost worked actually

440
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:39,620
of it took a moment for for everyone
else to realize

441
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,620
um but this is pretty much to
state-of-the-art

442
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:46,260
because everyone knows that the Chinese
and the Russians have the best

443
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:53,260
and and largest defense capabilities and
so they can try to pull shit like that

444
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,570
what I would really like to see which is
not going to happen

445
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:03,190
them is something for the internet that
is similar to the Outer Space Treaty

446
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:08,160
which by the way is from from time to
time violated by the Chinese

447
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,320
them so the other Space Treaty

448
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,580
was formed in order to you you know
internationally

449
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:18,070
I'm ready light regulate how

450
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:22,830
would you deal with space right them
what can we im

451
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:25,919
can I have a country in space for
example and

452
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,289
it says no so the exploration and use
for the benefit of all mankind

453
00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:33,559
firm free for exploration for everyone

454
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:37,960
um no subject to national from
appropriation by claim

455
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,510
of sovereignty which was funnily enough

456
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:44,890
a maxi got nixon into a lot of trouble

457
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,090
I think it was nixon do to you what is
called

458
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:52,230
do now flight XMB I am which is the
little flight to put

459
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,370
into the moon once they landed right
firm

460
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:59,289
begin his slave once that whole thing
when out of TV

461
00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:03,220
nixon went 8 we wanna latest

462
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,230
a Space Treaty said they actually passed
quickly of

463
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:09,590
that essentially says dear russians
sorry if

464
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:14,200
it was meant that way I think that was
one of the fastest laws

465
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,250
ever passed in the United States the to
play three days

466
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:20,570
South am so from

467
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:24,730
and don't want what I also like about
the outta space treaty is dead

468
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:29,240
State shot be responsible for national
space activities

469
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,690
whether carried out by government or
non-governmental entities

470
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:36,799
and liable for damage if it comes from
your country you're liable

471
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:41,039
that would be really nice warm from for
the internet as well

472
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,110
um also you know it says as truants

473
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:47,340
shall be regarded as an voice of mankind
I think that

474
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,890
would go to hackers in the internet case
right

475
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:55,990
said always wanted to have diplomacy

476
00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:01,919
so but to current status everyone fights
everyone else and nobody called war

477
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:08,919
and this is not good

478
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:28,389
me okay get spell by haiti's

479
00:30:28,389 --> 00:30:32,529
things anyway am and then

480
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:35,589
the reason I attend those those
conferences

481
00:30:35,589 --> 00:30:38,639
is a.m. is simply because

482
00:30:38,639 --> 00:30:42,729
you know it me the people that make the
decisions

483
00:30:42,729 --> 00:30:49,539
are pretty much blight mmm the thing as

484
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:53,309
.1 if you say cyber to get a drink

485
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:56,739
am and also money

486
00:30:56,739 --> 00:31:01,779
is suddenly flowing into your research
accounts so it's more important

487
00:31:01,779 --> 00:31:06,159
in in government context if you're if
you're working in the University where

488
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,339
other research context use a cyber pang

489
00:31:09,339 --> 00:31:13,339
money appears am the problem is everyone

490
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:17,210
who has something to contribute to our
world is already busy

491
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:21,019
so they don't write proposals so the
people that buy proposal what's

492
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:24,089
I'm are usually the ones that are not
good researchers

493
00:31:24,089 --> 00:31:29,219
from because candidate they need the
magic type a word in order to get grants

494
00:31:29,219 --> 00:31:32,989
while the poor people actually get
grounds anyway am

495
00:31:32,989 --> 00:31:36,229
said then do is work coming out um the

496
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:39,950
unfortunately from German academia my
favorite example

497
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:45,460
that proposes you know from so they had
10 people for four years working

498
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:50,789
on and privacy enhance rowdy privacy
enhance routing

499
00:31:50,789 --> 00:31:53,820
a men dead there's a new extension
header

500
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,109
and the extension header carries the

501
00:31:57,109 --> 00:32:00,570
level of confidentiality of the packet
am

502
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:05,559
ive a router gets packard that house a
higher level of confidentiality then the

503
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:07,719
router itself the router is supposed to
drop it

504
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:13,029
they got in ipv6 extension header is
fine too

505
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:16,489
right so you really wonder I mean

506
00:32:16,489 --> 00:32:19,509
it just in case it's not completely
clear

507
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:23,450
this is like writing a post card and
having in big fat letters

508
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:26,809
dis a secret please don't repeat made
sir

509
00:32:26,809 --> 00:32:30,820
it is like to leave a bit oh the
funniest thing was

510
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:34,759
when I asked them how they how to
actually you wanna chief that

511
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:41,759
that said well we're gonna do source
routing so they actually have never

512
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:43,889
tried it in the real internet

513
00:32:43,889 --> 00:32:48,139
in ND the pollutant politicians and
diplomats

514
00:32:48,139 --> 00:32:51,829
a need technical advice but the
technical advice to get

515
00:32:51,829 --> 00:32:55,089
is from lobbyists though the most of
them

516
00:32:55,089 --> 00:32:59,179
is so I'm Antec funnily enough them
intrusion prevention

517
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:03,579
am in protection of organizations is
done by HB Gary

518
00:33:03,579 --> 00:33:08,190
I think and this is because they have
such a good experience

519
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:12,989
in Howard fields to watch a 16-year-old
girl download all your emails over eight

520
00:33:12,989 --> 00:33:15,070
hours and not being able to do shit
about it

521
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:20,070
am didn't do network security comes from
academia

522
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:23,399
I was just mentioning that and in
regulations

523
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:26,639
I'm come from the politicians themselves
eaten

524
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:29,849
years eat like a literal quote um

525
00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:33,809
steam one of the of the British
representatives of the senior British

526
00:33:33,809 --> 00:33:34,950
representatives

527
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:38,960
a.m. had some idea about the ISP's being

528
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,339
arm liable for you know hacking goin'

529
00:33:42,339 --> 00:33:47,089
on from their networks right same he
says well we have to regulate

530
00:33:47,089 --> 00:33:50,899
an end zones as well you should actually
talk to the companies involved

531
00:33:50,899 --> 00:33:54,339
right because that's all private sector
and he's like well I can't just

532
00:33:54,339 --> 00:33:57,879
in by 24 in a good light weight which
for

533
00:33:57,879 --> 00:34:02,309
and literally looks every as ive and
totally stupid and says

534
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:06,389
well did the phone companies that run
the internet Microsoft makes the

535
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:07,570
operating system

536
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:11,129
who makes search Facebook make social
and semantic make secure

537
00:34:11,129 --> 00:34:17,039
yeah

538
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:20,409
am interestingly enough in in

539
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:23,869
all those conferences and meetings the
you go to where

540
00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:27,220
they actually discuss how to make the
Internet a safer place

541
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:30,919
you're not gonna see its single guy from
the offense teams

542
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:34,429
solved Dave respective nations because
they don't want

543
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:37,460
d other people did legislators to know

544
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,759
whether actual capabilities are not even
their own

545
00:34:40,759 --> 00:34:43,809
legislators so nobody talks to nobody
else

546
00:34:43,809 --> 00:34:47,849
and desist this is the major problem
because

547
00:34:47,849 --> 00:34:52,470
a.m. in a bit corporation is really
really needed right now

548
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:55,879
Defence Research is years if not decades
behind

549
00:34:55,879 --> 00:35:00,609
offense research right so didn't the
defense we use today

550
00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:03,960
is still dan farmer in between Mr only

551
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,289
the taking your site and building
bastion hosts

552
00:35:07,289 --> 00:35:10,529
now we called in virtual firewall
anti-virus blew up

553
00:35:10,529 --> 00:35:14,180
but essentially it's the same thing
right so

554
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:17,779
of things really knows what what we're
doing right but defense

555
00:35:17,779 --> 00:35:21,880
doesn't so we actually need systematic
changes for Dad

556
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:25,599
I'm however we need a holistic
understanding of the environment

557
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,270
if you don't understand the environment
you're not gonna fix that period

558
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:33,049
am Andy environment today is very
diverse

559
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:38,200
and do is lots of elements Lee you know
network infrastructures one but then

560
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,400
SCADA logistics production and supply
chain security

561
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,380
however it is forbidden 4G individual

562
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:49,500
um it is more beneficial right now I'm

563
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,750
to keep their mouths shut because then
George expert

564
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:56,329
and you can get you know large
consulting contracts

565
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:59,400
instead of cooperating then you're no
longer the expert

566
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,900
someone else gets pate academia for
example

567
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,960
so um we actually do have a

568
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:12,329
offense defense as some entry and out as
I T a brutal one

569
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:15,339
so from scale

570
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,390
is actually a big problem right um

571
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:21,509
its the I have does this image dead

572
00:36:21,509 --> 00:36:26,770
right now the cyberwar whereas cyber
conflict

573
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:32,880
again to bring

574
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,750
sup

575
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,750
am doesn't decide conflict i'm for me

576
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:43,859
is pretty much like nights in a medieval
times training as fuck inexpensive takes

577
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:44,569
agers

578
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:48,450
and unusually you're never forced with
inadequate

579
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:51,530
force on the opposite side so nights

580
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:54,839
'em would know rarely actually fight
against each other

581
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:58,990
would using will happen is stages run
into a town and kill everyone

582
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:02,980
am in this is the same here like to
hackers

583
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:06,720
um state-sponsored hackers did not yet
at the point

584
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,660
I'm weirder concurrently like kicking
the same system

585
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:14,720
right it happens occasionally but you
seemed you're pretty much alone

586
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,450
and you just gonna own someone I'm

587
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:22,940
and also we have irregular groups
irregular troops used

588
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:27,890
um in order to break somewhere in dade
don't have to be military

589
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:31,369
I'm I highly recommend Roberts

590
00:37:31,369 --> 00:37:35,579
talk I'm although I field watching it
twice

591
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:38,579
this conference but this time it but the
last light at least

592
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:43,990
am when I think old happen in the future
and this is just me speculating

593
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:47,260
is that we will have an effect like from

594
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:51,930
late with nuclear weapons and
intercontinental ballistic missiles at

595
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:52,609
some point

596
00:37:52,609 --> 00:37:57,329
um because the tremendous amount of
money that is spent by military for

597
00:37:57,329 --> 00:37:58,710
offensive capabilities

598
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:02,160
produce a something with tremendous
destruction

599
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,480
potential and no viable defense option

600
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,210
however just because that's the case

601
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:13,059
some of the year shoulder especially
American

602
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:16,190
older military people a

603
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:21,089
think well if it's like nuclear dan we
can do mutual assured destruction

604
00:38:21,089 --> 00:38:24,280
rights if we only have enough attack
potential

605
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,490
then you know nobody's gonna hackers
because we connect them back

606
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:32,750
third to which my answer usually is okay
fine 23 North Korean computers

607
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:37,599
it out by a this doesn't work your
infrastructure is viable to no end

608
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,710
North Korea doesn't have enough IP
addresses for your cyber warriors to

609
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:42,660
actually the

610
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,809
one it had one that doesn't work

611
00:38:45,809 --> 00:38:49,119
however um d

612
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,280
the symmetry from instant

613
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,740
them or didn't do doe your 273 between

614
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:59,130
ad-din nuclear war and the

615
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:02,650
cyberwar part is pretty

616
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:07,140
yeah it's pretty open so you have
recruitment of personal outside

617
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:12,720
of your own forces I'm namely year van a
fumble on and his team so

618
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:17,040
liked it the Americans to Bama and his
team the russians took the technology

619
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,579
and then

620
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:21,260
both had I said yes am so

621
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:24,579
actors or did you were enough that right
I'm

622
00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:27,809
also you can considered Stuxnet

623
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:32,230
a sputnik shock atm everyone knows what
the Sputnik shop worse

624
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:36,450
but when the russians manage to lounge
despite make in you know everyone in the

625
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,650
United States was shitting their pants
because some

626
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:43,559
something beeping through overtime am
serve

627
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:47,500
a.m. the one of the leading theories
from run Stuxnet

628
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:51,660
is dead um the cold was actually given

629
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:56,020
to the company virus blockade up in
order to make it public

630
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:59,369
and been ordered as a show of force
again

631
00:39:59,369 --> 00:40:03,210
to show what the Americans can do and
also

632
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:06,880
the major players pretty much behave
like in the sixties firm

633
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,329
and when knows this the song that they
had in the sixties

634
00:40:10,329 --> 00:40:14,579
a.m. get duck and cover right if you see
you to flash

635
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,829
doc then cover well heard today

636
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:20,990
we have you know if you hear cyber
update and AV

637
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:27,990
do both do both

638
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:33,869
equally Houston equally effective

639
00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:38,849
defense right so am

640
00:40:38,849 --> 00:40:42,180
there is no absolute defense

641
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:46,079
rate we still believe the Wheaton still
believe in

642
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,119
in defense solving all our problems

643
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,380
we still believe that we can have an
unbreakable computer where database

644
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:57,390
at least one company believes that am so

645
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:01,190
it's very unlikely that such a thing
actually exists rate

646
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:04,270
am what we see today um

647
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:08,500
in in computer security is just an
indicator how bad it really is

648
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,880
if you still find fun abilities by
something you call fuzzing

649
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,680
which actually is randomly picking one
or two test cases out of worst-case

650
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,380
bound retesting

651
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:24,049
which is a very simple testing
methodology and and that tells you how

652
00:41:24,049 --> 00:41:25,740
bad our softwares

653
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:29,059
and even if we do away with buffer
overflows and stuff

654
00:41:29,059 --> 00:41:33,000
the text move in a different direction
that's no newt's 8

655
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,220
am week actually need to do

656
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:40,309
um is we have two

657
00:41:40,309 --> 00:41:43,559
go from the one-dimensional protection

658
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:47,500
that is only if we only have protection
over protection of protection

659
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:51,180
but its actually love triangle we need a
Venice

660
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:56,339
we need to figure how when we get hacked
because nobody fuckin notices today

661
00:41:56,339 --> 00:41:59,660
Int we have to have disaster recovery

662
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:03,510
once you got hacked you know when you
when your home machine attacked

663
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:06,799
everyone's how to reinstall them is she

664
00:42:06,799 --> 00:42:09,900
if you have a SAP system

665
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:14,299
a corporate-wide SAP system tell that to
the managers

666
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:18,210
tell get out white two systems reinstall
SAT

667
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:21,579
that's not going to work so we actually
need

668
00:42:21,579 --> 00:42:25,690
to figure out how to recover from
attacks

669
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:28,950
am there is a nice example for

670
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:33,740
'em for the futility of the attempt to
get an absolute defense

671
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:36,900
some you this is from from the endure

672
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,029
in gear and talked to two

673
00:42:40,029 --> 00:42:44,430
water supply people in in states on the
question of terrorists

674
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:48,869
in attack prevention for the water
supply system and they're like no

675
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:52,609
not possible he's like why is like well

676
00:42:52,609 --> 00:42:56,440
it if I wanna break a water system

677
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,260
I go 'em into you know the Home Depot

678
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:03,490
am and I by a.m.

679
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:07,730
but cleaning think you know what with
lots of power

680
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:11,150
like a power cleaner basically i connect
into pipes

681
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:15,210
in a press the button and everything
that is not a straight lie in the pipes

682
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:16,819
goes

683
00:43:16,819 --> 00:43:20,339
and in a best-case I do that with a
little oil in it or something else

684
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:21,730
sticky and I do it will

685
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:25,569
over Christmas in a city like San
Francisco where it's really really

686
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:26,170
bitchin to

687
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:30,900
dick the pipes are to put new ones it
and also

688
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:35,930
one-sided ads didn't do water supply
people that can turn off the water

689
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:39,000
because people tend to need water so

690
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,950
they actually have to recover and a half
to recover while operating

691
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:46,900
until we are at this stage with our
computer networks

692
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:50,240
we have a prop

693
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,140
so a.m. I'm was mentioning died
yesterday in a

694
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:57,500
in that panel already a.m. so this is

695
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:01,359
a real ATT when that are to work pretty
well

696
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:05,359
um a foreign ministry team mmm from the
European country

697
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:08,980
but owns for over four years um

698
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:12,960
and this shows you how you do good
operation

699
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:18,240
goes they would be built was the clients
that had internet access had an agent

700
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:18,510
that

701
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:22,279
agent would watch when declined I
actually talked to the internet so it

702
00:44:22,279 --> 00:44:24,329
doesn't blink by itself

703
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:28,010
and then it would hearken back to the to
command and control server

704
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:31,790
the agents am setup a encrypt it network

705
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:36,309
over RPC over the domain controllers so
they have a complete

706
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:40,559
overlay network over the windows network
decrying rootkits

707
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:44,809
contained automatic december's for 32
and 64-bit

708
00:44:44,809 --> 00:44:48,710
debt when's your update to clone a world
automatically disassemble the updated

709
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:49,750
kernel parts

710
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:53,589
to find a new offset since internal
structures that the patch

711
00:44:53,589 --> 00:44:57,640
ride and it was a job based system so
you called from the outside you could

712
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,790
just send in

713
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:05,790
I look forward to commence that contain
the word cyber

714
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:13,730
and the only reason this was discovered
was because one system administrator

715
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:18,410
was actually built don't village in pain
of them to not reboot the

716
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:23,240
machine the blue screen because he had
some very cramped um

717
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:27,920
it on %um box in in the basement and it
didn't support it I'm so

718
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,089
to December kinda like fucked up in in
his leg woodstock driver

719
00:45:32,089 --> 00:45:36,060
mmm looks very russian

720
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:39,790
also funnily enough they didn't hide
anything did that in command and control

721
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:40,859
server connection

722
00:45:40,859 --> 00:45:45,119
went straight encrypt it but straight to
russian military acts like it

723
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:50,160
okay no bones points

724
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,220
my biggest problem with this whole with
the source I was tough is collateral

725
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,589
damage

726
00:45:55,589 --> 00:46:00,420
am collateral damage its patent is
especially not noticed

727
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:04,880
recently so um your in 2012 and November

728
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,730
a on the Nano mailing list that's a
network operated willingness

729
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:12,390
so on said did anyone else see own that
NTP

730
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:15,920
was kinda weird today am what turned out

731
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,069
worsted the a.m. Navy

732
00:46:19,069 --> 00:46:22,270
a time service the NTP Time Servers

733
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:26,940
from said its 2000 for about today

734
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:31,020
which is very very useful if you have
expired certificates the g20 used to

735
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:31,670
lock into

736
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:36,810
AV you wouldn't think that the navy
noticed

737
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:40,130
they actually didn't notice am

738
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:43,599
in the problem being that a lot of
hospitals

739
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:49,200
in and other vital things we're also
using the Navy time service

740
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,349
that is really not good for an automated
medication system

741
00:46:52,349 --> 00:46:55,650
give the time actually goes 10 years
back

742
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:59,960
um also um navy's OCSP server is

743
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:05,140
tend to be d dost which is also very
useful if you if you have a

744
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:08,819
vote certificated you could get into the
Navy

745
00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:12,630
I'm they don't do shit about it movie
version

746
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:15,660
this is my new like it was the 0

747
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:19,210
I servers %uh the goals

748
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:22,290
and

749
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:25,359
nobody knows I just I just noticed those
things

750
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:28,450
um in you know nobody else cares

751
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:33,940
so am my real problem with flame for
example is also to

752
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:37,730
I mean um it is clear

753
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:40,920
what country did that because not many
countries have a group

754
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,470
where they can walk into and say can you
give me a new md5 collision

755
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:48,240
a mechanism that nobody has seen before
and that is really fast

756
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:53,279
right now all is not so many groups that
after

757
00:47:53,279 --> 00:47:57,829
am me yep for example rates

758
00:47:57,829 --> 00:48:01,599
am so in this case Microsoft was that it
was the victim

759
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:04,650
however many other countries operate

760
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:08,910
certificate authorities and dis includes
countries

761
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:12,099
that are not very democratic in their
decision-making

762
00:48:12,099 --> 00:48:15,619
so of course some you know less
democratic country

763
00:48:15,619 --> 00:48:18,290
you can just walk up to their
certificate authority and go like

764
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:20,230
scientist cult

765
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,740
um and that's a problem because people
will do that

766
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:28,259
a and you know this this is what in
computer security call him

767
00:48:28,259 --> 00:48:32,859
ok they once you found a problem you no
longer use that technology

768
00:48:32,859 --> 00:48:36,790
so this one attack pretty much killed
code signing for us

769
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:40,150
on the Windows platform

770
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:44,150
here's a scenario that I really love um

771
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:50,490
you know the military's call the cyber

772
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:53,690
world um they call it the fifth to me

773
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:56,710
by two main 123 is air sea land

774
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:59,890
right demand for space

775
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:02,980
so in a in the seventies

776
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:06,400
a nasa scientists on named kessler

777
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,500
from looked at looked at the space
debris problem

778
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:14,839
in realize that by um smashing a couple
of satellites

779
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:18,540
into each other you produce so much I'm
space debris

780
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:21,690
that killed every other satellite low
orbit

781
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:25,119
a stationary orbit whatever you want
every satellite

782
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:28,349
and you know the space station's um
disappear

783
00:49:28,349 --> 00:49:31,700
in a big cloud of Jack essentially

784
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:36,000
also and I side effect um we probably
wouldn't be leaving

785
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,650
earth for a couple of hundred years

786
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:43,460
am the thing is the ease our house
assimilated dad

787
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:47,720
in realize well it doesn't really matter
which satellites to use

788
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:50,839
a.m. and you only need three

789
00:49:50,839 --> 00:49:55,240
this is really backed because you know
how do you get to satellites

790
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:58,309
hacking them directly is not is not an
option

791
00:49:58,309 --> 00:50:01,700
but would works perfectly well is taking
over

792
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:06,190
attn see um in at some point

793
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:09,829
countries with more desperate stand

794
00:50:09,829 --> 00:50:14,009
will actually come up with this idea in
Denton tried to break into one of two

795
00:50:14,009 --> 00:50:15,670
you tracking and control

796
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:19,849
sites now I talk to those people this is
just one operator

797
00:50:19,849 --> 00:50:22,859
there's a lot more I talked to one of
those um

798
00:50:22,859 --> 00:50:27,059
operators and their defense strategy is
pretty much where not connected to the

799
00:50:27,059 --> 00:50:28,099
Internet

800
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:31,329
but then someone else said but wait a
minute

801
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:34,390
you guys VPN

802
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:38,700
the yeah that's not internet so

803
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:42,490
it if I will do that I would actually
have I'm had two sites

804
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:46,180
named trawl because Lee taking out every
satellite

805
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:50,210
I'm around our planet is an active big
trawling

806
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:55,150
I'm but I'm I'm sure don't also the
physical security of those sites is

807
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:56,430
really good

808
00:50:56,430 --> 00:51:01,109
I'm inner

809
00:51:01,109 --> 00:51:04,369
nothing to be concerned about

810
00:51:04,369 --> 00:51:07,700
so what does that mean to you

811
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:11,619
um essentially on the question of
selling exploits

812
00:51:11,619 --> 00:51:15,500
a I am with Julia outta here who says

813
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:19,390
well its up to you and out make up your
mind

814
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:23,049
a.m. be warned in Germany it is not
legal to sell exploits

815
00:51:23,049 --> 00:51:26,819
so either you now sell them somewhere
else were

816
00:51:26,819 --> 00:51:31,049
a you know just don't um

817
00:51:31,049 --> 00:51:35,440
it's an interesting question whether
selling exploits is better or worse

818
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,040
then leaking confidential documents to
Wikileaks

819
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:43,529
thats want to consider am however did
argument of

820
00:51:43,529 --> 00:51:47,170
resource um the previous chin meaning

821
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:52,140
if we don't seldom exploits then the
military is not gonna have exploit is

822
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:57,210
obviously bullshit I because as I show
that they had exploits long before we

823
00:51:57,210 --> 00:52:00,040
even had a dream for

824
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:03,559
am also the defense contractors I really
gearing up as

825
00:52:03,559 --> 00:52:07,910
is one of them put it all we're doing
what everyone else does right now since

826
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:10,329
nobody buys fighter planes anymore

827
00:52:10,329 --> 00:52:13,869
I'm that is their prop

828
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:18,490
am markets are gonna change and
especially

829
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:22,290
especially I'm back bounties for example
are

830
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:25,480
our problem because and some point its

831
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:29,759
it will make sense for you um to hijack
email accounts

832
00:52:29,759 --> 00:52:35,150
interest commit one abilities into coat
that already happened a couple of times

833
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:39,000
a.m. you will have into dent intentional
introduction

834
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,690
and you were actually still liabilities
from consigning gates

835
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:47,430
yeah I'm today that really doesn't make
any sense but

836
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:50,650
let the price for one abilities rice a
little bit more

837
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:54,150
an you will have a problem that people
actually steal

838
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:59,579
while testing your stuff we already see
a significant decline

839
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:02,790
in full disclosure so everything that we
have and

840
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:05,920
terms of protecting the reliance on full
disclosure

841
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,970
namely fallibility scanners for example

842
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:12,440
they are getting less and less effective
because they don't know about to fuckin

843
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,109
viability is because they get

844
00:53:14,109 --> 00:53:18,660
sold under table 2 whatever sequences
pace the most

845
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:23,400
am and dis is gonna continue

846
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,170
so what can you do a.m. well as

847
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:30,420
I mentioned I'm a big fan of talking
home

848
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:33,549
to the politicians that actually make
the decision

849
00:53:33,549 --> 00:53:36,849
I'm begins if you have no financial
interest

850
00:53:36,849 --> 00:53:40,660
then um is really interesting for them
to talk to you

851
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:44,849
because everyone else is lying to them
and um

852
00:53:44,849 --> 00:53:48,000
the decisions must be made at some point
so

853
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,130
not talking to them is the automatic
losing proposition

854
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:55,290
am pro tips don't talk to law
enforcement

855
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:59,330
day are stupid and they don't get it am

856
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:02,890
invade on the defensive side as I said
where decades behind

857
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:05,950
on defense research so flank steak
movement

858
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:12,099
is one of the most important things
recently developed thanks

859
00:54:12,099 --> 00:54:16,810
missus again am heck stuff that's
relevant

860
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:20,719
we can't eat fried of them of divine
abilities however

861
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:24,580
you can take them away from the moment
you hack something

862
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:30,099
and you make full disclosure it's no
longer a good use for military word um

863
00:54:30,099 --> 00:54:33,119
a.m. secret service operation to use
right

864
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:37,089
it's no longer audit sucks Harry monkey
balls for them

865
00:54:37,089 --> 00:54:40,190
um dad is really what you can do

866
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:43,200
and um you know Dayton d

867
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,339
opportunism can make you rich right now
but

868
00:54:46,339 --> 00:54:50,960
a.m. I don't think you want to explain
to you get into your children

869
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,160
at some point why the internet is such a
fucked up place in

870
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:58,489
there is no privacy and im no anymore
and they have to sign up with their

871
00:54:58,489 --> 00:55:02,369
government ID in order to get an IP
address and stuff like that

872
00:55:02,369 --> 00:55:06,790
so we can stop them from for making
digital weapons but we can take them

873
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:08,170
away

874
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:13,900
and it's a fun game to play also the
really hate you for it

875
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,640
when an organization can do

876
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:19,710
um is state religion and and responsible

877
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:23,220
putting shit into the cloud in order to
blame someone else

878
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:28,330
is not responsible right especially if
the child is not yours

879
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:31,330
I'm don't make purchase decision

880
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:35,480
so what the plate based on the price of
the product because you might end up

881
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:39,190
which I'm his fucking routers am in

882
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:42,820
get out don't be predictable if your
defense is predictable

883
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:45,860
it is easy to get around it rate so

884
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:50,070
om yeah the unpredictable a.m.

885
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:53,380
my recommendation that I mentioned
yesterday already is patrols

886
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:57,610
like people dedicated people would admin
rights that go from system to system

887
00:55:57,610 --> 00:56:00,800
in tried to figure out if everything
running on it

888
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:05,850
belongs there from dis is the winning
defense strategy of every

889
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:10,100
good captain flight T so if it works

890
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:14,400
in a captain flight competition then it
probably also works in your enterprise

891
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,710
don't give up um

892
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:20,720
desis a quote unfortunately fun from a

893
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,140
net military network operator his end

894
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:27,790
why I'm so happy that our network is not
interesting

895
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:31,800
not for for two teenagers we know that
every fuckin secret service in the world

896
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:32,840
is in our network

897
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:36,450
ready but the teenagers will be just
annoy us

898
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:40,170
0 game

899
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:43,370
it is realistic however dis is really
playing

900
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:48,100
throw your hands up in yeah put your
head in to descend has never worked

901
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,410
particularly well

902
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:52,570
am also penetration tests

903
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:56,290
some in in especially in a military a
space

904
00:56:56,290 --> 00:57:00,430
the are of me kilts by higher superiors

905
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:04,530
from mostly generals and stuff because
they don't wanna know

906
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:08,320
if they know they have to do something
about it so

907
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:11,380
sure not to implement first tests in
order to not now

908
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:15,420
also yeah if you're clueless

909
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:19,310
and you need the public mailing lists

910
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:23,520
I've more or less equally clueless
people

911
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:29,140
and to tell you how to do your job don't
post into the parking mailing list

912
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:32,410
this is asking for getting owned right
so

913
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:35,420
um I'm not feeling particularly well
about

914
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:38,420
let europe in there a

915
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:43,020
security your and I was it

916
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:50,020
um any questions fighter

917
00:57:57,070 --> 00:57:58,050
questions comments

918
00:57:58,050 --> 00:58:04,080
good yeah and

919
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,350
uses Fred sure his

920
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:11,080
pygmy he's work doesn't work now

921
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:14,840
no well for

922
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,880
yes so mmm deterrence is

923
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:21,430
not is yet is not an option period

924
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:25,820
with the same house

925
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:29,090
I yup so it doesn't write

926
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:32,000
my I

927
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,230
I'll be the very there

928
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:38,460
yeah for

929
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:41,920
use I 2000 move on I

930
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,970
column by expose who saw

931
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:49,040
fruits US and gloves off

932
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:53,180
