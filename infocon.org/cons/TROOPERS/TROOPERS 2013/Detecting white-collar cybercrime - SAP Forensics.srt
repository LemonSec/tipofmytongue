1
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,559
any traction for us it's differently a
pleasure

2
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,010
mean Sheeran troopers we really loved at
this conference

3
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,690
so yes no sane air I'm in. illness

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,520
a the CEO of nazis his

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,950
an abscess I guess I will so

6
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,610
you um

7
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,870
yeah so %uh still sane we study the I
was searching on SAP Viking 2006

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:36,450
basically around some new attack make
those that we

9
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,879
research %uh since then we have been
you're doing more presentations on on

10
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,059
that topic so how

11
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,140
I think this may break into SAP systems
on over the last

12
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,539
a you're so we started you can we out it
what's

13
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:53,350
what's the next step right how we it
there is there's a difference here we

14
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,399
have highlighted ways

15
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,960
in 20 people come break and assistance
we have highlighted ways into how

16
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,890
companies come protect themselves from
this these attacks but

17
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,330
how we can help companies we detect our
allies

18
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:10,700
if they have been actually shocked if
there be an attack right now um

19
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:16,219
so that that's what we're going to be
covering today in the south so quick

20
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:17,890
introduction to hold up sis

21
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,369
that we are solely focus on the security
of ERP systems

22
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:25,750
mostly our own SAP solutions by Wilson
started to colour

23
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:30,500
Oracle ERP platforms JB on wonderful
where researchers Jordon you there

24
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,469
already a talk on

25
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:34,850
thanks to its evil and ddr2 are so
they're both from our clothes will

26
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,119
with some very interesting findings in
the OS

27
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:41,909
up sick talk conference last year so

28
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,409
a where headquartered in Boston the we
have a research and development mostly

29
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:47,929
in 10 cities Argentina I'll

30
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:51,020
know we also looking for way people here
in Germany so

31
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,390
can't speak with us if you are
interested in other leader on

32
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,179
with this caliber life security software
solutions off base on

33
00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:04,460
your PC sense lise SAP certify so forth
week up for my services are and trainees

34
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,240
yet that's some more but more
information about us but I

35
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,500
just wanted to highlight also is that
July guys from authorities

36
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,750
with such slobs is a key lime and a wet
willy work a lot on

37
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,849
are working on this topic so we want
also to thank them for for the research

38
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:22,530
so %uh we're going to be

39
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,239
I mean is what we're going to be looking
at today quick but we can't rush into

40
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,790
SEP I know how many of you have

41
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,959
as a PR company it you guys with her

42
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,030
I a at Los was a few I am so

43
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,420
effort they want to do a couple maybe
they do have SEP but you've met you may

44
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,220
have a sleepy but you're not familiar
with SAP

45
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,440
we're going to make a quick introduction
they were going to talk about

46
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,360
forensics we're going to see into like a
story

47
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,810
of I don't duck a doctor so you trying
to break into it if this is Sam

48
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:55,010
undetected trying to see at which kinda
fingertips ki may be leaving in the

49
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:55,540
system

50
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,319
and then we got that further throw some
concussions so

51
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,040
squeaking through to SAP as if he's
basically

52
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,920
the largest provider of business
solutions a in the work i'd

53
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,150
so over 140,000 implementations over

54
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,230
90,000 customers are on the Gulf so

55
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,459
this basically means that most awful
were business critical processes

56
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:21,830
large square commerce organizations
government or defense

57
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:25,069
their run by every airline SAP systems
so

58
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:28,459
you may have heard some SAP like

59
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:32,579
solutions awards like basis delicious
ERP CRM foretold

60
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,909
yeah I jurors see so all this kind of

61
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:39,420
difficult things a to remember are

62
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,650
the for SAP solutions a with differences
some of them have different security

63
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,459
architectures

64
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:47,879
the friend obviously business proposes
on

65
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:51,579
but we're what we're going to be talking
about today is pretty much going across

66
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:53,599
many of them because we're talking about

67
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,200
its threats affecting a waste to the tax
rates affect in SAP NetWeaver layer

68
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,200
is like a column base framework air for

69
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,590
many of the solutions so

70
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,610
again in planning is what a sissy peace
basically

71
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:12,019
what's safeguarding the business grow
jewels in there in a company right so

72
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:16,250
processes like in Boise but you mention
my resources data

73
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,870
financial planning Treasury so all the
good critical information

74
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:26,280
is in the services so

75
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,310
why would that I could actually go of
the SABC some

76
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,360
I think that you're ready so that if we
use light

77
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,479
all the this critical business they
desire so

78
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,479
what she would be looking at us air
after what what he's looking for

79
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,270
iffy she's trying to take away recipes
he may be trying to nation s gonna thats

80
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,419
that's just stealing sensitive
information at you

81
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:52,370
you may have like manufacturing date of
at personal data

82
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:55,729
a financial statements may be go
yesterday

83
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:58,820
she may be just trying to take this is
offline are you gonna think

84
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,240
your motion picture yourself in your
company all just from there

85
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,190
an employee perspective all many many of
our employees are working all day

86
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,550
through with this if the system so if
sell a stake in this if this is offline

87
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,620
continuously

88
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,180
that would you make us send people

89
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,340
health of people home right that's
already discussed but also

90
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:22,229
you can be disrupted interfaces with
payment gateway to and things

91
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:25,810
on financial cesaria finally free of
right he may be trying to engage in a

92
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,620
financial fraud modifying financial
statement

93
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,030
great can go spend the earth things

94
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,470
so basically what we

95
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,090
study took in 2007 was up

96
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,090
we started see SAP security essay assay

97
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:47,430
the friend a go said or let a more
complete goes it usually

98
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,789
SAP security was all about syndication
of you this controls

99
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:55,330
is mean and utilisation right so what
the user so they have my system

100
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,460
what kind of a few these they can do and
we try to make sure that only their

101
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,759
their minimal with a lisp released a

102
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,069
listless there are multiple for the
stations they have so that they

103
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:09,280
they kinda do any they should business
process

104
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,680
but what they mean if we underlies an
SAP system

105
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,380
I in nearly a year approach we had
obviously

106
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,569
they have and operating system a
database

107
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:25,000
and they were held up about this if the
solution so segregation of duties

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,009
controls

109
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:29,389
are basically a plane at what we call
this a if this is not player

110
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:33,289
so all this kind of business controls
however

111
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:36,650
there is a lil your pillow they can if
agree area

112
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:40,120
school that what we call this if the
application layer that's usually admit

113
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,800
we've ever base layer

114
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,400
where we find that this day there they
weak spot

115
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,800
today for most SAP systems

116
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,319
anyway what I just wanted to highlight
election we wanted to find it here is

117
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,569
that

118
00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:56,690
even if we're talking about foreign 6 or
attacks or threats

119
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,770
we should not forget about the database
and operating sys millions right

120
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:03,949
because a compromise to any of the
Slayers would result in a in the

121
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:06,129
compete.com for myself all this if this
is

122
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:09,410
their recipes

123
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:13,330
so one with so far was doing a sippy
penetration tester assessments to

124
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,900
store customers is that over 95 percent
of times

125
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,599
that we did have an interest in this we
were able to successfully

126
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:23,620
compromises for exploiting
vulnerabilities in desi

127
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,599
the application layer so they were
sprawl im

128
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,169
I think one of the worst think that we
have here is that

129
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:35,620
different to seem to get enough beauty
gots

130
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:40,120
I think I i thank you Dustin need to use
accounting the season to exploit

131
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,729
most of these will have its so we're
talking about someone who does

132
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:48,000
knows a few others will follow a recipe
system and using exploit

133
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,879
or exploit the one of these issues she
can get full control following type this

134
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,840
information and processes

135
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,340
thats that's what we're cut kind is
trying to take them fight fight against

136
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:04,770
so let's get into four-inches'

137
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,509
so this a like Wikipedia definition of
forensic if

138
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:12,099
sooo hustler how about it mp4 but
basically

139
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:15,849
in English were trying to us to find the
answer for the questions

140
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:20,629
house by SAP platform been hiked right
how I already have a security breach

141
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:24,009
in the bust on also I am be that sucks

142
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:27,180
right now to can I see if I mean how can
a

143
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,210
try to understand if I mean it that way

144
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,760
so we'll see obviously we'll ok only
about

145
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,480
free solutions and freeways into how

146
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,700
you you've got to take this kind of
activities mostly by the capabilities

147
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,020
provided by SAP

148
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:47,020
itself in order to help you day this
kind of faces

149
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,200
are you being able to scan streets

150
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,100
so this is something that we also find
very often

151
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,260
this will be the left would be a leg and
IT security guy information security

152
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,650
minister in the company

153
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:02,300
their right mind would be like this EP
guy over there

154
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,340
so maybe we well we thought with the CPS

155
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:11,710
SEP company are you sir the OC most
people say out that there's if this is a

156
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,770
house never been cut

157
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,980
right so

158
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,510
the full of questions that we do is like
okay so do you have looks in a

159
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,580
right the how you this acutely love you
have the

160
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,600
they chase love that documents

161
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,160
I'm the typical us so that we get is out
no wait what whether it's okay

162
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,620
so what we see all of these out

163
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,420
really them know right so we don't know
if we have hiked

164
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,510
been at BU we have suffered security
which are not because

165
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:45,310
we are not really tracing for that
information

166
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,360
also we get the question about

167
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,900
are we thanks again says if the season's
going on

168
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,220
so I know how many of you have heard
about this year's anyone

169
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,410
for a.m. so basically in October last
year

170
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:03,100
I anonymous claimed to have broken into
the Greek Minister Phineas

171
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,920
which is yet to be confirm but the most
important

172
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,140
always written thing for us a unicef
research

173
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,660
is a it was a first-time that we saw in
the headlights

174
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,210
someone are you saying that they have I
mean they were doing

175
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:20,220
died already have an SAP explode a
single day

176
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,590
and they were assisi that it was gonna
flooding to use it

177
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,300
widely right a so

178
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,670
just what what I want to to highlight
the reset

179
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,920
but it was a highlight here is up

180
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,090
maybe income that would customers and we
wait wait wait a minute when he said we

181
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:38,730
do

182
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:42,080
we often get like

183
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,760
confident me in confidence people tell
us

184
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,910
you know what we have suffered a
security breach in our services and we

185
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,170
had this problem

186
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,320
but obviously that doesn't get unions

187
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,900
so I think they say the set

188
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,040
would be something interesting a
game-changer

189
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,940
really have more people realize that
this is something that's

190
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,810
totally possibly we are not for
thicknesses

191
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:11,940
holistic um

192
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:16,120
so basically what we a are we going to

193
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,140
be look at today and I sent a date just
us we finish this

194
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,220
introduction is held

195
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,680
how can we trace these I mean which
which features which capabilities SAP

196
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,490
provide us

197
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:31,050
to to Tracy's I'm we're going to do that
a nice in the

198
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,280
course of action office some the lessee
a set of

199
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,940
SEPs so basically if we divide

200
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,310
a TOC onto like big faces

201
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:45,470
because the first one p.m. the anonymous
a doctor

202
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:49,670
doesn't have any you some possible
breaking into the system

203
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,720
on or if I did you sir elevating
releases to get

204
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,300
access to sensitive if I was he

205
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,450
its da DOCSIS then that Tiger Woods

206
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:03,940
try to perform fraudulent business
processes Alexis sensitive business

207
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,960
information

208
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,290
so most of their segregation of duties
controls

209
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:12,300
usually try to prevent this we have been
talking over this year's

210
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,940
is how we can prevent this I when we're
going to see today small city on

211
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:21,400
how to the thick that very first
face-off

212
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,490
so for that we basically have two guys

213
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,080
invited sources first one is that doctor

214
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,420
some a few me know this guy a so

215
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:35,470
if you don't i mean this basic this guy
has basically big big fraud

216
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:39,250
some years ago over I know he has keys
facing like

217
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,890
it's going to piss just only spent only
150 years in prison

218
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:45,890
because so this this will be our
attacker

219
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,630
rights right to the front on this if the
system and then we chose a very

220
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,070
smart detective to help us with this

221
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:56,610
you may recognize he's going to be also
some other sites

222
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,910
here we have also something that some of
you may be

223
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:03,760
looking up for so you just a few seconds

224
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,780
a picture or something if you're

225
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:11,380
are debating some kind of talents

226
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,740
I'm ready

227
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,740
so no JP will wheeler

228
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:22,590
walk us through their you that doctor
how the tech is going after the system

229
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,830
how over detective friend will be trying
to

230
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:29,300
wheelie see what he's doing it for you
just to see how that

231
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,020
affixes okay thanks marina

232
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,070
so and we we are following

233
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,410
the attackers trace so we are trying to
I

234
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:45,620
Santander right now and see which kind
of traces I mean generally

235
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,670
so we have a an

236
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:52,440
an SAP system the APIs

237
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,530
and we want to try to see what's being
exposed

238
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:01,520
in the save the other is basically this
is the attack at least trying to

239
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,390
breaking through the system right so

240
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:08,390
Iran and not we will see that

241
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,970
im there are some services discovered ex
post

242
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,060
so this could be for example the 8080

243
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,400
missus what dispatcher and ACN

244
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,470
is a web interface but

245
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:26,340
we can do a full on scanning and we will
see that there is another

246
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,550
for

247
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,110
which is open as well this is that's
about it for

248
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:39,080
three tonight it's not and

249
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,660
so busy a disease let let we just have
forsaken and issues of that time to

250
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,730
write and

251
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:48,110
he's tried to break into into a company
went missing the so

252
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,180
he knows they i three inches of that
company

253
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:55,100
exposed to internet or maybe generally
whatever I he doesn't get enough to see

254
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:55,900
what services

255
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,260
is a bride first phase of air of of
their

256
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:02,450
another so what he has said

257
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:07,340
discover is to ports 8080 with a with
this bye week

258
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,910
we'll see what but maybe they've behind
that on a 3299 that sits up bro

259
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:15,550
it's a set this up we'll see so this
could be a typical

260
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,900
and implementation exposing some
services

261
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,160
it to an interest in an

262
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,280
so while it's running in

263
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,210
but the results of this cunning is that
there are only two services

264
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:33,870
one of them is this %uh browder and the
other thing with this but

265
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:39,250
in so we know the hd2 entry points right

266
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:43,210
what we can do right now East

267
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:47,600
we can in try to analyze the security of
their

268
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,670
services that are behind the say

269
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:54,510
IP out a

270
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,590
so we can you say this ploy

271
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:02,200
to analyze the the ports

272
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,870
yeah in week we can use we can analyze
the

273
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:09,510
some powder and also the weather spotter
so

274
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,760
if we connect to the sport we will see
that there is a

275
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:18,440
and I one dispatcher interface is their
web interface

276
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,480
in of the SABC stems

277
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,910
and if we at sis the CPR mean

278
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:29,720
we will see that they reset from and
then shifting from first-class

279
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,610
so an attacker will definitely try
something like

280
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:38,600
these just to give you a handouts on the
way this pleasure

281
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:43,210
we can see in this light swat what they
will do this by juries

282
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,730
so basically it's one of the services
that expose

283
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,130
if you're running as if you will a
vacation you probably have it with the

284
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,370
Spicer day

285
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:54,800
in the next day we see that it would
dispatchers basically sitting

286
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,180
on on the DNC malignancy tambien working
as a reverse proxy

287
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,550
for all our SEP ways obligations so what
Davis

288
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:06,069
Joey now is that that there has covered
sports ace

289
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:09,350
looks now it's a web interface oats
wrong with this butter

290
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:12,390
so he tries let's see if we can break
into through their

291
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:17,410
administration interface so as this is
the first the initial point of contact

292
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,130
with a

293
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:22,380
from with that tag it to the CBC stand
there are some tracy said

294
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,270
could also be retrieved from the sea
initial contact

295
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:30,470
and okay we have two features

296
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:34,550
in there when this butter which are
useful regarding a

297
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:39,200
getting Tracy son doing for n6 one of
them is a security love

298
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,210
and we can it basically a gay

299
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:46,000
events or information regarding 85°c
nonsense

300
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,200
if the attacker E confer yes some

301
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,020
strange character sound centric with it
was he there

302
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:57,040
and also incorrect loan at them a are
also know they are so

303
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,100
it's a in useful information regarding
security

304
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,600
which kind of information that we have
in the in the low 50 s we have date and

305
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,120
time

306
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,960
of course the idea this which could be n

307
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,040
and a BS from the internet or any in

308
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:18,570
untrusted network and then the contents
up their request for fun by that that

309
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:21,670
that's the security no on

310
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,990
the CCM we have this format for all the

311
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,890
in different features that we will see
for each one of the

312
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,960
in features a of logging and tracing

313
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,990
only thing you will have a summary of
the different

314
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:41,500
in in need a shown sound features
provided by these

315
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,110
in tracing passing it is a you I mean
we're not going to go into the detail of

316
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:49,230
every every feature because it's going
to be quite a boring person the other

317
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,020
ways but

318
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:54,120
is for you to take away and see may have
us a reference to go

319
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,150
we to unseat what's this kind of longing

320
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:02,310
trace will be provided so the important
thing about this a cutie love is that

321
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:06,850
in in the ACM thats also as if you will
of the Haitian sober

322
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:09,800
you know what dispatcher that we are
looking at right now is looking a bit

323
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,480
like the full

324
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,310
in the IC NPD's is one of the few traces
the sensor

325
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:18,870
mechanism that this in a big way

326
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:22,100
and then you have the HD video which
actually

327
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,520
register or they the requests the server

328
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,620
so you have also it's the fussy requests
but you also have

329
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,330
request a different applications so you
can trace whether an attempt was trying

330
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,560
to break into a

331
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,750
dangerous obligation to know or a with
the complication for us

332
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,610
it and then you have a in a bit more
information

333
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,610
of course the date and time that the
address a it wastes

334
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:49,610
by mid terrace on so submitted this week

335
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:52,830
we don't know even though I mean we also
questions okay well what we up the

336
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,170
kitchen so we exposing what

337
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:57,150
as if you %uh petitions were exposing
what as if you ever get since people are

338
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:57,740
you seen

339
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,750
to get into the system is chibi also way
to to ELISA

340
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:05,360
I definitely keep it dry cough what
people sweetie you seen

341
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,450
through the web interface yen in the
Summary

342
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,690
something to to buy now these that East
nothing aided by default so

343
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,730
you have to in a min the some purpose is
very soon after they are they gonna

344
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:20,100
achieve log file so alexis Love fight

345
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,310
its pretty much said what you see there
with

346
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:26,680
rich okay

347
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,700
and the second service that the attacker
discover

348
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,760
he say somebody they are going to the
fourth

349
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,610
we can indefinitely think that the setup
router

350
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:42,910
and we win and I said later pay with and
with this but which is an open-source

351
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:47,060
to know that we have in or face so
basically this a boner

352
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:50,790
he said them away to a street access to
this ABC stands

353
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:54,430
through SAT brought a bus okay so
typically it's

354
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:57,740
between an untrusted network and not
just another work

355
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:01,050
and you can restrict which IP addresses
can access which

356
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:05,030
sabc them in the back in so you your
company issue

357
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:08,060
highly likely a sub rosa because

358
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,700
its use by SAP itself to provide you
with its

359
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,100
support services I minders services so

360
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,610
even though you think you may not be
using these its proly think should not

361
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,920
be exposed to the Internet should be
connected to the VPN with SAP

362
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,540
but we find it many times expose
excellent

363
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,560
sweets easier I

364
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,610
and the security of this about at least
he's remember NaCl

365
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:36,430
which you need to configure allowing we
take the IRS can access

366
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:40,590
we to and weeks service and I the other
thing about can

367
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,300
and and if it's not from a lack of the
year there are several attacks that can

368
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,050
be

369
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:48,540
and performed so we have been
researching this

370
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,310
we have published a security
substituting that

371
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:55,630
which is a white paper that you can
don't know from a web-based

372
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:59,220
and some other blog posts regarding
about security

373
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,760
but basically what you can do is you can
a perform

374
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,130
and what's coming in then in the been
systems

375
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:09,450
trying to access see them soon they back
in which I'm not

376
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:13,510
directly exposed to the and trusted
network

377
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:17,200
and so let's see what an attacker

378
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,490
would be able to new I could try to
access the web interface

379
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,370
i mean i mean he was lucky US lacy
enough to

380
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:29,640
switch to the next four to see if it was
easier so he knows trying to

381
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:35,500
see what he may find this up

382
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,020
so a wear and use b-spline

383
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,780
and missus the we are using some scrapes

384
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:48,140
which are basically configuring where is
this %uh browder which is a fourth

385
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:51,170
and and the flying that if trying to
perform a

386
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:54,290
and and scanning through the sub router
so

387
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:58,220
I think I see here and you are we have
been fearing

388
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,540
IP range and they scanning now

389
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,780
so basically I mean we r a senate doctor
we're

390
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:09,520
air Scott in the C 0.1 84 IP address

391
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,560
on with this up rotor spike lee

392
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:16,790
what he say's I want to analyze with the
divorce gone

393
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:20,860
of these targets but you have to bury my
for the same without

394
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:24,140
the as if this is right on the same IP
here you will have

395
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:27,450
they Intel IP address range the company
what

396
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:31,490
that I could guess it's a double life
get raised so did with this could be it

397
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:36,630
a 0 point always nice to me for some say
that and we do a full scan

398
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:40,270
rates this case is except the same one
but won't be

399
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:43,400
so when the attacker tried to reach and
the

400
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,040
see you all 194 IPOs who wasn't able to

401
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,480
access all the services but going
through the subfolder

402
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,410
he actually because the ACL is not
properly configured

403
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:58,470
so you can see that all these services
many of the sour

404
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,520
SEP related services so

405
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,470
if the attacker tries to go directly to

406
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:08,570
election lissy stand for the system with
a with a

407
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:12,490
in subway

408
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:16,050
he's not he's not going to be able to
that

409
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:20,190
you can see here that the the error
message

410
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:24,580
he points they reckoned with to the
system he's not going to be able to

411
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,530
access

412
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:32,080
but if he configures the sub router

413
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,220
the results are going to be different
pay

414
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,990
so he's going through the subfolder and

415
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:42,500
ask this is another point a fund that
between the attacker on the city's East

416
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,050
End

417
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:46,520
there are also traces that could be and
retrieve

418
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,140
and use you know to identify the
attackers in that phase already what

419
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:50,790
we've seen is out

420
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,900
that occur so this a router he fun to
play

421
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,900
beaded sports kind of course come and
discover there was an SABC some kinda

422
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:02,700
I'm thank you configure sup we connects
to the south relative to this ABC's

423
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:07,500
so he's already in the kind of accessing
the services and that's an

424
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,309
so these what how we can do think that
for TV

425
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:14,790
we sup notes if he

426
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,830
depending on the ACL he say accessing

427
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:21,790
and dispatching the bag and but he could
be i've seen any other service

428
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:25,020
like an SSH or Telnet server any other

429
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:29,120
and centerpiece depending on how
misconfigured the ACLU

430
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,200
so as you can see there are tracy's in
the

431
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,320
love find out this about our being
generated

432
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,500
but we can find out these a connect to

433
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,780
this is the connection attend which is
accepted

434
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:45,400
but if they ACN is properly configured
than he with that

435
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,090
permission denied i mean the log files
it would be

436
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,750
register as the the was a circular

437
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:56,450
how how this %uh brother reduces the so
you can go off so they look fights

438
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:00,780
and try to look see get something is
going to love it

439
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,830
and what some other examples like

440
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:07,880
when you try to with three information
from some browder in this also love

441
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,430
euphoric with the night I also love on

442
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:14,790
very important not native connections
when you can

443
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:18,430
use this about our if it's not properly
configured to access

444
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:22,200
any summit in the back and he's voting
for the nice weather

445
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,630
is my best native route

446
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:30,520
so what we did this basically we try to
connect to

447
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,830
different services in the Bakken and

448
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:37,110
their set specific pattern that we can
me take

449
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:40,820
in Delphi's which is permission denied

450
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:44,600
for some services in the backend on the
service

451
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,110
the services could be runs on or
sequentially

452
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:51,440
but you will see a lot of permission
denied on some

453
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,630
a accepted basically

454
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:58,020
amino sleep then you have they

455
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:01,440
the game we decided that I could be
doing these very slow

456
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,000
I was yes any foreskin this Google under
the radar but

457
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,110
if that agrees not smart enough you you
can see the dates right you can see that

458
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:13,140
in there very same sick on they someone

459
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,720
I've been trying to go into all
different and forth from the same from

460
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,040
the same source IP

461
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,510
I said that's very easy to spot us us
this is not a human

462
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:24,710
behind that's something we outta made it
going behind and trying to reach out to

463
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,880
boss imports

464
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,330
so we got him it's a see if you trying
to access through this offer out there

465
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:31,840
we

466
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,860
we may be that I think he may be able to
get

467
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,059
okay again summary this %uh broder love

468
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:42,880
if nothing anybody for you have to
configure the if I named

469
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,850
yeah some other limitations but they
reset feature do that

470
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:53,340
so if you are using this about a you
should have you see me

471
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:58,780
okay so the next in the next thing that
the attackers going to

472
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:02,950
try East he has access to this if you
see them

473
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:06,760
so he would try to brute force for
example the lobbying

474
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:11,290
so he size like beirut for SAP systems

475
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:15,760
if you never heard it before

476
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:21,090
on I believe it or not its I think every
time we have done an assessment we find

477
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:24,630
it is easy for you sir accounts with SAP
system I saw you sir

478
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:27,630
that its if we default password at

479
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:31,240
so if a possible site so okay with would
I will be

480
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,090
prolly the first think you will try if
he gets to our recipes

481
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:38,340
so if if he's lucky enough you with a
the you sir

482
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:41,850
account in maybe not in a bucket

483
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:45,640
client but pain one of the flood plains

484
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,900
so he he say will to live he has access
to the assembly

485
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:54,140
and execute transaction according to the
official

486
00:28:54,140 --> 00:29:01,140
week actually when our would be an issue

487
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:09,060
we lost chief

488
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:21,320
lose axis he'll prolly

489
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,610
create their by the user for him to be
able to access need their own

490
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:31,610
with with highest religious faith

491
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:39,740
a.m.

492
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:43,690
so he's great in the the use air she
will assigned himself all

493
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:48,720
releases that's the highest that you sir
have so that he doesn't perform any

494
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,400
kinda of any kind of business activity
or

495
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:59,400
the system idols

496
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:09,390
the user

497
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:16,390
no

498
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:45,169
have I see is it because some input
validation

499
00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:48,840
and SL

500
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:55,409
it safe

501
00:30:55,409 --> 00:30:58,820

doing like feeling the love

547
00:33:49,649 --> 00:33:53,270
right banding doing the actual nasty
things

548
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:56,440
up the city's then

549
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:01,590
knows who is taller usually Asian
sororities

550
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:04,710
ok I'll his opposition

551
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:08,230
DDC you have any saudi-ization change
documents

552
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:11,570
he said to this name before his

553
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:16,230
any sway is both you have all the
information

554
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:19,770
changed his profile laws love is a
shambles

555
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:24,070
user creation your users so doesn't
listen

556
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:27,379
in the use it robust you

557
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:31,139
is it changes million so that's

558
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:35,080
also this from that sense

559
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:40,000
and sits on is you know if

560
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:47,000
CZ hook which is great so you're always
happens and information

561
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:50,349
yeah then another also very very

562
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:54,020
doesn't intention on

563
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:57,320
fuji's the the LGBT mississippi

564
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,270
to registered changes sprinted if you
have

565
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:04,280
just going to use you got to see you

566
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:10,570
the states to be nor you see if the as a
so basically if the set

567
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:14,710
any kind of that I can only find
business tables like I don't great cars

568
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:17,660
or change in bed their bank accounts and
things like that directly

569
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:21,109
if that they will change log in EC naval
that

570
00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:24,510
is not by default again so so these I
diesel

571
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:27,920
what this one is not by default you
would be able to

572
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,720
to log these changes into tables I see
the old value on the new body of

573
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,330
a beer a court that was modified so it's

574
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:39,770
stored in database as well so you have a
big table with all the changes

575
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:44,560
to it a bust which are loath on

576
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,640
you can access through SC you 3

577
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,810
on the

578
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:55,010
okay let's see one lasted a feature
before the next mr.

579
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:59,760
which is the change documents so we have
seen security until

580
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,589
we have seen change documents for the
association's which is in a min by

581
00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:04,260
default

582
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,760
we have seen change date they will
change nothing which is not

583
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,170
enabled by default but you can call fear
you can enable the stand choose the

584
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:11,849
tables

585
00:36:11,849 --> 00:36:15,300
just also the clients which you can log
and

586
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:19,980
start registering changes to the stables
and then you have change documents

587
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,410
change documents the same oriented a

588
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:26,460
to record changes

589
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:31,160
to logical options okay so let's say
that you want to register changes to a

590
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,240
purchase order

591
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,780
or any other basis information this can
be configured with change documents

592
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:41,710
and any change to these all shakes
specific fields in the subjects

593
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:44,920
with me register on stored in database
as well

594
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,970
so this is very is fully if you need to
all the

595
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:52,220
some may basis function 10 or some
business information

596
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:55,520
you can enable these and you will be
registering all the

597
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,619
basis information in the day to recess
while

598
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:01,839
so these are the two tables which are
being field

599
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,710
CE see the for change document cather
and false

600
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:08,750
and you can access also with the report
the

601
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,770
the information that is Garrett

602
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:14,780
see

603
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:18,630
why that record is like trying to
brute-force at it us for

604
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:22,450
on creating the user how that is
reflected on this exists

605
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:25,790
made how we can that do a forensic
analysis and i dont

606
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:31,430
and try to take a kind of activities

607
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:36,480
so let's say that we discover through
some powder onto the subway Julie

608
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,050
a.m. that there is someone trying to
access the system's

609
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:47,050
on let's see if he was able to something

610
00:37:47,089 --> 00:37:50,640
so as analysis of their

611
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,410
security love this is this a good idea
though

612
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:57,520
this %uh the Los generated for the
security at low

613
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,710
so you can see NEC Naveen falling able

614
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:04,099
air for every a user on every client so
we

615
00:38:04,099 --> 00:38:08,569
where just saying everything so we can
see

616
00:38:08,569 --> 00:38:12,660
a successful on which is I guess it's
mine

617
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:16,580
and we can see here to be resource
creative

618
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:21,710
authorizations for two by users changes
so this is these are the records

619
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:25,099
that were generated when they attack
o'grady the you sir

620
00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:28,230
in the system I we can also see day

621
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:31,700
fail on attempt I just tested

622
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:35,540
so that that's a very also that's good a

623
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,980
it's a very convenient the are
interesting

624
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:42,030
by the right you have a little faith
maybe a few little face and it looks and

625
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:42,319
sex

626
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:46,510
successful right after we so it's known
to correlate that that could be

627
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:51,330
it was bothering to take that kinda and
integration of the use of course

628
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:55,010
so this is one way to this cover the
situation

629
00:38:55,010 --> 00:39:02,010
but if we include the USOC 02 for
example in detail a changeling

630
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:11,349
we can also see that

631
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:15,560
so we can see it that's a very essence
of was created so this is another

632
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,520
feature another long make an easy

633
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:23,480
which is an able

634
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:28,599
but you also have a report

635
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:32,490
to see the a you sir change documents

636
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:38,819
use authorization change documents

637
00:39:38,819 --> 00:39:44,240
and it see if their server record their

638
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,430
profit okay yet it's here so

639
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:51,839
we used three different ways to take Dez
usurpation

640
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:55,109
in depending and which once you have
been able

641
00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:58,380
in you can have different races and
information

642
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:02,250
as and some provide I mean as his soul
v4 in this accused adult

643
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:05,400
that only said that the usual decisions
were changed

644
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,609
but here with a change documents for use
our invitations you can see

645
00:40:08,609 --> 00:40:12,140
actually that it was this is it was a
site with support privileges

646
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:15,630
right so that's obviously at more much
usually

647
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:18,750
detail information that that we need to
achieve

648
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:23,060
and you don't have here a for example it
turning out the source that amino

649
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:26,880
or the source IP address from which the
attacker connected to

650
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,970
okay create the US so you have to kind
of use em all

651
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,450
and correlated to get the full picture

652
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:37,830
so Latino let's say is

653
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:41,160
yet so we million right we we went to
spot some key so

654
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,359
of his activities so it's a know that
the car was too

655
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:49,060
there the some scenes their I mean she
got access to see said she created

656
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:49,549
thereby

657
00:40:49,549 --> 00:40:52,710
dewey's account no keys a

658
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:56,170
doing some them to try to do business
truck right so he's trying to the two

659
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:57,850
payments for instance

660
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:02,740
so payments or this kind of a systems
are made at many times integrated

661
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:06,049
at with sabc since its low what's called
SAP gateway

662
00:41:06,049 --> 00:41:10,260
its and this basically our interfaces to
other seasons make a swift

663
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:14,430
interface so that doctor goes to the
same 59 transection

664
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,819
he says reviewing all the connections
that the system cuts

665
00:41:17,819 --> 00:41:21,920
unsettling to see that there is a swift
pavements interface

666
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,410
on dot well this is going very taking
also we gonna get sold so much in detail

667
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:26,850
but

668
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:29,930
basically a she would see in that

669
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:33,619
face their what's called a air

670
00:41:33,619 --> 00:41:37,290
deep in a moderate program I the of dot
in it's a to make it easy of that

671
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:37,990
interface

672
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:42,799
right so X actually what we talkin 2007

673
00:41:42,799 --> 00:41:46,839
in like it was mostly at docs against
this kind of thing for us to do that is

674
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:47,589
by default

675
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:51,350
your day yeah unprotected so now we see
what the Tekkit

676
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:55,750
at would be doing to exploit a so we
went to show that these woulda

677
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:59,640
at some charts are some some animations
so basically half

678
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,960
this would be there how this if the
system is working today took us an XML

679
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,000
nurses sever

680
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,530
with that program i do. TP name

681
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:10,780
registered a.s.a.p gateway and every
time there's a payment

682
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:14,260
that's going over day and

683
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:17,560
dot regular always knew that this eve to
the legitimate

684
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,569
16 to face but what I can do is

685
00:42:21,569 --> 00:42:24,869
block the connection to that interface
we we call these

686
00:42:24,869 --> 00:42:28,460
evil twin and this is a key between
because he can basically reduced her

687
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,390
himself

688
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:33,049
there is no authentication to do that he
can produce section self

689
00:42:33,049 --> 00:42:36,680
use in the same AUD us the original
interface

690
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:40,130
so how the SAP gateway it works

691
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:43,580
when they say new request that would be
sent to him

692
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:47,359
right so he would be getting that
information at: may also be

693
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,730
able to differences in mind me that so
he would just leave i jus a target bank

694
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:51,530
account

695
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:55,089
if you will get it the Munchkin so

696
00:42:55,089 --> 00:42:58,339
how can we spot that how can we detect
that

697
00:42:58,339 --> 00:43:02,430
and in in day get in there in SAP system
looks

698
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:06,339
so this is if we neighbors this EP
gateway love

699
00:43:06,339 --> 00:43:09,990
we may see something like this we will
see some previous records

700
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:13,450
on then we see basically did

701
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:18,980
the two teammates RFC severed this
interface been registered to the Gateway

702
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:22,170
but then we see another connection

703
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:25,770
another server with the same name

704
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:29,540
Cup but coming from a different host and
and that's like a run the IP address

705
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,240
that

706
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,260
that we don't know right so this could
be a good way for us

707
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:37,700
I mean this be actually one of the few
ways we have

708
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:41,480
to detect these activities because if
you

709
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,140
take the look fights on this ABC stand
itself on that on the to section

710
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:48,299
have luck fights you will see that they
there

711
00:43:48,299 --> 00:43:51,549
the payment went to the right interface
this other

712
00:43:51,549 --> 00:43:55,490
like technical attacks can only be
reducer

713
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:58,600
if we are taking again we loved
unfortunately

714
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:03,510
by default the Gateway least not enabled
again so

715
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:07,220
but but we got him again right we'll be
able to get it

716
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:10,430
was worth it so whether easy willing for

717
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:14,040
not only to take the set that's what all
the facts we have been talking about on

718
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:14,660
on

719
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:18,760
2007 and some in other presentations
I'll Otero see

720
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:22,589
connections um you have seen the kind of
information

721
00:44:22,589 --> 00:44:25,960
that you can get from there so

722
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,619
yes see I mentioned before this is not
enabled by default

723
00:44:29,619 --> 00:44:33,089
so you should enable dot and and there
are some

724
00:44:33,089 --> 00:44:36,450
settings that you also need to define if
you want to fight to update if you want

725
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:40,510
defy every fly you fight to be created
every everyday sorry

726
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:44,080
or how do you want to restrict that but
we definitely encourage you to

727
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:47,760
tool in even it will I'd do it with

728
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,450
we've got a scare because if any of the
field there said you find this could

729
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:52,319
really be

730
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:55,530
growing very fussy if you have it ABC

731
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:59,510
CBC some to say when many interfaces

732
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:05,520
so this way to see the draw some
conclusions from from this

733
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,960
fortunately yeah we cannot go over we
realized

734
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,170
when brand is that we cannot ever color
teasing a one-hour talk

735
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:16,830
so we had to leave several looking to
make any sense out of stock

736
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:20,589
what it would be like yet actually there

737
00:45:20,589 --> 00:45:26,080
several other Nate deeply technical a.m.
records charity the basie be

738
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,450
you have the system will only have a
system traces you have the developer

739
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:30,170
traces

740
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:33,230
for each service you have the SQL all
the

741
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:38,500
so there several other in Nokes being
generated that could be useful

742
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,930
in but one left a other for the
presentation because

743
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:45,260
when not so focused on on getting Tracy
self

744
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:48,390
the say type of attacks but the sorrow
somebody

745
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:53,150
and p.m. in most of them for use its to
know they're letting everybody falls

746
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:57,210
I also what we did in colour was attacks
all looks in the Java

747
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:00,580
stocks such jealousies and they have
holiday different the

748
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:04,049
Logan make any sense that that a is
important also

749
00:46:04,049 --> 00:46:08,910
for you too the attentions ok

750
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:12,750
yep church we in that they just lights
we will include the release of their

751
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:16,150
of those actually we we will include the

752
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:19,970
Lake because we actually these for every
every

753
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:22,970
metal to include a summary of all day
actually

754
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:27,750
kind of snare looks at you can get on
yeah that's a great idea

755
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:31,240
so so when you get the slights on the
website in to pursue a sec you'll see

756
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:34,790
all their so on their them against

757
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:38,080
a.m. so as we saw us we

758
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:42,280
sold their several features provided by
SEP that can help us

759
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:46,270
to detect this suspicious activities and
support forensic analysis

760
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:50,660
something that I sometimes I really
don't

761
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:54,290
and for the same I don't I we we decide
when people say that

762
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:58,460
look Sony only useful if you review that
at many people say no I don't know why I

763
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:01,140
want to be able to secure the law
because no one's going to be reviewing

764
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:02,240
it anyway

765
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,250
I think it still is useful to have the
locks eyes because

766
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:08,930
it's a way where you can go back to if
there is something if you up

767
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:12,010
eventually detected it was something run
right

768
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:17,330
so I would steal ok anyway because they
go so far for foreign six proposals

769
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:21,940
the end maybe not be unit may not be the
king at like in real time police you can

770
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:22,690
go

771
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:25,970
a house information to check for a.m.

772
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:29,359
the problem with most of this feature is
that they are not enabled by default

773
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:32,670
on yet most of the customers we work
with

774
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:36,569
the are not they'll have it and then
enabled

775
00:47:36,569 --> 00:47:39,940
a.m. so it's very important for you to
understand the limitations go to be sick

776
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:40,190
of

777
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:43,560
each of these methods that way we
include these summaries of

778
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:47,599
each one so you got hired as a reference
unlike a centralized because

779
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,819
I waz going through all this it be the
condition can be a bit

780
00:47:50,819 --> 00:47:54,010
a trouble some so is a

781
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:57,710
I think it a good reference for you to
keep I but also important for you to

782
00:47:57,710 --> 00:48:00,920
a nice day performers impact of enable
them

783
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,200
fighting yeah I think God I kind of
sadik

784
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:09,580
before but if it's already difficult to
see if our services and has been

785
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:13,750
a how to compromise if we are not
recording if we're not in a bowling

786
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:17,359
the way seabees providing us to come but
help us with this task

787
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:21,000
then it's really impossible so we'll
never realize I what we show we fought

788
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:21,580
about it

789
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:24,720
the two independents that's something
you'll never

790
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:28,970
be able to get if you're not having that
the right looks like simplex

791
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:32,520
so it something for us to think about
and and and

792
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:36,180
maybe best if we got an A with us know
so we can a and ice

793
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:39,710
even sing sing in real time so

794
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:43,720
without we I think we are with time

795
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,330
here we go out seven minutes so

796
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:54,330
I any questions that's you may have

797
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:59,230
yeah that's as a question is if it
supports centralized million

798
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:02,500
most of the most of the mechanism do not

799
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:06,799
so you got out how this is what I say
doesn't like export to see slow or

800
00:49:06,799 --> 00:49:07,880
something like that

801
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:11,180
on is a great as well like this accused
at a low for instance

802
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:14,400
that saving a/c synchronous way so if
you neighbor that

803
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,049
every time the user is doing something
just waiting to buy conferred a lot to

804
00:49:18,049 --> 00:49:18,880
be returned

805
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:25,880
so as way in may affect the performance

806
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:30,190
all gets very old ever use email

807
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:33,540
NJ radio reopen West your own

808
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:34,760
it

809
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:38,460
the actually I would be a good I feature
at the screen for us to %ah to

810
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:41,800
at their in certain blocks you can again
we love

811
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:45,710
you can do it in their security other
love you can define which kind of going

812
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:50,069
to want to log and developer traces a
swell developer trees as well there's

813
00:49:50,069 --> 00:49:53,720
but there are others out there like like
a white but

814
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:57,880
yeah I think most of them car some
featuring like the they would dispatcher

815
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,950
what that this approach that you don't
by the way these fighter

816
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:04,460
you do have you can define what kind of
information you look if you want to know

817
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:05,420
the contents

818
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:12,420
of the request not is it was that sir

819
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:18,310
yet dick yeah it's very that the good
one but two is very

820
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:21,440
flexing that as you can like I think
like

821
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,450
maybe 60 Somali fighters like okay I
want to look every connection and I

822
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:26,319
would just look

823
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:30,060
like excellent connections I want to the
Irish Sea calls

824
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:37,000
so it's very good and

825
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,329
I'll a at all he is a

826
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:44,700
hier is its a basically the same here

827
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:48,400
yeah effort in this note kind of
integrity checks on the locks provided

828
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,410
from SAP itself

829
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:52,420
and ever

830
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:56,170
but the thing is that in some of the
slow so

831
00:50:56,170 --> 00:51:00,829
are stored in database and many other
South say the end if I system

832
00:51:00,829 --> 00:51:04,270
so if you have see the DM in

833
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:09,000
you can modify anything but you can
create your own use a refund

834
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,750
you are like calling this a teeth and
dental said today in a city like

835
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:15,940
yeah basically when we talk before load
the OS on the data base layers so

836
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:19,770
I think they're actually if you go
through those layers that will never be

837
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:20,490
traducir

838
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:24,060
on that is if you look but so is he
crazy you said that a clean the database

839
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:27,700
these noisy below that would be detected
so an

840
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:31,300
and even I mean you can go directly to
let me some more and more the fight and

841
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,750
the let congress from their log

842
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:36,140
tables to if he cuts that that the level
of religious

843
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:41,020
its pre-match it said s

844
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:45,400
which

845
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,750
with sorry cm cm

846
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:51,910
seemed to get Soria yet they are

847
