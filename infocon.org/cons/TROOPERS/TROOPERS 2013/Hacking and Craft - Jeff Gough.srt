1
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:09,390
okay hi everyone and was talking about
hiking and Croft

2
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,589
so i've a electronic engineer

3
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:16,100
mostly a was for the kind of mechanical
hacker

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,500
a things and ans

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,490
currently studying to become a product
finer I'm it so the local as well as in

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,010
London

7
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:28,420
learning how to make RT shit like like
this a

8
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,300
so when you talk about crafting hacking
a people immediately

9
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,550
think about 3d printing is the as the
conservative confluence point between

10
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,340
other potential were packing and
printing stuff out into

11
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:46,000
into the 3d physical world a but in this
talk a lot of folks look more on

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,320
%uh low-tech so just before Christmas my
friend Connie

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,010
within by then and she was trying to get
this

14
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,060
keychain engraved with some mathematical
symbols

15
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,440
seems like a pretty pretty simple job
you take a 20 gravest

16
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,720
given the mission they should engrave it
but

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,079
a fortune you re engravers were set up
to either Stumpf

18
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,340
I with a I excessive metal stamps

19
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,590
ages that means a for you can certainly
some accents as well

20
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:18,009
and couldn't handle mathematical symbols
hot I am

21
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:21,240
she went to industrial laser engravers

22
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,490
they had some no problem engraving and
the a

23
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:28,270
any any shape possible ways that affect
the phone app but they couldn't deal

24
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:28,780
with

25
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,700
constructing the artwork in the right
file format so despite the fact that the

26
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,219
the technology is the is is progressing
after being

27
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:39,990
in the world laser cutting it without it
was impossible to Justin gave a simple

28
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,549
keychain

29
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:44,979
about two hundred years ago if you go to
any engraver shop on the corner

30
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:49,869
UX find a guy like this who would be
great hit with a hammer and chisel

31
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:53,569
and you could have almost any design if
you're seizing

32
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:57,130
engraved on the spot for somehow where

33
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,669
overall technology is the votes were
also for guessing some

34
00:02:00,669 --> 00:02:03,840
existing technologies that work lush

35
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,500
more powerful in certain ways sir

36
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,870
I something the hacking is a former
Croft

37
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,939
Packers I'm calls people have I think
very much the same mine says

38
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:19,290
we've both focus on that the setting
things

39
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,510
and we I think both the things for

40
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,370
for the love doing a good job so it's
more Michael P

41
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,079
in 10 makes it economic ought to
timekeeping sense for

42
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:36,239
for us to design piece of software to be
extra modular and really extensible and

43
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,349
clean elegant

44
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:41,120
but we do it for the same we do it just
for its own

45
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,099
to the internal eighty doesn't
necessarily sorry official necessary but

46
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:45,680
it's a

47
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,269
we do if the love and that's definitely
something that the cross the forty

48
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:55,569
I'm I think hackers can lay in front of
people who I think of you can go from

49
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:56,170
hackers

50
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:00,670
and we can both end of a six-speed doing
the same kinds of things

51
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:04,030
so the first section is about using
hacking tools

52
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,900
for better Croft I wanna talk about it
Jeff Francis

53
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,420
I've gotta for takes all the moment a
have been working for Fears

54
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,640
reverse engineering inkjet printers to
make them a

55
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,609
much more powerful 3d printers so
favoring differences

56
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:23,209
work this way you have a a an incredible
ah

57
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:26,340
up on the left the a and being phased
out into a

58
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,469
a chamber where is heated rapidly and
get the checks its

59
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:32,790
by the the force of creating the steam
behind the drop is essentially

60
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:36,620
there's also this kind which is a pesar
electric

61
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,909
membrane seeking to flex duplex this
little membrane electrically

62
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:44,359
and then pump out a little chocolate
like that on us could drop

63
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:47,819
on going on Pisa printing this is a
crazy

64
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:51,349
you can go it's a media arts or a PC
world or whatever

65
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:54,749
a pickup a printer like this a for

66
00:03:54,749 --> 00:03:58,999
yeah about forty erased possibly even
see for now and it can

67
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:03,889
second deposits for picking me to drop
this site tying a tiny droplets

68
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:08,040
huge degree of precision a its
instructors and got up I'm not sure

69
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,560
about

70
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,609
19 microns your hair is about fifty or

71
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:16,200
or 70 microns wide so it's the pretty
incredible that we can pick this

72
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,219
technology up for

73
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,560
such a low cost but the the question is

74
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,400
can we help this technology thing
achieve more

75
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,470
this is a very much a razor blades
business model

76
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,420
where the the the printer is sold
possibly it's a loss

77
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,070
to get you into a relationship with
manufacture

78
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,170
where you have to buy more more Inc
Andean cultures the

79
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:42,910
almost as expensive as the printer but
there's an opportunity obviously if we

80
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:43,800
can get for the

81
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,060
interface to the printhead and harness
this really high tech

82
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,340
printing technology to print of sherry
materials

83
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,310
maybe if you're into by attacking you
could use its print DNA arrays for

84
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,430
at the NASA a if you're a

85
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,200
took off to like me you might wanna
Prince Eltham I wax and use a pic of

86
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,610
things as well so applications

87
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,940
so anything on these machines the policy
see

88
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,590
a what are these print-outs which have
in this case for

89
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:14,330
teacher accepting red find reasons
yellow and black

90
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,940
inks and then on the other side a this
is the print plate

91
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,580
he might possibly not we'll see on this
projects over there's a

92
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,940
a paraffin gray lines down the middle is
always love

93
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:30,160
a inkjets I'm from print head nozzles

94
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,400
and though ninety

95
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,680
locals in align almost very very type it
I think that's about 20 meters wide

96
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,300
and then that is mighty black novels and
then 30 30 30

97
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,910
sign was entering its a very very high
density agnosio sup

98
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,050
print rapidly if you take it apart
further

99
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,800
that's what if it looks like and this is
what it looks like from the back

100
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,120
I can see the three ports for the colors
the 14 for the black

101
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,260
and this electrical interface here and
on that shit

102
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,300
on us flexible circuit board in the
middle that's all target

103
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,500
thats chip have a serial interface to
the or

104
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,770
yesterday mix serial and parallel
interface to the printer

105
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:15,440
and in family has some a multiplexing

106
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,740
which it uses to switch on to the
different levels we want what we want to

107
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,090
do

108
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:23,040
is a drive the print head is very low
levels so that we can

109
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,610
directly control over those whom we have
more access over the hardware consider

110
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,790
having just have

111
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:31,250
at scene photographs the mood or E-coli
mojito

112
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,260
some bullshit we just want to be noted
directly controlled in those

113
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:39,060
so that's that's the goal every girl in
a little bit closer

114
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,800
a we can see me this is appealing the
partying in five different had you can

115
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,620
see how the

116
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,750
how the ink is distributed from the
input port of into

117
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,090
up to little funny holes you can see
that the amount over

118
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,120
refinements and engineering complexity
in these

119
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,530
in the spring has is really incredible
and it's acceptable for

120
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,630
no money so definitely a good a good
hack

121
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:06,200
platform so there we're going to be able
to supply laboratory materials for the

122
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,140
printhead relevant issues the couch is
that we supplied

123
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,930
so I made with the reservoir Malave and

124
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,310
melts at the about the print head on

125
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,630
awesome so here we can see up

126
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:24,870
printer the places things interesting
stuff cook a

127
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:29,290
so I wanted to prints liquid wax on life

128
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:32,790
on my platform because I opens up
potentially 3d printing if you're pretty

129
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,280
tiny droplets they've

130
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,800
a a fellow file a Form

131
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,830
voice though is that material you can
make a.m.

132
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,340
quite complicated 3d structures with
opening tip printer

133
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,730
anything a lights a plume rise UV
polymer or

134
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,810
just directly using something like
blacks which you can heat up

135
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,900
Jets and says and that has an advantage
over conventional into

136
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,560
inc's because think tanks or suspension
a pigment particles

137
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,120
in the a liquid carrier and not the sort
of your problems with a into its getting

138
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,010
blocks and

139
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:09,440
Epson printers are famous for getting
blocks continuously because they have

140
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,110
the separation over

141
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,900
the intake of fish from the in Egypt I'm

142
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,620
a printhead which means the pin is very
high quality because the cultures

143
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,370
already just a dumb buckets in with the
engineering is in the printer

144
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,320
but obviously it means that be the pain
has compiled over just printing liquid

145
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:26,780
wax

146
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,090
it's no problem there are no pigment
particles we can just heat up the wax

147
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:33,849
and its liquid so there's a little
heater

148
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:38,140
sec ago I made this is a a big power
transistor which is essentially just

149
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:38,940
being used

150
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,370
as a heater just short of the transistor
in control occurrence

151
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:45,880
and they have a heater and then just
next to is the temperature sensor

152
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,340
and a a little bit of control
electronics see set the temperature

153
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,470
a you can see that the the

154
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:57,340
he's a part of it works you know what
actually comes out also that was easy

155
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,630
next business which I ataxia the pinhead
itself so

156
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:04,390
because the ports a very small we needed
a kinda gasket material for

157
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:09,220
officially gotten so we just use the
later cuz its cuz else a little caskets

158
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,290
I also a double sided sticky tape for
the second half

159
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:16,210
a really cheap quick khaki wave doing
some kind of

160
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,730
almost microfluidic assembly

161
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:23,650
if there's a the print head with the
gaskets a oh and yes but didn't actually

162
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:24,530
work

163
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:28,140
have because the because I have a V
double sided tape fails very quickly

164
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,260
with the

165
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,520
being overheated in separate so then we
tried

166
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,280
a silicone sealant from a being
deposited by

167
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,790
stenciling its release cut and sew
sweetie over the Senseo and then

168
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:45,030
you've got your precision silicone
gasket and now works for a little while

169
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,330
but eventually became became

170
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,430
and that's the main problem with this
machine moment this is very leaky so you

171
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,630
have any ideas for better feeling

172
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,900
they let me go finally eleven upon some
place a couple other gaskets and some

173
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,100
mechanical

174
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,730
confessions if it wins place and let us
about work

175
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:06,150
so reverse engineering electrical
interface there's been a few times this

176
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,980
in the past

177
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,480
for various Epson printers a
particularly the possum for Chase recall

178
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,300
this is a DNA printer

179
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,610
a cove where an American University

180
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,300
it it turns out that's the a

181
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:26,060
inkjet printers are a very well-used
research tool of people use them

182
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,740
particularly in and biotechnology
usually they use

183
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:34,080
up in the city research grades machines
that it may be a few hundred thousand

184
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,060
follows um and really they have almost
identical

185
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,180
capability to your 40 euro a

186
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,260
medium large printer terms if the
chocolate sizing

187
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,330
everything but the be only difference
between two couples

188
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,620
if the the said the party platform is

189
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,040
it was like to be hackable is something
that you can I'll

190
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,400
adjust the to the kind of driveway forms
to just how the

191
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,400
how different things like was work it's
just exactly like the

192
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,980
Epson printer but you just have more
access so the question is can we buy

193
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,170
reverse engineering re

194
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,279
Epson printer create a korchi style

195
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:13,470
packable platform for less than a few
hundred thousand dollars

196
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:17,010
India a spoiler the author is yes

197
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,620
so the first place to look when your
service engineer peace effect consumer

198
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,290
electronics

199
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:25,140
is look at the patents reading them is
exceptionally painful and I would

200
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,390
recommend doing that

201
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,680
but if you just look at the pictures you
can begin to get a a an idea what's

202
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,250
going on

203
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:35,540
this is the election in space between
the the printer and the printhead

204
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,540
it consists of a a to Serial Bus is

205
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,860
for byculla and black tater

206
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,470
I'm not entirely sure why the set for
this is probably some luv

207
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,810
a.m. auctions Rizzo gradually evolving

208
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:54,660
the stand is back and forth the
different different platforms

209
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:59,630
a also the top be this is a an analog
wait for which is actually delivered to

210
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,050
the

211
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:03,770
the PC a membrane actuator the soaring

212
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:07,230
the first flight so the as a the

213
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:11,890
ramp goes up that's the a very much maps
onto the physical motion

214
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,950
if the diaphragm moving up to fuck in
the ink and that

215
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:18,320
moved up slowly and then that rapid
downwards

216
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,830
a of the curve is the dropping injected

217
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:27,210
and as the flood recovery for the but I
found to be back up again

218
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,740
said just by controlling the shape of
this I love wait for

219
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,140
we can control the motion if the
printhead

220
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,940
and potentially adapts to different
kinds of things that different

221
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,220
different periodic properties

222
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,680
and you can see the the this patent is
talking about having

223
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,020
different parts of the printing cycles
that you can pretty actually different I

224
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,170
i misses a topless

225
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:53,310
and have different levels of grayscale
just completely nuts better for my

226
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:57,750
fly thing I was any interest in getting
Inc out different have nothing more

227
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,700
so here it is a the kindest domestic
level a

228
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,760
the top we have a away form and in that
controller IC which was the

229
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,630
a the small brown objects on the
flexible circuit board

230
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:13,180
on that something will be able to
control internally has

231
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,490
control over some switches and
essentially multiplexes the analog

232
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,520
waveform

233
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,900
on for the different droplet firing
missiles

234
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,250
and by setting up the image they serve
the serial bus you connect

235
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,810
for example we know the second third and
fifth novel for the high voltage

236
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:30,779
and then when you give it the high
voltage spike outcomes being from the

237
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,180
image

238
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,070
now look set up print data bus on the
left this thing which I to hack

239
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,630
so they'll also have a really cheap open
source

240
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:44,070
packing tools available this is the open
bench logic sniffer which is a really

241
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,250
cheap things about

242
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,980
thirty-year a a quite high speed power
help of sniffer

243
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,420
I just attach to between the printer in
the print heads his bedroom asking see

244
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,070
that

245
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:59,110
with me printer with me USB connection
coming in from my laptop in the existing

246
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,370
printer control board there

247
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,760
and about Justin's affected the ribbon
cable that leads to the printhead

248
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:09,940
and a task that logic sniffer which is
in the middle Asus capturing some traces

249
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,360
for this is the this is the the traces
captured from the a

250
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,839
from the print head and I was very happy
to see that they lined up

251
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:20,230
pretty closely with both in the patent
so immediately I was able to figure out

252
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,470
what the different

253
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:26,200
I'm signals were a and I built my own
piece of hardware to

254
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:31,089
to try to replicate those signals this
is basically a kind of

255
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:34,930
flexible development platform for
controlling

256
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:38,089
the shape of the analog I'm way forms
that

257
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:42,480
delivered to the top clips /a drivers
and also for just love

258
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,460
um adopting the Paulo bosses as as
necessary so the moment this doesn't

259
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,060
have reserve USB interface for anything
it just takes

260
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,720
a prefect image which you load onto it a
let

261
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,779
produces the Creek Drive signals

262
00:14:56,779 --> 00:15:00,350
that's for my way my away forms look
like play a

263
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,980
II Section inspiration from the date
sheet but from the apartment and also

264
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,980
from the

265
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,770
a.m. from the way from that I recorded
from the Epson printer

266
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:13,680
but I found the printing the wax was
very different from printing the

267
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,110
water-based Inc find a buyer about with
the the shape of the way form to

268
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,060
tries to get anything out of print head
but I did manage to eventually I guess

269
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,649
and drop it out

270
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:28,200
and its thermal is quite a flexible
working for for love

271
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,459
released Olivia the the materials if
you're interested in designing your own

272
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:34,120
and hacking your own printer

273
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,370
potentially has yellow portion a

274
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,800
a memory attached to it digital to
analog converter

275
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,290
a high voltage amplifier a so you can
actually

276
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:47,500
this visa way for the directly
synthesized from every

277
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,560
you can you can actually just see on the
on the slow possible trace

278
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,410
individual bits in the a in the way for
step-by-step so we have really any shape

279
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,880
way for we like

280
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,800
and about that makes it quite flexible
for printing different materials

281
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,300
so this is the complete attacking
packing powerful we've got my

282
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,750
a my control interface their next to is
the temperature control over this

283
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,410
maintaining the the printhead 54 degrees

284
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:17,970
a.m. and then there's the be will
mechanics is just harvested from

285
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,520
a couple of printers and put back
together again your VM

286
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,110
that backing board also have a couple a
stepper motor drivers as well so it can

287
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:28,779
to the motion control part as well so
results

288
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:32,290
a this is the LEGO brick and on under
the microscope

289
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:36,700
a if we see if you can see that we've
inkjet in just its allies wax their

290
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,920
on for some observed a copper substrate
was interested in using the wax is a a

291
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:46,110
as a service for printing circuit boards
as well as for printing 3d wax objects

292
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:49,480
thought I was pretty little actual to
copper to see how the a how materials

293
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,760
such together

294
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:56,250
this is my favorite photo is of some
tiny 3d structures

295
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,790
a made out of laxity the tiny droplets
fuck

296
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:02,810
stocked up each one is 1000 drops

297
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:06,399
hi and again this is also for the leg or
breaks you can see that the

298
00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:09,610
the technology is capable of some pretty
ridiculous a

299
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:12,759
3d revolution and this was after

300
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:15,860
obscene also I they should it so well I
was really lucky a

301
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,879
as soon as I could get away from the
right shape to get blacks actually to

302
00:17:18,879 --> 00:17:20,059
come out a thing

303
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:23,449
speculated recover it for in and and
this is what I came up with those

304
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:26,879
I was very happy I think there's a lot
over potential for taking a quiet if

305
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,059
ever

306
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:32,590
that's a close-up view follow these
things

307
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:37,690
pretty crazy I had those lucky enough to
have access to

308
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,690
a go to university professors friends
with

309
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:44,980
a composite microscope set up so this is
gonna come visit me too

310
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,320
locals the photos a different focus
that's the case we see the 3d structure

311
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,559
thing quite nicely

312
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,679
a.m. here it is printed out onto a

313
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,190
a piece of copper rose to print a solid
square head

314
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:00,769
other than one st I actually came out
with the individual was the initial

315
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:02,820
print calls is a bit messy but

316
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,320
for this there's always the quiet hi to
the resolution a accessible as well for

317
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:06,929
making

318
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:12,009
second both potentially I thought I try
to print this out with his lawyer

319
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:15,590
this is my pre flashed a third occasions
my controller foresee this is the

320
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,889
biggest image I can print at the moment
you too

321
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:22,580
yeah by lack of flash memory already got
a few hundred k to play with

322
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,190
I'm it is that isn't a good to go to be
badly but

323
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:30,210
superior comfort you can fit printing
their

324
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:35,649
about a small window look for sure yaaa
can see the image coming out

325
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:40,190
motion control happening

326
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:44,610
all of the images that comes out and
services on copper so I've tried dat

327
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:44,980
shit

328
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,429
and played a little fed report a outside
for

329
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:54,769
for

330
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:58,179
so this is a try to personal revelation
that a little bit further you can see

331
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,259
the edge over one year according to

332
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:04,119
and we both know quite quite dense text
that i think is that it's definitely a

333
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:08,460
to be a promising a rapid prototyping
technology for printed circuit boards

334
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,200
and also I think printing 3d

335
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,940
wax objects say that is what I've got a
text when I get around to it

336
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,419
a hopefully at the moment is also
problems with Apple

337
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:22,739
getting into the system makes me feel
like Nicki pinhead to

338
00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:25,879
reservoir interfaces and as soon as
their droplets the

339
00:19:25,879 --> 00:19:29,239
as if there ever was in there the whole
thing just fails and you have to have

340
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:32,539
pump it all back through so I need a
better way of priming the nose

341
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:37,009
incident Leo epstein printer printer
does this as well as a little um

342
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,009
a little kinda vacuum cup for women also
when the

343
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:44,210
when it pops the pretty the carriage
that of your pages here

344
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:47,769
what's this finish printing it means
that carried over here parks and then

345
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:48,710
this lol

346
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:52,309
platform comes I'll sucks a with little

347
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:55,649
personal site publisher sucks all the
ink three to try to clear it out a

348
00:19:55,649 --> 00:19:56,899
bubble 30

349
00:19:56,899 --> 00:20:01,619
I need to implement something similar if
unbelievable the open to those with for

350
00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:02,720
forty years I just

351
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,249
can't believe it so yeah this is a on

352
00:20:06,249 --> 00:20:10,549
this is from a commercial a wax Inc
testing machine

353
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:16,220
a.m. that exists for rapid prototyping
jury and a and then talk of things

354
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:20,129
so this is a this is a commercial
technology but the the machines oversee

355
00:20:20,129 --> 00:20:23,320
crazy expensive and also extremely slow
the

356
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,509
the machine that prints Prince this
thing out

357
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:30,119
he has won things and also I'll

358
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:37,119
thank you as the because of flawed

359
00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:19,460
objects like think this is a really
powerful technique this is an ancient

360
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,909
ancient tradition lost wax casting

361
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:24,990
I'll where usually soul call

362
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:28,720
lack subjects a and then converted into
metal

363
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,890
it has the advantage of being
ridiculously high resolutions the via

364
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:37,250
the wax is really almost perfectly
represented in metal the in the process

365
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:41,269
but unfortunately it destroys the moss
to up but when you combine it with 3d

366
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:43,340
printing you can print out what's lost
is

367
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:48,059
in Polk and potentially make a as many
ridiculously high resolution copies as

368
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:48,549
you like

369
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:52,850
so I use this technique for June retail
sales just

370
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:55,779
included this you can see the kinda
rough process the starter for the whites

371
00:21:55,779 --> 00:21:56,440
loss to

372
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,289
assesses up on a base mix up some pasta

373
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:04,289
up ford also backing out the air bubbles

374
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:07,460
put it in a kiln to file the offensive

375
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,889
very weak lost so Paris a material

376
00:22:10,889 --> 00:22:15,450
into a very high temperature a so very
high impact ceramic

377
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:19,620
a which also has some course that it's
so the actress Kate 24 the matalin

378
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,639
a and then after a few hours in the kiln

379
00:22:23,639 --> 00:22:26,659
the foster Paris has become space hopper
to

380
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:29,870
you can pull the liquid level in the top

381
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:33,950
a and I'm using a vacuum table hits you
cool the air

382
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:37,389
also the mole to allow the metal support
went off

383
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:41,149
and that is pretty amazing media
actually um

384
00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:44,840
just gets through pulled through the
polls in the a

385
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,850
in the process so this is a completely
solid block a blast so there are no

386
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,010
holes or anything but

387
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:54,049
the because of the extremely small force
so just by putting a vacuum

388
00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:57,260
table on the bottom play really hard
vacuum that's an officer

389
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:01,799
Fulham is there an insult I had many
failed attempts like that's

390
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:06,630
as I go centrifuge see pumper relaxing
holiday upon the

391
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:10,779
so over it harder and I got some quite
nice results at the end

392
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:13,980
muncie tied it up a bit you end up with
a 3d object

393
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,210
so this will in 3d printed this was
crafted by hand in the

394
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:21,419
making the weight loss to take a long
time I'm very excited about the a the

395
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:22,110
possibility

396
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:25,980
doing it a cat fancy I'm also an
competency

397
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,549
metal so that was packing for better
Crofts

398
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:33,260
up the next day with second half my talk
is about using

399
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:37,529
Croft for better hacking as so this is a
project like this

400
00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:41,399
a fans a news they wanted this payroll

401
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:44,399
um do you video display some losses

402
00:23:44,399 --> 00:23:47,620
%uh to display the lyrics to the songs
while there on stage

403
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:51,179
could be crazy go see through them a

404
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:54,260
yeah whatever pays the bills

405
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,940
says a yeah they often forget their own
their

406
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:01,250
X yea well eg it's been very dovish

407
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:06,909
K for say hey I thought of it so it
works to make it to make a 3d

408
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:10,850
efficiency to to sell the products that
basically but then

409
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:15,169
there wasn't really time to actually
have them a CNC machine tool

410
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:18,220
and then they can really be 3d printed
cuz they have to be very

411
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:22,929
robust for for touring a and surviving
the cut across conditions a

412
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:25,960
have a touring performance so I just
made everything

413
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,179
initially by hand with sores and files
in this a plastic

414
00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:33,210
a a.m. pretty traditional craft
techniques

415
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,830
so yeah printed out my cat in in 2d

416
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:40,740
stuck it on top of the a the bits a
plastic and coming out with us or

417
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,429
I let him take enough photos for you can
see the author as the kinda starting

418
00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:47,049
point you can nominate also layers if
this

419
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:50,260
this material is called acetate
cellulose acetate plastic

420
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:54,419
a and its basically not used anymore for
anything other than

421
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:58,440
custom spectacle frames because of
classical takes an hour since the

422
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,840
injection molded Torre

423
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,500
sometimes machines a but this stuff is
is is really optimized for working with

424
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,659
your hands you can get

425
00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:09,600
if the Hazrat very nicely with the so
conventional

426
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,269
woodworking tools essentially and a used
to be

427
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:17,230
Eastern Cape very common for spectacle
manufacturers to make their frames this

428
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,070
way by hand

429
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:21,659
I'm has lost property of being so little

430
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:25,149
in North partially soluble in acetone
see you can layout

431
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:29,529
many layers a the plastic and then on
them all together with a a saintly

432
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:34,179
and then of the sounding and cussing you
can get some quite nice

433
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:39,490
3 services wants to get back curved
shapes you can also see them perform

434
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:40,649
this material so I

435
00:25:40,649 --> 00:25:44,020
played a little wooden mold with the
seven degree

436
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,620
thankful that I wanted late the plastic
on top just it is up with that

437
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,120
with a hairdryer and it just to traipse
beautifully over the plastic notes the

438
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,460
only inning sophisticated

439
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:56,149
just the basic tools was the that the
two

440
00:25:56,149 --> 00:25:59,149
always need to be connected electrically
so there's this little tunnel that the

441
00:25:59,149 --> 00:26:01,120
case either between the laminated layers

442
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,029
and allows the a single skate 3 so when
it's a bit more

443
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:09,320
ok if you will for I'm photographs
making the the temples the site pieces

444
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,500
the classes so via so for the plastic

445
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,760
object print out the image from
SolidWorks and just my little sore

446
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,240
cut out the shape far let's get the 3d
come to us

447
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:24,539
sounded a Senate west to make it nice
neat surface

448
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:28,649
and then but a milling here just to

449
00:26:28,649 --> 00:26:32,039
attach the hinge pieces I am

450
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:36,970
toolmaking is really important step and
something that the hacking cough world's

451
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:40,889
definitely share sometimes it's worth
just making a custom tool just for one

452
00:26:40,889 --> 00:26:41,559
job

453
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:45,220
and this was a little custom GI made for
manufacturing other little

454
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,369
side pieces %uh the hinge rivets

455
00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:51,850
a so this is a a wave basis that the
chick for cussing

456
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:55,020
also pieces metals the same length and
injuring two holes in

457
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:59,600
for accurate position and using that to
like to make a few things that all

458
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,480
a diesel silver pieces I had to make
many of them cuz I kept messing up the

459
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,820
%uh the next part which was

460
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:07,809
soldiering the little pins on the back
to make a vivid so those the four rivets

461
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:10,059
that we're the closest together

462
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:13,460
a you can I'm silver sold them than

463
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:17,580
you have to remove the flux a of the
woods this is a a weak acid solutions is

464
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,070
just as of the flux

465
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:23,149
for Slough and they have some supplies
over this

466
00:27:23,149 --> 00:27:26,190
if it's a different place another
peaceful aspect to this

467
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:29,399
this plastic is them that you can
actually

468
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:32,419
polish a chemically say instead of
having to go through you

469
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:35,600
finer and finer and finer grades some
paper let's hope agrees

470
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,710
you can just get it roughly to a student
reasonable finish

471
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:42,010
and then poke it in plastic in ascertain
for a few minutes

472
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:46,240
in the surface will serve partially
dissolve away and leave you this perfect

473
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,010
it was perfect finishes up the
terrifying of course because if you do

474
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,139
that soon on

475
00:27:50,139 --> 00:27:53,299
you just end up with some sludge say

476
00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:57,139
yeah I I did manage to dissolve one face
a little bit too far

477
00:27:57,139 --> 00:28:01,730
I was very sad about so that the another
muscle feature this loss these

478
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:05,020
losses they perceive the and accuse

479
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:08,039
for playing the content the constant
speed record on that office but they

480
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:10,070
have to be synchronized up to the site

481
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:14,159
so this this the RF link to the glosses
and the antenna is a little

482
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,539
a little while others buried inside the
plastic over over year

483
00:28:17,539 --> 00:28:21,990
when it comes out to him so so quite
nicely a packed away and

484
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:26,129
us with a live from the back a.m. I made
these things to place again same way

485
00:28:26,129 --> 00:28:27,830
print out the cat data

486
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:32,409
cut-out with us or um I use the laser
engraver hit see

487
00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:35,460
a.m. mark the backs via

488
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:39,000
with losses this is real real
combination of the old and the new using

489
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,799
simple saw to cut out the sake then I've
gotta I've got a little

490
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,980
CNC laser engraver this use this for
coming out

491
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:49,679
a coming out level but it's it's it's
very nice a sieve mocking

492
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:55,320
sepsis actually I i think im gonna
skippers on this but I want to make some

493
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:55,980
classic

494
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:59,520
inserts to attach the a to such that

495
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,610
level two classic a chance

496
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:05,889
I wanted to know the services to make
them rough so they could

497
00:29:05,889 --> 00:29:09,220
bed into the classic family a and

498
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:13,039
I don't have a tool that can a the
company work on such a small things I

499
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,590
made this ruling so

500
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:18,919
out a pair cigarette lighters so again
if I'm that kinda very use mentalities

501
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:20,250
we've got around to can

502
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:24,450
you can really make some quite nice
tools doing some quite precise work

503
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:30,110
a staffing little inserts and since the
plastic

504
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:33,700
and he's a he's a very small fast as the
one millimeter screw

505
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,129
excellent service the same but in the
past second is quite possible to make

506
00:29:37,129 --> 00:29:38,309
all this stuff

507
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:41,820
just with you have seemed a little bit
of practice

508
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:45,260
so it was the electronics inside the
losses this is a

509
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:49,149
a ASTM 32

510
00:29:49,149 --> 00:29:52,669
a Cortex m4 development powerful

511
00:29:52,669 --> 00:29:56,139
and adjusters Minh City Gaza talks a lot
of

512
00:29:56,139 --> 00:29:59,879
a people coming from the

513
00:29:59,879 --> 00:30:03,240
the more civ informatics I to packing
traditional

514
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,309
a software engineers and

515
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:09,419
and security guys and when they come to
the world of

516
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:12,700
over hardware a starting from

517
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:16,320
maybe scratch a is quite often to pick
up

518
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,490
the Paco make a tools that are around
what we ought we know performance of I

519
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,250
got

520
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:25,730
but I think now um I really wouldn't go
for the art we know I'd go for something

521
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,929
much more powerful because they're all
some

522
00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:31,770
a incredibly powerful embedded hardware
platforms coming out

523
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:35,369
that all easy to use a little extra
point of view maybe less easy to use my

524
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:37,260
software point of view but you guys are
all

525
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:41,270
your approach so for people say I you
really have access to some incredible

526
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,369
tools this is a

527
00:30:42,369 --> 00:30:45,570
10 euro PCB you can get from Farnell

528
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:50,020
a in Germany I and it's got a hundred
sixty-eight make

529
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:53,039
cortex and fork or make a gram

530
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,200
and some really amazing for for this
cause I like seventeen different on the

531
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,780
modules that can configure

532
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:02,240
analog inputs and outputs and it's way
more calls than anything in the kinda

533
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,149
out we know make a movement

534
00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:08,240
seen and I i yes surely people all
moving across the

535
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,919
a via the software tools for driving
these things occur in a bit of a pain

536
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:12,889
but

537
00:31:12,889 --> 00:31:17,950
a you guys can handle it well you see
who fucks i text message

538
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:21,750
as a good place to start because it's
I'm very easy to

539
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:27,030
very easy to use as you can most this is
a commercial EVA tools I'll

540
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:31,299
really expensive but this one's free
it's got pretty good the next support

541
00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:35,330
snow open source unfortunately there are
a KYC at NGO which

542
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:38,799
open source a PCB editing tools

543
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,990
a which all pretty decent but

544
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:45,599
to us $3.00 for some reason a this is
the

545
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:52,599
PCB layout so good

546
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,240
can use to hit me yep good if if

547
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,159
so PCB layouts from your sensei take
your take your

548
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,309
I topper logical view from your

549
00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:14,679
schematic editor that was the the white
step

550
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:17,789
you can export see the kind of
topographical view

551
00:32:17,789 --> 00:32:21,639
which is that the physical connections
in in copper and then use the layout of

552
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:22,580
the tracks

553
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:26,230
and you end up with the with the design
like that for this is four layers of

554
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,280
copper

555
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,169
a with lace the wiring on the inside and
the outside and some power

556
00:32:31,169 --> 00:32:36,379
power planes in the in the middle a it
is quite a quite a dense design but its

557
00:32:36,379 --> 00:32:39,500
a still fairly easy to do with these

558
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,789
the these quite quite cheap and
accessible tools

559
00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:46,639
so once you got your circuit um we
didn't actually have time to

560
00:32:46,639 --> 00:32:49,919
a to get it assembled by a by PCB
assembly house

561
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,379
fortune is quite easy to do it associate
your karoge

562
00:32:53,379 --> 00:32:56,830
I'll you can gets the you can order the
PCB's

563
00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:00,780
a all the some pretty rapid services
this one's actually Forte

564
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,980
a four-day turnaround to get the PCB
from a

565
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:07,119
email to a physical objects in my head
say they're all

566
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:11,669
really really Rapids PCB fabrication
services available now

567
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:16,500
a will say if you want to see so that
that was very expensive to get very high

568
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,490
quality PCB

569
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:21,530
in a very short period of time if you
want a very cheap prototype

570
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:27,520
you can go to China a and with about two
weeks you can get custom PCB's for

571
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:31,010
ridiculously low prices like 20 years or
something

572
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:35,059
and go see if subjects of back and forth
in China has been refined but very cheap

573
00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:39,139
um this does really easy to get access
to

574
00:33:39,139 --> 00:33:42,649
a you can also order these stencils up
for

575
00:33:42,649 --> 00:33:47,039
applying the soul though so the these
this came from a UK company

576
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,780
has a one-day again a one-day turnaround
for forty Pouncey

577
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:54,590
email some cat data and they'll ship
your LASIK I'll stencil for trying a

578
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,889
soda

579
00:33:55,889 --> 00:33:59,309
then you can just take your soda paste
so the place is a bit like

580
00:33:59,309 --> 00:34:03,389
caviar is tiny tiny balls a soda in this
kinda liquid

581
00:34:03,389 --> 00:34:08,159
a if looks good a so it behaves much
like toothpaste you can kinda squeegee

582
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,240
on C or

583
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,099
on to your contacts and then when he set
up the little balls a soda melts and

584
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:13,679
then

585
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,790
a.m. could do together and form for your
joints

586
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:21,799
influx gonna boils away a so this is an
alternative to soaring by hand

587
00:34:21,799 --> 00:34:25,530
and it's this is hell production
electronics is late

588
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,950
in huge quantities the soldiers stand
sort and

589
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:32,319
the parts place by robot busty placing
the pulse pretty easy so

590
00:34:32,319 --> 00:34:36,879
16 10 secure components you end up with
hopefully a little perfect oil

591
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:41,440
love solder paste on each pass a
slightly sticky so it's quite easy

592
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,679
just place a component on top sticks to
the

593
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:48,000
sticks the solder paste quite nicely a

594
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,179
for about 30 race you can get a toaster
oven us replace the

595
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:55,659
you know several thousand pound
industrial unit Leslie us the profile

596
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:56,960
this with the fam a couple

597
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,510
closer to grow of I pretty much fits the
to

598
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:04,180
hits the JEDEC to which is the
industrial body to

599
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:08,000
that regulate substandard PCB assembly
it pretty much

600
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,240
hits the time temperature profile cuz a

601
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,450
with the Praxis gonna jiggling the
normal opening the door the right side

602
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:16,430
you can actually hit here

603
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:20,150
hit the specs pretty tight a soft about

604
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:23,720
the they come out with all the
components over the place

605
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,740
and the just give you an idea of time
this was

606
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:30,339
four circuits with several hundred
components on each one

607
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:34,900
a and probably forty or fifty different
types of components least one

608
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:39,580
and once with a little butter prices you
can get quite replacing I think I

609
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:43,740
I started I started assembling this
project I started squeezing the solder

610
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,630
paste to 11 p.m.

611
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:48,799
and by 4 a.m. I had for a

612
00:35:48,799 --> 00:35:52,180
complete circuit so is a very very fast
wave

613
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,460
a producing very high-quality output

614
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:59,770
prima Croft 11 back in you can to if you
don't have time to make

615
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:04,690
motor pool a bits of development
hardware I estimate one PCB intensive

616
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:06,160
Cup it's a pardon

617
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:11,430
the and stuff too test it before
integrating into the classes

618
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:15,240
discussing that lasts a to make the from
pedals losses

619
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,270
the system organic LED displays a.m.
from China

620
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:22,330
Alibaba express a talk called is the way
to go

621
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:25,580
for a it credit who

622
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:29,700
components the kinda stuff any year some
sonya putting into the mobile phones

623
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:33,080
are available on Alibaba express a for

624
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,200
pretty after chipping in pretty life
volume say

625
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,319
you gonna be prepared to do it or
emailing back and forth the

626
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:42,510
and deal with it but its English you end
up with some

627
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:45,520
pretty amazing access to parts if you're
prepared to

628
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,920
go through the pain a yet this is the
simple device from the back says choir

629
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:55,069
quite then since Integrated Products and
is not far away for a visa consumer

630
00:36:55,069 --> 00:36:58,290
electronics at this point you know
you've got a custom enclosure

631
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:02,049
I which would only be an injection
molded part with tens of thousands

632
00:37:02,049 --> 00:37:05,890
view reserve tooling costs made that
with my hands with you know for a couple

633
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,310
days work

634
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:11,240
I ended up the same policy is as you
could have a

635
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,319
injection molded so it really is
possible to you see

636
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:17,319
really simple craft techniques to make
consumer

637
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:20,339
a level out for overseeing a prototype
volume

638
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:23,150
but if you're doing a Kickstarter
project or something you want to impress

639
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,109
somebody

640
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:28,390
it might be worth a.m. 3d printing
something that's

641
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:32,330
a going to resemble but not completely
emulate the final output

642
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:36,900
in last possible with handcraft
techniques to achieve the final outputs

643
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:41,250
just using a bit if develop a decrease
in the a bit patients

644
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:45,720
so this one advocating the sort of Croft
and hacking fusion together you can

645
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,650
actually produce very high-quality
output

646
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:52,490
so it's fun for blacks a no security
ahead

647
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:56,640
a safe area later very a

648
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,089
also wants its citizens over security
call I want to somehow justify my

649
00:38:00,089 --> 00:38:01,230
presence here

650
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:05,349
by starting some conversations about to
attack aircraft

651
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:08,720
and a security implications i mean
obviously as

652
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,720
implications in physical security up
because a lot of our audience that

653
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,310
they've been

654
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:17,700
a in the in the media about kind of the
house its 3d printing and

655
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:21,470
and homemade home 8 a.m. guns or

656
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:24,650
this is well a bit closer to home German
hacker

657
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:28,420
ray a made these three different keys
that hope

658
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:31,560
a I think as last year and

659
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,000
defeatism shitty handcuffs with them so

660
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,700
this the something happening in the in
the in the physical security

661
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,700
whirls a in the confluence if

662
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:45,069
Crofton packing sunny lockpicking that

663
00:38:45,069 --> 00:38:48,650
I'm not exactly certain what it's going
to and offers

664
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:51,830
us is my work so i just want to mention
that we love this stuff was essentially

665
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,250
done

666
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:56,369
in my flats a student at the moment I
have a lot special cash

667
00:38:56,369 --> 00:39:00,460
saga 1 workshop one living room
everything space

668
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:03,520
we're together say a no excuse to go

669
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,080
if you've got a bit of disposable income
what you IT security professionals you

670
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,650
can

671
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:12,290
some for the division 2 tools and that's
that it's a solid investment

672
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:15,810
so you're there were cops like details
you got any more information the

673
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:22,810
thanks very much

674
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,170
thank you very much with crew yeah i
working with you

675
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:36,170
for work in the video to go on his
summer

676
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:45,440
we go to a swim

677
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,839
we do we have the to include your
connection here you're a player

678
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:54,529
a plugin was so close that possible
thanks

679
00:39:54,529 --> 00:39:58,730
see what happens it's also her father

680
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:02,230
it it's a bluesy yes it looks like

681
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:05,690
floor of

682
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:09,890
it's the

683
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:16,890
u2's and

684
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:27,070
dreams

685
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:27,830
yes we can

686
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:32,380
yes

687
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:35,619
questions yes sprayed with greater

688
00:40:35,619 --> 00:40:39,779
so i'm used must have given you some
disposable income the

689
00:40:39,779 --> 00:40:42,960
through yeah

690
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,020
very obvious

691
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:47,650
this is just a month but going to look
like there's a

692
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:53,170
so the glasses they that display that
the like something I would say to that

693
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:56,430
the audience a about that

694
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:57,720
the big bro

695
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,810
dealing with by rebuild the added I

696
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:04,680
okay more questions or

697
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:11,680
we would like just what's the deal the
fifth

698
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:15,600
%uh I

699
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,800
definitely do with the vision problem
250 better

700
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,500
I does he look at bill begins in tiny
periscope Invidia exhaust

701
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,060
I with out a bit over lenses

702
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:30,720
and if possible to use your mobile phone
with men

703
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:35,430
for the camera is only about you can
identify with expenses

she said my name is a big project it
back to life inside

707
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:52,550
I less I thought I'd different from

708
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:56,430
they look more questions

709
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,240
good

710
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,480
celebrations

711
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,000
as fellow at paper for the crosses as
yeah cool

712
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,710
if it was up to the bachelor and the on
the board yeah it is

713
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:12,130
I'll show you the say the inside you

714
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:15,270
was the last player to be named some
roads are slick losses

715
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:19,990
this is absolutely the perfect
absolutely everything is a

716
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:23,359
is with the Impala that is a pretty good
they say they are pretty high

717
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:27,809
feel like I still say feel lazy you will
really like the salt star

718
00:42:27,809 --> 00:42:30,910
the 14 once Road the

719
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:33,960
way the basic for sends enzymes

720
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,130
decide no yet the highest

721
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:40,400
of weaponry is he said you think about

722
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,140
are you both go to a views about $300
million our

723
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:48,690
battery Cassell these with a

724
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:52,440
the informed by grew up

725
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,569
worked in the end is about to attend win
six movies

726
00:42:55,569 --> 00:42:58,660
think PCP way

727
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:02,010
and and adhesive stuff

728
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:05,780
girl

729
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:06,480
support

730
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,420
point

731
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:16,620
is that the aft

732
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:20,010
21b radio yeah if okay

733
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:23,070
%ah whereby tickets for Muse concert
Rosa

734
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:27,860
where to buy tickets for Muse concert
cop

735
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:31,300
hood yeah has been through

736
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:34,630
our security orbit so yeah healthier

737
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:41,630
every for you days yet

738
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,370
so Jeff what are you going to do after
the talk

739
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:50,830
oh yes oh yes a for you with you don't
answer

740
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:54,600
just on from your designs to 1:48 left

741
00:43:54,600 --> 00:44:00,550
Treasury and it's about with her is
about the size the

742
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:04,810
surveillance personal surveillance tools
living in a tizzy

743
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:10,260
feature like you yes I

744
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:14,300
over just saw this so not through the

745
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,910
this the sounds and I love to talk to

746
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:20,980
you guys about surveillance

747
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:24,990
in public here you

748
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:30,000
both actual you just know it was about
your way

749
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,830
hands the public needs some

750
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:37,080
response you see I think sir

751
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:41,190
possibly with a open source surveillance
tools and

752
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:45,880
totally distribution between governments
or the

753
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:50,370
police forces or with her love
corporations access

754
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:53,930
Jose and our with and

755
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:56,970
perhaps if we except things out

756
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:00,040
maybe we just need salsa use of those

757
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,130
watches us aidid

758
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:07,040
yes as you can so on media a break I

759
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,550
very you see sony vivaz I feel because
those

760
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:14,930
the physical stays both

761
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:18,340
the with

762
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:21,920
