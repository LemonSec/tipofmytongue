office is open to because the mix of

16

just

19
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:10,729

00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,880

24
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,780

25
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:35,780
awesome well ok

26
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:42,159
I so now for my wonders a PowerPoint I'm

27
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,759
pay attention is super important

28
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,049
I'm before I guess I really like how to
give a

29
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,329
general disclaimer about me if any of
you

30
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:58,829
having or you shouldn't million

31
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:02,130
useless to know who I am up but

32
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,009
I asked to give disclaimer anyway
because I own a company in

33
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:10,009
by lawyers tell me I have to so up

34
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:15,909
I partied for a while last night and and
I got drunk

35
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:19,959
and its I'm gonna do my best to not puke

36
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:23,700
while standing here but you know what

37
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,909
this is a the I love that I

38
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:29,959
highlights where if that's okay with a
on

39
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:33,049
fine if it's not get the fuck I don't
care

40
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:36,090
up say

41
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,680
some curse up

42
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,170
that's me and a whole bunch different
formats I

43
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:49,379
including the 500-pound version of me
that I gave a talk using their

44
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,510
linguistic programming about how to pick
up chicks cuz I thought it was funny

45
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:58,540
up which is a really fun to go out to
bars and stuff like that

46
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,409
up cuz you you have no idea

47
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:06,799
the level can actually get some people
and it just empowers you to drink or

48
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:10,939
because you know who doesn't want to be
a five how person just rolling around

49
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:15,629
to sell my credentials okay

50
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:18,920
a cup that's that's those records of

51
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,950
up those are

52
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:27,049
probably a little bit more relevant
credentials for me

53
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:30,109
because everybody has to like give the
why am i important

54
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:34,329
park before they start talking of

55
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:38,280
I what are those I'll

56
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,519
I one of those you can too if you have
Photoshop

57
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:48,370
it's really really its way easier than
this stupid test

58
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,480
low maybe it's not easier than past but
at least it takes less time

59
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,709
of granted for some bizarre

60
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:00,260
so that's why I'm saying it just it just
takes less hot up

61
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,889
I'm actually planning on running for a

62
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:08,639
the icy board again because I think that
they need more people talk shit

63
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:11,909
and less bureaucrats %ah and

64
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:15,870
and I made it yeah I made at the
Communist Chinese version

65
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,310
because I thought it was funnier to
infiltrate them up

66
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,970
I have a whole bunch of other
certifications that don't freakin matter

67
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:26,740
I run a company my company does

68
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,870
ap testing we do code review

69
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:36,230
I just being quiet

70
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,659
cuz its funnier up

71
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:43,529
we do in certain spots I

72
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:47,629
would you risk assessments sweet break
into should physically

73
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:51,300
we depend tests I'll with the red
teaming

74
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,399
we do a slide that's all fucked up

75
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,229
you know we

76
00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:02,289
we figure out how computers work against
each other this is a methodology

77
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:06,749
because everybody has have important
methodologies in their sights

78
00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:11,499
that's ours just feel shit I don't
really care

79
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:16,649
yeah anyway I'm

80
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:20,629
I'm glad they're waking up it's good I

81
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:27,629
so what while I hear it the first threes
and I'm here's the wake you up

82
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:33,669
frappe keep looking at it

83
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:38,499
it gets funnier look at how sleeping she
is

84
00:05:38,499 --> 00:05:43,069
got that had the sock I'm

85
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:47,439
second reason I'm here is to make you
think in

86
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,789
I at

87
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:55,889
and obviously the third reason I'm here

88
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,959
is because as much as

89
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,899
I know that probably everybody in the
audience a smarter than I am

90
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:06,209
good that's why I just made people laugh
out

91
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:13,209
but I'm I'm here to try and give you
something I i want to interest you

92
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:17,039
into looking at whatever you see the
rest of today and whatever you've seen

93
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:17,669
yesterday

94
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:21,159
lol really whatever you look at in this

95
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:25,809
in this field and to try and get a taste
for what else could be

96
00:06:25,809 --> 00:06:30,649
right because for me teaching you guys
is probably relevant because

97
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:35,069
again there also are I am but but I can
at least get you interested in looking

98
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:36,159
at things are def by

99
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:41,110
so that's my point kept so

100
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,839
I get this email from you know it was
awesome

101
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:48,430
asking me to come out here and

102
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:52,589
and give a talk and and because it was a
keynote you know I was like

103
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:55,620
all it's great and I get to wake people
up in I get so

104
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,509
come to my talk drugs as parting the SI
up

105
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:02,939
so I take you know this flight across

106
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:09,939
the country's I'm

107
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,450
but to keep going

108
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:15,300
yeah it's good take

109
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,600
to give my you know of about what

110
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,550
what's going on right so like at a lot
of people are giving

111
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:27,360
very technical talk so i cant like some
I'm just like or her for that

112
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,510
I I leave it to effects and everyone
else too

113
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,890
to give relevant technical talks up

114
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:37,420
but I was thinking about all these
people right

115
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:42,150
and how they keep kicking our ass over

116
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:46,460
and over again

117
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,600
I mean we just keep getting messed up by
all of these people right

118
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,810
and its no matter what we do and no
matter what controls we put in place

119
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,920
we keep failing and in its not really

120
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,590
to a reason to give up but we just keep
failing

121
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:08,710
and and and we don't really necessarily
understand

122
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:13,520
that something's fundamentally wrong
mean you guys said

123
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,110
in in your panel yesterday about there's
there's someone in the audience was

124
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,020
talking about this like

125
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,110
echo chamber how we all just continue
talking bitch to each other and this is

126
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,820
just nothing more than a bunch of us

127
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:29,090
I mean to me in my words nothing more
than a bunch of us just sitting around

128
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,660
making blankets pitching at each other
right

129
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:37,300
so how do we fix it I love what we do
well

130
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,620
as I was looking at these things i was
thinkin although it may be maybe it's

131
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,640
not a war

132
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,450
cuz that's a so far Mon crazy country
based in

133
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:50,380
you know you could do I ever house maybe
it's just a fight I

134
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:55,110
how do people their fight before raise
hands

135
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,240
the seriously raise your hands I don't
care if you're tired of

136
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,040
that's it get a coke into a fight

137
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,160
I mean seriously like I'm not trying to
be of a club about it like

138
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,500
physically go get into a fight fight
each other right

139
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,910
because if your job is to attack and
defend the health

140
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,010
do you know what to do unless you've
ever been in a fight

141
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:23,260
that's what your job is cat

142
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:27,010
so why do we keep losing fights want
because

143
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:31,390
even those of us who have been in fights
before gets nicked up on sometimes

144
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:36,070
right up

145
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:42,680
and no got shit spratt okay

146
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,410
you know we I can give you the relevant
statistics

147
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,910
overfly sneak attacks work but you guys
can figure it out schulhaufs

148
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:55,280
I'm sure there's plenty of other people
with college graphs so

149
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,800
we're trying to figure out this whole
thing

150
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,850
something screwed up right

151
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:07,460
only we started delivering information
to people and that early sixties

152
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:12,839
something messed up in our evolution we
started losing right

153
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,240
and I'm not saying that just to be like
sad panda guy I'm just saying that cuz

154
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,060
it's a fact

155
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,520
so as I looked at these things I thought
whoa

156
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,690
since since we keep going through all of
this different stuff up why

157
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:31,120
and how and where but we're not making
any progress let's look at history

158
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,600
right let's look at how these fights

159
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,900
have happened before because

160
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,390
in our alright in our own minds all of
us are super powers in one way or

161
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:42,850
another

162
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,440
so what happened when superpowers

163
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,280
deconstruct that

164
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,700
so look at it right

165
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,240
the Persians and is getting its you guys
know anything about this

166
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,350
but the Persian Empire right

167
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:05,040
at the time the largest superpower

168
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,310
on the planet more resources

169
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:11,510
more men more armor

170
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,890
better weapons than anyone else

171
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:18,880
they conquered well and after Lance

172
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,320
yet what happens they meet this get the
ends

173
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:29,079
the skins go crate we only have a few
thousand soldiers verses your hundreds

174
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:29,990
of thousands

175
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:34,780
how are we going to fight them well we
give up

176
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,810
we fight them in the way they were
supposed to conventionally

177
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:41,450
or which is murder and kill

178
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:46,079
and wat and colleges many people as
possible and I hope that God

179
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,350
that these people are so scared a bus
but they never wanna fight us again

180
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:55,820
what happens wall it doesn't seem like
there's a Persian Empire anymore so

181
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:01,700
I think we understand what happened in
history the skins broke that

182
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,410
they broke them because they could

183
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,760
not because they have more resources not
because they were better not because

184
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,670
they were stronger

185
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:14,280
not because they were more it sets
because they had the will to break them

186
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,290
and they did

187
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:19,690
the Romans Friday

188
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,910
says all the still speak Latin

189
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,300
so the Romans throw it had this horrible
time I

190
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,579
they were doing awesome and then you
know the embers just

191
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:33,760
continue to have orgies and got drunk
too much

192
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,190
and they started to lose their way

193
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,750
right because they were so focused on
these other things

194
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:46,000
they lost track of their business which
was conquering people

195
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,220
yeah even though the again more resource

196
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,520
more power better weapons that everyone
else

197
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,940
they came over to this area they got
there ass handed to him

198
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:03,410
all the time but once they got out and
they got to the Prince

199
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:07,670
decided to make some relief big affects
because as a Roman soldiers would come

200
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,339
in their droves

201
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:12,620
the plans which is run up kamikaze style

202
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,160
like kick through the front and you
start killing as many people as they

203
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,880
possibly get

204
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,070
I see you have 50 1890

205
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:25,560
100 Romans get killed by one person just
hunter with swords feel like we're gonna

206
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,000
die anyway

207
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,170
I may as well kill a point to romance

208
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:38,170
and what happens well you know you guys
won the dots

209
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,570
the mongolians again

210
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:48,570
and for serve their time absolutely no
one

211
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:52,560
could screw with the mongolians they
would ride n

212
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,390
they would conquer villages they would
take all the people

213
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:00,350
they would make all the women they would
kill over then

214
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:04,010
they would murder all the children just
so that there was absolutely no

215
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,709
survivors

216
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:10,230
in the new culture that they were
bringing to these people

217
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:15,339
right total domination

218
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:19,930
yep somehow their snow mongolians either

219
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:26,370
the super powers over time dot
absolutely and brutally destroyed

220
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,680
by the texts K

221
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,220
again ever heard of most of these are
many guys

222
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,810
done history stuff at

223
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,949
I mean they beat the crap

224
00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:45,230
out among Koreans and their little tiny
tribe

225
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,480
so all these things to me really
relevant what i'm looking at like

226
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,660
okay how two superpowers die

227
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,829
how does a company that has more
resources more

228
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:58,800
armor more energy more capital
everything than their attackers how they

229
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,060
get beat up

230
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,209
and why so i'd look at this you know

231
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:08,570
wonderful exercise of the Ottoman Empire

232
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:12,079
its twenty-five years

233
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,130
25 years they attacked Transilvania

234
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:18,579
then conquered everything else and
Europe

235
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:23,570
and for 25 years this little shady City

236
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:27,130
say couldn't conquer because these
people

237
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:31,670
would just go crazy they would wait
until they would find an encampment

238
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:36,350
and they were burn it to the ground
while effortlessly

239
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:40,470
okay come get it come fight me okay how
big you are

240
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:46,760
I'll kill as many people as possible I'm
gonna make you scared

241
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:51,530
they get me started on this little TS

242
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:54,670
I because

243
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:58,910
he's the whole reason the term exists

244
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:05,020
K anybody know him

245
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,150
yes now

246
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:11,939
Juan Martinez vs

247
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:16,650
the founder ugly Aeros

248
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:20,699
the originator guerrilla warfare

249
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:24,579
seven people including

250
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:27,640
one woman that was

251
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,370
crazy enough to attack

252
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:34,390
droves a French forces to the point

253
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,520
where they were terrified

254
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,730
and could no longer fight

255
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:45,640
seven people started a revolution

256
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,040
seven people Concord the most

257
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,910
feared the most for source for

258
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:56,319
the most well aren't the most populated

259
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:00,380
army in the world at that time

260
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:06,189
sets out from earlier to anyone right
now based on how we're doing things

261
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:11,490
cat I mean us americans have some good
history on that

262
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,819
I we had all these people that marched
in blocks and your son you know funny

263
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:15,569
uniforms

264
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:19,280
you know we head up this

265
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,630
these guys that were continue to just
this kind of wander through the streets

266
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,910
right like how do you know that the
worst coming ok

267
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:32,380
listen for the marching bands there they
are

268
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:37,670
so what do you do how you attack that
you're just march up to them and fight

269
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:41,100
you know you acts tactfully you just

270
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,790
go get some things whenever it's
opportunistic and you can

271
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,830
yes that was the first saw the car for
us

272
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:52,040
up you analyze how they work

273
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,300
because they're super power

274
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,340
and then you take shots at them as many
times as you can

275
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:02,660
without getting caught you hide right in
front of them

276
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,730
right you get visible

277
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,940
but you don't let people see

278
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,760
is that also i think is a badass like

279
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,900
I put to the slides back to back just
cuz he's such a gangster

280
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,309
look at that a

281
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:23,440
you wanna talk about IDS wanna talk
about the fence

282
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,780
that's the fence you just staying there
waiting for somebody in your like

283
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:32,059
please come get this now only into I
have

284
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:36,140
a friggin bulldozer you can't find me
and I'm standing right in front you

285
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:40,220
with paint I mean go get a soda

286
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,610
I

287
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:47,410
I'll still get you

288
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:52,290
because you have these people that just
go take potshots in

289
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:55,620
I think we did the same thing as
americans right

290
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,870
that's how we got our country owned by
conquering this trial

291
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,850
our own selves team that just making
anything

292
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:07,100
but but even though these kind of
potshots in these these

293
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:12,100
general things happen around superpowers

294
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,280
their structure right

295
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,860
their structure and how we get into
these fights even though it seems

296
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,620
arbitrary even though it seems that

297
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:24,780
they're just attacking us whenever they
opportunistically can

298
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:29,700
so so we need to look a little bit
history and how that works

299
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:36,179
yeah so everybody talks about how the
users are problem

300
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:40,380
but but it's not because everybody who
says the you know

301
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:45,510
there's no patch for stupidity i think
is just not trying hard enough

302
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:49,179
or maybe you're too dumb to teach
somebody sorry

303
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:53,510
because if you say that you're just %ah
paying attention

304
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:56,920
I think we didn't pay attention when

305
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,410
we decided to fight vietnam

306
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:04,070
because you don't like it you know the
Americans lost in vietnam

307
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:08,240
even though they you know claim is a
winner whatever their that bullshit is

308
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,179
is because the enemy is head one thing

309
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:15,290
that every single piece of info sacked

310
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:19,360
right now doesn't pay attention to

311
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,340
and that's the home field advantage

312
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,910
right call at me

313
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:31,299
because if I know you're coming I can
prepare yesterday you're talking about

314
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:34,390
battlefield preparation right vs

315
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:38,270
that's what it's about that's what we
learned in our tactics we got the crap

316
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,720
beat out of us

317
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,610
no matter how much money and how many
people we threw it whatever bombs and

318
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,330
also planes or whatever else

319
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:50,830
people to shake us in a car right to use
our bodies as barriers for bullets when

320
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:55,559
they were shaken somebody else

321
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:59,240
clout choir like that as a supply

322
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,260
yeah we need to like look at how

323
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,309
that you have graphs you just make up

324
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:08,890
random graphs but really

325
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:12,540
you know this this is one of those
graphs that mean something to me

326
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:17,850
because if we look at kind of the
attacker

327
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:21,100
the attack only has a small window of
opportunity here

328
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,270
if we screw up a weirdo understand our
environment well enough

329
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:31,160
we're giving them almost half up the
amount of success that's possible

330
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,860
just by not knowing our own environment

331
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:39,750
what actually giving the attacker an
advantage

332
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,059
so excess

333
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:46,220
ready in even worse

334
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:51,309
we pretended to norovirus even though we
don't

335
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:54,620
as we do these things of

336
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,940
yeah yea we when

337
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,179
UN what nothing you in getting aren't

338
00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:06,240
because we set up all these rules right
and we have all these standards

339
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,020
that we try to follow and then we make a
loss to park legends

340
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,330
and then what happens we put stuff in
place

341
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:20,850
in order to survive these audits right
but this

342
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:25,900
so we got a sweet network maps that
don't mean shit

343
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,920
and we call it a best practice meanwhile
you have all these vendors out there

344
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,940
being like home

345
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:38,840
how to make money of love this person
just chasing their own ass

346
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,450
all I know how to do it will sell them
technology

347
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:48,110
and anyone have all remember the shirt I
still have lied

348
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:52,470
I but one of the one of the best things

349
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:55,830
I believe that the hacker community has
done and

350
00:22:55,830 --> 00:23:00,130
all of its history is lawyer with people

351
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:03,610
is just got are you can export it or
could I print it

352
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:08,360
yes could I put on a t-shirt yes Chris
ok to issue its the somebody

353
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,860
yes K have fun

354
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:17,410
of right okay it's all these people say
this shit

355
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:20,960
and you really can't buy it great meal

356
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,030
even know it's there you get instantly
get by

357
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:28,740
even if you don't use any of these
methods you can get by it

358
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,980
right grab someone throw them on the
ground put a gun in their face guess

359
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,650
what

360
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:37,440
by security posture is not gonna happen
in mind shit how much auditing you've

361
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,049
done

362
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:42,410
I have your passwords because there is
no system administrator

363
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:47,400
on the planet that gets paid enough to
take a bullet

364
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,690
that's the fax you can talk about
security

365
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:54,210
all day long someone's going to get shot
over gonna be like

366
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:57,799
don't care

367
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:01,730
IDS Khalife call-in

368
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:04,740
its with I this is so poor

369
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,380
that techniques from 10 years ago still
work

370
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:12,030
to get around it and I'll the idea
spenders

371
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:15,100
a on somebody

372
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,330
now whip okay %uh play this game fight

373
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:21,580
I'll seriously but

374
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:25,630
it's a joke they lost and data leak

375
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:31,330
right that's hard that's like super hard
to get around

376
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:34,580
because you have to have all these
things for compliance

377
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:38,430
yeah travelers crap

378
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:42,860
yet we can instantly get around it or we
can just use Disk

379
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:47,080
because a lot of times doesn't protect
against that up

380
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:54,080
yes talked about this a lot yesterday
and a number of talks

381
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,950
that works good of

382
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:01,880
integrity checking right we we do those
things as well

383
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,500
which you know there's there's an app
for that

384
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,690
what management also to Liam

385
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:13,340
and then you have the magical firewall
right

386
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:18,200
the the like 2008 this is this for text
everything

387
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,710
but have any you guys read about this

388
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:26,800
about you know house with handshakes
work

389
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,140
and if you fire all vendors they wanna
get mad at me

390
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:34,070
ohs a split handshake they're like
sheesh I'm an expert

391
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:37,390
our firewall does other stuff because

392
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:41,020
only one firewall in the history thus
far

393
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:45,960
successfully can stop split Hansika tax

394
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,720
by the fall out of the box otherwise you
have to configure all sorts of things

395
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,830
and then it just breaks your general
traffic

396
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:57,350
pockets at just ask for money of

397
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:02,190
because that's how we fix things right I
we just ask for money and fix them

398
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:06,190
yet we started getting on so the money
things that weren't working

399
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,950
so we do all we should comply with
something we should we should do some

400
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:10,970
type of

401
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:14,960
flights standard compliance because that
protects everyone else

402
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,930
right anybody anybody in

403
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:22,330
compliant with the standard

404
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,440
now no one else I don't believe that

405
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,850
your companies are meet you might not be

406
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:33,750
but you have all these wonderful
standards that exist all over the planet

407
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:38,620
yep and they do nothing but give you a
bunch of checkboxes

408
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:42,140
they'll really tell you if you're secure
now they just give you some

409
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,410
arbitrary number that most of the time

410
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:49,460
its data specific which means it has
absolutely nothing to do with your

411
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,410
company

412
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:57,400
does that make sense compliance has
nothing to do with your company

413
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,570
it has to do with compliance in the
industry

414
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:04,750
organization that you're complying with

415
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:08,540
not protecting your business only
protecting your organization

416
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,640
and where it operates

417
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,520
I mean you have other standards that
teach you how to catch butterflies

418
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,980
you can get mad at me I don't care

419
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,920
again it teaches you how to do some
tactical things

420
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:29,350
which I appreciate but it's a it's not
talking about your business it's not

421
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,280
protecting the

422
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:35,080
business it's just giving you arbitrary
methods

423
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,880
to me that's not security

424
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:45,880
its pass fail we get ourselves on tests
so that we can feel good

425
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:51,210
for this a somber of

426
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:54,710
so do you up

427
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:58,770
like you know yesterday there's a lot of
things that I was too I was just sitting

428
00:27:58,770 --> 00:27:59,480
there going

429
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:05,630
yes to write because education is one of
the biggest things that we can do

430
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:09,960
right or talking about that winning that
home-field advantage how do we fight

431
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,400
these these attacks that are gonna
happen to us over and over again

432
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,620
well we can't put a face on our Thacker
we know that our attacker exists and has

433
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,270
a right

434
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:21,960
are here she is right outside our door

435
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,060
we need to just educate ourselves

436
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:30,380
right we talk about human patches

437
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,820
you what you need math at the office if
your math people

438
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:37,790
also I'm not so I made a formula

439
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:41,500
because in my opinion that's thats math
right

440
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,090
so the fence Eagles capability plus

441
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:50,840
experience they will see defense that
were

442
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:56,920
not how much shit you put in front of
the IP address that's attacking here

443
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:01,120
a while so what I'd like to see

444
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,820
is people looking at the fence based on
how capable they are

445
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:11,050
and how much experience they can get in
their environment

446
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:14,700
and using the tools that they have

447
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:18,160
AVN you can bypass but you have to have
it

448
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,390
are you don't have to have it her
doesn't comply or whatever else you know

449
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,540
a lot of times compliance is a risk

450
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:28,300
that you need to mitigate

451
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:33,790
so but also really basic understanding
if your defense capabilities

452
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:38,140
K I mean this is this is not something
where you need to

453
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:42,470
arbitrarily make a number and say I'm
eighty per site per 90 percent 45

454
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,560
percent secure

455
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,940
right make will gradually executives a
love that shit

456
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,820
I mean if they're really really do
because this gives them

457
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:55,720
an idea of where they're at and you say
someday

458
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,880
your cover the whole web I but right now

459
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:05,220
here's where we're at and here's our
capabilities just based on how we react

460
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,220
not based on how good our pen tester is
not based on

461
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:14,060
how of some you know the code review was
how great our employees are entirely or

462
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:14,770
anything else

463
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:17,980
just based on the fax

464
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,960
right because we just you know at the
end of the day I'll probably do some

465
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,530
compliance thing so you could show
someone else that you're awesome in

466
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,040
secure seek to use it

467
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:33,040
as a business driver for a totally let's
be honest with ourselves

468
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:36,900
risk

469
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,040
Christmas lists as anybody know that

470
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,490
it was almost fifteen hundred years
before the japanese

471
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:47,580
had a word for risk

472
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,580
that's hard core fifteen hundred years

473
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:55,430
that have a word for risk because it was
not specific enough

474
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:59,100
because most times when you use the word
risk it's a cover

475
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,150
for your lack specificity

476
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:05,230
because you can't the final its actually
happening

477
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:09,800
you use the word risk in order to cover
your ass

478
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:14,040
or it's risky yeah I get that

479
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:18,740
is stupid Modelo let's look at the
actions

480
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:22,300
yeah I mean I don't know how many times
I've been

481
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,610
drunk in bed searching for condom and
wondered about

482
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:32,610
what the word risk means

483
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:37,360
sup what do you do classic practice the
basics

484
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:42,740
in my opinion much like was talked
yesterday

485
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:46,440
this this advance thing as a farce

486
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,480
right to me being advanced

487
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,350
is flawless execution above the basics

488
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:57,610
if you can't do basic things you will be
more advanced than

489
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:01,050
anyone who has tons of shit on the
outside who does

490
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:04,100
ninja cool of some you know

491
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:07,520
go speak at a conference at

492
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,950
I because you want me to you need to be
here

493
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:15,600
if you the basics you could just feel
like still get

494
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,560
so sleek come at me and just let's see
what happens

495
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,980
and then we'll start actually training
for your fight

496
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:27,430
so you know again patch shit

497
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:30,770
I we know that we tell that to each
other yet

498
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:34,460
how many if you haven't installed all
the latest Ubuntu patches on

499
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,020
your own machine that you have sitting
in your backpack

500
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:41,170
I responsive you have it

501
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:44,280
we expected to be automated awards lot

502
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,090
or I expect automation to work but I've
never really checked

503
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:52,710
to see if it still work reduce
complexity

504
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:55,930
who in all it so it's not just say we're
talking about

505
00:32:55,930 --> 00:33:00,040
how complex it works

506
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:03,960
and at all things into an environment in
making a more complex

507
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,170
makes it less secure

508
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:11,830
if you take anti-virus and you put it on
your machine

509
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:16,430
does it increase or decrease our
security

510
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:20,720
now decrease right why

511
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,870
because you've now increased you attack
surface

512
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:29,290
I now have one more thing that I can
attack

513
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:34,330
now I will make the evaluation that
because all of my other attack surfaces

514
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,920
are starting to get reduced based on
this thing

515
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,390
being implemented that I can allow the
increase

516
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:45,390
my attack surface in another area but we
have to understand that the

517
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:52,390
surface increases every time we
introduce complexity

518
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:57,110
my favorite quote ever the doctor got it
right

519
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:02,990
the more sophisticated technology them
of all abilities to primitive attacks

520
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:08,440
think about that when you're putting in
your new next-generation bullshit that

521
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:13,849
Friday I mean really really think about
that this is a fact

522
00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:18,159
coming from someone who pretty much
weekly breaks in the buildings and

523
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:24,089
poll shit out of Iraq I can tell you I
don't have to be a good hacker

524
00:34:24,089 --> 00:34:27,389
cuz I'm not right

525
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:32,369
I just have to be able to obviously see
the easy way to attack something

526
00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:35,450
and then attacked

527
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:38,940
I like things with their business
objectives up

528
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:43,010
to do it a have you guys it and I know
German company in San

529
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:46,079
international companies in general have
the same meat sauce

530
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:51,710
understanding mission statement of what
what what company do

531
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:58,050
right then you have you know your
company's mission statement

532
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:01,849
now what the fuck to do for a job

533
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:06,579
clinch a job to protect them and him
saying is the full commission statement

534
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:08,430
like it's really easy

535
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:11,700
you only die scholar freakin ice or
anything else to tell you what to

536
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,290
protect

537
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:17,210
it one sentence and it exists in your
company somewhere

538
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:20,369
whether the executives know it whether
someone next you know it

539
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:23,960
whether it's printed on a freakin
intranet or whatever else

540
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,400
that's the only job that you have this
protect those

541
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:33,910
few little words yet most of us don't
even look at it

542
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:37,900
who yeah

543
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:42,849
I think you know what we do instead
ascension to the clout

544
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:46,730
right no no reason for me to understand
my business when I can

545
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:50,819
the for the risks for someone else

546
00:35:50,819 --> 00:35:54,089
well thats just my own

547
00:35:54,089 --> 00:35:57,790
opinion up you're working yourself out
of a job

548
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:02,000
hike stop doing that shit if you give
everything and all the security stuff to

549
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,790
someone else

550
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:06,930
you won't work anymore

551
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:13,619
so you know to be outsourced to insource
I don't do it

552
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:17,000
also when you're building all these
controls and you're looking at

553
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,750
how do we defend against these attacks
that are happening to us over and over

554
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,839
again

555
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:27,520
you know the these are theoretical type
methods to get you in the game

556
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,790
to get you thinking about the right
things not thinking about

557
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:35,180
you know does Mike email server matter
now it doesn't matter

558
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:39,160
you pick up the phone oshit the phones
not working great go face to face and

559
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,740
talk to someone

560
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,839
can i still convey the message yes

561
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:48,970
that's that's why we important yet what
do we do we spend all this money

562
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:54,380
giving our email server five nines when
it really doesn't matter at all

563
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:59,420
to the overall business as we need to
figure out how we work

564
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:02,619
we figure out what accompanied us

565
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:07,750
this didn't do any of you guys analyze
what your company do

566
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:12,780
I me realise our profiles and all of the
the servers that we have and how

567
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:16,920
these little SEP boxes and also aircraft
that we have in our environment is

568
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,900
vulnerable

569
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,559
right adopt scary people but

570
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:26,650
doing a load to ever stop all that crap
and go back to the business and say how

571
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:29,829
does our business really work

572
00:37:29,829 --> 00:37:32,700
because that's what you're sending
you're not offending is little boxes

573
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,420
you're defending the business

574
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,150
and how you gonna adequately defend
something that you don't know how to

575
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,309
operates

576
00:37:39,309 --> 00:37:44,990
so take the time to go through the
business

577
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:48,690
that so what does it do

578
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:53,849
how does it do it how does your company
make the money that you make

579
00:37:53,849 --> 00:37:59,410
in what ways do they do it give sales
people do have products whatever else

580
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:05,000
right this whole mission statement thing
what's the culture look like

581
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,319
right do you guys ever look at your
business plans

582
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:12,619
and say hey give me all the business
plans for the entire year

583
00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:16,660
I need to see where the business is
going so I can proactively defense

584
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:21,869
the business and the New Territories it
more just then

585
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:24,930
yeah it was the right

586
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:28,920
I mean granted these are fairy tale type
things

587
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,880
well you start having some of these
conversations I guarantee you

588
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,980
everything's gonna change

589
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:37,089
we make this whole little matrix I love
what are we doing

590
00:38:37,089 --> 00:38:41,500
versus what is the company doing you'll
start to see that a lot of these just

591
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,210
don't

592
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:46,690
matchup you know growing revenue and
deploying the OP

593
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:52,750
might not fit with you have these
objectives and those objectives

594
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:56,599
and what's your job not to the PLO shit
and spend your budget your job is to

595
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:58,880
protect the business

596
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,059
so we need to evaluate those things and
how they work and where they actually

597
00:39:02,059 --> 00:39:03,700
support the business

598
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,380
I know this is contrary to everyone else
giving the you know all secure all your

599
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,010
stuff

600
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:11,890
and make sure everything's hearten
patched in wonderful to me honestly I

601
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:14,809
don't care if the business survives and
I get my paycheck tomorrow

602
00:39:14,809 --> 00:39:18,480
I get my paycheck ten years from now I'm
doing my job

603
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,650
because I don't get back to business I
don't get compromise in a way

604
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:26,579
the materially affects my business I did
a good job

605
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:30,180
it's measurable what we're doing now is
we're installing shit

606
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,150
and measuring ourselves on how good we
are installing shit and then we get

607
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:33,869
hacked or like

608
00:39:33,869 --> 00:39:39,190
Iron Man I didn't install of stuff

609
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:42,700
doesn't make sense to me I its it's a
it's a confusing

610
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:47,010
of it to it

611
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:52,569
solutions a class do more

612
00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:57,869
simple I mean um I'm a simple person I'm
just not smart enough to grasp all this

613
00:39:57,869 --> 00:40:03,170
highly technical crap do testing

614
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:07,760
prove that what you put in works

615
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,099
do this to test every time you install
something

616
00:40:13,099 --> 00:40:16,690
hands now and it's have people active so

617
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:19,869
tooth forty forty-percent the audience

618
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:23,309
doesn't that every single time you
install something

619
00:40:23,309 --> 00:40:28,010
yeah every single time somebody install
something in your business

620
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:31,900
is that is it is that is it the hand
count same

621
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,990
and everybody knows anytime somebody
install something like when the

622
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:38,440
developers like fuck it on skype another
box on the right to ask

623
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,490
and then only uses for production and
then to put it on the internet

624
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:46,800
know what's had that happen before right
of course

625
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,819
the pressure on the Internet and then he
let the Chinese test that

626
00:40:49,819 --> 00:40:53,339
he bring back in the house

627
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:56,150
and you analyze the Ricketts cuz you
have nothing else to our people that

628
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,869
their

629
00:40:57,869 --> 00:41:01,849
because they're too busy getting their
ass beat it by everyone else

630
00:41:01,849 --> 00:41:06,170
right so this is the point get into
fights

631
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:09,430
were also love you can feel it attack

632
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:15,000
defender Red Team Blue Team can Chinese
not Chinese what every column

633
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,049
I mean the Chinese test themselves

634
00:41:18,049 --> 00:41:23,119
it we know that fixes that help

635
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,839
so look at this not like security

636
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:31,999
a lot of times look at what disasters
right security is a disaster

637
00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:35,640
that's really what it is we're we're
trying to mitigate a disaster

638
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:40,749
we're trying to make up all these new
jobs for jobs that exist

639
00:41:40,749 --> 00:41:45,309
right so you have this huge spend that
you have incest everybody's executives

640
00:41:45,309 --> 00:41:45,989
understand

641
00:41:45,989 --> 00:41:49,170
disaster recovery right I mean like
we've

642
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:52,829
this industry has been beaten up so much
and people have lost so much because

643
00:41:52,829 --> 00:41:55,430
I've disasters and because of
surrounding just everything else that

644
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,019
they get

645
00:41:57,019 --> 00:42:02,509
right so let's do some real basic math
around security disasters

646
00:42:02,509 --> 00:42:07,700
K average cost down time based on
thousands of people worldwide

647
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:11,859
two hundred and eighty seven thousand
six hundred dollars

648
00:42:11,859 --> 00:42:15,700
K that's one occurrence about time

649
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,869
want to conserve a disaster now

650
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:23,259
take your word for Boy Scout

651
00:42:23,259 --> 00:42:27,259
ok multiply that by all the different
things that can stop the service and

652
00:42:27,259 --> 00:42:28,289
cause a disaster

653
00:42:28,289 --> 00:42:32,950
and you now have quantifiable number of
how much it costs to be vulnerable to

654
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,339
those things

655
00:42:34,339 --> 00:42:38,239
super basic math yeah

656
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:41,890
you can show that the people and
empirically tell them this is how it

657
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:44,150
works

658
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:47,960
if they can't get it otherwise you can
find it in the frame of a disaster

659
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,440
and let me tell you that that number is
crazy meet

660
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:56,190
billions of dollars right so we need to
test those things to see if they're

661
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,630
actually work

662
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:01,839
we need to be able to understand how
vulnerabilities exist in the environment

663
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:05,999
yeah and we do assessments against it

664
00:43:05,999 --> 00:43:10,410
and the week actually go confirm them so
we make sure yes

665
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:13,720
I can get shells all over the place I
can show some type

666
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:17,289
risk I can actually connected I get
actually

667
00:43:17,289 --> 00:43:21,910
get there and go to the point why not
just in this nerd fight

668
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:25,339
right we want to actually make it
relevant to the business what just gonna

669
00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:26,140
pop shells

670
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:30,289
and get a boner be like a win-win

671
00:43:30,289 --> 00:43:33,799
because that doesn't do anything unless
you can actually attacked a business

672
00:43:33,799 --> 00:43:38,559
right so dat is basic methodology is a
criminal sex

673
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:42,359
find stuff that is important and take it

674
00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:46,109
knows how long that has get a shell and
be impressed with your leet hacker

675
00:43:46,109 --> 00:43:47,489
skills

676
00:43:47,489 --> 00:43:52,230
like you know that that this is not on
the methodology at all

677
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:56,509
cuz about the business K

678
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:59,829
once you do that while you're doing
testing in this is a problem that I have

679
00:43:59,829 --> 00:44:00,869
with most I've

680
00:44:00,869 --> 00:44:06,829
the testing methodologies that are out
there they don't have to wait

681
00:44:06,829 --> 00:44:10,940
what attacker are you defending against
so my company we

682
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:14,119
we do some real weird stuff right

683
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:17,220
most of the time we're doing you know
what we call

684
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:21,039
and testing its attack model

685
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:24,299
so we interview we hang out with me

686
00:44:24,299 --> 00:44:27,880
talk for days with our customers to
figure out who their large as

687
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,539
adversaries are

688
00:44:29,539 --> 00:44:33,920
we spend months profiling those
adversaries

689
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,920
we figure out the techniques that the
use how they use them

690
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,369
where they use them what tools they use
how the implement those tools and

691
00:44:40,369 --> 00:44:41,319
everything else

692
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:45,779
and then we actually go to our test we
limit ourselves to only attacking the

693
00:44:45,779 --> 00:44:48,519
way is that those specific adversaries
attack

694
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:52,289
because we want them to go through the
experience of getting attacked by the

695
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:57,470
person that's most likely to attack them

696
00:44:57,470 --> 00:45:03,039
K defy top because I want people to have
that experience

697
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:06,779
now maybe that's a level one or two or
three or five or whatever else depending

698
00:45:06,779 --> 00:45:08,130
on their adversarial class

699
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:12,690
but that's gonna get them ready that's
got a patch that human stupidity peace

700
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:15,349
because they're gonna go through the
experience they're gonna be cool under

701
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:16,130
fire

702
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:20,700
and at the end of the day when some
analysts the sitting on the keyboard

703
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:24,559
and stopping a shell from happening
they're gonna go hot Chris your

704
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:29,019
bitch I got you and then we like him to
where you like

705
00:45:29,019 --> 00:45:33,710
try again you suck how much not me today

706
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:36,819
and the like whole so actually stop the
attack

707
00:45:36,819 --> 00:45:40,609
because they were cool with it now
because they're freaking out now because

708
00:45:40,609 --> 00:45:43,160
they had an incident response plan %uh
because the ending of

709
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:47,920
because they want to the experience so
this repeatedly methodologies

710
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,499
that lots of us have worked on before if
any have you ever seen

711
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:55,839
the test its a muchos core testers

712
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:00,869
who got pissed about people screwing up
the word and test

713
00:46:00,869 --> 00:46:05,430
and just said Cole wait it out this is
how we do testing

714
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:08,900
so if you ever need some guidance on how
to do some this testing

715
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:12,630
it's out there it's free I only licenses
right thing else just

716
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:17,700
go take it use it printouts out some
Italian care

717
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:22,180
for stricter tests

718
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:26,069
it's a big problem try you can only at
me

719
00:46:26,069 --> 00:46:28,920
I'm sure all of us have gone through
this right you can only test these

720
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,609
things

721
00:46:30,609 --> 00:46:34,009
what about that nine thousand other
hosts will let you know you can only

722
00:46:34,009 --> 00:46:34,989
test these nine

723
00:46:34,989 --> 00:46:39,140
hosts what no that's okay with me

724
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:41,890
because your test tonight hosting a
local to this false sense of security

725
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:42,630
understanding your

726
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:45,789
violent and then you go all our secure
we just had a contest even though it was

727
00:46:45,789 --> 00:46:48,190
like dresses

728
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:51,980
really that someone kick your door and
still your server no

729
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:55,670
not much of a test as a criminal will do
that

730
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:59,460
they will kick your door if but they
don't care about your door locks there

731
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:00,890
was scope

732
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:04,099
say that your

733
00:47:04,099 --> 00:47:07,690
is in response plan doesn't matter
because

734
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:12,940
mike tyson the profit

735
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:16,059
said something that I'll never ever
forget

736
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:20,569
in his wonderful list behind Voice

737
00:47:20,569 --> 00:47:23,569
K mike tyson said something

738
00:47:23,569 --> 00:47:27,099
for the entire security world to write
underway pork

739
00:47:27,099 --> 00:47:34,099
which is everybody has a plan until they
get punched in the face

740
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:38,010
up yeah

741
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:41,240
%ah Somerset

742
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:44,970
every sale prices appear you like bad
cyclic

743
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:48,210
okay shit stop it just hello

744
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:54,300
let me read what I'm supposed to do a

745
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:57,800
at welcome to our industry ok

746
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:02,540
yet so we need to be able

747
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:06,920
to set a reason why expectations for
ourselves and and a lot of times I think

748
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,270
that work unreasonable

749
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:11,700
at all reasonable spine for certain
things

750
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:15,170
right like I'm gonna get unreasonably
drunk

751
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:18,320
okay great but

752
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:22,760
but being able to be unreasonable in
security is not always the right way to

753
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,180
do it

754
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:27,100
right you can't wait for the world you
have to set a chief what expectations

755
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:31,140
because you need to be able to get
people addicted to progress

756
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:35,530
I all this crap that i've been talking
about

757
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:38,720
is really about we have these attackers

758
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:43,440
there there they compromise us they
break our will

759
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:49,070
we go to security conferences to cry and
hold each other we get there was a

760
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:52,170
security conference with crying and
holding each other we come back home

761
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:55,320
we stayed over users in town other its

762
00:48:55,320 --> 00:49:00,440
we go back into work you and we wait for
the next compromise the happens that we

763
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,620
can go to some other security conference
get drunk

764
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:07,160
and cried all the other day and this is
not this is not a good way to do it

765
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:11,790
right we need to set some type of
expectations for ourselves and for our

766
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:13,440
companies that are achievable

767
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,760
so that we can get a company's addicted
to progress because we get them add that

768
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,470
to the progress

769
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:22,290
even if we don't have the energy to
force it forward

770
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:25,920
they will Sep make sense

771
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:31,180
that's that's what I wanna see other
programs I don't wanna see more

772
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,820
checkboxes I don't wanna see

773
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:36,180
more shit in front I don't wanna see you
know more

774
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:40,810
things that could defend or not the
fender River Park not refer Parker

775
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:44,400
arbitrarily attesting to who was doing a
turf

776
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,800
can APT one report all that stuff
doesn't matter because if you're not

777
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,770
addicted to progress you're not going
anywhere and you've actually be one

778
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:52,970
other people the report

779
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:57,760
plus up also have to understand

780
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:03,850
that's our job is not fair it's not fair

781
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:07,610
that's a relief I

782
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:11,690
ever look at that picture number of
times I just sit there and stare at home

783
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:12,030
like

784
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:16,530
when it is a gangster of so

785
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:20,230
all of my reading aside

786
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:23,940
our expectations

787
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:27,390
especially around our users hopefully

788
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:32,060
I if I get anything today hopefully I
can stop every other speaker

789
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:37,640
from blaming the users %uh the problem
and if i cant I'm enough

790
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:42,030
physically sick right there in that seat
and call a minute and I'm willing to

791
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:42,650
fight off

792
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:47,110
I'm a camp arrogant angry americans
that's what we did right

793
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:50,420
but but but

794
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:54,970
one of our biggest problems that we have
aside from all these attacks

795
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:58,460
aside from the achievable nature of our
security program is

796
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:02,860
and up I'll leave you with us this is
what we expect

797
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:07,870
I love every single one of our users

798
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:12,260
that's all we expect that's really
unreasonable is it

799
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:15,380
it's really really over

800
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:19,560
its is awesome as it sounds I would love
that my dog Clippers on ships

801
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:22,730
that the Fed past because I would have
to do nothing for it I mean if you could

802
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:23,910
do that and feed itself

803
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:27,350
it's just exist in my house and I never
I can only play with it why what

804
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:31,090
right and how much of a narcissistic
shit is that

805
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:34,610
I all are just play with you when I
walked in Skyway

806
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:38,540
and that operate in be angry at you when
you don't do the things I want even

807
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:39,610
though I didn't tell you

808
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:42,810
sounds like last marriage but whatever

809
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:46,450
up I

810
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:50,280
sale so we have these things right

811
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:55,590
ever expect we expect all over animals
in our little house that we protect

812
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:59,480
to clean up after themselves up yet

813
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:02,810
yet we you know constantly ignore fact

814
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:09,570
like how many people have had a virus
and their environment right

815
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:12,610
and this the just so that you know

816
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:16,820
just that you know there's people here
didn't raise their hands if you can't

817
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:17,680
look this latest

818
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,410
Lily as much a joke with there's
somebody who didn't raise their aunt

819
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:24,510
that silly of so

820
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:30,320
so we all understand that right how many
people have been hacked

821
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,950
yet there's a less again from my side
view

822
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:38,250
there's less people there is the head
right that means that those people who

823
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:40,280
is the head once and didn't the other
time

824
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:43,500
don't understand that

825
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:48,710
a virus executes functions on your
machine

826
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:52,770
but you didn't ask it to do

827
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:56,820
to do something for someone or something
else

828
00:52:56,820 --> 00:53:02,460
right which is also exactly what getting
hacked its

829
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:06,640
ok right

830
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,280
or chain of so

831
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:14,360
so understanding that all this have been
hacked before

832
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:18,190
to me is really important because we
don't have to

833
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:21,780
like lose faith right cuz cuz Ralph

834
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:26,160
you know like this is the secret a
meeting almost go down also

835
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,400
college yes I got hacked all the time it
sucks

836
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,990
what do I do next instead of just say
maybe like no not me

837
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:37,950
I I don't I just have a couple drinks
and I hope not yet I'll call

838
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:41,740
just a love hate but that's why you're
here

839
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:45,610
so we don't have much to lose right

840
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:48,620
always have already been hacked

841
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:53,970
so why don't we just start making
progress

842
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:58,240
right that the things that I put up
there are no heart

843
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,400
and I'm not saying that you can even do
them but if

844
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,910
if you do anything at least 20 all

845
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:07,980
and we go back to your company

846
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:12,720
try something new instead of worrying
about installing worship

847
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,750
go have an interview with an executive

848
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,980
sitting for them for 30 minutes

849
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:23,140
and just say you know what Jen bill

850
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:26,240
hot whatever your name is

851
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:30,240
I don't care it's my job to protect you

852
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:34,160
what do you do ask them what they do

853
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:38,280
the funny part is that a lot of them
have no fucking idea they like I

854
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:42,480
I a set in this office

855
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:49,050
cool I need to get better locks but when
you start to provide them solutions

856
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:53,320
instantly and let me tell you right now

857
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:57,640
those people will be your best friends
we're good friends that have especially

858
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:58,720
when it comes time for

859
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,420
budget cuts up but

860
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:07,580
but just go have that talk with them out
of all the Gartner Inc on friendship and

861
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:08,350
everything else

862
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:12,740
and go home and understand you're all

863
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:17,620
figure out what your landscape is take
back your home field advantage

864
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:21,630
cuz you're just give it away it doesn't
take much

865
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:26,830
all it takes to set up a meeting and
sitting down and not being afraid

866
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:30,670
we have nothing to be afraid of cuz also
been authorized there's nothing to be

867
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:33,640
afraid if this is our job to protect
people

868
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:37,290
I think you know every secret service on
the planet

869
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:40,630
I

870
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:46,080
their job is to protect people is the
standard for the bullets

871
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:49,790
be the person that stands in for the
packets

872
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:52,070
set tie-up I've elsa
