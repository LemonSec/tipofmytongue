1
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:12,170
up

2
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:24,150
myself would

3
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:33,480
of

4
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,839
much

5
00:00:48,839 --> 00:00:54,940
yep

6
00:00:54,940 --> 00:01:00,360
me

7
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:06,049
make

8
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:10,330
he sighed

9
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:16,080
up

10
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,490
so you had

11
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,509
yes so of very fast

12
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:31,509
not going

13
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,359
official PC all

14
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:42,829
side see

15
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:48,290
well thank you I F

16
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,420
no-pressure ok thank you for

17
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,979
for taking that risk with me I hope I
hope you all enjoy this presentation

18
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:57,509
okay so i'm david weinstein

19
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:02,009
I work at via forensics the company
based out of Chicago

20
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,780
focused on mobile security and part of
my job is to do

21
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,800
research in mobile security and so
basically what I'm gonna present today

22
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,700
is some prefer concept for injury
platform

23
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,280
and I want to do it in the context love
this idea corporate espionage because

24
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,160
it's a big deal

25
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,360
it's happening in large-scale I believe

26
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,550
so corporate espionage what is this

27
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,620
a you know perhaps this stay /div a

28
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,810
for pedestrians as a result of increased
reliance on computers Asian

29
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:36,680
I'm I mean certainly James Bond makes
this really sexy stuff rate

30
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,410
so the its kinda fun to talk about

31
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,550
but when I'm really focused on is the
mobile mobile

32
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,840
you know what is the risk curve you know
these mobile platforms

33
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,079
in in a corporate setting arm

34
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:55,010
and what we've seen at least in most
cases

35
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,900
from small beginnings country things
right so in the case of our essay

36
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,450
it was simply an email that

37
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:07,230
started the whole chain of events that
led to you RC security tokens being

38
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,180
stolen right so

39
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,579
it wasn't something very complicated I'm
or

40
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:14,690
sophisticated you know email was crafted

41
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:18,480
and ended up being an email that landed
into a junk email box

42
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,160
right to the user actually went into the
junk email

43
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,250
and found and clicked on that that euro
on

44
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,730
clicked on that document yes so

45
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,790
clearly the level surfaces
sophistication required to get into

46
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,480
corporate network isn't set all that
high these days this talk is a little

47
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,540
bit more forward-looking

48
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,350
I'm trying to look at what are the
possibilities with mobile platforms

49
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,420
so you know the comment

50
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,870
that you know I I'd like to ask is

51
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,049
it's just business rate this this idea
of stealing information

52
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:58,260
you know perhaps their nation states
that are doing this perhaps it's company

53
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:58,920
to company

54
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,849
but arm for the most part it's for
business or you know national game

55
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:08,390
but yet the FBI put out a report saying
that

56
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:12,110
you know thirteen billion dollars have
accumulated in Los intellectual property

57
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,640
so I don't know how they put a number to
this

58
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,970
but obviously it's have interest to the
US government and I'm sure other

59
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:19,709
governments

60
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:23,120
a where this intellectual property is
going

61
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:30,120
and how it's leaving no question is what
what is if interest

62
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,440
clearly information and communication
systems military stuff

63
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,430
the healthcare electronics information
on

64
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,490
patent-pending results research and
development

65
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,140
all these things are particular interest
in a corporate environment

66
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,979
and basically

67
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:54,930
you know we fought we find that more and
more cyber and probably should drink

68
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,460
when I say that but it's more it easier
to do it via

69
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,550
computer computers because the Lacombe
attribution

70
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,270
you for all these other talks talking
about how hard it is to attribute things

71
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,400
to particular country

72
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,979
arm and the level is set very low

73
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:12,080
mean clearly sending email with
attachment not that hard

74
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,039
home so you know there's this big
question

75
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:19,789
love how's this problem can be solved
but I'm

76
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:22,470
I guess the angle that i'm gonna take
with this talk is to just give another

77
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,610
example of how

78
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,580
things can be done and try to talk about
some potential medications for those

79
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,180
attacks

80
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:33,840
now show couple demos potential talk
about the moment

81
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,599
so the question is is it you

82
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:41,630
what's happening we just really been
tracking things from 2009

83
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:45,940
at least in the news i'm talking about
Aurora for susan is doesn't show up very

84
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,510
well

85
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,210
on this projector but basically you know
I'm trying to

86
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:54,260
to put across that you know there's a
lot of public attention to this stuff

87
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:58,530
and the more tension there is to it them
or like leaders to happen in my opinion

88
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:05,000
so the question is it real um

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,979
so I have a video here I don't know if
it'll

90
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:15,979
if it'll play with full audio but I will
try

91
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,229
did

92
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:24,910
me just go back there

93
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:31,910
it

94
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,330
rates

95
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:42,540
track some fall cast I

96
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:48,350
speech took last song staff apart

97
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,970
phone see half sexy suck

98
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:57,620
all sprawl

99
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:04,620
I costs I

100
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,260
scheck's hearse

101
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,780
Ste much power first

102
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,780
scotch shocks

103
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:22,360
spy 30 make spark high tops

104
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,870
I such

105
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,650
speech hosts

106
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,000
sparse

107
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,190
smallest seed Serena blasts

108
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:41,660
I'm sheesh

109
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:47,069
I

110
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:47,539
so

111
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:51,119
this this video 30 captures on

112
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:55,439
have a lot of interesting topics

113
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:59,689
on you have a question is it right to do
these sorts of things

114
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:03,110
are you can throw K okay

115
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,110
so you know there's a lot of questions
here this for you and a lot of

116
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:11,849
interesting potential answers yeltsin I
like it because it summarizes them all

117
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:15,039
for one-minute clip on but

118
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,339
now the question is how how real is that
is it possible to do this sort of thing

119
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:19,589
with mobile devices

120
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:24,199
and you know here's a interesting piece
of research from

121
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:27,639
this guy this research are Templeman
University

122
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:32,110
at you receive Indiana any basically
created an application

123
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,779
that opportunistically takes pictures
from mobile devices

124
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:39,300
and combines that with accelerometer
data

125
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,990
from the sensor on the platform to
create these

126
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,810
very interesting 3d models love

127
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:52,529
rooms and from from that they were able
to extract information like barcodes

128
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:56,540
checking numbers on use with codes on

129
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,130
checks in you know so many different
interesting artifacts from

130
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:04,670
setting so they called this now like in
information burglary from

131
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:08,630
from mobile device so it's a kinda cool
interesting idea and

132
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:12,399
and it didn't have to work that hard
certainly building these models

133
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,600
was was challenging but we're at a point
with

134
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,079
visual with our capabilities with
visualization and 3d modeling that were

135
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:21,670
able to do this in quite rapidly

136
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:27,370
so it's been interesting so next I like
to talk about

137
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:31,389
on these things in the context of the
mobile overkill chain so the culture is

138
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:33,250
basically eight steps in a process

139
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,069
uptick typical right arm in the case of
mobile

140
00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:41,250
its it's a little bit more complicated
you have more potential attack surface

141
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:45,350
but on this is a useful way to talk
about how an attack happens where you

142
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,009
can sort it

143
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:49,790
defend things armed and its

144
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,209
it basically how many walkthrough wanted
want the demos the minute you

145
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:56,939
so you on the left we have before you do
reconnaissance

146
00:09:56,939 --> 00:10:01,269
on you might weaponize some kinda
exploit you deliver and then

147
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:08,269
use the expert against the target so in
the gather intelligence base in the case

148
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,970
mobile one the most useful things you
can gather is

149
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:17,220
on the serial number the device when and
how the user charges this

150
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,329
device which will be useful later great
all sorts of device fingerprint

151
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,120
information

152
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,059
there movie the interesting thing is
that the majority things you can get for

153
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,459
reconnaissance you can do with

154
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:32,439
basically an advertisement library
sitting in the application arm

155
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:36,319
a lot of that information is basically
gathered by these advertising libraries

156
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:36,639
and

157
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:42,209
people don't seem to you to care that
much course

158
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:46,350
as an adversary you have to prepare some
kind of

159
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:50,360
exploit or attacks for that particular
device

160
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:57,350
in my case I build a custom kernel for
the Android device the the targets on

161
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:01,360
in the pit stall some market on the
platform because I'd like to have

162
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,510
low-level access to things inside the
current

163
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:09,300
a force when it comes time to delivering

164
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,519
a payload to the application we have
many options

165
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,529
in the case of Android devices it's very
easy to you basically dynamically

166
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:23,160
download object from from website and
low that into memory

167
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,420
whereas and i OS platforms that's far
more difficult that's

168
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:33,420
generally not is not new is easy so in
the case a

169
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:38,959
just go back for seconds so in the case
%uh vom the demo them to do in a moment

170
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,970
the basically we've created demo RSS
application

171
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,529
so that the idea is that the users
downloaded in our setup occasion

172
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:50,939
for browsing going you know downloading
slashed our articles or

173
00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:55,420
reddit articles and use the fact that we
can dynamically

174
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,680
extend the functionality the application
to

175
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:05,569
lewd malicious content them course you
have 2x

176
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:08,910
execute yet the export against the
target

177
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,819
lose the malicious code in this case

178
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:17,510
installing some kind have arm userspace
application-level rat

179
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:22,089
and a crime level component mostly
because

180
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:26,579
it's a lot easier to you do things at
the application layer to gather data

181
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:30,279
because there's some there's a semantic
gap you're looking at things from

182
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:34,189
the kernel space things look a lot on
more abstract

183
00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:37,699
and if you're able to act extract
information from userspace

184
00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:41,309
it's much easier because you can just
call the appropriate the ice so you

185
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:43,149
basically have the ability to you

186
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:45,920
get things information at the current
level and information at the application

187
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,699
layer

188
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:50,899
very nicely

189
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:53,939
command control so once the

190
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:57,519
the target applications run on the
device it'll connect back to

191
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,399
our server and this is all pretty
typical for you know normal laptop and

192
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:02,600
desktop platforms

193
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,850
perceive the challenge the mobile
network going down so you have to be

194
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,029
resilient to you

195
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:10,130
you network com being different

196
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,420
that sort of thing

197
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,870
then of course if you have some
objective right so in in the first

198
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,689
demo my objective is just to gain access
to the platform

199
00:13:20,689 --> 00:13:24,179
almond extract all sensor data and many

200
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:28,819
contacts lists and as much data that I
can get from the platform itself

201
00:13:28,819 --> 00:13:33,679
in the second demo basically using the
phone to

202
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,160
actually start a whole nother kill chain
so you can have killed chains with until

203
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,079
chains

204
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,579
on server Chris that we define so 1k
somebody's one killed saying to you get

205
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:46,140
access to the device and the other
cultural use the devices

206
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:51,949
leverage the device to basically get on
to another device

207
00:13:51,949 --> 00:13:54,990
and of course you have to be stealthy so

208
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:58,920
you we heard talks about interesting
techniques for doing covert channels but

209
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,649
for the most part you don't have to
employ the sophisticated covert channels

210
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:02,459
because

211
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:05,769
use mobile networks aren't looking at
the sort to communication

212
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:09,709
channels closely do you believe that
year

213
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:12,750
infrastructure is actually looking at
this very thing

214
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:18,640
not really especially if it's just very
simply infected

215
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,339
course there's no shortage of sensors on
these platforms in the case a

216
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:25,779
phone the demo I'll be using all the
sensors that are in

217
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:30,750
I agree so I'll be able to take pictures
from the front camera on the rear camber

218
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,079
X will trade data through the baseband
wifi

219
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,260
gather information about local wireless
networks Bluetooth devices

220
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,579
all this stuff is not really knew right
we can expect always

221
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:44,870
of

222
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:49,209
hussein but also

223
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:52,920
cases fraud that user

224
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,439
when PCs

225
00:14:57,439 --> 00:15:02,410
Richard you

226
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:08,040
he dude

227
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,449
is just party

228
00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:16,310
that's because here

229
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:20,440
day this first time

230
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:27,440
which

231
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,430
first

232
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:42,790
when you use this yeah

233
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:49,790
you

234
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,690
he runs for you Narcisse

235
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:58,280
up you did

236
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,860
the basic years that

237
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,270
user down seems like non

238
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:12,140
this is up very love you of

239
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:19,140
believe this a puppy

240
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,940
mmm

241
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:34,000
you the longer here find that

242
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,100
through i misses you

243
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,240
I mean added your RSS feed

244
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,810
he's if

245
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:47,910
you were is for you rosalee's

246
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:51,090
about different movies with here

247
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:57,890
just basic here then we have another

248
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:04,890
min that we can send to this application

249
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,659
so here we see that X sounds good

250
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:29,010
to you up to iraq this

251
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:35,080
vision system on racism with its not
stop

252
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,100
hitchens is basically

253
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:45,100
connected back to my sister said

254
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:51,110
you can see that

255
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:54,690
up to phones and the server

256
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:59,460
get all sorts interesting the

257
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,429
he I this particular life

258
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:10,259
all so his life

259
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:13,620
here the

260
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,840
these yet

261
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,919
both particular here the

262
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:24,960
trying to of

263
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,320
like stools fun things

264
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,789
was itself sand a ivory

265
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:35,090
up

266
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:41,230
yes live really

267
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,330
we can send messages

268
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:48,700
user

269
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:53,370
so basically he said

270
00:18:53,370 --> 00:19:00,370
great URL

271
00:19:02,459 --> 00:19:06,969
word his

272
00:19:06,969 --> 00:19:11,379
you whose

273
00:19:11,379 --> 00:19:15,729
we

274
00:19:15,729 --> 00:19:19,769
pictures would

275
00:19:19,769 --> 00:19:26,769
back

276
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:38,110
was about

277
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:45,110
interest him

278
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:04,179
if

279
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:14,790
this particular devices he half

280
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:22,130
his

281
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:25,900
all of us both his

282
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:32,900
on

283
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:42,970
but

284
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:52,260
you the you

285
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:57,000
no user the the

286
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,410
but the food was the places that

287
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:05,590
who your up

288
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:09,670
persons the water

289
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:13,960
up very

290
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,450
like these fools gold this is the he

291
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:24,070
should you

292
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:27,490
prophecy with you

293
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,860
police and

294
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:34,180
up whose the

295
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,470
different receive faxes

296
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,540
of things simple

297
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:46,880
steel should

298
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,870
you do it offers which said

299
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,860
who said

300
00:21:54,860 --> 00:22:00,669
should

301
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:03,929
he's whose

would

362
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:45,820
is said

Jersey all are said

386
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:25,659
here

387
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:30,890
so

388
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:33,059

up

392
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:59,610

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,080
up

408
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:48,080
he said

409
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,340
he all

410
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:56,809
here

411
00:32:56,809 --> 00:33:03,809

while sorry or

416
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:27,960
all for good

417
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:33,140
use

418
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,720
or buyout

419
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,060
and would

420
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:43,619
there of

421
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:47,470
said well

422
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:50,879
10 years life

423
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:57,009
all up

424
00:33:57,009 --> 00:34:03,220
3 us

425
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:07,540
up

426
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:14,540
says up

427
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:24,339
up

428
00:34:24,339 --> 00:34:30,310
polls

429
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:35,889
used good

430
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:42,889
you

431
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:47,810
the

432
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:54,810
up

433
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:56,760
home

434
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:02,860
both so

435
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:06,359
your

436
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:08,920
with

437
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:15,920
there

438
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,540
good

439
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:38,970
X so we have basically two options

440
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:43,180
recompile the kernel or patch at runtime
so depending on how skilled you are

441
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,819
passing the external on time

442
00:35:44,819 --> 00:35:47,990
you can just recompile the kernel it's
pretty easy to get the kernel source

443
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:50,180
because all this stuff is open source on
entry

444
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:53,960
Eunice request the colonel from Samsung
or Toshiba

445
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,960
war Google its pretty simple to get
that's

446
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,470
on

447
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:06,130
in order to integrate with the rest of
the Android platform you have a couple

448
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:12,420
call backs have a couple call back
functions that you have to implement see

449
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,520
a minute cleanup enable

450
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,829
combine configure and buying configured
to control cost

451
00:36:17,829 --> 00:36:21,060
so I'm basically just going to talk
about this in it

452
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:25,359
and the spine function I feel like
everything else is pretty simple from

453
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:25,660
there

454
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:31,119
so this hit function in it what all does
it do

455
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,750
I'm sure not all you've done Linux
kernel hacking in the past but I feel

456
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,270
like the stuff is pretty easy to follow

457
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:40,240
KZ alec is equivalent to malloc in
userspace

458
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,010
so you can allocate the structure the
sizes function config

459
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:48,050
which is basically hit function
configures that

460
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:52,030
the stove call back functions that I
should you earlier so that thing on the

461
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:52,540
bottom

462
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:58,119
rate that's basically what we're taking
sizeof and

463
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:01,130
then we'll to set up a couple love
options in that conflict

464
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:04,920
file in a complex structure and all this
other functions he had set up

465
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,390
which is in this wonderfully available

466
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:11,920
I'm see file called funds were hit so it
turns out that the Linux kernel

467
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,770
already supports hid devices so we just
have to connect

468
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:19,220
on these functions together to make this
attack work

469
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:26,220
we don't have to actually implement the
component in that she had set up

470
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,220
function

471
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:30,540
we basically allocate a character device
so that

472
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:34,569
from userspace will have this new file
in the slash dove tree

473
00:37:34,569 --> 00:37:37,660
called he'd G something and

474
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:41,660
this is how colonel you create really
easy al Qaeda character device with

475
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:45,210
a certain arm a certain value

476
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:51,319
and call it something

477
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:56,210
to bind basically the functionality of
the device to you the Android system

478
00:37:56,210 --> 00:38:00,440
we call busy have a wrapper function for
this

479
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,329
function f head called did you find
convicts you can configure already

480
00:38:04,329 --> 00:38:06,310
implemented for switches have to connect
piece

481
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:11,950
once again and how does that work

482
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:15,319
well this one slightly more complicated
we saw

483
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:19,880
allocate some extra data structures but
on basically this part is the meat what

484
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,510
makes

485
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:25,319
on he'd gadget he'd get because the way
that the US peace pact works

486
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:29,450
you define a couple fields in your in
your USP

487
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:34,630
descriptor and you basically you have to
set these values to particular

488
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:38,680
to particular things that you get from
the USB spec look we'll an external

489
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,589
people have already

490
00:38:39,589 --> 00:38:42,849
but that stuff or so we'll have to do
that but if you were interested you

491
00:38:42,849 --> 00:38:43,619
could go look up

492
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:47,460
in this respect what these values
actually are may come from our

493
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,670
are filed RF descriptor which was a
little bit earlier

494
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:55,670
and then we basically call this USB
headphone which is a composite

495
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:59,930
function so this is implement to use get
from to the in the composite e-file

496
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:05,910
once you do this

497
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:09,300
and if you re compiling the kernel you
have to write it

498
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,670
and rejoice redo but once you've done
this you have a new

499
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:16,450
file in your Dept recall dead he g0

500
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:20,119
in the cases the phone on that I was
using actually have a keyboard and a

501
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:20,619
mouse

502
00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:24,460
so I would have a dead g0 NNA did g1 I
could have

503
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:27,579
1200 you know keyboard devices I want
you

504
00:39:27,579 --> 00:39:31,130
needlessly to show up is dead 10 101

505
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:34,230
just whatever and if I want to write
data

506
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:37,500
to you that device basically just take

507
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,550
a fight sequence arm

508
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:45,619
mostly zeros and this this particular
example cent VAT struck down so

509
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:48,819
the way that the USB protocol

510
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:52,720
for devices works you have any fights
per keypress

511
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,920
and within that it bites you encode what
he struck his be held down

512
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,970
the first bite on the left is what's

513
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:03,770
on modifiers you're holding out on
selection of control

514
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:08,109
those are encoded in the first bite and
then a couple bites into this so you the

515
00:40:08,109 --> 00:40:09,180
actual the next by

516
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:13,650
00 here %uh the second by is always zero
it's reserved

517
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:16,859
and then after that the six bites on the
right

518
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:19,990
they encode what keystroke is being held
down so on the case a

519
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:24,579
just four key and then everyone the so
they'll basically hold down the A button

520
00:40:24,579 --> 00:40:25,470
from the

521
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:29,339
host perspective so this is just repeat
a over and over again

522
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:32,980
in order to get that back up we just
have to clear that bit

523
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:39,010
and and then the phone stop sending that
he's

524
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:42,119
you want to send the BT increment for
buy one

525
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:45,349
do the same thing and you can send
multiple keys down so actually you can

526
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:47,109
increase your rated typing

527
00:40:47,109 --> 00:40:54,109
you get the timing right on send by six
points at a time

528
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,920
so in summary

529
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,150
how hard is it to do injury-hit stuff
not that hard particularly because the

530
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:06,119
his stuff is already in the final we're
not limited to doing it stuff we can do

531
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:08,060
all sorts of other things we can

532
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:12,060
emulate other devices and Android in the
lecture will give us by default the mass

533
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:12,829
storage

534
00:41:12,829 --> 00:41:15,880
NNTP in all these other devices that we
can just

535
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:20,839
uses so its you know it's not super
challenging the question is how can we

536
00:41:20,839 --> 00:41:21,890
do to run time:

537
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:25,410
and that's a little bit more challenging
because the way they entered

538
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:29,109
structures were built up they weren't
set up to you basically be

539
00:41:29,109 --> 00:41:32,339
on dynamically registered so you have to
go back in

540
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:36,060
replace some %uh those those functions
within that Android

541
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:41,740
data structure analytical more work

542
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:46,390
but basically you wait for the plug
event and you on the machine

543
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:52,420
I love this red button I don't know if
you have I have this one is on my desk

544
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:56,170
so I mean in summary basically I I
wanted to

545
00:41:56,170 --> 00:42:00,030
show how it's possible to do these kinds
of attacks

546
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:03,530
I wanted to show that it's possible to
you

547
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:06,960
also detect these things so

548
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,950
water some potential medications for
this

549
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:14,790
what one thing for the mobile attack is
to the corporate setting always

550
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:18,900
TPP Anna sure it's gonna take more
battery to maintain the network

551
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,630
connection

552
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:23,490
all the time but at least you're going
to be able to leverage your

553
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:27,049
intrusion protection systems your
network based prostitution stuff

554
00:42:27,049 --> 00:42:30,319
and be able to see some these kinds of
attacks as they're happening

555
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:33,599
place so if you if you're not

556
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,970
basically keeping the VPN up your kinda
leading on all that information go to

557
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:38,589
the

558
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:41,920
infrastructure to the cell towers and
you're not for you being able to capture

559
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,990
that sort of thing

560
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:46,329
so obviously that's a challenge but if
you can do to keep you know

561
00:42:46,329 --> 00:42:50,549
began up and use your corporate
infrastructure

562
00:42:50,549 --> 00:42:54,280
limit third-party applications and for
proactively analyze them

563
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,280
so no tear them apart reverse engineer
them

564
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,680
look at how they work also consider the
ecosystem

565
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,060
how Android devices and other mobile
devices interact with

566
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:08,970
arm the broader scope love machinery out
there

567
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:12,690
there is a bunch of data d loss
prevention software that you

568
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:16,920
Tom can be deployed on the host and the
one the problems is that that's not

569
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,810
properly configured and it's also an
uphill battle because

570
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:23,579
it comes down to be a black white list
on the deal P so

571
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:27,430
you might be able to detect that on
random devices are being plugged into

572
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:30,730
your brain and USB devices being plugged
in but how do you decide which ones you

573
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:31,890
can allow in tonight's

574
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:38,730
still a problem the courses training and
awareness

575
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:45,730
to is basically it i'm happy to take
some questions

576
00:43:58,099 --> 00:44:01,359
now just the Internet yeah

577
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:05,480
so the particular vulnerability that was
exploited the accident things is

578
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,230
required

579
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:11,080
ability to read and write from the
filesystem so something like

580
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:14,950
SE Android which is the project that's

581
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:18,359
starting to be used on some actual
commercial devices would've potentially

582
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:19,710
protected something like that

583
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:24,380
on because I see enjoy it is designed to
prevent you space applications from

584
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:28,080
you know obviously doing anything anyone
it's sort of a a whitelist I'm going to

585
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,160
loan application to you only touch
certain files in the file system

586
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:35,700
I'm going on make off limits the whole
slashed at Rideau Hall slash prop trio

587
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:42,700
whole in a directory of files pardon

588
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:53,690
see groups

589
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:57,529
I'm not familiar with the group is that
like a userspace user mode Linux kind of

590
00:44:57,529 --> 00:44:58,150
thing words

591
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:03,730
ch ruling on

592
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:10,730
so is is it a sin yeah

593
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:15,339
so deftly would help to deploy those
kinda things on these devices

594
00:45:15,339 --> 00:45:19,650
become the question no are there still
colonel vulnerabilities that I can

595
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:24,900
attack so you know if I'm still plugging
in devices into my mobile device

596
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:28,190
you heard Travis answer to talk about
all those drivers that exists in the

597
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:29,059
kernel

598
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:32,950
so use of to worry about that same
attack surface because it sits inside

599
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:33,599
the kernel

600
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:37,230
you the questions

601
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:40,839
okay
