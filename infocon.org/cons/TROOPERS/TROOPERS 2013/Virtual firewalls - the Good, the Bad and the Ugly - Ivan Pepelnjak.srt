1
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,370
thanks for inviting me well

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,370
%uh

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,050
for studies

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,020
claimer I'm not a security person I'm

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,420
networking engineer who was stupid
enough to stumble

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,330
into the virtualization mass and it then
it got

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,380
interest think so I said well yeah sure
let's try this

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,369
and one other things that happened in
the virtualization mass

9
00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:33,560
is that they introduced firewalls into
that mess

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,840
and what I did today is

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,310
I will tell you from the architectural
perspective

12
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:44,780
what the options are so I will not go
into products

13
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:50,090
because he only gave me an hour I am

14
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,219
I will not go deep into detail so I'll
adjust

15
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:59,600
tell you what the bro skate landscape of
virtual firewall

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,670
product this and what different people
are doing because

17
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,510
a lot of people are experimenting with
different ideas

18
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:11,659
if you want to know more details I'd be
here for the next two days

19
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:15,540
and I can spend hours discussing things

20
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,460
as long as you don't ask me whether this
is more secure than

21
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,220
physical firewall or not as that that
turns into a

22
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,530
religious argument okay so

23
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,740
a just imagine it I'm doing a lot of
other similar thing so if anyone is

24
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,210
interest into more and more
virtualization stuff this are all the

25
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:35,560
things

26
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,070
sup firewalls s we knew that

27
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,630
in the past the used to be easy it was

28
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,810
either packet filters or stateful
firewalls and them people discovered

29
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,740
that this is like basic hygiene this is
like washing hands

30
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,850
because ninety percent of the attacks
happened over here

31
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,910
things like sequel injection

32
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,230
and who knows what else if you do if you
read

33
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:06,640
any threat reports everyone is telling
you

34
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,940
ninety-plus percent of the bad stuff
happens

35
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,950
at layer 7 and

36
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,310
here we are protecting things at later
3&4

37
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,570
its really like washing hands

38
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:24,550
you have to have it for good reasons
because sometimes you just might be

39
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,240
vulnerable

40
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,550
on player 3&4 but this

41
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,210
things with not protect you the gamethe
the really

42
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:38,510
stupid stuff like sick when injections
so those of you who are familiar with

43
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,960
that American comic

44
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,980
xkcd you probably know about the two by
the tables the guy who

45
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,520
the named his child so that the name
three-guard

46
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:57,350
a sequel injection yes

47
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:02,880
and doesn't work to bed

48
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,480
yep okay

49
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,970
and than the last one that we can
discuss offline

50
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,340
is r load balancers firewalls or not
because

51
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,709
actually they provide some functionality
over here and they provide some

52
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:19,190
functionality over here sup

53
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:23,130
you could misuse them as firewalls if
you wish let's not go there

54
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,150
the other thing that the

55
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:30,730
St San and as the bait it should I have
a router firewall

56
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:34,160
a with inside and outside subnets or
should I

57
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,170
cat abridged firewall which is like a
bomb

58
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:41,450
in the wire and it really depends on
what you're trying to do

59
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,520
so both have their

60
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:49,580
uses the for example here you typically
can only have two interfaces

61
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,900
at least in most implementations and
positive there's the vendor out there

62
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,319
too cast abridged by with the interfaces
a positive there is

63
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,000
%uh and the other thing to keep in mind
is that

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,780
anyone producing anything this day's

65
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,380
also cast a virtual some think

66
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,430
so it started with firewalls

67
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,060
a decade ago probably people were upset

68
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,539
that you are paying dance thousands of
dollars or Euros

69
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:23,599
for a box that has three interfaces
inside

70
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:27,349
outside and the Anzac or sometimes even
to so

71
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:31,870
for they wanted to have more interfaces
and then the figure now that the world

72
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,939
actually managing twenty security zones
with all different fire a firewall rules

73
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:38,219
on the same box as

74
00:04:38,219 --> 00:04:43,300
a nightmare and its so someone came up
with this great idea

75
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,259
what if I split this box into multiple
box

76
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:51,490
at this are not the virtual firewalls we
are looking for

77
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,430
these our devotional context on physical
box

78
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,199
its and old boring concept

79
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,009
keep in mind that the usually they tell
you how these things

80
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:08,330
out totally separate they still share
the resources like CPU

81
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:14,139
and interfaces and memory and they share
the same coat

82
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:19,139
so gain feel worried they are isolated
instances

83
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:23,759
in practice there is a lot of shared
state

84
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,589
keep that in mind before you ask me the
question about four so far was running

85
00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:31,319
on top of a hypervisor

86
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:37,379
there's a lot of shared stay here that
no one wants to talk about

87
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,800
sup if we compare virtual contexts on

88
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,879
physical firewalls with virtual
firewalls

89
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,139
and let's say for the moment that a
virtual firewall

90
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:53,550
is a VM with two interfaces running on
whatever hypervisor of your choice

91
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,889
we'll see later on that there are other
things and I'll go there but

92
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:00,830
for the moment let's say a virtual
firewall is virtual machine with two

93
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,389
interfaces

94
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:07,150
the first thing is that now people are
experimenting with all sorts of

95
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,219
transport technologies

96
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:13,289
that should get as beyond four thousand
fields

97
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:20,020
now he's anyone in the room that needs
more than 4,000 be Lance

98
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:23,400
okay well anyone that is

99
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,949
a cloud provider needs to

100
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:30,479
because the hopeful you have more than a
few hundred customers

101
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,210
otherwise things don't work out
financially unless you cast but the more

102
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:34,889
psych

103
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:38,879
BMW and Mercedes in which case is OK

104
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,939
%uh and each customer usually want to
have a few subnets for security reasons

105
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:47,749
so you need a few villains per customer
find the number of customers

106
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:50,949
4,000 is a very small number so people

107
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:56,369
are experimenting with all sorts of
different transport technologies

108
00:06:56,369 --> 00:06:59,719
and those transfer technologies are
usually supportive in the hypervisor

109
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:00,490
because

110
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:04,080
you know that's why the hypervisor
bender sleep on

111
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,469
but of course they're not supported by
the physical appliances

112
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,839
so you want to implement something like
BX lawn from

113
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:16,909
yen wor or MP Gerry from Microsoft or
STT from they see around now

114
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:21,219
VMware or GRE between as and server

115
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:27,639
marxists those things con be filter
Twitter regular firewall

116
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:31,849
because your firewall when there doesn't
care

117
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:35,460
on the other hand if you have a virtual
machine that seats on top of this thing

118
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,159
is

119
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:41,089
that virtual machine doesn't know that
you're using the lands or BX and or what

120
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:42,550
have you

121
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:47,629
so you're totally independent the
transport technology

122
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:52,990
okay a now the XLE and he's getting
supported by people like

123
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:58,610
at five and brocade and now arista and
and the jury supposedly supported by at

124
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,909
five and

125
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:02,969
dallas has announced something but
hasn't shipped yet

126
00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:06,279
so things are getting better but in
principle this

127
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:10,939
things will involve and the file the
physical fire was with always be like

128
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:15,419
one generation behind the leading edge

129
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:18,610
your thing is the configuration
management

130
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,860
with a virtual machine that's the
firewall it s the configuration which is

131
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,349
stored in the virtual disk

132
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:28,520
its way easy to take the virtual machine

133
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,440
well decided down you think the virtual
disk you move it

134
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,020
to some different place and you restart
a virtual machine

135
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,270
and you're back in business disaster
recovery

136
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:46,839
like this try do that with physical
firewalls

137
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:50,759
mission impossible K

138
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:54,350
oh were killed my batt a

139
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,490
you want to move Cole

140
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,199
application stack from data center a

141
00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:06,279
to data center be it could be for
migration purposes it could be for

142
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,779
disaster avoidance purposes it would be
for

143
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:11,940
is that the recovery purses what
whatever

144
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,100
you have to move the whole spec

145
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,190
okay with virtual firewalls

146
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,430
you shut everything down including the
firewalls you move everything

147
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:28,569
you start you're done try doing that
with physical files

148
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:31,850
there are people out there that the are
saying okay

149
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:35,310
you know we have this final clusters
every vendor support them

150
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,370
like this Cisco supports firework last
Thursday

151
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,089
find as juniper does everyone does it

152
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:46,630
so let's just put one member of the
cluster here

153
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:50,649
and another member of the cluster there
and the configuration was seen

154
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:57,160
automatically please don't even mention
this to me

155
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,649
yes some people don't get it but in
networking

156
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:06,480
actually sometimes both links might fail

157
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,569
me that's a surprise to most people out
there but sometimes networks fail

158
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:17,000
and you have to split brain cluster its
firewall going on its

159
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,110
own doing some crazy stuff

160
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:26,600
trust me you don't want to be and that
data center at that time

161
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,139
I've seen it once it wasn't pretty

162
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:34,160
up with virtual firewalls its

163
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,870
away obvious thing to do shut down
everything here

164
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,050
you move it over you started you get

165
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:44,910
the file so the good news

166
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,980
we're independent for the transport
network we can use be lands we can use

167
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,870
whatever else we wish

168
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:53,079
we have great configuration management
because

169
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:56,360
ok what do you think about the
configuration management ever if you got

170
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,389
my stick tenant environment

171
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:01,819
it could be partly cloudy or private
about

172
00:11:01,819 --> 00:11:05,490
every tenant can manage his own file

173
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,730
K you want to do your own stuff

174
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:13,050
be my guest here's your virtual firewall
play with it

175
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:17,959
oh you're kept to bat was yours

176
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:22,920
that weekend easily offload the
responsibility if people are willing to

177
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,709
take it over

178
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:27,829
great stuff sup now for some bad news
what

179
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:30,889
performance but you see that it's not

180
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:34,500
as bad ask it seems

181
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:40,480
hired were is not a problem broken
implementations are

182
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,240
and of course there are attacks on the
hypervisors

183
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,170
and if you kept a multi-tenant
environment

184
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:51,639
there's always the noisy neighbour
problem

185
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:56,269
so someone is attacking your neighbor
and because he's firewall is sitting on

186
00:11:56,269 --> 00:11:59,060
the same physical server s your firewall

187
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,310
your firewall is affect

188
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:08,069
because he is defending himself and
using up shared resource

189
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:11,610
and there's not much you can do about
that

190
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:15,379
attacks on the hypervisor well

191
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:18,420
there have been known exploits

192
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:22,110
I E I told an awesome the security
persists

193
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,959
I A haven't heard of anyone actually

194
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:29,370
doing that in the wild so the exploits

195
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,680
that i've seen where primarily
hypothetical

196
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,899
although doable so

197
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:39,259
my sarcastic take on it is

198
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:43,430
how secure does your auditor want you to
be

199
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,060
sup I on st. if

200
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,209
you think that running inside

201
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:53,720
and outside security zone on the same
switch

202
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,230
is a bad idea then you don't want to use

203
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,750
virtual firewalls if you think

204
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,689
that running inside and outside into
movie lands on the same physical

205
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:06,250
switches

206
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:11,699
okay than you already crossed one of the
boundaries

207
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:14,829
if you think that its okay it's totally

208
00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:17,879
inappropriate to run the

209
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:21,079
inside and outside virtual machines

210
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:24,449
on the same cluster that and

211
00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:28,310
maybe you don't want to care for for
firewalls

212
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:31,699
if on the other hand if you think that
it is okay

213
00:13:31,699 --> 00:13:36,750
to run a public web server and then
inside application server

214
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,850
on the same PCR cluster

215
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,490
then you have no argument against
personal firewalls

216
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,759
because you already breached the
boundaries

217
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:51,139
K the if the pants on were you are

218
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:54,339
in the whole risk

219
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:57,519
spat you want to be

220
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:03,300
totally protected use dedicated
infrastructure for every securities I'll

221
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:09,399
you don't care that much well maybe
virtual firewalls are okay for you

222
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:12,930
the final word if you are if a national
organization or if you need PCI

223
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:16,160
compliance is with your auditor

224
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,290
whatever you persuade your auditor is OK
is okay

225
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:26,160
now for some real stuff so

226
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,550
in ideal world when you virtualize

227
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:33,649
your applications you would also fix

228
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:36,930
all the mistakes from the last 20 years

229
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:41,699
Hess anyone ever seen that happen Inc

230
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:45,550
okay what's ok self

231
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,949
your users which in this case would be a
Picatinny

232
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:52,439
teens still wants to have the same whole
thing they

233
00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:55,499
cat previously so outside

234
00:14:55,499 --> 00:14:59,339
load balancer and a firewall web server
slow bouncer in the firewall

235
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:03,350
app server about their firewall DB
servers know about fair enough I want to

236
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,160
pick a swell

237
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,850
a vindication service and so on and so
on and so on day

238
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,970
so no one wants to get away from the

239
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:16,699
exist think structure they want to have
the same functionality

240
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:20,220
only virtual and cheaper of course

241
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,089
or they don't care about for sure the
cat care about cheaper

242
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,350
sup they want to use the virtual
machines like physical host

243
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:31,970
but of course they want to deploy and
move them it will

244
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,550
within a data center between data
centers that makes perfect sense

245
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,949
a what whatever they just want to move
them

246
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:44,499
and then I see consultants throwing
business agility it's me

247
00:15:44,499 --> 00:15:47,579
and I get sick

248
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:50,939
a so they want to build virtual lands
and they want to retain the existing

249
00:15:50,939 --> 00:15:52,800
security paradigm

250
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,360
so firewalls between subnets

251
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,829
on the other hand on the hypervisor site
we need to decouple physical from

252
00:15:59,829 --> 00:16:00,379
virtual

253
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:04,370
otherwise skew can't move the VM's if
you don't the couple

254
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:08,309
and somehow you have to enable the
interview and traffic and providing for

255
00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:10,019
BM isolation

256
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:15,319
sup will this box is be physical or
virtual

257
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:19,990
in traditional data centers you
virtualized the servers

258
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:24,829
but you keep the physical load balancers
and violence

259
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:30,029
that's how we've been doing things for
the last ten years

260
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:33,670
there is now an option that you could
virtualized this metal boxes

261
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,949
guess what and

262
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:42,149
therefore architectural thinks you can
do

263
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:45,730
VM both appliances which is the same as
physical box

264
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:48,740
only in a VM form factor

265
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:52,490
or Nick level firewalls

266
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:57,850
which is actually a firewall seeking
just in front of the VM

267
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,790
I'll go through all this in detail and
then their services surfin

268
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:06,540
and service chain Inc and I'll tell you
what that

269
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,630
but let's start with easy part for tough

270
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:14,430
of course every bend their selling you
firewalls and load balancers

271
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:18,560
is telling you how they have secret
sauce insight

272
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,920
how their box is the only one that can
do whatever it is they're doing

273
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,350
because they have the secret hardware
inside

274
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:30,800
in many cases it turns out that the
secret hardware is actually

275
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,780
and Nick that can do TCP of

276
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,120
a because no one

277
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,860
is willing to invest in hardware
assisted

278
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,800
fire warning or load balancing because
hard work is expensive

279
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,139
and it turns out that you can do the
same thing since offer at reasonable

280
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,380
speeds

281
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,830
now the last company I know of why there
too a

282
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:59,140
that hats hardware assist load balancing

283
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:02,180
wasn't able to support v6 for

284
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,550
years until their latest model that is
now

285
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:12,550
on was discontinued is a five-letter
company I will not mention

286
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:17,060
mmm with his continued low that a
certain

287
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:20,330
I so most obvious things

288
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:24,170
are already software-based anyway

289
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:29,610
and some vendors are more open about
that than the others

290
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:34,340
antique really depends on whether your
sales team

291
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,910
can sell software

292
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:43,950
some benders are still selling the
hardware because that's how their sales

293
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:49,280
organization structure but they could
easy run the same thing on

294
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,690
third-party hardware K

295
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:56,620
so you calf all sorts of firewalls

296
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,750
like by at that which is now broke eight
cell now they

297
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:04,940
look honorable the front you feel the
same but now there's a big name behind

298
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,380
it

299
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,400
a f5 cast a load balancer that

300
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,600
yes p.m. appliance 810 has a load
balancer

301
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,180
that is available as the appliance
reverb at

302
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:21,950
ass a load balancer and there are all
sorts of startups

303
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:25,770
line right for example was a great start
up and they just got bought by

304
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:30,930
5 on the firewall from

305
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:34,480
I think there are a few fire will
vendors that also do

306
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,860
firewall in a VM I think checkpoints has
something

307
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:43,730
fell anyway the beauty is that of course
this will work with on that for which in

308
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,360
addition technologists

309
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,820
the hard part is the performance because

310
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,750
every packet has two arrive into the

311
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,820
hypervisor goes to the hypervisor kono

312
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,010
goes back into usable length which is

313
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:03,220
actually the corner above the washing
machine

314
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,780
is processed by the kernel the virtual
machine

315
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,440
thrown maybe into the VM usable and

316
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,570
and then all the way back and of course

317
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:18,320
thats takes quite a few CPU cycles

318
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,920
so if you really don't care about
performance and you do

319
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,220
like IP tables with fancy glee in front
of it

320
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,700
you get approximately 1 Gigabit

321
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,770
on one social CP

322
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:37,250
missus wat VMware planes for be shield
actual each

323
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:41,490
is filehost: national Bowser SVM its

324
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,570
if you're a bit smarter about what you
do and you fix the

325
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,850
DCP stepped in your VM then

326
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:53,820
810 can get to a two gig on that same
while core

327
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,730
just by removing the Linux TCP stack

328
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,440
from the picture Linux TCP stack

329
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,030
is of if you remove the Linux TCP stack
from

330
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:11,040
a VM you get to after 8 Gate Park or

331
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,770
which is more than enough for most
people

332
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:20,700
if you remove the hypervisor and the
Linux TCP step from the picture

333
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,790
you get forty to sixty geek through

334
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:28,880
a single Z on base or

335
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,010
so it usually stops around four to get
sick

336
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,980
but not because the CPU with the
overloaded but because the other

337
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,240
components of the server

338
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,750
don't cope with the load anymore

339
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,740
that you have memory contention problems
and things like that

340
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:48,730
so there were people who pushed this
much through

341
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:51,740
a single x86 box

342
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,930
and CPU was not at 100 percent

343
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:59,890
so hard were is not a problem

344
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:03,020
Linux TCP stat that every single

345
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:08,370
appliances use Inc and hypervisor stack

346
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:12,220
is a prop others the company in France

347
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,960
that does its own TCP stack for Linux

348
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,040
and that same thing is offered asking
told datapath

349
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:27,530
development UK though that the company's
actually develop this author for rental

350
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:32,020
and they told me that if they replaced

351
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:35,560
the Linux TCP stack with their own stack

352
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,190
in a VM and bound

353
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:42,690
the interfaces love that VM straight to
the hardware

354
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:48,070
so hypervisor bypass they got twenty
geek

355
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:51,420
out to that single CPU

356
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,750
K so the performance

357
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,710
will go up s people figure out how to

358
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,560
keep away his two roadblocks

359
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:07,960
are on the other hand in traditional
data center where you have firewalls and

360
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,100
load balancer sitting

361
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:13,270
at the outside and then you have the
switches and then you have the servers

362
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:17,700
you know how the traffic will flow if
you personalize things and you

363
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:23,830
allow them to move around than you think
that the traffic is flowing like this

364
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:27,800
which looks okay right but in reality

365
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,080
the traffic is going across the network
and drink

366
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:38,020
a server going now and driven our server
going out doing here and so on

367
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:42,900
so you see all of a sudden you get all
this spaghetti of traffic

368
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,390
going over the same core many network

369
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:49,510
court many times that is a real problem

370
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:52,750
in traditional data centers that we're
way

371
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:57,760
oversubscribed if you build a new data
center

372
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,100
and you know what you're doing and you
using something called class

373
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,390
architecture

374
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:09,480
which was by the way invented more to
fifty years ago for Vice which is

375
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,520
you can build the huge data center
fabric

376
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,600
with what people call equidistant and
points

377
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:23,710
so any to points in the data center have
the same bed with available between them

378
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:29,600
and once you have that you actually
don't care what if I was sick

379
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,460
because 82 and fines are equal

380
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:38,200
so you don't really care where you place
the VM with the file

381
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,200
day nice move on to a more interesting
concept which is

382
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,330
Nick firewalls so this are two firewalls
that

383
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:51,140
actually see in frown of individual

384
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:55,060
VM's so in traditional

385
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,620
virtualization environment you with have
different virtual machines in different

386
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,000
security zones

387
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,460
and they would be indifferent be lands

388
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,880
and every hypervisor cast a layer 2
switch

389
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,890
and this which with preserve bill and
separation and then you would have a

390
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:13,640
front for going out to the physical
switch

391
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,450
and my the pavilion is going to the
physical firewall

392
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:21,730
for traffic would go from Blue over
Movieland to the firewall

393
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:25,790
and them back or directly led to the Red
yep

394
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:29,210
K this is how we've been doing things
for last

395
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:34,190
fifteen years %uh now imagine that
instead of all this

396
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:37,290
you put small firewalls in front of

397
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:40,640
every virtual machine

398
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,670
so you don't need any TV land's anymore

399
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:47,620
hypothetically up because every virtual
machine

400
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:53,300
is protected with its own small tiny
firewall

401
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:57,430
and it could be either a packet filter
or a full stateful firewall

402
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:02,550
and usually these things are managed
from a central management system

403
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:06,390
so that obviously you can't manage each
one of them individually that

404
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:10,920
escape usually a custom management
console what he said that the VM

405
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,730
and then you apply the rules to the VM
or you apply the rules the whole data

406
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:18,700
center order or group or what have you

407
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,450
are this looks great rights

408
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:28,390
it dust change your perspective
completely

409
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:31,800
in the old-world that week all
understand

410
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,370
a security zone was appeal and was an IP
subnet

411
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:40,340
if you run out the view that you can
throw this new stuff in

412
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,360
up but feel things

413
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,950
in the same security zone would be in
the same subnet and that would be

414
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:50,450
in the same VLAN and by the way

415
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:54,550
this fire was would become talk points
because everything between two security

416
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,100
zones has to go through that

417
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:00,910
central box physical Russell doesn't
matter

418
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:04,670
now imagine a new brave new world

419
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:08,750
what you have one subnet

420
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,870
and a firewall in front of

421
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:15,890
every virtual machine

422
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:19,630
hypothetically this two pictures

423
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:23,570
are identical even better

424
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:29,920
here the VM is protected against other
VM's in the same subnet

425
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:35,570
which is not the case here someone broke
breaks into one

426
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:39,070
machine in the database of net usually
he can

427
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:42,220
own all the other machines in the same
subnet

428
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:47,290
because there are protected because
everyone thinks that the firewall should

429
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:52,260
so we can go from here to here

430
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:56,650
hypothetically is the same think

431
00:27:56,650 --> 00:28:00,460
the real question is psychological are
you willing to make

432
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:04,260
that shift in paradigm

433
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:08,540
are you willing to go from here to here

434
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,930
and going bet my previous remark

435
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:17,260
is your auditor willing to go with you

436
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:21,200
I don't know on the other hand if you
get here

437
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,100
then because the firewall rules are
attached to individual virtual machines

438
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,110
and they travel with the virtual
machines

439
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:30,240
as you move them across the data center
this thing

440
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:36,410
is in principle infinitely scaleable

441
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:42,160
because you just at a few CPU cycles to
every bird flu machine and you're done

442
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,500
sq scale your computer cluster

443
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:50,170
your firewall capacity automatically
expects

444
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:55,430
ent there is no more trombone Inc
through the physical or virtual firewall

445
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:59,880
traffic flows optimally from point A to
point B

446
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,110
and the performance kit is always on the

447
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:08,130
virtual NIC not on some middle box
somewhere in the middle

448
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:11,380
but going from what we know

449
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:17,870
this new thing may be scary for most
people

450
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:22,900
up now for a few solutions that are out
there in the wild

451
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:27,200
view more has something called VM safe
network API

452
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,130
which is hook that allows you to insert
whatever you wish

453
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:35,240
and front of the virtual machine

454
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:41,510
ok its actually hook in the driver for
the virtual machine Nick

455
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:45,260
and different people are using that cook
for different things usually former so

456
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:45,980
far warning

457
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:49,320
the HP has a really interesting other
Inc

458
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,740
also show later on and there too

459
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:56,130
products that you know when mission

460
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:59,160
a via work as its own firewall

461
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:03,220
and Jennifer a pass something quick is I
think out or a quiz Ishan

462
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:07,440
if I remember the names correctly under
Linux site

463
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,840
know you have the usual stuff like
because on Zen or KTM

464
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,870
you actually have access to the

465
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:20,100
kernel that runs the virtualization so
you could implement I think tables or IP

466
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,010
six tables for

467
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:26,130
EB tables down there which you cannot do
with VMware because I'm peace fear you

468
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:29,040
don't have access to that

469
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,110
part of the operating system and there
is now

470
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:36,520
a even in mainstream Linux but in that
it was available for a long time

471
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,030
open the switch which is and enhanced

472
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:44,040
bridge where OpenFlow rules so you can
program

473
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:49,070
it from the outside and the Citrix haz

474
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:54,580
Zande something manager that actually
uses OpenFlow to install packet filters

475
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,480
in front of virtual machine X

476
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,570
and the CRA's also using open this waste
as the new acquisition

477
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:08,000
by VMware and there's another startup
issue doing all sorts of places

478
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,350
a hyper-v was particularly bad at

479
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:14,640
deal hyper-v 3.0 0 and then

480
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,330
they make and amazing step forward

481
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:22,120
I mean compared to what other people are
doing

482
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,320
and compare it to what Microsoft it
going from here

483
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,920
there when I look at that it was like

484
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,060
while so

485
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:37,470
they were really bad previously and now
they have a totally

486
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:41,340
extensible switch where you can install

487
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:45,330
your own extensions for capturing for
filtering

488
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:49,070
and even for forwarding and

489
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:53,160
the whole thing is totally document it
on the web

490
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:57,210
not like VMware what you have two sy
whatever agreements with them

491
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:00,380
to get access to this API

492
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,430
everything you need to write a filtering
extension

493
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:06,830
for hyper-v is right on Microsoft
website

494
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:11,730
including sample cup you just go and do
it

495
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:15,720
and their is a company that did it so
there is already a personal firewall for

496
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,150
hyper-v

497
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:22,510
now the obvious questions you should ask
when a vendor comes around

498
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:25,570
telling you how great their product is

499
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:29,760
a if they just were faithful

500
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,120
so what happens with return traffic

501
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,440
and some people actually have true
stateful firewalls like you would expect

502
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,990
a firewall to be and some people just
say oh well

503
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:45,320
you know actually it's affected Luther
but we also install the reverse feels

504
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,040
her in the opposite direction

505
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,110
yeah dats if that

506
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:54,330
it depends on your level of risk so that
the first thing you have to

507
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:58,130
us the second one was important

508
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:01,450
are you doing filtering Inc or no or

509
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:04,960
in a VM

510
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,670
that's the performers question

511
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:11,990
our own Tennessee

512
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,380
no I don't that's on

513
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:19,100
VMware has the bee shield apt which
actually does

514
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:23,770
all the filtering in a VM

515
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:28,400
the maximum you can push through that
think is three to four get

516
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,790
per server which is OK

517
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:37,150
right maybe not be maybe is not OK for
some high volume environment like video

518
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,240
streaming

519
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,480
but for rather use case it's okay

520
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,840
juniper with its virtual gateway

521
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,490
does all the filtering in the kernel

522
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:52,480
so they can push 30 geek through that
same box

523
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,140
firewall and if you really want to know
the details

524
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:00,370
of course juniper has a nice white paper
on their website

525
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:04,870
documenting all the measurements they'd
against a certain

526
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:10,020
competitor and how their product was
better than the other

527
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:13,050
up the next question to ask do I need

528
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:18,030
8 for a hypervisor VM to control this
stuff

529
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:21,120
in view were in barmen because

530
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:25,510
love the way there API is structured you
actually need

531
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:30,820
a new extra p.m. on every hypervisor
host

532
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:34,940
to control and manage the virtual
firewalls

533
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,870
with hyper-v you don't need that with
Linux with OpenFlow controller you don't

534
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,379
need that

535
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:43,780
and of course the obvious question then
is what happens

536
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:47,850
if that p.m. fail

537
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:51,530
it depends really on where you the
filtering

538
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:55,110
so if you the filtering in coral there
who cares

539
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:59,740
if the VM fails yeah I will not be able
to download the new rules

540
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:03,230
okay but still my existing VM

541
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:07,050
are protected if you're doing the
filtering

542
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:13,880
in the VM and that VM fails what do you
think happens

543
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,180
well there are two options what
initially all the BS would be isolated

544
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,900
from the rest of the network

545
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:25,160
which is actually the proper response

546
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,940
now with the sphere 5 got some think you
can

547
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:34,370
configure whether it's fail open or fail
clubs

548
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:38,260
your choice but remember

549
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,580
if a vendor is using a VM

550
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:46,120
to implement the virtual firewalls if
that VM fails during

551
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,540
prop in trouble one way or the other

552
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:55,910
so this iz actually the structure that
dealer is using for a VM save network

553
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:56,880
API

554
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,160
you have the kernel module that

555
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,480
implement whatever functionality you
want to implement

556
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,460
and then you have the VM that fast to
run on

557
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:13,050
every host where you want this book so
far were or what have you

558
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:18,220
and those hidden the switch between the
two

559
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:22,040
that's hidden we switch is used for the
control VM

560
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,620
to program the kernel module

561
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:29,000
and because the best hidden this which
that obviously shouldn't be accessible

562
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,950
from the outside

563
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:35,050
or it would be secure because of that
hidden to switch

564
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:38,660
you have the problem of having a control
VM running

565
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:43,950
on every coaxed because the control the
end is not there

566
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:47,080
well who will X is this which

567
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,290
K and remember that

568
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:54,950
this kernel module test actually
thinking of in the switch

569
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:58,820
but it's with it sitting between the
switch

570
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:03,350
and the VM K

571
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:08,620
so the virtual switch is still doing
whatever is doing you can't control that

572
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:15,180
you can only control what gets in and
out of a particular VM

573
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:18,200
are K so as I said

574
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:22,050
be shield at is one of them but will get
with from Juniper

575
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:25,690
and while keeping a nation later on

576
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:30,280
based on where they do filtering here
were here

577
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:36,640
there's like that band time difference
in performance

578
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,430
%uh of then some other vendors came
along saying

579
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:44,590
well you know that's cool ok by the way

580
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:49,270
non up this product is has a
multi-tenant

581
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:53,080
configuration interface yet

582
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,520
so I love them assume that you have one

583
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,550
security administrator for the whole
data center

584
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:04,050
and he's configuring whatever he's
configuring

585
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:07,480
I love if I remember correctly and I'm
guessing

586
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:11,020
a Micheel zone slash at can do

587
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:14,540
iron different rules per

588
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:18,040
poor group and virtually

589
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,430
way can do different rules per VM but

590
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:25,220
check the manuals things change

591
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,280
so Cisco

592
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:32,600
did a total different think expect

593
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:36,020
but they said we don't want to cast
anything sitting

594
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:40,710
in the Coast so we want to craft
something

595
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:44,920
on the outside so like if I will hear
and well because we

596
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:50,940
owned the switchgear this has to be
Nexus 1000v Francisco not the the switch

597
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,870
from

598
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:56,690
the owner weaken over there and the
traffic

599
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:01,490
so we will have like this every
director's here in front of

600
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:06,650
VM's when the traffic comes in this
thing was sent the traffic out

601
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:12,130
to external firewall that firewall will
do whatever it does

602
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:15,440
antenna traffic back in because and
because now this is coming from the

603
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,010
firewall it goes straight to the VM

604
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:22,370
day arm

605
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:26,850
sort of makes sense or of doesn't make
sense

606
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:30,810
it really depends on what you're trying
to do

607
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:34,780
so on one hand you are suffering the
traffic back and forth for the

608
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:39,610
outside firewall so it does look like a
VM appliance

609
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:42,850
on the other hand if inserted in from of

610
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:47,100
a VM Nick so it appears as a bump in the
wire

611
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:50,520
it's not a router firewall most
appliances

612
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,830
are routers firewalls n

613
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:57,190
the they edit and expert with

614
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:01,920
when this fire was because out that the
flow is OK

615
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:08,090
it downloads the five topple sources in
nation IP address protocol port numbers

616
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:11,900
into the switching module in the kernel

617
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:18,560
and then the rest the session is not
redirected to the firewall anymore

618
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:23,040
so initial packets go to the external
firewall they are inspected

619
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,670
when the final says this is OK then

620
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:31,680
the shortcut is installed in the corner
module and the rest of the session

621
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,080
is forward it just the curtain rod so
it's not

622
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,250
as bad s it looks on this line

623
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:42,170
eight %uh on the other hand

624
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:45,430
what HP cast with tipping point the
controller is

625
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:49,660
actually as bad s it look on the
previous life

626
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:52,820
Smith so

627
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:57,950
they kept a great IDS product

628
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:02,290
soap so people tell me I I don't know
anything about security

629
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:06,000
and they wanted to repurpose

630
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,960
that great product and virtual
environments

631
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,310
so what they actually do is they use
this VM se

632
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:17,400
API to install the kernel module

633
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,030
and the sphere hosts and this kernel
module review as the traffic

634
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:25,530
apps sorry to the

635
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:30,730
external I D S IPS and them back to the
PM

636
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:34,360
so they're selling point is that you
know it's usually hard

637
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,630
in box lies environment to figure out
where the traffic is flowing

638
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:41,390
and to ensure data traffic flows by de-
IPS IDS

639
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:45,170
s it should but with this with or plugin
you can

640
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:48,300
ensure that the fact it does go

641
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,800
by the required ipsi yes

642
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,320
are which in some environments properly
make sense

643
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:01,220
the only in double quotes problem is
that

644
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:08,220
this things this external boxes aren't
exactly known for worry high speeds

645
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:14,330
the Cayenne the box that i've seen wash
tank

646
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:19,660
for the hole at the center maybe not
enough

647
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:24,280
a and they tend to be expensive

648
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,630
so in some way special environments were
you

649
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:30,720
actually have to inspect all the traffic
going

650
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:36,010
in and out of a VM this might be an
option

651
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:40,560
in more regular mainstream environments

652
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,100
you maybe don't need that level of
inspection

653
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:49,390
but your auditor is the one to say yes
or no

654
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:52,880
%uh and this is actually how the the
structure

655
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:58,430
of Social Security Gateway which is the
Cisco's

656
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:03,350
product name for this think so you have
to have the Nexus 1000v

657
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:07,280
in the the sphere host without that it
doesn't work

658
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,280
because they're using their own service
insertion technology

659
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,550
by the way they think redirecting the
traffic from the hypervisor to some

660
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:16,369
external thing

661
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:20,430
and back is called service insertion

662
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:24,140
K it's a fancy marketing name Fort

663
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:27,900
election

664
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:31,680
so you have the switching element here
and then you need to control playing the

665
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,860
VSM

666
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:38,000
that actually controls this which and
then you need the firewall is that will

667
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,380
receive the traffic and say this is OK

668
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:44,850
Ortiz is not OK the beauty

669
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:48,200
of this architecture is that on every

670
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,540
single for the group

671
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:55,090
which if like the the lawn if you wish

672
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:58,369
not exactly be land but you know what I
mean so on

673
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:03,090
every single port group or even on every
single port

674
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:06,730
which would be VM Nick you could specify

675
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:10,710
who the firewall is

676
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:14,090
so you could have one firewall for this
Sat

677
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:17,780
of VM's and a different firewall for

678
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:22,020
another set of VM's and even if the two
sets

679
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:25,170
of VM's use the same firewall

680
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:29,400
you can always attachment extra
attributes without the firewall which

681
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,720
context to use for this particular VM

682
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,240
so you can deploy this in two scenarios
either

683
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:41,660
you cap one V is cheaper tenant

684
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:45,400
so every single-tenant with half his own
firewall

685
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,580
and he can do whatever he wishes with
his firewall

686
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:52,720
breaking it miss configuring it whatever
this

687
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,140
or you have one context for 10

688
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:59,369
and then you will have different sets of
rules for different

689
00:44:59,369 --> 00:45:03,750
dance or different security zones or
what have you

690
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:07,200
so from the flexibility perspectif this

691
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,260
gives you way more options that and

692
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:14,940
the things I've been showing on the
previous lights

693
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:19,820
but of course it comes with an extra
performance kit because you have to go

694
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:23,090
out and back

695
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:27,119
and then Cisco came out with

696
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:31,030
a firewall appliance

697
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:35,080
the ASA in VM form factor

698
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,740
and before that they don't know that
they have a problem

699
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:42,420
because now you can have the

700
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:45,430
layer 3 firewall and

701
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:49,010
you have the Nick level firewall

702
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:52,320
and if you use the traditional approach

703
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:56,860
like Nick level firewall is implemented
in the hypervisor

704
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:00,390
and if external firewall is into making
a VM

705
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:05,150
you don't have a problem but if you
using service insertion like Cisco is

706
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:06,600
using

707
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:10,020
then you do have a problem because

708
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,020
imagine that the traffic comes from the
outside

709
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:17,740
it has to go to the external the route
its firewall first

710
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:21,000
K are you already see what's going on

711
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,810
a so it has to go to the router's
firewall because we are in different

712
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:25,530
subnets

713
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:29,520
things have to go through that final and
then

714
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:34,860
it goes to this nation IP address based
on the destination necklace

715
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:40,160
a not so fast there's a interceptor here

716
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,340
that says the traffic 2d bomb

717
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:48,119
in the wire firewall and then the bump
in the water firewall

718
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:51,400
looks traficant s what its okay yes it
can pass

719
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,470
and send it back to the Viet

720
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:58,150
so the traffic is actually traversing
the data center

721
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:02,240
one time too many K

722
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,540
and what Cisco did was that

723
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:09,210
a they actually in in there be passed
technology

724
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:12,960
they have something called service
changing

725
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,300
so when think sly Nexus 1000v

726
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,649
and

727
00:47:17,649 --> 00:47:21,639
BSG and basa figure out that

728
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:25,299
actually where senate traveling back and
forth unnecessarily

729
00:47:25,299 --> 00:47:28,939
Vasa would get the shortcut saying

730
00:47:28,939 --> 00:47:34,349
hate don't go to the hypervisor because
the think has to go through BSG anyway

731
00:47:34,349 --> 00:47:37,749
K so

732
00:47:37,749 --> 00:47:41,279
because all the three components are
from the same vendor

733
00:47:41,279 --> 00:47:46,059
because there is no standard protocol to
do it %uh

734
00:47:46,059 --> 00:47:50,630
they can install the short cut here for
a traffic goes through BSG first and

735
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:50,999
then

736
00:47:50,999 --> 00:47:54,579
arrives to the hypervisor and it has
that

737
00:47:54,579 --> 00:47:57,989
extra had they're saying this came from
VSG so it's okay

738
00:47:57,989 --> 00:48:03,009
and so it goes to VM a

739
00:48:03,009 --> 00:48:06,569
as far as I understand and I may be
wrong

740
00:48:06,569 --> 00:48:10,179
a you can combine ASA 1000v

741
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:13,219
South firewall which is the official
name for ASA

742
00:48:13,219 --> 00:48:16,369
nvm for a factor with VSG

743
00:48:16,369 --> 00:48:19,380
I obviously there are

744
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:23,519
other thinks you make be able to do
today I don't know

745
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:28,319
but you would definitely be able to do
in the future like combining this to you

746
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:33,539
way it the when accelerated product they
have

747
00:48:33,539 --> 00:48:36,929
Wes in appliance and

748
00:48:36,929 --> 00:48:40,909
West is also a bomb in the wire so

749
00:48:40,909 --> 00:48:44,519
it this technically possible to change
all three together

750
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:48,109
so the traffic goes through the

751
00:48:48,109 --> 00:48:51,449
router firewall and down through the

752
00:48:51,449 --> 00:48:54,889
a when accelerator and then through the

753
00:48:54,889 --> 00:48:58,619
bomb in the wire Nick firewall and then
arrives to the VM

754
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:05,619
so thats a potential option okay

755
00:49:05,969 --> 00:49:10,369
and now for some quick conclusions VM
appliances

756
00:49:10,369 --> 00:49:16,049
are for more s all purposes identical to
physical devices usually they also have

757
00:49:16,049 --> 00:49:17,079
the same feature set

758
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:22,579
apart from a certain five-letter company
that I happen to be mentioning on the

759
00:49:22,579 --> 00:49:23,349
previous life

760
00:49:23,349 --> 00:49:26,959
a which had ipv6 support

761
00:49:26,959 --> 00:49:33,549
in their physical firewall for a decade
and still doesn't care ipv6 support

762
00:49:33,549 --> 00:49:37,469
in their virtual because no one is using

763
00:49:37,469 --> 00:49:41,969
ipv6 in the dataset I fell

764
00:49:41,969 --> 00:49:45,899
p.m. appliances are almost equivalent

765
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:49,729
in most cases the physical devices if
you are concerned

766
00:49:49,729 --> 00:49:53,239
about security and nyse: attendance and
so on

767
00:49:53,239 --> 00:49:57,679
maybe s and interim step you could
create

768
00:49:57,679 --> 00:50:02,029
a separate cluster of servers and deploy

769
00:50:02,029 --> 00:50:07,409
only firewall appliances and then you
would get something that would be

770
00:50:07,409 --> 00:50:10,679
almost identical to virtual contexts

771
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:13,849
on the physical firewalls not

772
00:50:13,849 --> 00:50:19,169
exactly identical but as close as you
can get and all these things

773
00:50:19,169 --> 00:50:22,569
obviously generate extra traffic across
the data center

774
00:50:22,569 --> 00:50:26,130
what marketing people caught east-west
traffic because

775
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:30,229
it's moving this way not that way and

776
00:50:30,229 --> 00:50:33,559
a if that's the case then

777
00:50:33,559 --> 00:50:38,119
its best if you cast the data center
fabric that is not

778
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:42,269
to over sprite a new account

779
00:50:42,269 --> 00:50:45,649
Nick level firewalls they do give

780
00:50:45,649 --> 00:50:49,649
lenora performance so SU add more VM's

781
00:50:49,649 --> 00:50:55,689
each VM is has the firewall attacks and
if I was just getting a few CPU cycles

782
00:50:55,689 --> 00:51:00,329
well a few is like 10 percent so it's
not like

783
00:51:00,329 --> 00:51:03,669
but it depends on your workflow so

784
00:51:03,669 --> 00:51:07,759
the more CPU intensive the workload is
the less the fire was using

785
00:51:07,759 --> 00:51:11,459
the more I'll intensive the workload is
the more CPU cycles

786
00:51:11,459 --> 00:51:15,059
I was using this up but you have to be
ready

787
00:51:15,059 --> 00:51:19,909
to go from the old world to the new
world and services there's an chain Inc

788
00:51:19,909 --> 00:51:23,579
I really like Cisco's architecture
because

789
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:27,969
of its flexibility it allows me to
deploy

790
00:51:27,969 --> 00:51:30,979
either centralized firewalls or

791
00:51:30,979 --> 00:51:34,549
fire what brought the cation or
multi-tenant environment

792
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:39,009
but on the other hand their is some
performance trade-off

793
00:51:39,009 --> 00:51:44,139
okay and this is just for those of you
that

794
00:51:44,139 --> 00:51:48,519
will this is longleaf blocks and podcast
that you should really read

795
00:51:48,519 --> 00:51:52,569
if you're interested in this topic and
this is for reference purposes when you

796
00:51:52,569 --> 00:51:54,799
read

797
00:51:54,799 --> 00:51:58,259
and while some people will write this
down

798
00:51:58,259 --> 00:52:02,249
if you can read it I

799
00:52:02,249 --> 00:52:09,249
a I'm here for any questions you might
have

800
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:18,060
yeah burned and Lisa

801
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:22,780
so but I hit

802
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:29,750
watch area KS maybe one

803
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:33,220
this year I'm move statement

804
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:40,220
cuba the same J are I

805
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:44,810
12 Geithner though

806
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:49,410
said who go to these new to a reason
because they

807
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:52,890
while keep says said what they want

808
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:56,349
there teams that were a

809
00:52:56,349 --> 00:53:00,560
soon as 0 I

810
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,940
goddess they the that

811
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:08,910
16 you well probably as bad as yours

812
00:53:08,910 --> 00:53:13,109
now a honestly

813
00:53:13,109 --> 00:53:16,210
we pushed this old

814
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:20,020
organization in silos to and x3

815
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:23,150
and its

816
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:26,470
clerking us more and more s we go toward

817
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:33,470
this thanks on thinks

818
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:36,880
usually you work only if

819
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,980
different themes managed to start

820
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:43,810
talking to each other and eventually
March

821
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:50,810
a if you can do that then it's best to
stay with physical fire wasn't physical

822
00:53:50,839 --> 00:53:51,430
servers

823
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:55,750
iron the

824
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:59,750
usual problem

825
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:02,869
and if on layers a and above

826
00:54:02,869 --> 00:54:06,830
and the problem is

827
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:10,440
s you probably what I I'm sure we all
know is

828
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:14,470
that everyone is trying to shift s much
responsibility

829
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:18,540
away from him as possible so

830
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:21,550
in and i do. were all you know

831
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:25,570
the application teams would be
responsible for their own security

832
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:28,780
and the security team would be there

833
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:33,619
only to check for compliance and in that
world

834
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:38,859
we wouldn't be having this discussion
okay

835
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:44,570
ion the

836
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:49,570
move from physical to virtual firewall

837
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:53,050
particular case I am

838
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:56,990
Mike work in the two teams

839
00:54:56,990 --> 00:55:00,480
actually sit down and

840
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,460
a on figure out who will be doing what

841
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:07,730
and a

842
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:12,599
from the psychological standpoint

843
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:15,780
if that's a situation you're facing

844
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:20,540
maybe Cisco's a Nexus 1000v

845
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:24,470
glasby is GE might be good political
option

846
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:27,790
because it is

847
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:31,330
so similar and concept

848
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:34,349
and the split of responsibilities

849
00:55:34,349 --> 00:55:38,349
and operations ass what they had before

850
00:55:38,349 --> 00:55:41,780
I'm not saying

851
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:46,530
it's the best technical attorney if I'm
just saying that

852
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:51,490
its the closest to what this people were
you still

853
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:58,490
goes up because with Nexus 1000v you
have a clit its identical to the

854
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:00,980
physical Nexus switches

855
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:05,339
and with the is GE you have some sort of
see a lie that

856
00:56:05,339 --> 00:56:09,180
remind some people of how all firewalls
were configured

857
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:14,880
either he said totally different product
and you rethink that split

858
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,849
of responsibilities %uh

859
00:56:18,849 --> 00:56:23,830
it is possible to do something similar

860
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:27,730
where it let's see the shield at

861
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:32,619
and I think definitely we ate voshel
gateway from Juniper

862
00:56:32,619 --> 00:56:35,910
a but it is

863
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:40,750
within it has to be done with user roles
within the same framework

864
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:44,780
yeah

865
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:48,140
and did their if the teams don't talk to
each other

866
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:53,480
you have a problem anyway but as I said

867
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:57,270
India deal were ok the networking server

868
00:56:57,270 --> 00:57:01,300
and virtualization teens and security
team would get together

869
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:05,010
and push all the responsibility have to
where it belongs to the application

870
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:05,260
things
