33
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:06,539
in english these HTTP call on

34
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:09,569
a slacker slacker because I'm going to
talk about

35
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:13,300
how to use and ipv6 seem in

36
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,200
on the Internet the hock II Windows

37
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,990
and Windows network across everybody is

38
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:24,200
a is using ipv6 it today

39
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,280
probably most of the people think that
they are not

40
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,600
you seen ip65 in five ipv6

41
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,799
is sacked by it I'm running in all
Windows machines

42
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,990
scenes windows-based that you go to
their head

43
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,220
and network properties you can realized
that

44
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,380
ipv6 East its an activator

45
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:48,260
you know is is in a Spanish brother call
I think I might my father bought

46
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,390
based on sis on the population is is one
that you can see on their on the right

47
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:53,900
time

48
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,440
wheat CSA of thing ok might be

49
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,590
I V I ipv6 address on Ave

50
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,380
out might be DNS and services that the
point of the racism

51
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:10,330
I'm broadly in most of the companies in
most of the network now what he's

52
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,470
creating an espresso coffee or a sample
or for ipv6 they are

53
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,880
in companies they are high DHCP

54
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,590
best house seeks to rely ipv6 artist who

55
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,800
to all networks while computers in the
network but

56
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,270
in fact ipv6 is running you don't know
something very dangerous like I

57
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:35,630
I BB IP coffee in your Windows machine
you can realize that you have

58
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:39,720
they'll know Carling ipv6 honest these
wanna

59
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,120
the FB AP column call on

60
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,500
is there la calling for ipv6 on

61
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,230
it is working on the most important
thing is that

62
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,730
in the opening I mean in the network's
second week though

63
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,470
using a router is day it has the
priority

64
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,450
so you are you all to you want to
connect to a computer

65
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,110
in the same networks segment they are
going to use

66
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,760
ipv6 by the fall because is a

67
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,670
is there priority brother all saw

68
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,220
you though and I wrote breeds ER

69
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,819
in your Windows balls are you are going
to who

70
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:24,190
to watch they ipv6 a rope in paper or

71
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,320
in which you can see the full
cooperation with sees

72
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,330
baseball connect to their local
languages

73
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,550
a column on alanis last 120 a

74
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,550
then de la calling for ipv6

75
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,160
I'm then the fair one is that a is they

76
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,220
on computer at lockout ipv6

77
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,169
others in the lookout compute that I V
6's

78
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:52,590
is working I need to know something and
something but it's important you can

79
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,320
realize

80
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,090
been forgotten so his brother Gordon all
Windows machine

81
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:01,150
index a sample we are going and We R Who
We something like I

82
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,800
being 2 I'm I think before and a

83
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,730
obvious a different see we are using the
enemy knows me

84
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:13,860
to think they Haas name index a somewhat
because menus share

85
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,010
in the same concentration in the same
machine

86
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,480
we feel billion anything in more weekend
though

87
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,690
being celebrate on that we are going to
octane is not

88
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,240
a Windows machine is going to break
bread the ipv6 network a

89
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,940
I BBC's brother called instead of the
ipv4

90
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:37,490
Brotherhood this is very important
because masakela security my

91
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,690
security tool security and missionaries

92
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,240
that and I see something I've created in
their network

93
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,820
out basis I racy sunday baby I got

94
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,350
only ipv4 is configuring the network and
is not true I P six is

95
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,430
also go feeling in the network

96
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,620
day they might behind these

97
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,940
yes im where the mall is they not only
my dear brother

98
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:06,210
all this because is include non-windows
and machines

99
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:10,190
scenes Windows be stopped I mean with at
least by 10 7 I'm we know say

100
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,820
and maybe I'll be spoke only stock
before connecting

101
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,720
to any computer on the network with this
protocol

102
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,919
day that Brian is going to try the fine

103
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:25,220
all obvious is relate to their
destination computer

104
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,729
so index a sample and you can see how
the lac Carling

105
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:32,960
market for all is trying to connect to

106
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,199
it's fine to the spot where their
centigrade

107
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:40,120
mushing you seen ipv6

108
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,139
on ipv4 network connecting and

109
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:46,900
requesting the information to the
broadcast requested information on

110
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,660
to their DNS you seen I BBC East and
ways

111
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,860
you seen a ipv4 ways and so on in the
end lol

112
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,030
look on the monitor from Google is going
to who

113
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:01,910
of Fame on ways to connect with the best
in ACM

114
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,870
and if in the end is possible to connect
with us every

115
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:09,759
using IP seeks then the computer

116
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,060
I can be theirs are going to use ipv6
who

117
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,310
connect each all that not men's

118
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,169
dot I'm although and on security tools

119
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:23,169
related to I before attacks

120
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:28,660
I'm not ready to there to react to this
comment the ipv6 attacks

baseball which is

132
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:12,050
more or less the same but race it on a
blueprint for

133
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,680
protocol I don't concede we go if we
used a

134
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,250
next Sat interface ipv6 so neighbours

135

140
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:43,759

we thought okay I got this ipv6 others

156
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:39,459
on this is my Mike lattice so

157
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:42,920
I in this area has been such a plan see
how it works

158
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,569
in out there in a very simple way I
don't see we had

159
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:49,769
requesting Braun the site PCs others

160
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:53,410
2001 column column 1 column 1

161
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,709
and a and yes and in that way to

162
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:59,860
and broadcast the more we got what got
us

163
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,899
and bit wary East requesting they might

164
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:06,800
address of the IP address 2001

165
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,489
column column 1 call to so in the end

166
00:10:10,489 --> 00:10:13,850
the computer we die I BBC I S

167
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,079
index as a whole 2001 column column 1
column console

168
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,029
is going to respond do there and

169
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:25,239
to the computer who washed set to import
these my

170
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:29,730

242
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:12,029
now well let's look at the mo

243
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:15,449
well as you can see it in this a

244
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:20,119
in this AM in this says 7i got and I
think the format war and of course the

245
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,189
local lean

246
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:24,899
up in they ipv6 network it go we go to
the

247
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:29,040
other machine we got more or less the
same

248
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,499
there were 192 478 see all 2

249
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:35,629
it with Noel being minnows

250
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:38,709
a 100 9 who are hard to say

251
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:44,089
digs a seal three

252
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:48,559
let's do that it being

253
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:55,520
come on

254
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,810
yeah i buy a vowel happened

255
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:04,960
who it doesn't make sense I saw a cause

256
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:10,589
1912 and went to it doesn't mean it's

257
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:14,620
I'm I need to activate if

258
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:21,620
okay

259
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:24,870
up what they have to implement to I

260
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:28,120
before I V you can see why we got the
connection a

261
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,260
sup if we know if being a game with

262
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,019
minnows a modifier

263
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:40,880
weekend rate that the hot name

264
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,860
is settlements in with dole's being
separate then

265
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:50,019
we can see how they they connection in
the lockout segment is using ipv6

266
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:53,360
and bro saw in be some by tomorrow

267
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,640
environment I'm going to open the people
who are which is running in their

268
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,940
in me at my house machine in my

269
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:06,030
press on russian on I hey we got on a
scan and this is kinda is trying to

270
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:09,620
retrieve all ipv4 addresses on all ipv6
other says

271
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,939
Ryan to those canisters at 3x I a

272
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:16,040
figure out wats ipv6 other s

273
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,670
is configuring the local leading and

274
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,990
in the local Indian area ipv6 protocol

275
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:28,300
because a in most of the cases that
defense from the Mac other message so in

276
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,010
the end

277
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:33,350
it will focus recognizing the network
sign this and buy a home with that I

278
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,470
look of a

279
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,669
attacks on the press one is the neighbor
advertisement poppin

280
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:42,240
which is quite same what we only need to
select their 70's

281
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,260
their wine ending in 72

282
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,760
on their Big Ten

283
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,650
or the window share and machine which is
the one antonin

284
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,960
7 eight seats saw bizarre

285
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,950
we are going into we gonna start I'm
evil for guys

286
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:04,330
send in that talkback its packages net
and needed to

287
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:08,240
do the man in the mirror so in this
environment I'm going to do

288
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,660
something very simple online to open and

289
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,320
white shark and gas

290
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,490
go Tuesday well I am

291
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,640
I'm gonna act slow I site for their

292
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,590
let's see if it is working okay and we
got

293
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:30,750
in the south all that are I like the XT
fine with CS

294
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,780
might work txt I'm with with the

295
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,590
share pics missed racing ball but

296
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:41,510
if we go to there why sad

297
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:47,710
outweighs sense for armond pay

298
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,919
I'll

299
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:57,919
I happen to you something went wrong

300
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:04,820
with these the car big us

301
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,169
no no no no no because this using the
ipv4

302
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:11,669
network instead of the ipv6 while

303
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:15,250
something went higher when we're on with
their

304
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:19,010
with a I with us address I need to
report

305
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:23,100
day the machine because something is
working hard we

306
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,620
work in fact we pay ipv6 brother all

307
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:30,320
because right now and is your scene and

308
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,520
ipv4 is that ok ipv6 I need doesn't make
sense so

309
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,059
I'm going to to the next the more and
then I'm going to finish this one

310
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:41,780
which is there the simple one cell let's

311
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,110
stop let's though

312
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:49,500
evoke what r merits recalls

313
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:55,140
this machine sorry for it I let some
piano with animal something where

314
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,679
but with this machine I do not see what

315
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:02,770
we don't need is machine for the second
im also

316
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:06,380
let's go through their slights I let's
do

317
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:13,380
the other the mall so

318
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,660
why the press the press the moist is
very well known as gracie is basic to

319
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,120
love the only thing that you need

320
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,160
is that and bought machines are welcome
pete Burns

321
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,530
with I think 26 I might be for us who
can see with the local eating

322
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:35,370
ipv6 artist but this thing on Sat this
economy moist air release them almost a

323
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:40,440
is the most important because is that
the main topic what the stock

324
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,470
they doin ipv6 a brother call

325
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:48,530
is that's and based on a special
protocol which is

326
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:52,070
slack that this if that means stainless

327
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:55,409
out is how that would be ratio that
follows rotors

328
00:20:55,409 --> 00:21:00,230
will send default gateway to on a
computer in the network segment

329
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:03,909
the idea is that there are two any
messages which is

330
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:07,210
which are wrote this observation and
broken advertisement

331
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,960
on with these two messages II computer

332
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,590
can request and for our default gateway

333
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:19,470
when it it is connected to our network
said it is not

334
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:23,040
every computer that connects through our
network

335
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,280
request for the default gateway send the
nonprofit association on

336
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,350
Mazzetti their own lives I'm going to
send

337
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:33,909
their response which is the router
advertisement

338
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:38,530
the idea of the road in about five min
is that is not necessary

339
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,590
stop raise the the computer send

340
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:45,340
sense I wrote this solicitation so every
rotor

341
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:50,210
connected to the network can send broker
advertisement while computers

342
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:54,909
I'm all computers are going to create a
new ipv6

343
00:21:54,909 --> 00:21:58,679
a address that connects the default
gateway

344
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:03,440
I'm not going to go fieger their own to
send in their opener advertisement

345
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,620
package

346
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:09,050
ask before gateway this is very
important because

347
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:13,340
every computer attacks sent this rolled
out of bed frame men

348
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:17,710
is 92 to me bread acerola edsall

349
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:23,570
in in in wanna right on man live before
we know stem rushing don't be racism

350
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:26,790
all machines are waiting for rockers and
Rutgers

351
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:29,840
out of course mining me though a

352
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,110
mind the Italian ski ski mask saw the
most important thing is not

353
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:38,210
we final 15 minutes is possible to
compete at all I BBC

354
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:41,890
protocol because by the fall all Windows
machines

355
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:45,150
iraq won't be seen their DNS how the
story

356
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:49,250
brother all bien ESO the discovery
protocol United States

357
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:53,050
and say that every bump you there

358
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:57,150
Eve know all that the NAS is configuring
the machine

359
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:00,179
is going to use these three ipv6

360
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:03,470
operators asked that before the NS saw

361
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:07,809
in the right moment that we send honest
like five minutes till one computer and

362
00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:08,980
that computers

363
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:13,480
comfy breasted what gateway then we got
VIP says

364
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,840
a computer box we thought the NS

365
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:21,179
I at that moment did the initial
discovery will be

366
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:25,070
I'm driving this a in an environment in
which

367
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,399
we want to do I'm on in the middle
attack to

368
00:23:28,399 --> 00:23:32,830
any computer on the network who is going
to browse the internet

369
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:36,050
we don't need to though anything more
because by default

370
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:39,899
on web browsers article fieger to use
the

371
00:23:39,899 --> 00:23:43,179
ipv6 protocol when all when

372
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:46,669
a hot name is request that this is the
part of the way some poor

373
00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:50,640
more Muzio fire plus on it you can see
how

374
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,850
is in a right before I i the fall is
from Peter

375
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,919
follows their networks BNs the same ol
ipv6

376
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,480
that means not quite the phone is going
to use the ipv6

377
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,270
a broke in when does that is so I

378
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:08,559
honest friend UK ER because you got time
I

379
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,270
before struggle I'm done ipv6 protocol

380
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:16,050
air friendly gonna be good I mean we've
default gateway

381
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:20,990
in the i think is Steve ipv4 protocol
and default gateway in the ipv6 protocol

382
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:24,309
and you got the NS go on feat Lori in
there I

383
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:27,679
before protocol I'm a new VNS

384
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,720
configuring the ipv6 protocol when those

385
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,230
is going to use by the fall the DNS
goofy grin the ipv4 protocol

386
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:40,169
that means not is suppose not

387
00:24:40,169 --> 00:24:45,429
the NS is on wanna sell it doesn't Matta
you gonna be good to the DNA issues in

388
00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:46,679
the ipv4 protocol

389
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:50,610
or VIP is six protocol in Windows

390
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:55,610
by the fall if you got the ipv4 protocol
and ipv6 protocol fieger

391
00:24:55,610 --> 00:25:00,110
we know she's going to use that he and
his air base in for

392
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:03,399
if we got a Windows machine week ipv6
are legal

393
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:08,970
fieger then the computer is going to use
that yet the DNS cool feature in the

394
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:11,980
a in the ipv6 protocol but

395
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:15,030
120 psi want to be and

396
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:18,130
request p.m. %uh night records

397
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:21,760
it doesn't make sense %uh I've got about
that's the way you

398
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,330
in which we know she's working win it
all the discovery

399
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:30,760
wine Windows is doing this but your
invite Windows is going up to

400
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:35,060
I'm based on a special gazing weights if
you have ipv6

401
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,230
and practical a night before brother
Paul

402
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:41,409
and configure on with a lot of being I
mean

403
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:45,520
planes that when you configure you
connect to a WiFi network

404
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,950
and the DHCP doesn't need to you on

405
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:52,040
I V VIII for BC I think before I arrest

406
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:56,510
then in that case the configuration
which is going to be ulysses

407
00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:00,460
the ipv6 on are quite nice I'm going to
be

408
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,780
sent in for ipv6 records

409
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,909
that means not want to go I'm on the
mewling

410
00:26:06,909 --> 00:26:10,600
in that environment when it goes
something similar to these

411
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:15,090
index a somewhat less important that we
wanted to go I'm on the miller Tabak

412
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:18,280
do I compute to one compute their that
connects

413
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,590
to a is its personnel

414
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:26,540
banking website so index a sample letter
to paul got the banking website

415
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:30,040
is not comfy chair with an ipv6 a wreck
or

416
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:34,179
let's suppose not there if our role that
Islam

417
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:37,340
got the next day computer to the
Internet

418
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:40,510
is not to party in ipv6 Apple

419
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:44,050
in not to buy it online we can go
something and

420
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:49,320
something I also asked to create a 96
network between

421
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,550
there be thinkin and get active a night
before

422
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:55,600
connection between the attack and on the
Internet

423
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,320
so index a sample we these when this
computer connect to internet request the

424
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,649
No

425
00:27:00,649 --> 00:27:04,310
now without you my personal bank inside
Dakar

426
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:08,230
we are going to retrieve day wall ace

427
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:14,050
rare waited rate for in this fall when
we are going to use their DNS six before

428
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:19,300
service to connect to the all-region out
the NS on the Internet requesting

429
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,330
for a night before rate what 34

430
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:25,440
in that environment we are going to
retrieve the I before

431
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,100
others that our centerpiece is going to
gonna read

432
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,300
in math on ipv6 the for

433
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:36,350
ipv6 obvious that means not for the big
day in

434
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:39,669
their destination website is in on

435
00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:42,740
ipv6 a at least Alan

436
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:46,360
they have been is going to use the fall
guy great way

437
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,700
in the ipv6 network to connect to the
back

438
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:53,970
I'm in not following in the air we are
going to retreat

439
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:57,370
day yet HTTP and a

440
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:01,580
request in over the ipv6 men were on
Home Brands

441
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,800
that ipv6 and request

442
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,260
who are one I think or request saw

443
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,950
I rise

444
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:16,440
break I'm is very simple I'm SL

445
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,300
we're going to retreat it's the male
rates on where we allow for traffic jam

446
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,790
up because as a Java update window

447
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:28,230
I job I'm yeah it's not where I thought
you'd for

448
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:32,110
I I'll

449
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,950

I'll get I'll your remote

453
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:53,629
now there was a nice decision in the
keynote about 20 but JavaBeans

454
00:28:53,629 --> 00:28:58,220
yeah I'd like to I yet another a
survivability announcement so it's

455
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:02,679
with two was just 52 the keynote

456
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:08,780
saw on DDR or wait until yep least Corp

457
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:12,090

we are going to do we with a local bar
with you are we are going to compete

460
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:19,870
there

461
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:24,840
the ipv6 connection on I'm evil fucker
is going to the whole day

462
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,730
network others foundation on six before
I'm also they VNS

463
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:32,090
6245 Lacey on in this environment

464
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:36,460
enough money to me than scheme up and we
need to

465
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,810
deal with the HTTPS on XM and they are

466
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:43,280
to different approach not week I use

467
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,490
press one is the the SSL St

468
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:50,280
up girls in this in this approach may be
a is not

469
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,560
we are going to remove all all s from
the

470
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,110
HTTPS links when we aren't sending day

471
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:01,250
the bridges to their to the the second
approach is

472
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:04,820
Daz cool US happy ASCA to create

473
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:09,169
dynamically on real-time rate CA still
there

474
00:30:09,169 --> 00:30:14,120
to the peak the baby I is in on the
cigar scheme I is that the meeting

475
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:18,960
is going to read refinance and I'm then
is necessary to peacock

476
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,330
okay I compete are I confine in these

477
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:25,899
I is the outside the gate so far

478
00:30:25,899 --> 00:30:29,570
Evil four guys doing only as a senate 3
saw

479
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:33,040
let's see how it works in I'm

480
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,159
the same by and I want to share

481
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,510
my best up

482
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:44,110
and let's do the mall and I'm going to

483
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:47,190
US stock the window say for

484
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:50,780
later bats right now

485
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:55,540
I'm going to use on TV's reno's

486
00:30:55,540 --> 00:31:00,810
step sup

487
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:04,360
are press the whole I'm going to
computer

488
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,450
ipv4 in the law governing

489
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:11,990
let's suppose that we got their 169

490
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:15,419
sOooo 5 for 3

491
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:19,030
233 points or ID I the

492
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:22,899
before either less the same want to be
in a

493
00:31:22,899 --> 00:31:29,040
everything unless in a book why this is
their normal configuration

494
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:33,980
I'm when you try to connect to allow
WiFi network or whatever I

495
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:38,030
you cannot connect to the a you cannot
connect to the the HCV

496
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:41,440
yeah said a prayer then you got their
locally

497
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,909
ipv4 and ID's how many are you have
happened

498
00:31:45,909 --> 00:31:49,159
these any time in the past

499
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:53,940
I mean funny look on the night before we
without the HEB

500
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:58,409
yep everyone saw I guess environment

501
00:31:58,409 --> 00:32:01,530
I in this environment

502
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:05,460
we are going to though something
medicine ball

503
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,470
suffers the fall

504
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:12,139
I'm going to use you also I

505
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:15,309

I'm going to use the slacker back

507
00:32:19,169 --> 00:32:22,409

508
00:32:22,409 --> 00:32:25,460
they beat then which is is why I'm on

509
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:28,970
last send it back its update

510
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:32,879
this is BOM we gots

511
00:32:32,879 --> 00:32:36,830
I you can see a new ipv6 others which is

512
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:41,590
which have been created by hit by a
computer by the big thing

513
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:45,070
to connect to their default gateway
which is the evil

514
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:48,530
Olga so in this environment

515
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:52,159
we got we got right now ipv6

516
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,370
other s I'm also the point gateway on

517
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:59,379
if we go and ivory comfy as last all

518
00:32:59,379 --> 00:33:02,520
we got also here in the DNS server

519
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,840
did the NSL be rationing sadness

520
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,440
you can see is there they are and ECC
you know

521
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,570
call our co-pilot CEO paula F

522
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:17,010
are up call our while still I'm week

523
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:20,190
top bizarre if we go who

524
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:23,230
to my local machine

525
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:26,649
and we do something very complicated
that

526
00:33:26,649 --> 00:33:30,679
lie being

527
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:33,879
through grass dubbed a

528
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:40,690
we got the night before obviously we got
back to

529
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:44,330
were do that the NSI we got beat at

530
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:49,139
I am or A's requests

531
00:33:49,139 --> 00:33:52,399
for I was eww through grass

532
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,550
not be we got no I'm sad because

533
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:58,800
through various not be easily working in
I believe

534
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,940
ipv4 cell in this environment

535
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:07,159
if we go and though something like being

536
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:11,820
through grass not be

537
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:15,629
through best not be it is we averaged
three min

538
00:34:15,629 --> 00:34:18,639
we r recycle bin and ipv6 others

539
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,970
this is because the evil Hawkeyes going
back in the ipv4

540
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:27,030
others to an IP b6 honest saw

541
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:30,169
bizarre we only need to go

542
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:34,530
cool Firefox and I you can see we can
browse the internet

543
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,990
we got we got no

544
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:42,060
ipv4 connection at all we got we got the
locally in

545
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:45,099

00:34:56,889 --> 00:35:00,790
and everything is is walking on
everything is I'm ready

550
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:04,240

the ipv6 network ir on Moss

728
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:02,750
and infinite but the problem is that

729
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:06,500
the memory of your Windows machine is
speedy so

730

that Windows machine right now there is
no solution to the east and if they only

733
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:19,200

security attacks

744
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:04,950
I'm not working on the same way in the
ipv6 protocol so you need to

745
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:08,270
think twice about the security of your
network if you have

746
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:11,990
ipv6 a on it is not use it to read more

747
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:15,820
and ipv6 it because out there and what
time these

748
