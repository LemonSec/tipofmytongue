1
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:07,510
so welcome everybody i'm too or taco
stand the shelf

2
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,760
why do we call it ghost in the shell
because they're really

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,340
weird things going on in in our demo

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,830
which should not supposed to have so
first of all

5
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,780
yeah I'm a few words about us me and my
colleague to

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:27,080
are activity recipe /a security research
community for quite some time

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,770
yes discover its a variety of

8
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,500
all day Sun reported them I'm I hope all
of them to the

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,789
said a section of SAP HANA under
responsible disclosure

10
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:41,969
ever talking about them once SFPs fix
them and some time as hostile to

11
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:46,920
all the customers have had a chance to
apply the fix this yeah so as you can

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,659
see there's not a first conference love
you

13
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:52,359
talk about that part and what they're
talking about today s

14
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:55,690
you we have never talked about this
before anywhere except there's a fee of

15
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:56,059
course

16
00:00:56,059 --> 00:01:01,129
that so I'm before we go into the
details of the attack

17
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:04,229
it it's necessary to give everybody an
idea

18
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:07,420
even especially everybody not this is BS

19
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,170
an idea about how the technology works
that they're going to attack

20
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,740
so for some SAP technology

21
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:19,230
basics I'm so

22
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,760
the first question is of course if you
are a conference where

23
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,330
there are a lot of people that are not
involved in SAP technology

24
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,110
I'm for the audience is not involved in
SAP technology

25
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,790
I

26
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,630
funny guys that such okay so I but
everybody knows it's a piece of

27
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,370
its therefore expects a good idea I'm to
introduce SAP and

28
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,890
and tell people what is a PSI I was at a
conference on this year

29
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,910
golden cause I T defense and during

30
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,530
lungs a guy on the opposite side on the
table

31
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:55,770
ask what are you doing and I said well I
research SAP security

32
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,490
and then the guy said isn't that's a
very old protocol

33
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,210
so yet no idea what basically what so
you saw it as a protocol so therefore

34
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,920
it's it's a good idea to talk a little
about

35
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,929
what whitish let's protect the safety
systems

36
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:14,260
s most of you know ASAP is some the
largest business application

37
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,810
yuppie solution provider in the world
and I'm

38
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,680
a lot of companies I really running SAP
it depends on SAP

39
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,840
so what are these customers to just some
examples he got some figures about some

40
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,450
love the federal you if I said p.m. so

41
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,860
the transport $1.5 1,000,000,000 flight
passengers per year

42
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,150
I don't wanna read all that but it's
really a lot of things that they're

43
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:39,760
doing

44
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,840
book pick up producers

45
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,800
run SAP entertainment companies wanna
brought us this way

46
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,020
and most important of all because yeah
of course if

47
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,200
who cares about flights cars and stuff
like that but

48
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,170
something we all care about the most of
us care about us that seventy

49
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,590
2 percent of the vote the approach
depends on a set piece of it so this is

50
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,730
at least one reason to protect SAP
systems

51
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,610
and make sure there is they really
protect so

52
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,700
yep okay I'm know if this is a little

53
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,200
interactive Q&A I'm some

54
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,950
numbers I'm what do you think on an SAP
Basis result

55
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:26,640
first of all as it becomes with a basis
for ocean which is a technology

56
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,640
10 the technological foundation

57
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,930
but you could use some initial empiric
and develop and

58
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,690
do stuff like that and on top of that
last business solutions

59
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,840
in this case Mb refer to ECC 60 this is
a business solution so

60
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,680
some questions about how many database
tables do you think exists

61
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,690
into stunned out sup basis

62
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:53,920
installation plane base installation 200
thank the gentleman on the top

63
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,120
for us more 300 thank you

64
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,530
us a ser on the left side that's like an
option out of there

65
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,670
anyone more than 300 X 301

66
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:07,150
them or some other number so I

67
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:14,150
6-under thank you very much 27,000
football statements

68
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,120
okay there's a that 30506

69
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,260
DB tables how many lines of code

70
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:28,010
do you think existence up basis up

71
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:35,010
to it twenty million $50 million their

72
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,510
37.99 I'm

73
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:43,610
which is quite a lot and how many
execute a programs

74
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:47,570
do you think exists in the standards you
don't have to write it's there when you

75
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,330
install it

76
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:55,330
approximately 200 thank you

77
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:03,300
somebody says 3-under 35,000 bit bassist
Jack

78
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,639
self know we go to the next level how
many database tables to be half

79
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,479
NECC 60 system running solutions like

80
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,320
financial HR and stuff that's

81
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,030
companies really me because with the
bases sector basically con do anything

82
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,210
if your organization unless you want to

83
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:30,110
built all the applications yourself so
how many database service do you think

84
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,210
other and a full-blown and the Presstek

85
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:37,650
its must be more than 13,000

86
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:44,650
got expects

87
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:51,229
nein number okay

88
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:54,720
97,000 so I'm

89
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,919
basically a recipe most all the data are
are in the database so they really a

90
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:00,940
tremendous number if they have a stable
staff

91
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,380
and I'll that's cool so the other
numbers a little bit quicker

92
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,759
so we don't waste too much of your time
lines of course

93
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,280
172 million

94
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,490
after the Mac OS SAT 5 the notes that
case 15

95
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:22,130
so this is really a high complexity and
executing programs as anybody would have

96
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,310
guessed also a little bit more

97
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:28,020
then yet before so

98
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,460
what we have here is just an idea of the
complexity of the system and

99
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:37,060
and also an idea about that the masses
of data that on the system at the masses

100
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,430
of business logic that existed messaging
system

101
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,729
so there really a lot of things you can
do in SAP to manage your business

102
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:46,750
processes

103
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,630
so yes a picture on how the architect
rest when he was a slot on over up with

104
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,259
SAP

105
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:55,680
so they the use and application caught
SAP go away

106
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,160
which is a proprietary solution which
with which they can connect to the SAP

107
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,300
server and then

108
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,300
connects specific SAP application
service here in the back and interact

109
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,360
with them

110
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,660
but that's that's the way people out
working I used to work with

111
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,500
SAP so on I'm

112
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,949
yeah this is a picture of sup go if

113
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:21,979
just get you some idea what what it
looks like because is a technology using

114
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:24,150
to perform the attack later

115
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:28,289
so who works with that technology every
employee of a company of course because

116
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:29,300
they want to run

117
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,470
business then it's up going to do I'm

118
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:37,240
yeah to 21 create sales orders purchase
order us to

119
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,919
to create a char records through
assigned salaries to people

120
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,750
basically everything you do when a
company you going to what's up coolly

121
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,600
and run

122
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,770
any of the many SAP programs that are in
the system

123
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,210
so who also boxes up going
administrators the cost they use the

124
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,110
exact same tool to maintain

125
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:58,550
the configuration of the system

126
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,650
to use a maintenance assign roles to
users

127
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:06,110
and stuff and also last but not least

128
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,259
even the developed us that right
customers at the applications use the

129
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:11,270
same application sup we

130
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,419
they just run different applications
with its

131
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:17,750
and can write court so

132
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:22,880
bench or bf a fight variety of users
that use this technology

133
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,130
with totally different privileges and

134
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:30,550
things they need to do in the
organization

135
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,969
that still most back and access Istanbul
sup coli

136
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:38,959
today organizations

137
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,300
okay I am a few more words on the
technology itself

138
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:48,149
it's a proprietary fat client that has a
lot of functionality is

139
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:51,790
I'm the ongoing us in the xy file
there's also a

140
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,610
a Java version I'm it s potential to

141
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,649
excess the client operating system fight
system

142
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:02,060
and stuff like that so sweep of all

143
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:06,120
I'm it's also a scriptable and which was
also come

144
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,029
proprietary communication protocol to
communicate with the back and

145
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:14,089
and all the upload and download the
files can be done what's up cool we

146
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:17,630
and of course all the data you need to
sensual beckons

147
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:21,440
and display from that they can't also
attendants through

148
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,980
this protocol

149
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,250
so the solution is really powerful and
every

150
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,450
user every business using an
organization that runs S&P

151
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:36,130
uses it for the day to day book

152
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,830
so I'm I don't know how many of you were
already in

153
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,970
marianas talk earlier today about
forensic

154
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:48,050
you quickly reiterate some of the things
slow down already explained

155
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,029
a month basically there are some
important security thing senator

156
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:52,330
consider an SAP

157
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,350
rosen authorizations I one important
part

158
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:59,270
you need to make sure the business users
can only do other things

159
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:02,350
you want them to do so you need to
restrict their access

160
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:06,060
to specific programs such as a specific
dates of

161
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,010
usually I'm you restrict access to
business logic to programs

162
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:14,070
and thereby control who can do what

163
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:17,220
another important aspect is
accountability

164
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,250
if they are financial transactions
involve I must have a clear record of

165
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:26,830
court date what's when you contact for
an entry that says fifty million dollars

166
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,980
has been transferred and you have no
clue

167
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,890
will trigger this service must all be
accountable

168
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:36,050
so basically they are up

169
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:40,089
um yeah changes to relevant data can be
locked

170
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:44,310
SLs you can have information where
access to database

171
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,930
did people left the rights offer is
Asian who executed which program

172
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:51,360
when and some another part

173
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,350
which in this city is also relevant you
can host multiple businesses on the same

174
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,430
system

175
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:59,560
and there's a mechanism called a.m.
clients

176
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,709
which is there to separate the day
itself the

177
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:06,980
different businesses courses in the same
system so just to make sure that

178
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:11,660
if you are part of Klein 42 over here
that you cannot access state on any of

179
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,000
the other clients is also an important
mechanism

180
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,890
in SAP so you now have sort of a

181
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:22,040
basic idea of on the complexity and
things that

182
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,529
that ever existed in a secure system so
about

183
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:30,279
forensics there are very few a
monitoring toss that are active all the

184
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:32,410
time but he falls on a Sat the system

185
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:35,580
Lucas pics of of course many morning
touring

186
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,690
I'm I'm solutions by Sapa but

187
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:42,480
the usually tend to consume a lot of
disk space if you do so

188
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,380
that's why many companies don't activate
all of them

189
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,970
so especially that's a a very prominent
one which is called the security audit

190
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:51,410
lock

191
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,850
the security audit la cosa monitoring
solution that

192
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,750
basically checks for locked onto the
system which look once failed

193
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:05,040
I'm was it was a created was a specific
program started and stuff like that

194
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,980
and there's also another one we want to
so today the system trace

195
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:14,850
by which which is usually not turned on
because it really consumes a lot of data

196
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:18,190
but you can track authorization of the
use us

197
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:21,959
if if you run a certain program which
will see later that the was that the

198
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,930
right privilege to do that and

199
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:28,790
if they access the database which state
was that the excess and so for

200
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,810
okay now let's go to face 20

201
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,940
of our project ghost in the shell an
always switch over to a demo

202
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,839
in order to do that yeah she to play the
part of the attack a

203
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,040
K it doesn't very good and this by the
way I i'm

204
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,980
both the person that found the
vulnerability got no demonstrating

205
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,320
sex and Jess and head over when my name
issue

206
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,680
um just mentioned by and Jess um

207
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,800
yeah I first day want to show you a call
to

208
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,000
activates that the system tray sent
desecrate the audit

209
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,200
ok so this first say thats

210
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,790
looking to the to system up system

211
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,829
a possible at this to

212
00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:15,660
strong of I get sick

213
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,160
okay so

214
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:24,350
and this first day that's going to the

215
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:28,480
see as he said he ate start to

216
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:35,140
shot Caldwell

217
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,630
I just have for pet a small program

218
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:46,630
%uh sorry I'm not equipment this

219
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:52,990
either okay

220
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:56,490
okay I just hope that a ditto up

221
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:00,529
report what we've is here so

222
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:03,579
and also at the check and a they have a
success this time

223
00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:08,389
so if we activates the system chase and
the security audits look

224
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:12,459
we expect that's at least those already
checked and

225
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:15,579
that they have a success this time
locked so

226
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:19,100
for the so quick

227
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:25,009
assistant race we go to the test section
is 301 so just to keep

228
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:28,600
a story station check and they be excess

229
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,639
so that weekend use chase on

230
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,860
so

231
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,920
we need another for the

232
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:45,230
equity audit book pic activated

233
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:51,370
ect fit audit

234
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:57,069
okay so

235
00:14:57,069 --> 00:15:03,110
now let's executes the report yet

236
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:09,890
says the report sick skiff so

237
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:14,440
for the security audit look when you
going to the

238
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,480
shes in I think that they

239
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,060
time it

240
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,320
%uh that look okay

241
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,290
what we see is the user myself

242
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:36,900
and execute the report see churchill
posts lauck

243
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:41,580
yeah the report is started

244
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:47,940
is locked

245
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:54,940
and we checked the system trace

246
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:01,120
this morning formation in the system
trace I just go

247
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,700
down to the system choice hope

248
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:10,080
I hope I can fight it getting as as you
see there's really a lot which is

249
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,070
protocol if you switch that on

250
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:17,760
they're just to use those currently
working here hope I can find it

251
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,679
get

252
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:24,459
yet okay so

253
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:28,529
precede the user massive

254
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:33,309
that the X so St coat this authority

255
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:40,309
authority check with it sorry St code
and

256
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:44,230
you years old who is that they have a
success

257
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:48,499
we did so it showed you that Essex
expected

258
00:16:48,499 --> 00:16:51,809
all things I it and s ready

259
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:55,199
lot in the system so now

260
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,740
that's that's the real attack and for
the rear deck we need another

261
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,790
that talk so and yes we're

262
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:10,790
have me

263
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,270
saw no another year was a on the same
that's ok

264
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,570
locked onto the same SAP system with the
difference

265
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:28,170
sup going on a different machine
separate

266
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:32,600
yet so

267
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,610
and just check

268
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:38,880
okay I'm that take a this my name yes

269
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,230
sort I have to switch on the lock right
yet

270
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,450
okay so now we do the same thing they
just shit

271
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:52,450
group so we can create a trace

272
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:56,150
this time just the authorization trace
because this is not

273
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:00,540
as much stuff is this all before okay
our

274
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:07,540
I've put it off that step away from the
machine and do nothing okay

275
00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:14,700
did you notice that that's the same
program sure

276
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,849
started on this machine earlier I didn't
do anything it just came up

277
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:22,889
now i close that and now I want

278
00:18:22,889 --> 00:18:29,889
stop the trace and see what's going on

279
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:37,150
now it tells me

280
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:41,280
this is my he was up up there this time
down there

281
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,730
there's a nasty Court sac at my was a
senate so

282
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:48,630
what has happened program shoot through
launched the program

283
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:52,590
under my account on my machine and I
didn't do it

284
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,720
and the locks as I did it but I was
standing here like that

285
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,270
and I told you earlier an SAP system is
crucial that you have

286
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:05,930
accountability with this cut well of

287
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:09,080
of funny thing you can make somebody

288
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,090
execute the business logic they didn't
do

289
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:17,260
and we show up earlier that they are
really a lot of stunned out

290
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,710
execute a programs in the system which
means

291
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:25,580
trick with no trigger a malicious
business program which would for example

292
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,020
make me fire

293
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,090
another user and everybody if they look
at the locks

294
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:33,930
would say hey you did that well while I
didn't do it I didn't touch the machine

295
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:34,510
still

296
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:37,700
the program got executed and the locks s

297
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,290
it was me we can also check or divert
sec

298
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:48,290
and what the security on it looks s

299
00:19:57,049 --> 00:20:04,049
SOR worse than its

300
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:19,349
yeah to see it central bus lock security
on it looks s

301
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:22,719
I started that it names the time

302
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:26,559
date and time it says some also makes
machine that happened

303
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,989
and I did that through friends ex SE 38

304
00:20:29,989 --> 00:20:33,659
and it's in the lock so every audit so
that checks the security audit log

305
00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:36,950
what's a headache I Joe actually did
that

306
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:40,969
your own state report what I didn't do
it so

307
00:20:40,969 --> 00:20:44,649
what does that mean that means this
mechanism this ghost mechanism

308
00:20:44,649 --> 00:20:49,629
which stuff some magic think so yes it
is system can be used from one

309
00:20:49,629 --> 00:20:54,329
sup Corey so a tech active sessions of
other users

310
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:57,639

I I hit and

468
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:23,200
for okay know what what what happens
suddenly

469
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,440
ami we do so before when we try to
release the edits whether the sector you

470
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,880
want to save the changes in ok

471
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:32,809
born it's gone so if thats happens to
you think it's great if you're working

472
00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:34,039
because then you can go home

473
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:38,710
and application isn't doesn't or it
collects the whatever number trying to

474
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:39,559
log on again

475
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:43,500
so again my user and could you please to
swoop us again

476
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,389
to to login which

477
00:32:47,389 --> 00:32:50,850
only get an error message from the lower
on the north side

478
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:54,159
user is locked so whatever

479
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,690
you didn't do it rite II so I didn't
read it right off

480
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:02,210
write your first first program and so

481
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:06,460
somehow shoot manage to kill this
session and not only kill the session

482
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,809
without saving anything

483
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:11,570
but also to lock down the user console
econ even log on again

484
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:15,190
which is a nasty thing thank you very
much for your quick

485
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:18,909
thanks susannah up up training course

486
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:22,580
so I'm accident

487
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:25,669
ok esta that team of

488
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:29,480
okay great thank you so I'm

489
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:36,480
mmm

490
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:42,850
so so much for the demo and if you want
to avoid this kind of issue

491
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:46,260
this is a subset you as you know it you
should have in your system and as you

492
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,020
can see if

493
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:51,210
I'm be very I'm kind with the release of
that

494
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:54,700
it has been fixed already a long time
ago also

495
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,280
I'm it should be on every recipe system
now

496
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,550
and this kind of attack should not be
you working anymore

497
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:05,260
so this is what would use we didn't
attack

498
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:08,620
the that that the data transmission
between

499
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:11,780
a the system between us up go in the
back and did

500
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:16,440
somehow inject militia stuff no we
didn't do that the US the functionality

501
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,370
of the SAP application server

502
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:21,530
to send call months from one station to
another

503
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:26,320
execute them in that session making the
other station look like

504
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,520
they were triggered from there and
there's also some advisories

505
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,490
I'm that some on necessary in order to

506
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:36,580
avoids the possibility to somebody

507
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,920
executes alaska months through sup
coolly

508
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:44,820
and the enforce very kind I'm there's an
old us up we version that was not

509
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,190
protected against this but this if you
will use the subway 720

510
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:52,850
which had a protection against execution
of voice commands and creation of ice

511
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:53,610
and stuff like that

512
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:57,450
by informing the user hey somebody just
wants to create a file your system do

513
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:58,670
you want that yes or no

514
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:01,860
the brother Dan but again sure the nasty
guy

515
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,860
picked that mechanism and some these
notes I'm

516
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:09,330
are there to fix those up we version and
so it's protected again

517
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:12,610
so I'm now lets their

518
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,900
talk a little bit on how did that work
what what the just showing you

519
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,500
report on that phone anymore

520
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,710
how did that work

521
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:26,680
I'm soap basically I'm most of your
birth

522
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,390
probably all of you know I'm cross-site
request forgery which is gonna take it

523
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,900
was the best pros us to

524
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,240
Clonsilla tech somebody comes

525
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,560
on a militia so than that its highest
since the active session of the

526
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,800
up to the pros at this is a I'm yeah I
widely known to take its

527
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,220
even on the ovals top 10 or it has been
I don't know if it still is

528
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:50,350
and this is some example of what we call
a passive

529
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:56,410
request forgery attack so basically what
it needs it needs to have a trap

530
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:00,840
remix to plant the trap invite for
another user to come someone took a trip

531
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,930
and then we can hit him

532
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:05,090
and and another one that was

533
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:09,570
bills based on a trip for some queso P
case request forgery attack me shorten

534
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:13,710
troopers 2011 again related to
subsequent but

535
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:17,510
know what what the fitness today and
this is something at you at least in

536
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:20,240
this if you've got a sec X if request
forgery attack

537
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,590
well we don't have to put on something
and wait for use it to stumble over it

538
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:28,020
but we have X if you was a session and
we can

539
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:31,740
at eckardt's in real time we can see
what to say he was a

540
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:35,050
what was a son locked on you can pick
any of them

541
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:39,330
and send come ons in their system and in
the protocols and

542
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,820
in the locks of SAP it to look like the
other uses that that

543
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:46,500
and they can also use that attack as you
have seen to

544
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,860
distribute mall there once the affected
SAP server

545
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:53,260
to clients an easy way to all active
clients

546
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:56,650
so again

547
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:00,470
the asynchronous the passive request
forgery years old works

548
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,880
US beef on some wearable systems in your
plans

549
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,080
an attack on a web server the next thing
you have to do with an attack you have

550
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:08,740
to wait

551
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:13,090
and try to trick us some social
engineering stuff will simply be patient

552
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:16,130
to somebody comes across the server by
accident

553
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:20,440
and what then happens we have five

554
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:26,310
a USO that is connected to obsession to
a legitimate web session maybe something

555
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,190
like the bay

556
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:30,210
or Google account or in a bank account

557
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:33,390
and then he comes across the militia
swept page

558
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:36,760
and that the trip is here and it
launches through the bros on the text

559
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,250
the other web session butts with

560
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:45,490
um some Coronas attack we have a number
of users and are currently locked onto

561
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:46,810
SAP systems

562
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:51,050
one SMS malicious and she senses come on
through the back and

563
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:54,200
to any of the user's and can detect them
at will

564
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,610
in real time which is a very bad things

565
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:01,140
in an environment for units very heavily
depends on

566
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:06,170
authorizations and some accountability
so

567
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:11,550
to summarize hey make sure you all this
has the latest SAP patches installs

568
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:15,630
from to be sure that there are no
problems like that on your system

569
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:22,130
and also make sure that your custom code
does not do anything malicious here

570
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:22,880
because the

571
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,820
in order to launch the attack earlier we
needed to build some little custom

572
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,950
reports that a trick got this

573
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:32,530
so to make that clear the mechanism was
not there

574
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:36,250
in the SAP and I could do some aging and
brought I meet I needed to write a small

575
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,700
program

576
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:42,320
to launch the attack and I i need to
know how to do that

577
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,800
in order to make this exploit so the SAP
system itself if you install it

578
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,130
has the technical capability of doing it
but nobody yet knows how when there's no

579
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:54,580
no business logic to execute it be built
at ourselves

580
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:58,040
and you have to make sure that there is
no such program that can leverage

581
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,670
a mechanisms like that said yes if your
system

582
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:05,710
so if you have more using it more
information on SAP security and

583
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,730
especially a vacation security

584
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:11,760
here are some links you might find
interesting

585
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,140
and if you have any questions

586
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:18,890
including a program Inc I

587
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:25,890
about ghosts or something like that now
is the time to ask

588
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:31,760
questions was a download link for the
coat

589
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,710
I do not fit within 30 secs I

590
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:42,490
you can ask sure if you want to join you
for dinner maybe he tells his I

591
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:45,910
okay but no crystal essence thank you
very much over

592
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:49,630
last-minute question thank you you also
want to come down wrote some other

593
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,500
programs

594
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:54,530
I I'm it seems like you did the attack
on the

595
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:57,800
when you are logged onto the same
application server yet it does it also

596
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,300
work if you're on different application
servers

597
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:07,300
who its I

598
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:12,690
question a very very valid question yes
it works the box office but

599
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:16,300
I of course in certain conditions in its
I need to have away from

600
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,300
to get from applications over 80
application server be

601
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,350
and then I can I take everybody in
applications that will be a swell

602
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:26,120
yep that's possible

603
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:31,730
other questions

604
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:35,089
okay great thanks very much thank you
very much
