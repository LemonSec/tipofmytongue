1
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,290
of companies that

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,700
use of me he

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,180
here his

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:21,760
he

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,699
and for of

6
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:30,060
all around home is feel if

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,110
so know if

8
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,510
security companies day

9
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,229
to do if feature much much easier

10
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:44,670
now for the last year some I guess some

11
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,110
you know what when it came to
authentication authorization already

12
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,049
some

13
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:54,960
D's problems arm they weren t speak
specifications you'd like to do is stop

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,729
WS Federation ws-security year duffy's
trust

15
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:02,299
and they were driven by dipped by the
body and the prices basically

16
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:06,440
now erased over

17
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,630
if you haven't realized yet is over
dummies trust on you

18
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,630
Federation WS security he's all like

19
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,840
could cause that kind of sauce Indian
security but because that's one

20
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,869
want big beat rival in the industry
which is changing everything

21
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:24,899
and it's more like a cutie okay

22
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:28,420
so if you wanna incorporate any saw

23
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,490
of mobile I'll experiences let's put it
this way

24
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,939
in your software and it can be even a
laptop yet that if

25
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,200
roaming yeah in doesn't need to be
specifically like a smartphone or a

26
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:40,789
tablet

27
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:43,880
then you need to talk to cause that

28
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,929
are you know did not deny working on
these devices

29
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:50,439
and there is no WS trust spec on I West

30
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:53,869
his trust back on Android everything his
trust back

31
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:58,179
on Windows eighty sold that means we
have to adapt

32
00:01:58,179 --> 00:02:01,280
if we want to play in the mobile market
speak on use these

33
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,409
old old ten-year-old specification
anymore

34
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,360
we have to use than you keep stuff that
he's tough to

35
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,680
at the guys that's it in stocks with
them then tossed in writing

36
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,890
now and the replacement for many of the
problems that obvious trust

37
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,950
and and friends up try to solve

38
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,040
is called all of all of

39
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,430
for open authorization and

40
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,810
you know all the guys are doing it like
Microsoft Google Facebook Kurt without

41
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,950
they did he started using that that
stuff

42
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,349
and interesting if interesting for the
first time

43
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:42,750
in it seems like that specs that came
from the web session

44
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,590
you out space trickle down in the
enterprise not wise for us

45
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,409
and that's interesting observation and
thanks for the call is so new

46
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:55,209
and a lot of little things have gone
wrong just recently which is part of my

47
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:55,760
talk

48
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,019
arm I thought it might be worthwhile to

49
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:02,079
a.m. show you how it works because I
just a few

50
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:05,540
that not everybody here all expert in
the room and be

51
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,540
on the problems that some I'll

52
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,209
some far-out he I saw myself
implementing a

53
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:16,989
us found the hard way my name is Dominic

54
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:21,819
I am used to work at the end a long time
ago well not so long time ago

55
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:25,220
eightieth the way I focused a lot on

56
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,849
breaking stuff now I focus a lot on
fixing stuff

57
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:32,769
on me here you know looked hot at least
arm

58
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:35,989
so I guess the most important thing here
is my email address if you have any

59
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:37,250
questions up to talk

60
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,129
feel free to write me it and I simple

61
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:44,870
as i said i wanna give you know if you
want to office and some

62
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:49,049
you know concerns and its actually a
very controversial call actually I'm

63
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:52,579
arm which makes it much much more fun to
talk about

64
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:55,650
what is all of ASO

65
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,000
the first thing is it's an authorized
agent call this the most

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,099
the biggest misconception because people
still don't know what to give

67
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:07,069
an authentication authorization for many
people use the form of indication

68
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:10,689
which is not too because the tendency
later on how wrong that its

69
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:15,659
on but it says it's an open to call for
the Q authorization in a simple

70
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:18,900
and standard methods for at mobile and
death

71
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,170
applications and if you follow this link
here video of cation

72
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,240
brings you to the Irish Sea which has to
be in korea

73
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,010
obviously yeah I'm to make it more you
know substantial

74
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:35,190
and you can see is actually are seeing a
pretty new one from October

75
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:40,350
last year so if you get saying the same
thing just more

76
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:44,090
now what's the three of the protocol

77
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,970
it it's interesting it started as a few
accounts you must think

78
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,160
it was written by one single guy arm
what started by soon as I heard

79
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,360
around him up which are gone but later
more detail

80
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,790
and basically was some kind of a long

81
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:02,650
I'm something very very early problems
like how

82
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,820
movie controls access to its resources
like

83
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,720
like Kelantan mail and am contacts

84
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,590
and things like that and I'm one so it

85
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:17,710
got more traction on data submitted to
the IETF and I guess that's the thing

86
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:18,670
that everyone will

87
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:22,150
regret for the rest of his life that he
started to follow

88
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:25,790
arm standardization process using the
IETF

89
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:29,220
so rc5

90
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,520
8 495 of 10

91
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,770
in 2010 then suddenly all the other big
companies became you know

92
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,380
interested like Microsoft came in hands
Yahoo and

93
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:46,050
Google again and you know tweet and
Facebook and all other

94
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,070
lots of companies bid enterprise
interests as well

95
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:54,570
and you know started doing thereafter on
something you

96
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,990
on and in 2010 the button below 20

97
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,640
again because all these companies fault
that all formal was too complicated for

98
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,000
me

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,940
250 simplified its yeah to make easier
for developers

100
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,530
and sometimes things might be too simple
even

101
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:15,840
so interesting thing is now between 2010
and 2012 developed think 32

102
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,190
revisions of the of the of the draft and
in between is fine it easier for TIF

103
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:25,720
to TV revisions all the big guys decided
to implement it

104
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,820
you know at some point in the revision

105
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,960
process like Google Facebook Microsoft
he got of

106
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,200
one and dismiss least 32 me very much
like their

107
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,800
the least on the company that has been
hacked recently now

108
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,620
um so and the interesting thing which
makes it is really

109
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:49,310
fun to talk about is some just like
three months before the finalization

110
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:52,860
gonna call delete also said I'm done
with it

111
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,770
all of Sox yeah all over the piece of
shit

112
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,860
basically what is what is burning and he

113
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,860
removed his name from all the documents

114
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,320
I I don't want to be associated with
just gonna call anymore

115
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,690
okay I and so my hired a guy in

116
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:13,750
actually I'm some in Olympic hot he he
did the same as

117
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,000
and I'm NT 2.0 talk news and rumors that

118
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,570
I'm from moscow on he hired hand next
time the guys that I can you please

119
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:22,400
write that

120
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,860
last revision for the can finally sign
of kissing and getting

121
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,110
streets and that's what happened in
October

122
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,420
of to specs now and out about

123
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,600
now what did you do it

124
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:42,600
so a high level of %um of a strike to
achieve something really simple

125
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,330
we have to use up that is trying to
access

126
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:51,860
data or service now and maybe you'll see
in India

127
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,860
intro it's about HTP based services so
it's all about you know

128
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,960
rest restful serve ACPE API's

129
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,710
no the feeling that you know groupies do
these days

130
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:06,670
I'm bot for the first time actually in

131
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:10,050
arm they did something into
consideration it's not actually the

132
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:10,670
human

133
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:14,510
directly accessing the Service it's a
human accessing data

134
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,260
wire and application okay

135
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:23,350
and education might on might not be a
fully trusted

136
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:27,590
and even more common maybe maybe you
trust the application but maybe your

137
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,050
company doesn't trust the device the
applications one

138
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,260
okay so the first time you reading the
spec

139
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,629
your head will hurt because they use
different terminology here

140
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:41,529
so they have to think what the client
and a red

141
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:45,120
he didn't make any sense because the
client in my mind with this guy

142
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,160
by the clients the application death
Beach and despise there is also not

143
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,370
and there we saw honer own we saw
onerous author

144
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:58,040
and the client X on behalf of the risks
of owner

145
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,180
to access that results fun

146
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:08,180
and an elegy I'm from the real world so
who knows this movie

147
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:12,790
Ferris Bueller's Day Off Fed is not now

148
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,120
now so

149
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,319
that the story behind that issue me
photos don't know it of kind remember

150
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:25,839
day basically they take a day off from
school and stating that his cock

151
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,829
okay so they did have its really really
I expensive Ferrari

152
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:34,720
and if you wanna have had the day off
and bring it to a I'm

153
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,750
Valley talking you know what any parking
isn't a statement you try somebody some

154
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,769
Nike

155
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:42,889
and he parked the car for you and you
note

156
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:45,889
the dead kind of concerned I can be
really in

157
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:49,300
you know trust this guy can indicate it
is very expensive covered

158
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,110
is that no problem trust me yeah

159
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:59,370
so the next thing was basically a disk I
and his friend took a road trip

160
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,639
and coming back to all of that is
exactly what they're trying to sort of

161
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:07,439
basically that the resource the Mahoning
of the car

162
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:10,449
okay and they were giving client

163
00:10:10,449 --> 00:10:13,970
a third party access to the sauce

164
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:18,079
now what what what did they give them
the Asian to keep

165
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,639
John master key to the results and is
this something that you like to give

166
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,699
people must think he'd summaries of

167
00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:30,420
probably not yeah so in the states
actually did it there are things called

168
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,089
villi

169
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:34,310
talking he thought when you buy a car
you get two sets of keys what is the

170
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,370
master key

171
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,939
one is the valley kinky and with the
valley talking to you can only try to

172
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:41,009
cop a five-month

173
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:45,879
you don't have access to trunk and you
can use the built-in mobile phone

174
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,980
okay so what this for trying to solve is

175
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,439
hold Valley parking key for the internet
work

176
00:10:52,439 --> 00:10:55,990
how can we give at third-party client
that be

177
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:01,959
partially trust maybe only limited
access to resolve the PO

178
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:06,240
on maybe even that

179
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,759
yeah maybe even you want to revoke
excess at some point

180
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:14,329
when you think it's the right place
through my point between revoke it

181
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:18,230
and that's exactly what it is like to
solve okay all of exactly about

182
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:22,620
is broken to keep the look at what's

183
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,149
arm we have so we all over wanted to
resolve

184
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:29,660
not that's the guidance only a wreath of
think Ferrari

185
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,529
we have tourists also well not really
directly applicable

186
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:37,759
we have the client and stuffing data of

187
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:40,949
adds to the mix is a so-called
authorization server that's the thing

188
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:44,889
that's basically if out limited access
keys

189
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:50,050
okay so if you get here is this the
river owns a wreath of

190
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:53,379
there is also a trustee authorization
server that

191
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,720
the keys that is getting out of you know
trust nothing

192
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,809
or can be used then we have to

193
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:03,410
client thats is used by resolve owner to

194
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,259
access the resource the client is
typically wretched

195
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:11,879
with your frustrations over and
authorized why the authorization server

196
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:15,809
and accessories of on behalf of the
resolve

197
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:18,879
okay fate of Twitter

198
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:22,730
at Twitter Hess I can't you have a
Twitter account

199
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,100
directed is only one application want to
that line made by Twitter

200
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,220
court weekday all the other stuff
parties

201
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,999
okay and you don't give them you ought
to ask but the only thing he did was at

202
00:12:33,999 --> 00:12:36,259
hand chicken and actually how it works

203
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:39,779
to give to get access to your data so

204
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:42,949
what a trust relationship basically

205
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:46,120
this is a trust so Chris also one of
president

206
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,350
long to get okay the authorization
server isn't determined

207
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:53,749
hot of tourists author it knows about
the resources to do with what I was

208
00:12:53,749 --> 00:12:56,089
trying to protect

209
00:12:56,089 --> 00:13:00,269
on there is also to have trust mysteries
also obviously because it has resolved

210
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:03,559
on this %uh NEC by default that

211
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:08,170
that client is is outside of the Trust's
on it's not trusted

212
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:13,079
okay so they actually have free type of
all types of clients

213
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:16,850
one is called confidential client
bitches basic declined it can keep a

214
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,550
secret

215
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:21,550
to be something that is installed on the
server magnification is a subset of a

216
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,589
slight

217
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:25,759
a public lines would be something that
is on your on your machine

218
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:30,149
something that on your machine can keep
a secret now

219
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:34,209
for example they can keep a secret
Justin Bieber knife

220
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:38,480
I'm trusted client specific times that
you don't trust to say you don't want to

221
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,350
give them your

222
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:44,009
master key 3 I'm just trying to trust
lines are the ones that you trust

223
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:47,579
or again um I guess where the device

224
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:51,189
that they are installed on is considered
trusted yes maybe I think really tightly

225
00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:53,160
controlled device from the company

226
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,279
you know for hard disk encryption
whatever remote piping

227
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,319
stuff like that maybe you then you than

228
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:03,509
it's okay for you to store a password on
your device

229
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:07,379
otherwise maybe you don't so he can be
trusted

230
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:11,829
but thats a special case of okay

231
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:16,149
okay cool so of defiance

232
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:20,209
5 throws basically flows how to

233
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:24,889
Greek fest excess bequest to token and
powerful what it open to to

234
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:28,449
to your application you are using arm

235
00:14:28,449 --> 00:14:31,629
there are to flow switch which home

236
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:34,660
require user interaction and free flows

237
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,509
which which don't so I will focus on the
free most

238
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:43,290
common once arm there are no one's for
you know like et Huntsville exit of

239
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:46,319
books and stuff like that which we don't
come away

240
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:50,720
soda at the most Noel a very common one
is the call

241
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,059
is called of recitation cold flow and
that is so it

242
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:58,220
applications so you like the client that
you're giving access to be resource

243
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:02,300
is that application something that is
why okay

244
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:07,449
and you can see de some if respects your
request authorization request it open

245
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:10,759
X is the result of the Institute Flavia
that is something called the implicit

246
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:11,839
flow

247
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,339
which is for locally installed
applications something running on a hot

248
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:15,999
where

249
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:20,459
and take conflate the authorization
token stage

250
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:23,339
and actually that is the one that is
most to discuss these days if it's

251
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,160
really it doesn't make any sense at all

252
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,589
now and Esteban called the resolve own
up past much potential for a witch's

253
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:33,569
trusted applications when there is no
authorization staged it could be like

254
00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:34,139
you up

255
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:38,009
trusted piece of software on your highly
secure covered hardware

256
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:41,709
for example now and also a I'm

257
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:46,629
a not so nice on way of describing that
but you see the literature

258
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:50,679
baby decor that the three-legged who of
and the two left

259
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:54,779
well-off because here we have free three
steps here we have two steps

260
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:58,670
here we actually have a lot of respect
but the city inflated

261
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:02,309
two steps into one which is a problem

262
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:06,679
actually okay

263
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:10,959
let's start with Dom that application
client on the authorization code flow

264
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,029
that's the idea

265
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:16,410
US citizen from the browser are you
going to get the education and at

266
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,660
education should work on your behalf on
some data

267
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:24,189
FB cover Twitter client did that this
morning in a browser

268
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:28,410
yeah and existing data on your behalf on
Twitter of think of an application that

269
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:32,610
accessing your you're protected Flickr
pictures on your behalf to print and

270
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:33,610
stuff like that

271
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,929
I and you can easily tired moved into
the in the public space

272
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:40,139
think of an application X is your pocket
calendar stuff like

273
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:43,790
yeah so we don't want to gift that

274
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:48,040
application our master key for the use
of our effort

275
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:53,040
right okay so how can you let

276
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,480
so I'll it's all done the magic of pay
issue

277
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,499
directs forget here is justification
redirect the browser

278
00:17:01,499 --> 00:17:05,179
to the authorization server that's the
guy that can authenticate

279
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:09,230
34 or not and knows about your
application that's trying to access to

280
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:09,959
data

281
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,300
okay so you can see basically we had a
arm

282
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,490
a degrees being here saying hey I'm

283
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,650
have enacted is this the application he
stretches to

284
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:22,970
beforehand if your position seventy
exchange some you know

285
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:28,000
secret basically arm they say I want to
access that resource hiya

286
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,150
and when you're done with the
authorization process

287
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,940
come back to this address and give me a
so-called cold

288
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,520
bestest thing I one aspect and this
year's fight interesting which is

289
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,190
getting some

290
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:43,510
implementations is basically a random
number to the client has to come up with

291
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:46,610
central server and as I have to send it
back

292
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:50,050
why cross-site request forgery

293
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:53,030
hey we want to make sure that the
request coming back from the server is

294
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,120
actually matching

295
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,300
their request that he said to sever

296
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:02,360
obviously that means that the client has
to store state which many don't

297
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,970
and then what you see baby gear is I'm
what he called a constant

298
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:09,180
style of the visited I don't think

299
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,740
this and as the application in that case
the application is called bottled up

300
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,130
anyone access to your Google read our
data which if

301
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:19,220
no soon obsolete because Kuria shut off

302
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,310
afterlife haven't had a news today which
sucks

303
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:26,420
yeah arm yeah visibility what you say is
OK I

304
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,900
allowed this application access to my
Google reader data

305
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,180
and if you're pressing okay then exactly
that will happen

306
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:38,160
okay and that's what people often don't
get like I really gotta

307
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,820
advice from a guy thing like yeah it can
be safe might threaten on the internet

308
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,490
as well

309
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:45,820
actually a pretty nothing can save your
friend on the internet via not

310
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,650
oh and all of Canada okay if you press
acadia

311
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,780
you are in the game for example

312
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,490
this year nicer for a shot to attack me
since being with you

313
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:03,490
to allow here

314
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:11,040
it takes some time to read it right good

315
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,770
yeah so at whatever you click here

316
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:18,860
yes your your responsible for that yeah

317
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:23,530
okay so when you take allow and maybe
make me go back to call back

318
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,920
that was awesome specified by

319
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:31,120
by the response upon request about
awaited again and I have

320
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,400
implementation Florida a.m. sup stone
anything to call but you are right and

321
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,360
something is gonna pick somewhere else
and a didn't know to

322
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,830
um this entry coat and did you make a
statement again

323
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,350
the state has to be validated with the
state that the record before we make the

324
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,650
request otherwise you know

325
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:53,100
them to my match okay and then if thats
with that cold

326
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,550
you go back to the application goes back
to the authorization up

327
00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:00,000
test welfare indicate review of
reservations with the secret that they

328
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,280
exchanged I'm

329
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,370
a priori say and here's my coat

330
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,400
and get back annexes ok

331
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,500
okay is JC it or cheese no pickle he has
to be challenged but friendly

332
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,760
yet arm sold to extol

333
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,880
basically gives you access to resolve
yeah expires in

334
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,100
basically says okay how long is this
thing bellied talking type

335
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,910
about it later and everything refreshed
hoping to talk about sect

336
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,910
okay and for with X is talking in hand

337
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:36,150
the application can from now on X is
expected to resolve that I consented to

338
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,690
okay so basically after that bacon x3
sauce

339
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,900
on my behalf without me being you know
heading to be

340
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,580
in front of the computer anymore okay

341
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,650
so chasing that opens this then used

342
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:54,120
then you talkin former data ended today
using here

343
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,140
and is basically a chasing encoded
string

344
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:00,500
so we can basically say child was
created you know chasing

345
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,790
string if I am I can get to get a
JavaScript object

346
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:08,680
his department which is you everything
we've had a

347
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,300
which says I'm it chase metal shot as
they say

348
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:16,220
on and rhythm which defines the haitian
him

349
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,230
and then we have a list of claims

350
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:22,880
now arm something

351
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,210
Reese of claim anything issue up
exploration

352
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:30,060
audience somehow you know something that
you can

353
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,100
freely defined like name role

354
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:38,110
whatever yet so if you want hold it hold
it works if they take to head up

355
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:42,420
Bay 64 encoded dot take the claims a 64
encoded

356
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,540
dot and buddhist it would think that a
lot of pot

357
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,870
and and the Signet that's what you think
around

358
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:53,800
basically just fine you know

359
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,310
and then this thing called the refreshed
open here

360
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:01,370
and that is basically I'm giving the
client

361
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:04,380
and opportunity shoe reading you

362
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:09,280
his token once the Wichita Kan has
expired

363
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,890
okay so let's say in I'm

364
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:16,040
you want to give is some this
application long-lived

365
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,130
access to be resource and maybe they're
doing something on behalf of

366
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:23,440
in the background to I am there are
services for example if you like in

367
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,510
info like this week you had six new for
a loss and fall

368
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,590
left and you have so many be treats
retreats

369
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:34,400
and thats up how did you get it by
running best shot in the back from and

370
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,510
any access to that form for a longer
period of time

371
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:41,350
and again if you consent to give up
refresh token Stan

372
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:46,760
that's what you do and maybe you've seen
these pages here before

373
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:51,700
arm where you can actually revoke
refresh token so here for example I gave

374
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,200
adobe photoshop lightroom except my
flickr lol

375
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,590
if at some point I realized I don't want
that anymore

376
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:01,620
I can revoke it and what detective
technically do with

377
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:05,750
they revoke to refresh token so we
country fresh

378
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:09,350
our existing talk

379
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:14,250
okay on that same thing Dropbox

380
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:17,850
now maybe you think you've seen that
before on that's how you can connect

381
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:21,170
applications drop off without giving
them your Dropbox pestered

382
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:24,570
be that that's the whole idea

383
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:31,570
questions yep

384
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,409
mmm that this um basically I am

385
00:23:45,409 --> 00:23:51,720
just a Chia yet when you re fresh to
tokyo also on first use maybe a

386
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,120
home you see that what the opposition of
recisions

387
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,429
should do is is no doubt right down

388
00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:02,960
for which client was that talkin and
economic lines have to re authenticate

389
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,230
need to be fed into talking

390
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:07,470
so that's how you can buy into talking
to with a client

391
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:11,299
if it is implemented okay

392
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:15,580
and there is one of the things that
doesn't happen all the time of

393
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:21,110
up for up to date with the heck

394
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:25,070
for example to protect like some months
ago what is still were

395
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:28,139
refresh token and it turned out there
was a planned by

396
00:24:28,139 --> 00:24:31,629
yet for the day to restore the account

397
00:24:31,629 --> 00:24:36,700
okay let's go through de eso

398
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,200
implicit flowed esta the most
interesting one actually from a security

399
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,840
point of view

400
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,110
I'm it for native of a client
application

401
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:48,230
as you all know you that these are the
ones which can be secured by definition

402
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:52,100
now but the idea is simple: you have 'em

403
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:56,169
every thought or not he has some sort of
device and the soffits running

404
00:24:56,169 --> 00:24:59,950
on the device now again photo of
dictates is

405
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,999
must be used in correction okay so
becomes

406
00:25:02,999 --> 00:25:06,570
just silently request a token for the
fortress of

407
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:10,700
the user must give consent okay and how
do we give consent

408
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,779
in a native application what we have to
do which

409
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:20,779
do you think that you all seen before
technically speaking

410
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:24,799
and nephew you have to open a browser

411
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,759
you have to open something that trend of
the page okay

412
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:32,159
something like this up

413
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,240
which looks like a native be dope

414
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,659
and is supposed to render Google right

415
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:44,059
so yeah you believe you type in your
password

416
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:47,470
induced by law here and you click again

417
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:51,659
I allow access for application XY 2 X's
my data

418
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:55,409
in the nephew and a closed few did
typically

419
00:25:55,409 --> 00:25:58,590
the way this works is it depends on the
operating system have a talk about it

420
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,059
later

421
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:02,769
but the client gets that token by a
brother

422
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:06,639
directly without having to cold in
between as you can see here

423
00:26:06,639 --> 00:26:09,559
requesting a token again we have to do
that whole for site request forgery

424
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:10,570
thing

425
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:14,279
arm yet and what we get back yes

426
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:18,179
talking directly on the call back
extolled

427
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:21,519
on the chemistry okay

428
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:24,929
this time D-day diva has fragment and
not a

429
00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:28,190
a question mark which is a different
issue P because have threatened

430
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:32,200
and not I'm not lock by so fast and
don't appear in before I head up and you

431
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,840
click on a link that it wouldn't you
know

432
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,309
should be a problem if they would be in
the river a head-on day which

433
00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:41,919
trace that from stuff like that but
that's basically to the simplified

434
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,519
version for local

435
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,570
locally installed applications okay

436
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:52,830
and let's define a discussion if that
doesn't make sense at all

437
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:56,139
too late to but that's how it works now

438
00:26:56,139 --> 00:26:59,889
and I'm pretty sure you've seen that
before let's do this

439
00:26:59,889 --> 00:27:05,789
arm I just installed a new Twitter
client for Windows 8 this morning

440
00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:12,789
so when I click here what they are doing
is they're opening a bit few

441
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:18,090
inside up when

442
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:24,750
that's an issue are good

443
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:31,750
money in

444
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:46,190
but this one great

445
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:51,220
are are

446
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:58,220
as while

447
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:05,840
okay let's try it

448
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,979
you

449
00:28:12,979 --> 00:28:16,239
see that questions before

450
00:28:16,239 --> 00:28:20,919
style a few so many

451
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:24,700
what what they're rendering he is that
page okay and that's fine with us

452
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,929
aidid have been in support for all of s
in the operating system APIs

453
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:33,559
yep um and easy like what's your email
address and what's your password and

454
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:34,929
anything authorized at

455
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:38,440
and what comes back to the Twitter
application is the token

456
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,049
and from that point on they can access
your data using talking but

457
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:46,309
technically if you believe that is
really to that page from Twitter

458
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:49,399
unification that okay

459
00:28:49,399 --> 00:28:56,399
either in the simplification the dust
that

460
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:01,590
are basically and who's interested in
the source code

461
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:05,419
contrast an email but it's going to take
me the same thing

462
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:09,129
its opening that contain a to some of
rice asians up

463
00:29:09,129 --> 00:29:13,269
and then dismissal media in you I have

464
00:29:13,269 --> 00:29:18,489
I say of and and the consent

465
00:29:18,489 --> 00:29:21,700
gets shown aa

466
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,729
when a client is requesting permission
to access a resource

467
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:30,299
on your behalf that the resource here
minutes allow that the token coming that

468
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:34,450
and then I would stall a token locally
on the device

469
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:39,129
which is short-lived he's competitive

470
00:29:39,129 --> 00:29:43,159
I'm and then you would use to talk in
afterwards so

471
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:46,299
I can now call the service and that used

472
00:29:46,299 --> 00:29:49,489
de donde close the application and come
back to it

473
00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:53,960
you see they have to start opened it up
don't have to ask me again

474
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:59,139
for indication estella obviously because
you Kant

475
00:29:59,139 --> 00:30:02,940
board are you with us every single time
on a mobile device

476
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:09,940
way past that just won't work okay

477
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,690
for Esther so what implicit flow now
what

478
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:17,269
notification to a.m. a sample of blood

479
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:23,049
NetFlow home that in here

480
00:30:23,049 --> 00:30:26,909
so when I faced opposition and shake to
coat with her

481
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:31,659
yeah

482
00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:37,119
sign in

483
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:39,779
I get the content screen consent screen

484
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:43,849
see Alexis now to uphold comes back to
the client application

485
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:47,739
and I can say get token have mental

486
00:30:47,739 --> 00:30:51,129
okay know if they were you talkin

487
00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:58,129
5126 by at for okay

488
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:05,799
good and then afterwards I can just
texted X 3/4 again

489
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:08,919
by putting the token to be on
authorization

490
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:12,510
in a chippy okay

491
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:16,409
last last flow I wanna show is the
so-called rethought

492
00:31:16,409 --> 00:31:20,429
owner password potential flow and that
for so-called trusted applications and

493
00:31:20,429 --> 00:31:21,460
the only difference between

494
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:25,440
debt and the floor before 10 is that
there will be no consent screen

495
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,580
so it is assumed that when using their
flow that

496
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:32,200
you know the user doesn't have to
consent to that because the application

497
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:32,919
is

498
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:37,279
already trust now and what they're doing
is basically

499
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:41,260
going directly home handshake with your
friends Asian summer

500
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:44,289
they say type is the passcode house

501
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:47,820
in the name of the iPad the name of the
user doesn't depend on if the user

502
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:51,350
with of Kona and you get direct effect
talking

503
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:54,460
from that point so that it wasn't using
directional to you

504
00:31:54,460 --> 00:32:00,309
okay okay

505
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:04,360
any questions

506
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,299
aunda flows on how historical works

507
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:14,600
yep it depends on your frustrations up

508
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,450
very typically is one hour bot it
totally opposed to be implemented

509
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:23,710
implement a basically how long you think
sleeve yeah so what if you do is you

510
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:26,840
have really short left oakland's like
maybe even 10 minutes

511
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,890
yeah and then have to refresh tokens to
give get you once

512
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:33,659
where and when you have to re
authenticate to getting you refresh

513
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:34,149
token

514
00:32:34,149 --> 00:32:37,679
I media applications to be authenticated
user be a

515
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:44,130
okay

516
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:47,200
and I think it's like really yet

517
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:54,200
where pipe

518
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,620
depends on the operating system so
windows 8 for example has

519
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:02,750
has a s papi did the Data Protection AVI
and windows build in

520
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:06,309
on a date even have more high-level if
you ask for the password vault

521
00:33:06,309 --> 00:33:09,360
for example wedding trip to stop and its
biggest of

522
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,970
you know in ApplicationContext somebody
education is wide access to

523
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:17,280
now there is a and operating systems do
it differently

524
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:22,309
and some you know because eighty I S

525
00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:25,659
more like highly controlled environments
because typically you get your stuff

526
00:33:25,659 --> 00:33:26,520
from the App Store

527
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:30,350
and it ran for a certain certifications
on Android know it's been

528
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:33,620
live wild wild west thing yeah so

529
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:37,590
some yeah opportunity its toll in the
context of the application

530
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:41,899
some some operators and has really good
API so that which are not yet broken at

531
00:33:41,899 --> 00:33:42,350
least

532
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:45,950
and some have don't have to arm

533
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:51,200
okay yep said

534
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,740
II 170

535
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:58,110
okay

536
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:02,110
so the original of local you can see it
was

537
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:06,080
internet thing because he it has a cat
yeah I'm

538
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,649
so do you do or chill of key

539
00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:12,700
move to: of talkin now arm

540
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,859
and that was like that on I'm

541
00:34:15,859 --> 00:34:20,339
depicted a roadkill version um few years
later when this guy and left a comment

542
00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:20,760
here

543
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,099
like done with of he made his logo and

544
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:27,570
printed t-shirts ask you to give us who
have to people because it believes that

545
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:28,050
while

546
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:32,780
that's what you get so than a funny
thing I saw recently

547
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:37,419
so

548
00:34:37,419 --> 00:34:42,169
let's start with this guy Arran Hamas
that's the guy that that created all of

549
00:34:42,169 --> 00:34:45,450
left the committee just before you know
it was done

550
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:49,149
and by the way he fell he/she tweet with
the hashtag 500 of

551
00:34:49,149 --> 00:34:52,859
yeah police really really pissed off

552
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:56,149
yeah because basically he gave just
because the IETF

553
00:34:56,149 --> 00:34:59,650
and he and in his mind it was completed

554
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:04,080
killed by the interests okay so here's a
number of

555
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:08,109
interesting blog post n the thing is
he's right everything he's saying

556
00:35:08,109 --> 00:35:12,460
arm but yeah its of no big used to know

557
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,790
just home complaint if we have to make
something of that F

558
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:19,020
I'm but he's he's totally right I'm I

559
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:23,319
for points against if this one is the
most important for all of two on the

560
00:35:23,319 --> 00:35:24,099
road to Hell

561
00:35:24,099 --> 00:35:27,599
am way he said and done with the whole
thing

562
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,970
and he made a really good tom tall he
gave a talk on now

563
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:35,089
on con conference in in the states where
he

564
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:40,150
you know showed all his reasoning behind
why he thinks that stuff is broken so

565
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,220
let's have a look

566
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:44,599
at his main points so the one thing
that's

567
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:48,240
arm you know I'm really bothered him is

568
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,300
that he became the huge specification
yet it started as a really

569
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:56,339
like a concise piece of paper holding
his hand shakes

570
00:35:56,339 --> 00:35:59,859
yeah and its most actually call at some
point

571
00:35:59,859 --> 00:36:03,280
that authorization protocol any turn to

572
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,230
and authorization framework why

573
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:10,349
because if you search for the word out
of scope

574
00:36:10,349 --> 00:36:13,869
in the specification of at the
discretion of the implement a

575
00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:17,220
then you'll see why yeah many many
shoots

576
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,460
and mace if you're expecting for you
know what that means

577
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:24,819
lot of interpretation space

578
00:36:24,819 --> 00:36:30,440
and set um in between there all the
companies have Microsoft Google Facebook

579
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,339
Yahoo or did all sitting there had good
ideas how to improve to fame

580
00:36:34,339 --> 00:36:38,910
and it just left that okay mid-on let
event finished a hard work

581
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:41,960
as I said in the end might have had a
guy to

582
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,530
sign of the last the last revision

583
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:48,720
so actually when you're looking at the
whole of

584
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,800
authorization framework family

585
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:58,510
it's quiet interest these are the specs
you have to read

586
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:03,060
so this thing was meant to make things
easy

587
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:06,849
s like a counter reaction to w ith stop
what damages Dexter

588
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:10,220
as many college yeah I'm so there are
diff

589
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:14,200
call of proposals like tough or
framework

590
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,700
barreto can use this to think that no
anyone has read yet

591
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,180
the fret model which actually quite
interesting document to and enter all

592
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,470
the satellite specifications around it

593
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:27,710
now so for example to talk and type C A
so distinct is about

594
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:31,710
transporting tokens talking to
unspecified

595
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:35,380
yeah so it baby everybody came up with
it on talkin

596
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:39,430
implementation and we all know that
implementing sumitomo is not

597
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:43,730
an easy thing to do so long there is
another specification Polytechnic

598
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:44,410
talking bitch

599
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:47,839
is encryption think equanimity not done
yet by the way

600
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:51,359
in their own nothing stayed they
basically pushed

601
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,690
too late updates like arm mom

602
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,790
family to talking revocation make tokens

603
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:01,900
very important but in the second their
own even more

604
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:05,170
esoteric once we just in the US like a
how do we

605
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:09,619
I'm register clients how do you with us
give consent

606
00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:13,490
chaining of recisions us meta-data

607
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:16,760
lots of stuff and as I said hoops

608
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:21,170
up office is not a lot of indicated
authorizations if you want of indication

609
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:21,790
at this thing called

610
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:26,080
Open ID connect he sits on top of that
and just has 12 Fyfe

611
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,790
aight thanks to read in addition so

612
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:33,880
that is one point where I think we baby
can do better we need some good basic

613
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,839
profile

614
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:38,150
that talks about the simple use cases
and not you and you may do this and you

615
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,359
should do that and

616
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,910
you know and the total scope have

617
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:46,490
um the next big big point of criticism
here is

618
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,690
Bharat opens 30 only talk untie

619
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:53,510
talkin you know arm type of talking to
be specified so-called

620
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:56,670
their own tokens there a token SME's

621
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:00,099
that basically you sent the token
alongside the request

622
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:03,960
and if someone can steal the Tolkien by
eavesdropping your connection

623
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,150
he can make his all requests
impersonating you

624
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,630
because there's nothing that binds the
talking to the request

625
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:13,940
deafness signature for example dead you
know arm

626
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:17,140
I am to be implementation would be to
encrypt the token

627
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:22,599
who dis session key inside a token used
at 72 signed a if you request

628
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:26,369
so we'll be country play this thing
anymore isn't specified

629
00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:31,599
it was too hot now the barrel tokens
party only a

630
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,410
way it is in the spec right now how to
transport tokens

631
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:38,770
okay which means which comes back to
point

632
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:43,290
only line of defense is as

633
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:48,380
the only line of defense so

634
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,569
how to develop a series

635
00:39:51,569 --> 00:39:54,930
I ask that question he recently on
Google now

636
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:59,089
how to handle it as a validation error
and actually to response I suspect that

637
00:39:59,089 --> 00:40:02,780
was well an answer to that question
right

638
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:08,109
but that came back

639
00:40:08,109 --> 00:40:11,560
yes odor the main on some developers get
on in that is how to

640
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,160
ignore SSL Certificates yes certificate
validation

641
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,710
us for every popular platform %ah

642
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:24,040
patchy net and civil so it worked at
these guys building is mobile

643
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,490
applications which don't have a clue
about security but the level of

644
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:30,740
and kind of protect access to our copies
of

645
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:34,030
on to other resources they have
basically learning on the internet how

646
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:34,600
to disable

647
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,799
sanitation meaning you're sitting with a
template for your laptop

648
00:40:37,799 --> 00:40:41,119
in at the airport of in in a hotel

649
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,069
and someone simply doesn't end the
middle attack and you don't realize the

650
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:44,720
cost

651
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,859
elevations of fortification

652
00:40:48,859 --> 00:40:52,690
now and as you can see I'm it's pretty
easy to do

653
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:57,740
now if in I S for example you just have
to catch exception E edition exceptional

654
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,560
something and shove

655
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,650
swallow it that's it

656
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:07,920
that's one part of the problem unified
is this

657
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,980
up

658
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:15,260
at mobile carriers these days

659
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,900
they have their own needs certificates
on the phone the branded phones

660
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:22,780
for D&D cryptographic and can do
optimization of it

661
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:26,400
like cashing a a.m.

662
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,640
compression stuff like that and that
means they first eclipse just tough

663
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,450
running for death for their machinery
and then included again

664
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:39,720
I'm and SEO Bharat opens

665
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,900
okay and obviously you know thats

666
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,140
that's a definite

667
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:50,270
what has to be /f security theater

668
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:54,339
as anyone noticed own security fielder

669
00:41:54,339 --> 00:41:58,839
was coined by Bruce Schneier after 9/11
for example ever

670
00:41:58,839 --> 00:42:02,700
like I mean up Petaling New York City
with

671
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,869
machine machine guns with no bullets in
it

672
00:42:05,869 --> 00:42:10,020
to make you feel secure just if you no
more terrorists come forward for for the

673
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,609
sky or something like that yeah

674
00:42:11,609 --> 00:42:15,549
and that's the security field I am
giving you the feeling of being secure

675
00:42:15,549 --> 00:42:19,040
and snow yet just yesterday here

676
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:25,790
the post that let's see if it still
online that's all security theater

677
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:32,790
from from bel sogno yeah am bank in the
states

678
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,390
last one of the best building secure
environment

679
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:43,970
I okay for today security feel like
giving someone the feeling he is secure

680
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:47,299
way might be

681
00:42:47,299 --> 00:42:50,720
good

682
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,440
so you know we talk about this disc
lined up the cations

683
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:59,640
yeah when they opened it I lots where
you seeking be slow in screen

684
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:03,210
strictly speaking to security fears
because no one can just tell you that

685
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:05,150
it's really can be with their showing
here

686
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:08,230
and Edina 23 trauma center: d DUI

687
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:11,730
and you try to get in India application
and not incumbents

688
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:15,010
website yeah arm they work

689
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:19,140
incidence of people that for like all of
its too hot for me

690
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:23,250
nets opened even exciting happen and
invisible overlay window

691
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:26,540
to capture keystrokes okay

692
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:31,609
and ended just have passwords and indeed
don't know anything

693
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,839
many people say that you know what we
could cost that much just chilling to

694
00:43:34,839 --> 00:43:35,400
growth

695
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,710
and not and added window back rose I
with at risk I and

696
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:44,560
certificate thing yeah if you believe
that is actually a prosecuting at

697
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,670
and properties of you know anybody
control something that looks like the

698
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:49,819
pros

699
00:43:49,819 --> 00:43:54,100
am so good you know even Microsoft have

700
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:57,990
putting so much effort to India into
native

701
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:02,560
if hap we've tease secure container us

702
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,920
separation low-key stroll separately
contain us

703
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,730
you know that's a good thing yeah for
develop

704
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:13,400
he does the right thing he doesn't have
to do with password but no one is

705
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,470
telling you that is that legitimate

706
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:19,869
this company trying to Twitter login
page

707
00:44:19,869 --> 00:44:23,790
now for it the real question is

708
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:28,170
can be secured line applications at all
didn't just make a statement of trust

709
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:31,060
before installing them

710
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:34,220
yeah so yeah that is what is commonly

711
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:37,660
convicted in the security field

712
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:40,760
I'm not saying it's a bad thing and just
saying it doesn't help

713
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,770
really distinguishing the bed between a
good apps

714
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:47,069
okay and obviously to hold act movement

715
00:44:47,069 --> 00:44:50,270
helps a little bit because we have to go
for the App Store and eight

716
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:54,540
you know validate applications arm at
least on I O S

717
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:57,990
and when does not include home

718
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:01,720
and and the interesting thing is some
which went wrong

719
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:06,500
arm is you know indian dude flow you
have to have to give them a call back

720
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,220
but it but it all comes back to
education

721
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:13,410
well 3s 1s up on the client now took to
get

722
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:17,330
exist if you request no you register
according to a ride

723
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:21,339
when you installed yet when you submit
the application to the store

724
00:45:21,339 --> 00:45:25,390
Apple has a registered you arrive for
you whenever that you or i gets involved

725
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:28,930
they involve your application okay

726
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:32,580
now it's it turned out that many people
just trying to overwrite

727
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:35,970
applications click your rice and it's
even notice it

728
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:40,339
yes maybe no one to talk comes back he
comes back enjoy education but in death

729
00:45:40,339 --> 00:45:44,510
and you know you can be sure that the
devil secures Facebook and Google into

730
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:46,390
one but two small aP's

731
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:50,560
they don't know about all care about so
in ventral

732
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,290
historic Android shows show the final

733
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:57,540
there's a conflict daredevil 2x match
the for the same

734
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:02,310
URL no one is you know your bank in one
shows the smiley

735
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:05,920
what would you click if to have you on
me yeah

736
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,220
um play its abilities

737
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:13,069
again moving to st. trust decision today
and you which

738
00:46:13,069 --> 00:46:17,450
order already rental authorities be

739
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:20,690
if the next thing that went wrong with
all of his

740
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:23,710
that people used for authentication and
I

741
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:26,790
pretty much made make clear that it's
authorization protocol

742
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:30,220
of indication for this is a totally
different things yeah

743
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:35,230
so some of education is a prerequisite
for

744
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:39,480
for authorization but it's not the same
thing and what people really want it

745
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:44,069
is have a sign in with Facebook button
and add as a people feel secure but they

746
00:46:44,069 --> 00:46:45,619
are basically signing into Facebook

747
00:46:45,619 --> 00:46:49,109
Nazi not giving in the password into
trying to catch

748
00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:53,339
I'll pretty quickly explain to you how
that works

749
00:46:53,339 --> 00:46:58,650
of indications of so basically did unity
is the issue voted today to the client

750
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:01,109
application you pick to sign in with
Facebook

751
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:06,390
arm up I now and then we go to a
Facebook page you see the facebook login

752
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:07,599
screen

753
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,750
on your feeling good because you busy
doing the right thing you don't give the

754
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:13,660
application depends you give it to
Facebook we already have a trust

755
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:18,819
relationship with and and especially
endpoint on Facebook or did you say

756
00:47:18,819 --> 00:47:22,230
info point that is a good thing that has
information about the first name last

757
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:23,839
name email address these

758
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:27,930
profile stuff so what they actually
requesting a token for

759
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:32,280
is for the user info and part okay baby
did a kind of

760
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:37,420
wrapping of indication thing into offer
a authorization

761
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:41,010
okay the menu click login they get back
a token

762
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:45,380
basically having a user ID and access
token for the user info and

763
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:49,080
what okay now okay cool

764
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:53,690
solved a reason must be authenticated
right because we get back is talkin

765
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:57,690
so we can use to using for Endpoint hair
used the token

766
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:00,960
and get back first name last name even
in death okay

767
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,880
for that's how it seemed every single
application to three feet above

768
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,700
indication

769
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,819
West the problem

770
00:48:09,819 --> 00:48:16,819
you

771
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:22,630
it's on Facebook in it yeah do you do
for info

772
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:26,490
belongs to Facebook now

773
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:32,220
okay for from there up

774
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:35,730
yes because he gets the next open for
you the info

775
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:38,890
which is up

776
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:43,160
one check absolutely

777
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:47,660
so the heck looks like this you sign
into a militia

778
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:50,690
at okay some app

779
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:55,089
that you know looks legitimate but isn't
and you doing the right thing right you

780
00:48:55,089 --> 00:48:56,330
don't give them the password

781
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:59,890
using the facebook login for you you to
Facebook

782
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:04,560
wanted to get back for this

783
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:09,410
of yes okay so now they get back a token

784
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:13,330
yeah is for you on youth in Flint point
so no date take dis

785
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:17,690
token and go to a legitimate at

786
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:22,410
and send it along baby when you to do
your vindication

787
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:26,330
and handshake on the request a
substitute

788
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,470
their token with your talkin

789
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:36,060
what does it mean %um personally

790
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:39,890
okay

791
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:42,499
that's how facebook login worked since a
I'm

792
00:49:42,499 --> 00:49:46,479
for a long time if nixon okay

793
00:49:46,479 --> 00:49:50,779
the answer is all of them authentication
protocol full stop

794
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:54,239
it's an offer as a spy novel to
authenticate you you have to open it to

795
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:54,819
connect

796
00:49:54,819 --> 00:49:58,209
which sits on top of all of which I D
aid additional specs after we

797
00:49:58,209 --> 00:50:01,839
okay yeah and everybody

798
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:06,359
open to connect my in my mind the most
robust implementation of open idea of

799
00:50:06,359 --> 00:50:06,680
this

800
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:10,559
is my Google right now arm and few to
see that here

801
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:14,609
to go with 10 points despite era 9fifty
over ninety credit certification be just

802
00:50:14,609 --> 00:50:15,130
called him

803
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:18,359
of now for people have to know

804
00:50:18,359 --> 00:50:22,109
very about but that that's a pretty good
in

805
00:50:22,109 --> 00:50:25,890
to finish do everything Facebook except

806
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:29,079
on the road to hell is this %uh
vindicated by Facebook a good one

807
00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:34,259
I'm hacking facebook often chrome or how
I feel X Facebook again

808
00:50:34,259 --> 00:50:38,229
arm the whole problems here where

809
00:50:38,229 --> 00:50:41,569
that s before of has it pretty

810
00:50:41,569 --> 00:50:45,640
peak attack surface you seemed issue to
restring this response time

811
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:48,789
redirect you arrive on these things to
be you can

812
00:50:48,789 --> 00:50:52,410
many too late all these parameters and
see what happens yet

813
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:55,719
so for example when you're basically
saying if you take a cold

814
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:59,469
you you just heat he paused and your
proxy and

815
00:50:59,469 --> 00:51:02,910
removed the code in turn into tokenism
you talkin comes back not to call

816
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:03,400
anymore

817
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:07,749
if the implementation is weak and you
just how does the talking from the broth

818
00:51:07,749 --> 00:51:11,459
okay of the redirect you are right

819
00:51:11,459 --> 00:51:14,609
I'm is the a comment tech vector so

820
00:51:14,609 --> 00:51:18,769
I'm who for example doesn't exact match
to beat me think sensible to talk back

821
00:51:18,769 --> 00:51:19,650
this year right

822
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:23,410
they make sure way to exact match with
tip the database record it for you

823
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:27,329
and if if they don't match they don't
don't give you talkin Facebook

824
00:51:27,329 --> 00:51:30,420
just checked the domain name okay

825
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:34,400
so you can use Facebook that
accomplished Happy Tree everything's

826
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,449
okay so what they found his disguise at
the fountain if

827
00:51:38,449 --> 00:51:42,019
Facebook page which had a cross-site
scripting when your ability

828
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:46,349
for dissent talking to that page which
in turn send it back to triumph

829
00:51:46,349 --> 00:51:51,249
and it's just you know spent people with
these fake facebook login links

830
00:51:51,249 --> 00:51:55,299
and talking connected okay

831
00:51:55,299 --> 00:51:58,660
so in other words I guess the my summary

832
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:02,039
up of itself is not about protocol

833
00:52:02,039 --> 00:52:05,579
but there are so many variations and
implementations

834
00:52:05,579 --> 00:52:09,819
very very bad we've seen so far okay

835
00:52:09,819 --> 00:52:14,239
and that is the problem because the big
guy started implementing it like

836
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:18,650
halfway through yep like in in revision
15 of 32

837
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:22,209
be made efforts to love implementation
Facebook and then didn't change it for

838
00:52:22,209 --> 00:52:25,900
fidelity reasons anymore in

839
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:29,759
revision 32 maybe day-in day-out many of
the problems but it was too late because

840
00:52:29,759 --> 00:52:30,349
the

841
00:52:30,349 --> 00:52:33,559
already up there now the next big thing
is

842
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:37,729
arm when you when you did W starr & soap
before you knew that stuff is

843
00:52:37,729 --> 00:52:38,509
complicated

844
00:52:38,509 --> 00:52:41,579
but the whole of spec gives you the
feeling

845
00:52:41,579 --> 00:52:44,940
old it's just you know polls indirect
and

846
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:48,829
okay so it's love we just had a feeling
here

847
00:52:48,829 --> 00:52:52,190
am people without security background

848
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:55,579
implementing security protocols and is a
recipe for disaster I guess

849
00:52:55,579 --> 00:53:00,170
um and the last things I guess just
stuff that is missing right now

850
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:03,339
and that is for one maastricht profile

851
00:53:03,339 --> 00:53:06,559
where there are no shoots and mace in
des ponts

852
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:09,709
you master this you must it is you must
do this and nothing else

853
00:53:09,709 --> 00:53:13,959
yeah and the last thing that's missing
is a real replacement for

854
00:53:13,959 --> 00:53:18,049
Bharat ok and so we can actually find
access tokens to requests

855
00:53:18,049 --> 00:53:21,529
and you know get rid of that a problem
you stopping and as

856
00:53:21,529 --> 00:53:25,130
validation us infrastructure

857
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:28,140
which decreased to less and the last

858
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:31,369
I'm article I wanna give you is which i
think is the best one

859
00:53:31,369 --> 00:53:35,279
written by team pray by the way to the
right of the x-mas this occasion

860
00:53:35,279 --> 00:53:38,930
on who works for Google now and he's the
guy that takes skill school with

861
00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:42,359
implementation and he is a very good and
balanced and realistic few

862
00:53:42,359 --> 00:53:45,930
what what works what doesn't work and
what you should do what you shouldn't do

863
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:50,959
and I think that's a a good read
summarized quest

864
00:53:50,959 --> 00:53:55,390
okay

865
00:53:55,390 --> 00:53:59,880
then yep

866
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:03,549
the kind with the brother in that case

867
00:54:03,549 --> 00:54:09,039
okay

868
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:10,529
and last worked with them
