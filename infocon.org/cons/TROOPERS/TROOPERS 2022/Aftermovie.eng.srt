2
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:18,420
all of the Troopers variables changed

3
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,580
got a new venue we got new people

4
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,799
running the show got new attendees

5
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,260
that was just amazing there was so much

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,480
Intel and it was it was great a

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,940
highlight on Troopers are definitely the

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,420
people I think Troopers is about

9
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,579
transforming a community into a kind of

10
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,280
family this is I guess what it's all

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,579
about we have a few egg jamsu to charity

12
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,780
it's a unique composition of Highly

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,460
technical people that want to learn new

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,340
stuff from people doing work on the edge

15
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,059
I was here in 2018 I really loved this

16
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:59,280
conference I'm super happy that I got to

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,280
come back two plus means for me to to

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,680
meet great people from all over the

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,000
world

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,680
Troopers was always special for me

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,600
because I meet new people which I didn't

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,299
know before the talks are great the

23
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,760
stuff that is around everything is great

24
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,560
of course every single conference has

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,920
its own highlights many highlights even

26
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,840
we have attendees from all over the

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,479
world every year

28
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,400
don't worry about bringing the people

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,520
with the expertise to talk about those

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,860
topics and then talk together about the

31
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,799
same topics as the talks yes it was

32
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,640
amazing because we loved the team spirit

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,360
of our company

34
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,460
is a great way to not only learn

35
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,700
something new but to spend time with

36
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,640
exciting and exciting challenges and

37
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,079
exciting people

38
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,939
this is something that we also want to

39
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,619
provide to the outside if you're trying

40
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,060
to figure out whether to go to Troopers

41
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,340
or not just go if you have the chance

42
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,540
just do it

43
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,220
the whole thing about Troopers is

44
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,740
sharing knowledge deep knowledge and

45
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,420
make sure that everybody else attending

46
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,399
gets that knowledge to use it on our own

47
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,760
for the best purpose they can think of

48
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,980
but the best thing is actually to get in

49
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,360
touch with all the people with the

50
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,220
speakers the the guys running around

51
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,200
thank you all for Troopers 22. see you

52
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,500
