1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,399
and now we're happy to hand over to

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,840
someone

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,160
who keynoted Troopers 12 like exactly 10

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,480
years ago

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,420
and he's a perfect match for the reunion

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,940
we're happy he's here please welcome

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,720
Professor Dr Gary McGraw

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:25,538
[Applause]

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,660
okay I'm not actually here Dr Professor

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,420
or whatever anymore because I am retired

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,200
so I'll take off this which I made in

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,020
Troopers 2012. uh there are things you

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,579
can make at this conference which is

14
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,980
really cool I only wear this every 10

15
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,680
years so I put it back away

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,579
and I'm retired and now this is what I'm

17
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:54,600
doing

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,239
but in the meantime uh let me tell you

19
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,079
where I come from so a long time ago I

20
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,239
wrote a bunch of books on software

21
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,760
security and so some of you may know me

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,220
as a software security person writing

23
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,960
building secure software and software

24
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,700
security and exploiting software and

25
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,140
exploiting online games and a whole

26
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,659
bunch of other stuff and everything I

27
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,180
tell you today is going to be informed

28
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,439
by that work over 25 years of doing that

29
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,240
software security work

30
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,060
I had a company called sigital which we

31
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,840
grew up to about 500 people uh the way

32
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,600
that we did our work was very similar to

33
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,700
the way these guys that run Troopers did

34
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,340
do their work uh so philosophically we

35
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,520
felt very very close to those guys and

36
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,460
we sold that company to synopsis in 2016

37
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,939
which is when I became a retired guy but

38
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,119
in addition to that I'm also a musician

39
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:53,119
and I live in a place called Virginia

40
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,380
anybody ever heard of that country road

41
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,939
song in here

42
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:58,860
shall we all sing it what do you think

43
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,960
Country Road

44
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,719
that's where I'm from I live in that

45
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,600
song right on the Shenandoah River

46
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,119
and sometimes I have big fires there

47
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,919
you're all invited to the next one every

48
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,660
solstice

49
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,239
later today at 5 30 I'm going to talk

50
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,160
about this machine learning security

51
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,140
stuff I'll try to work some into the

52
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,540
keynote this morning but what I've been

53
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,180
working on lately is what happens all

54
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,220
the time in security if you've been in

55
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,239
it for 30 years like me you see these

56
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,480
waves of new things that are happening

57
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,640
unbelievable hype like I remember when

58
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,420
these things didn't really exist

59
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,680
everybody didn't have one in their

60
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,599
pocket and all of us security people

61
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,739
were like wait wait wait wait oh

62
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:49,080
and that happens every time and now it's

63
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,060
happening with machine learning it's

64
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,560
time to go wait wait oh so we're ready

65
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,180
for that and we'll tell you I'll tell

66
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,159
you more about that this afternoon

67
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,739
what I want to do today though is meet

68
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,739
the challenge that I got from Michaela

69
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:08,340
which is uh involving time travel so

70
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,180
exactly 10 years ago at Troopers 2012 I

71
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,040
gave a talk and the talk was about

72
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,280
software security zombies the reason it

73
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,099
was zombies is because by that time in

74
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:23,099
2012 I had already given that talk 200

75
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:26,640
times and so you say the same thing and

76
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,239
yet the same thing still is right we

77
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,280
still have to repeat the obvious things

78
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,860
so I called them zombies it's like yes

79
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,000
pen testing alone is not enough and and

80
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,040
so you know I couldn't really go back to

81
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,760
the zombies they all really still exist

82
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,159
but I thought what if I learned in the

83
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,260
last 10 years since the last Troopers

84
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,480
that I can like bring to the table and

85
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,180
say hey guys we all got to work on this

86
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,439
together

87
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,900
and so what I did is I looked at all of

88
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,939
the big talks I gave in the last 10

89
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:04,379
years and I try to take one thing out of

90
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:05,879
each of those talks

91
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,159
now I added up all of the things in all

92
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,519
those talks and it was 41 things which

93
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,280
is a kind of cool number but 42 is a way

94
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,040
cooler number so I added a bonus one so

95
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,738
it would be 42 and I'm going to tell you

96
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:22,440
about just a few of those 42 things in

97
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,199
fact I'll show you all 42 but I'm only

98
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,300
going to tell you about one from each

99
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,160
blob so it's going to look something

100
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,360
like this

101
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,780
there are six software security zombies

102
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,060
the ones that I talked about in 2012

103
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,600
that still exist there are 10 design

104
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,540
flaws in software not bugs but flaws

105
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,720
there are seven common myths of software

106
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,979
security

107
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:54,060
there are four oh seven startup lessons

108
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,100
so I did this startup and grew it up to

109
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,500
500 people and I learned only seven

110
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,180
things I'm going to tell you one of

111
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,740
those there are four tribes of cisos if

112
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,259
you've ever seen csos they're the people

113
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:09,300
that gets fired when we have a security

114
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,440
problem

115
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,199
so don't be the guy before the guy is

116
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,060
the best advice I can give you

117
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,240
uh and then on top of that seven things

118
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,259
that I learned in my career in I.T so

119
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:24,539
I'm gonna pick one thing out of each of

120
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:26,759
those Globs which adds up to 42 and

121
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,240
that's where this talk is coming from

122
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,639
so the first thing we got to do is run

123
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,860
from the software security zombies here

124
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,560
they are and here is this the slide

125
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,300
remember when slides used to be like

126
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,979
smooshed like that

127
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:43,020
back in the old days and there's the

128
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,960
logo in low resolution

129
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,300
so here they are network security

130
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,240
doesn't work for software security the

131
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,400
more code you have the more bugs you

132
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,340
have you guys remember that you think we

133
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,680
have more code or less code now than we

134
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,560
had in 2012. anybody

135
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,280
more how about bugs more or less

136
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,500
more in fact now you throw a dart

137
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,060
anywhere you're gonna hit a bug

138
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,520
right we now know that you have to put

139
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,020
stuff in the software development life

140
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,060
cycle we now know that there are not

141
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,940
just bugs but architecture flaws we now

142
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,060
know that we can't just run negative

143
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,460
tests and declare something secure we

144
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,860
can just say ah at least we ran these

145
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,400
tests against it and uh the last one and

146
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,319
the most important one I want to tell

147
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:35,400
you now this is a zombie baby in 2012 we

148
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,560
were all thinking about how do I find

149
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,500
bugs in software how do I automate that

150
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,900
what about using static analysis is it

151
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,360
better to do Dynamic Black Box testing

152
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,240
should I do pen testing only how do I

153
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,740
find the bugs

154
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,919
you know and we forgot about the more

155
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,560
important thing which is once you find

156
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,860
it you better fix it otherwise all you

157
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,340
did is just say hey I got a problem I

158
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,740
have 10 000 problems

159
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,120
so we still have got work to do in

160
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,139
security

161
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,880
fixing things

162
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,060
I want to emphasize this the only way to

163
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,300
make a system secure any kind of system

164
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,940
but especially software is to think

165
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,240
about security before you start writing

166
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,699
the code not only at the design level

167
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:28,740
but also at the implementation level so

168
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,340
we have lots of work to do both

169
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,660
identifying problems but more

170
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,599
importantly designing things right and

171
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:39,180
fixing things when we find problems so

172
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,340
that is one of the most important things

173
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,680
and you got to ask yourself well which

174
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,900
one of the ten thousand bugs should I

175
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,400
fix first and that's a really good

176
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,699
question lots of work remains here so

177
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:52,560
anybody who thinks that we're done with

178
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,720
software security that we've built all

179
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,759
the tools that we need and now we just

180
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,400
have to turn cranks we still have to

181
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,160
figure out which bugs to fix and how to

182
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,440
fix them properly

183
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,620
more important than bugs though are

184
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,520
flaws and in fact these two categories

185
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,020
are something I've been trying to get

186
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,419
people to understand for about 20 years

187
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:18,960
it's very difficult because it's easy to

188
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,759
talk about bugs when you look at code

189
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,919
you can say oh look right there on line

190
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,979
42 I use the wrong system call and see

191
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:27,780
so I know that's going to lead to a

192
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,300
buffer overflow so I change that I use a

193
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,860
new system call

194
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,779
that's great that's pretty easy because

195
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,779
it's online whatever

196
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:39,240
4024 right there it is

197
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,260
finding a design flaw is much harder and

198
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,959
so you know I want to really emphasize

199
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,279
the fact that there are these two

200
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,800
categories of of things so here are some

201
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,860
a list of bugs these are common bugs

202
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,180
that I'm sure you've heard of before

203
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,300
race conditions and buffer overflows you

204
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,700
know unsafe system calls these are all

205
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,800
mostly C related here's a bunch of

206
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,899
architecture flaws like screwing up

207
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:06,600
crypto compartmentalizing incorrectly

208
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,800
you know so between bugs and flaws

209
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,980
a question for you what do you think the

210
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,959
division is if you had to divide it up

211
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,839
in percentages how many bugs versus how

212
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:20,880
many flaws anybody have a guess

213
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,279
yell something out anybody

214
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,000
80 20 80 which way

215
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,360
which way either way

216
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:36,060
80 bugs 20 flaws 80 flaws 20 bucks wrong

217
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,519
anybody else

218
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,839
what

219
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,420
50 50. are you a mathematician

220
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,820
that's a really good guess

221
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,100
that turns out to be right I've heard

222
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,560
all sorts of different guesses 90 10 you

223
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,839
know 10 90 some people usually say when

224
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,279
somebody says 80 20 and gets it wrong

225
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,560
they go how about 2080

226
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,019
but smart math guys go yeah 50 50 will

227
00:09:58,019 --> 00:09:59,279
just go right in the middle and we're

228
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,860
probably going to be close

229
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,420
it turns out 50 50 is right but my

230
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,000
favorite answer of all time many years

231
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,339
ago about 15 17 years ago I was giving

232
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:13,260
this talk at Qualcomm and I asked the

233
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:18,600
same question and somebody said 70 70.

234
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,720
and everybody moved away from that guy

235
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,019
like wow that guy can't really do meth

236
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:26,279
very well

237
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,140
but you know what

238
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,300
that guy might have been right there

239
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,640
were 20 percent more on either side that

240
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,940
we didn't even know about

241
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,240
[Laughter]

242
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,240
however the main point is this there are

243
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,839
design problems and we've got to fix the

244
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:45,600
design problems as much as we're fixing

245
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,420
the bugs we still got plenty of bugs to

246
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,140
go but we haven't even started on design

247
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,320
like how do you find design problems

248
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,660
well that's a good question nobody's

249
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,140
really sure

250
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,880
but one thing that we did was gather

251
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,519
together some practical some

252
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,200
practitioners in the IEEE to think about

253
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,540
flaws the same way we think about bugs I

254
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,100
gave them an assignment when they all

255
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,380
got together and we built a thing called

256
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,260
the center for secure design the idea

257
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,560
was bring some design flaws from your

258
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,200
own organization and we had people from

259
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,360
Google and we had people from Facebook

260
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,240
we had people from Qualcomm there were

261
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,519
lots of lots of people came and brought

262
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,160
flaws and I didn't even say here's what

263
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,140
a flaw looks like let's just find out

264
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,660
what people think they are and we all

265
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,880
dumped them out on the floor in front of

266
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,060
each other real ones and we started

267
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,459
sorting them out into piles

268
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:51,480
we over a few days identified 10 big

269
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,519
piles which are up here

270
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,540
uh and then we said look we could say

271
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:01,560
something like trust is a problem be

272
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,079
careful about trust or we could tell you

273
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,440
how to do it better how to avoid Flaws

274
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,079
by doing better design and that's what

275
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,760
we ended up doing in that piece of work

276
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,600
so these are 10 major flaws that have

277
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,000
been found in the world a lot that we

278
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,040
now know how to avoid and I'll give you

279
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,320
an example of one that's super important

280
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,720
it's about trust

281
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,600
make sure that all the data that you eat

282
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,639
come from a trusted place and if they

283
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:32,399
come from an untrusted place don't eat

284
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,399
it or at least wash it off before you

285
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,300
eat it

286
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,339
right

287
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,860
and assume that data are going to try to

288
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,720
do something bad so if you bring

289
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,300
something in from the outside put it in

290
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,440
a box

291
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,180
these are design problems that are

292
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,740
pretty obvious

293
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,620
so we have to worry about things like

294
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,220
Access Control policy enforcement

295
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,779
sensitive data and client code all of

296
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:00,019
these things are around trust as well

297
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:02,639
and and lead to problems I want to give

298
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,639
you an example of what happens when we

299
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:08,160
don't do this obvious thing for machine

300
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,480
learning

301
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,420
machine learning is about creating a

302
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,440
machine by taking data from the outside

303
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,920
and adjusting the code you know in real

304
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,279
time through a training process

305
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:25,440
changing the way the machine is wired up

306
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,320
over millions or sometimes billions of

307
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,639
Cycles to become the data

308
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,120
so the machine becomes the data that's

309
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,500
really interesting

310
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,320
now that means if you start with data

311
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,699
that are evil

312
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:43,740
what do you end up with

313
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,620
a machine that's evil

314
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,600
and we don't really want to build evil

315
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,120
machines do we no

316
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,740
those of you who do you're at the wrong

317
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,940
conference this is where we built the

318
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:58,019
good machines right so so uh we want to

319
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:00,420
make sure that the data that we use that

320
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,360
become the machine are properly

321
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,480
accounted for can't be poisoned we got

322
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,519
them from somebody we trust we at least

323
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,980
tried to clean things up more about that

324
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,339
later at 5 30. but I want to show you

325
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:17,399
that each one of these flaws which

326
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,380
account for half of the defects in

327
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,480
systems that we build

328
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,300
also applies to machine learning just as

329
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,399
well as it applies to software and

330
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,079
Hardware

331
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,959
speaking of software there are a whole

332
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,600
bunch of myths associated with software

333
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,519
security

334
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:38,940
and for RSA which is a big show filled

335
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,920
with more marketing people than actual

336
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,500
technology people I built this little

337
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,880
stupid list

338
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,160
because when you go to RSA you have to

339
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,000
do stupider things for the masses and so

340
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,240
here are seven myths that turn out to be

341
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,480
wrong like you can just have broken apps

342
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,639
as long as you have a firewall and your

343
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,639
perimeter is secure

344
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:06,480
no that's wrong you know all you need is

345
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,060
a tool just run the tool and your code

346
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,639
will magically become secure

347
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:14,519
no that's wrong

348
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:17,339
here's a hard one developers should do

349
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:19,860
it then we don't have to do it we'll let

350
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,839
the developers do it

351
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,060
have you seen the crap that developers

352
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,500
produce

353
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,740
if you're the security guy you can help

354
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,259
them they need to know how to think like

355
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:34,680
a security person remember developers

356
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,259
are the most optimistic people on the

357
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:39,420
whole planet we come to the developers

358
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,399
and we go okay we're going to build this

359
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,380
thing we're not really sure but it's

360
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,779
gonna fly to the moon and we got to put

361
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,459
some code on there to control the thing

362
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:49,620
flying to the moon and that means it has

363
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,940
to do a bunch of stuff we haven't

364
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,380
figured it out but can you write that

365
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,459
code

366
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:57,240
and the developers go sure

367
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,139
that is optimistic

368
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:03,120
optimistic people don't usually think

369
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,040
about bad

370
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,139
you know so I'll give you a really

371
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:08,699
simple example imagine you have a

372
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:09,959
program you're supposed to take in a

373
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:12,000
name you have to account for Germans so

374
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,699
you have really long name like maybe one

375
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:17,779
megabyte but then

376
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:22,579
it's Unicode dude so but then then you

377
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:24,959
somebody comes along and they put a

378
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,639
terabyte in there and I say to the

379
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,500
developer I'm going to put a terabyte in

380
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,720
the name field then what and the

381
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,000
developer says no no even German names

382
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,860
are less than a megabyte

383
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,120
hahaha

384
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,820
and you say yeah but what if I do put in

385
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,220
a terabyte why would anybody ever do

386
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,160
that no one would ever do that

387
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,380
I'm the bad person I do the bad thing on

388
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,660
purpose remember the part about people

389
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,579
rob banks they're not supposed to do

390
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:53,060
that but they do it anyway and they go

391
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:57,120
wow people rob banks that's bad

392
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,519
yeah imagine those people running your

393
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,959
code

394
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,720
so we can't leave it only up to

395
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,059
developers we have to teach them how we

396
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:06,959
think

397
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,000
and they have to teach us how to code

398
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,459
properly so we have something to learn

399
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:13,919
from both from each other

400
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,439
but of all of these missed I think my

401
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:19,140
favorite one is this

402
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,539
it is that if I build a system and it's

403
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:23,720
all done and I need to make it secure

404
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,480
then I just sprinkle on the magic fairy

405
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,199
dust

406
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,539
and it becomes secure

407
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:33,419
that is wrong

408
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:38,100
security is not a feature

409
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,940
security is a property of a system

410
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,120
just like safety and reliability all of

411
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,700
these illities security is one of those

412
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,539
so if our code is not Dependable it

413
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:54,480
can't be secure if it's not reliable it

414
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,740
can't be secure security is not a thing

415
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,020
and the main thing that you asked

416
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,760
developers when you say hey what do you

417
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,200
think security is they're going to go

418
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,440
SSL TLS something like that just Crypt

419
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,299
it up I don't know

420
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:11,520
that's what they think because you know

421
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,520
we talked about it too much in security

422
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,919
we didn't talk about the goal what the

423
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,919
goal is a property and so it's important

424
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,960
that we remind ourselves that all the

425
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,140
time

426
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:25,620
all right

427
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,780
so in addition to technical stuff which

428
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,900
I've worked on for many many years uh I

429
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,559
also ran a company that went from when I

430
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,799
joined it I was employee number 18 but I

431
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,840
was actually the seventh real employee

432
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,320
we used to count dogs and sometimes

433
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,080
goldfish to get the employee number up

434
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,179
back in the early days so I remember

435
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:51,240
that I joined as the seventh person and

436
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,700
when I left the company we had 500

437
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,700
people and now it's part of synopsis

438
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,200
which has 15

439
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,480
000 people something like that and the

440
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,880
security division has at least a

441
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,280
thousand so that's very very interesting

442
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,640
you know what happens when you build a

443
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,660
startup from zero all the way through we

444
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,460
all do all the jobs together that's

445
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,520
amoeba mode to uh oh we're gonna have to

446
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,440
sort of differentiate between some jobs

447
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,780
we shouldn't send that guy to sales

448
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,960
because he only talks about problems

449
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,260
we need to send that guy to engineering

450
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,419
and instead we we have the vision people

451
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,760
go to sales or whatever and then you get

452
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,740
bigger and pretty soon there's middle

453
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,380
management at about 150 or 200 and you

454
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,419
go we're not even sure what that guy

455
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:40,500
does

456
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,419
but he does a lot of it enough for a

457
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:43,799
full-time job I think if you take some

458
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,600
paper from here and you can you put it

459
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,620
over there

460
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,340
that's middle management

461
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,960
and remember middle management is mostly

462
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,000
about inertia because if you try try to

463
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,340
go too fast you have to slow down that's

464
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,860
what middle management for or if you try

465
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,960
to change direction wrong it also keeps

466
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,640
you from changing wrong so it's like

467
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,159
just an inertia machine but it's an

468
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:07,440
important inertia machine

469
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,360
so I learned some things while I was

470
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,039
building this company sigital up

471
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,559
together with a lot of other people and

472
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:15,960
here are the things the first thing is

473
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,059
don't forget to write stuff down and

474
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:18,919
think

475
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:21,840
turns out to be important build a

476
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,280
network of people

477
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,860
well I'm here at Troopers 2022

478
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,960
because I met people

479
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,900
2012 that were so great that we've

480
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,240
remained friends for a decade

481
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,940
so you can meet people here at this

482
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,159
conference that may be your friends in

483
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,679
10 years still and we'll all watch the

484
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:43,799
world grow and change together so as we

485
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:46,080
reboot this conference and get it back

486
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,360
on track after Corona thanks for your

487
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,059
help with that by the way you know don't

488
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:53,820
forget to do the networking part the

489
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,919
most important part of Troopers is not

490
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,659
the keynote the most important well

491
00:20:57,659 --> 00:21:00,000
maybe it is never mind

492
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,520
the most important part of Troopers is

493
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,640
the hall track or tonight at packet Wars

494
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,140
when everybody's had just a little too

495
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,700
much beer and you start talking about

496
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,960
real stuff

497
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,120
through your mask

498
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,780
right or you know outside having a

499
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,179
coffee so don't forget to do the hall

500
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:19,500
track

501
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,500
what is the categorical and period

502
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,299
imperative anybody know who Kant is in

503
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:26,220
here you mind you will count yeah I

504
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,760
think he was a German guy wasn't he

505
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,679
rule stickler

506
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,720
treat other people like you want to be

507
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,460
treated that's all it is very simple

508
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,100
thing now the one I'm going to emphasize

509
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,200
is calmness

510
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,440
I've watched some of this today in fact

511
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,299
I have a picture I wish I could show you

512
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:48,059
but I don't have time to show it right

513
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:48,900
now

514
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,280
but watching Flo and Michael working on

515
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,679
this conference with the five trillion

516
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,320
million things that happen it's like

517
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,780
they didn't change a few variables back

518
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,360
in the past for the last 15 years it was

519
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,980
just we'll change a couple variables

520
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,840
same venue we know how the wi-fi system

521
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,620
works that same stuff they changed all

522
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,679
of the variables every single one new

523
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,900
venue new place a lot of new people new

524
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,380
stuff a lot everything it is hard to put

525
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,600
on a conference that's this good so

526
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,780
let's give them a hand for being calm

527
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,860
while all of that happened

528
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,039
really super job

529
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:34,260
this is way harder than you think the

530
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,580
fact that I'm actually something's

531
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,320
coming out when I talk into this is a

532
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,100
thing

533
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,840
that's good

534
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,140
so how do you do that well in the face

535
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,080
of adversity you remain calm you don't

536
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,480
panic and when you're running a company

537
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,360
that comes to numbers and money too you

538
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,299
have to make payroll for 500 families

539
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:56,760
you can't screw that up it's a real

540
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,320
commitment to your people they have a

541
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,640
commitment to you you got a commitment

542
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,580
to them and one way to show that

543
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,559
commitment is to share the actual

544
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,260
results you say here's how much money we

545
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,840
made here's how we spin it here's you

546
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,059
know you have an open book these are

547
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:13,860
things that I think are important as you

548
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,960
build something up and that goes for

549
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,360
engineering too here's what we built so

550
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,220
far here are the problems here's our

551
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,140
productivity levels these are not

552
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,460
secrets

553
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,679
these are things we can use to build a

554
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,900
better organization so the more you

555
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,700
share information inside of your

556
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,380
organization the better off you're going

557
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,059
to be I think

558
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:35,940
and measurement is the key to that for

559
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,980
example there's this thing called ebitda

560
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,260
which I don't know what the German

561
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,380
equivalent is it may be ebita

562
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,260
but uh a lot of technical people never

563
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,659
even heard of that and it's about

564
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:50,460
earnings before interest tax

565
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,679
depreciation and amortization that's

566
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:55,200
what it stands for it's a bunch of just

567
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,840
blah blah blah blah blah from accounting

568
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,900
but really what it is is cash

569
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,380
so you just think cash and if you look

570
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,020
at where's the cash today then you have

571
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,820
a better idea about how your company is

572
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,400
running than if you don't and it's okay

573
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,460
to share that with everybody as long as

574
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,960
you're calm

575
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,140
if you go oh my God no cash

576
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,419
everyone's gonna quit

577
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:24,600
instead you have to say big hole step to

578
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,400
the left

579
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,640
good now keep going

580
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,500
so that's the sort of thing that you do

581
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,020
uh that that I learned over the years in

582
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,020
terms of running a company

583
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,760
the next thing I want to do is move up

584
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,559
even farther in the food chain and

585
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,799
security so there's some debate about

586
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:47,159
whether this word should be ciso or

587
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:48,480
sizzo

588
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,940
what do you think Germans which one is

589
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,200
it

590
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,240
yeah can't hear you

591
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,620
don't

592
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,380
see so

593
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,500
zizo that's like halfway between

594
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,500
flow that's not helpful

595
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,159
Bruce Potter from he thinks sizzo and he

596
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,179
is one I think ciso I don't know doesn't

597
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,700
really matter it's mainly the guy before

598
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,460
the guy as I said before

599
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,480
um

600
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,820
a lot of people here's what it stands

601
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:25,760
for chief impending sacrifice officer

602
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:30,900
here hold this good good see-so I mean

603
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,720
sizzo whatever

604
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,000
yeah because you have to stand on top of

605
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,100
the whole security pile it helps if

606
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,020
there is one otherwise you're just

607
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,820
standing in thin air waiting to fall

608
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:46,020
like the coyote in Road Runner foreign

609
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,500
here's the thing about csos there are

610
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,380
some they do some stuff

611
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,260
but the people who talk about what csos

612
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:58,080
do and write books about it they're not

613
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,799
csos they're just marketing people or

614
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:04,740
people from Gartner who don't know

615
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,880
anything

616
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,700
and so when I went to see find out what

617
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,520
cisos do I read all that stuff I was

618
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,559
like this is just garbage this is not

619
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:15,299
what they really do some of my friends

620
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:18,559
are those maybe I'll just ask those guys

621
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,740
what they actually do and write it down

622
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,779
now you may remember this thing called

623
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:27,179
the BCM which still exists that I talked

624
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:29,580
about in 2012. now it's quite a huge

625
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,340
thing for software security and the idea

626
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:36,240
between behind the CSO work and the bsim

627
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,059
was very much the same let's go out into

628
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:41,460
the world and find out what's actually

629
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,220
happening we'll gather some data we'll

630
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,500
look at the data and go we'll

631
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,320
reorganize it until we understand it and

632
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,059
then we'll say here's what we found out

633
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:54,539
by going into the real world and you

634
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:56,159
know looking at what happened so we did

635
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,580
that for csos it was hard first I called

636
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,100
up 25 of my friends that were actually

637
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,919
csos that were very good the CSO Bank of

638
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:07,080
America see so who's now the CEO of

639
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,480
Google was it Goldman Sachs at the time

640
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,940
and said guys doing this project they're

641
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,159
like we like that we love the Beast and

642
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,600
we would love to know what we're

643
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,220
supposed to do I want to know what that

644
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,380
guy's doing and that guy I said all

645
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,640
right I'll talk to all those guys and

646
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,260
we'll just put it all together

647
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,440
so we gathered all this data and we said

648
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,039
oh this is too hard usually the the

649
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,320
obvious answer just emerges out of the

650
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,059
data at least that's how my brain

651
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:34,320
usually works for this one it didn't

652
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,419
work so I talked to a guy named Brian

653
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:40,020
chess also a scientist who is now at a

654
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,240
Oracle oh God I don't know how a

655
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,299
scientist works there but so so uh he's

656
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:48,120
the ciso of the netsuite thing

657
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,100
um and he loves hard problems and I said

658
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,260
I have all this data and I can't figure

659
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,080
it out and he he said do you still have

660
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,260
lots of bourbon and I said yeah he goes

661
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,080
all right I'll fly to Virginia

662
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,520
and we'll sit in the guest house and

663
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,799
we'll just work this out and after four

664
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,720
days of Smashing the data we came up

665
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,659
with these four tribes four different

666
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:13,799
kinds of csos they go from good to not

667
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:17,480
so good at the bottom we have security

668
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,480
where we dump ten dollars or I guess

669
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,240
that's about 10 and a half Euros right

670
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,980
so 10.11 so so we dump in 10 euros into

671
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,779
security and they just cost us money

672
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:33,000
next year we might do 11 maybe we'll do

673
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,399
nine but it's just about how much money

674
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:37,740
we dump in the hole

675
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,919
that's the bottom at the top we have the

676
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,320
most important tribe that I want to tell

677
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,020
you about and that is people that are

678
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:49,320
real security People Like Us who can

679
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,200
also be a business person at the table

680
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,260
talking about profit and loss

681
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,779
talking about how they're enabling

682
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:00,720
everybody else to make more money

683
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,120
this doesn't say security division makes

684
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,640
money it's not really supposed to It's

685
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,679
supposed to help everybody else make

686
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,200
more money and if you're a CSO who

687
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,539
thinks about it that way I'm not here to

688
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:14,520
slow you down I'm here to speed you up

689
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,860
and make sure you don't fly off the edge

690
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,059
of the world

691
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:21,360
that's the way to do it

692
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,539
so these are people who know things like

693
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:26,580
I'll tell you a lesson that was very

694
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,559
interesting the U.S government was

695
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,260
beginning to think about doing some

696
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,220
standards and requirements for security

697
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:37,740
for businesses at the CSO level

698
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,399
and uh the NSA was involved in this and

699
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:44,640
the NSA was beginning to put some

700
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,500
information into the system and moving

701
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,179
the regulations in a certain direction

702
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:51,240
which was very interesting and my friend

703
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,820
Phil venables who's now the CEO CSO of

704
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,820
alphabet in on top of Google

705
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:00,360
said dang those NSA guys actually said

706
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,980
it in a British accent but let's pretend

707
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,620
during those interchange guys so so they

708
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,200
were going to impose some stuff and

709
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,940
instead of saying what are they going to

710
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,100
do he said I know I'll go get on the

711
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,380
board of the NSA

712
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,720
which is what he did that's getting in

713
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,399
front of the regulations

714
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,860
so you can either be a leader and an

715
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,840
enabler and get in front of the problems

716
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,000
or you can just follow and try to play

717
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,720
catch-up it's better to do that

718
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,820
um so that's another one of the things

719
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,799
out of the 42 things that I wanted to

720
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:33,360
share today

721
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,120
finally you know I started getting older

722
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:40,140
and so about the time I retired was uh

723
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,860
2019 right right before Corona actually

724
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,720
I started thinking about what I learned

725
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,820
over all these years not just technical

726
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,820
stuff like things about bugs and flaws

727
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,559
and buffer overflows from the early part

728
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,080
of the talk and not just business who uh

729
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,980
like the CSO stuff but life you know is

730
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,919
it good to be a technology person out in

731
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,899
the world for 21 years what do you learn

732
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:05,279
when you do that well these are the

733
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,559
things that I learned and I hung these

734
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:09,960
off of uh the work of two people that I

735
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,059
have a lot of respect for I think of

736
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:14,279
them as kind of people I'd like to be

737
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:15,179
like

738
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:18,059
and you know it would be lucky if I were

739
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:20,700
one is Frank Zappa anybody ever heard of

740
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,980
Frank Zappa in here oh if you it's okay

741
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,720
to clap for Frank

742
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,640
yes

743
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,820
and the other is a guy named TC Boyle

744
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:32,640
who writes he's an American novelist but

745
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,580
all of his books are published in German

746
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,580
too because his wife is German for I'll

747
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,880
be we call her and uh he's a really

748
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,320
interesting writer so if you haven't

749
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,080
read any stuff from Boyle read his stuff

750
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,860
So based on these two guys these are the

751
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,440
lessons that that I tried to write down

752
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,059
number one

753
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:56,539
you should actually give a

754
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:59,580
number two you have to give a every

755
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:03,120
day a lot the same you have to give the

756
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,240
same talk 500 times that's what you have

757
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,080
to do

758
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,100
number three don't forget to practice

759
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,220
I gotta tell you I've only given two

760
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,700
live talks since Corona only two and I

761
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,679
loved it because the energy comes back

762
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,659
to you I feel energy from you guys

763
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:24,179
paying attention and laughing and you

764
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:27,440
know booing let's hear you

765
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,419
that's so much energy

766
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:33,260
laughs

767
00:32:33,779 --> 00:32:36,600
it's hard to remember how to give a talk

768
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,880
when you're talking to a screen full of

769
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,460
eggs that have their video off

770
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,640
that sucks and people are like wow that

771
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,440
was a great talk you gave on zoom and

772
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,019
you go I wouldn't know I was

773
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:51,960
just sorry sitting in front of my screen

774
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,480
number four

775
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,340
sometimes you invent stuff that nobody

776
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,980
else invented and everyone's gonna tell

777
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,440
you you can't do that

778
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,640
you know what you tell them

779
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:09,120
can so okay to do original things it

780
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,700
turns out that security in my view is

781
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,340
about design and software problems it's

782
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,380
not about Network packets

783
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,480
you know the network package stuff

784
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,200
that's all written in software you want

785
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,760
to see some screwed up stuff like I

786
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,279
don't know IPv6

787
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,919
just look at the design

788
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:31,080
number five we already talked about be

789
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,519
calm

790
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:34,740
number six is coming up soon and number

791
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,080
seven know your audience interesting to

792
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,460
try to remember what the Troopers

793
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,140
audience is like but this is a great

794
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,940
audience it's fun to fun to talk to you

795
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,840
guys

796
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:47,460
[Applause]

797
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,279
the coolest thing about Troopers is the

798
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:53,880
give back thing give back you know that

799
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,059
part about the charity well instead of

800
00:33:57,059 --> 00:33:59,940
giving speakers money to give a talk

801
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,260
which is what the rest of the world

802
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,659
usually does the way it worked is

803
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:06,480
Troopers 12 they said hey we'll give

804
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,460
fifteen hundred dollars to your favorite

805
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,659
charity

806
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:11,579
which is you know a real chunk of change

807
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:14,159
that's pretty cool so what I said was

808
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,899
I'm going to put that into this thing

809
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:19,079
called Kiva that does Micro loans and I

810
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:21,899
started using Kiva with a little tiny

811
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:24,719
seed from Troopers of fifteen hundred

812
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,239
dollars eventually that became six

813
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,260
thousand

814
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:31,079
which got put in but the first 1500 came

815
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:33,179
from Troopers and the idea came from

816
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:35,699
Troopers so thank you for that and to

817
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:38,399
date that money has turned itself into

818
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:39,899
forty five thousand eight hundred

819
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:42,599
dollars because of Troopers

820
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:45,540
micro loans to people who do capitalism

821
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:48,060
at a tiny little scale which I think is

822
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,339
okay I don't really like surveillance

823
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:52,800
capitalism much but I do kind of like

824
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,560
capitalism and so if we can help people

825
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,720
that don't have any by giving them a

826
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,280
loan and then they pay it back over time

827
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,980
and it's only twenty five dollars it

828
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,619
changes their lives that's what Kiva

829
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:06,839
does so we want to change lives that way

830
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:10,140
thanks Troopers for the seed that's what

831
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,220
it became

832
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,660
you can do that too

833
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,720
thank you

834
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,700
thanks do it here give back it doesn't

835
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,800
have to be money if you learn something

836
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,960
share what you learned with others don't

837
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,780
hoard it don't try to be the best try to

838
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,300
be the guy who tells everybody how to do

839
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,660
that remember we are all monkeys this is

840
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,300
from Boyle on this planet together we're

841
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,400
the same monkeys

842
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,099
and some monkeys wear ties and stuff

843
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:43,020
they think they're better monkeys but

844
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,280
they're not

845
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,440
unless monkeys with no ties we're the

846
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,079
Good Monkeys but we're all monkeys right

847
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:53,000
so thanks for Troopers for that

848
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,420
so I've given you a fair chunk of uh of

849
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,760
stuff to to digest

850
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,800
um and I want to tell you that there are

851
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,380
kind of places to go look for each one

852
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,300
of these things that I talked about so I

853
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,420
pulled one lesson out of all those there

854
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,760
were 41 things in that list

855
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,320
the zombies

856
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,560
the center for secure design flaws the

857
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,940
seven myths of software security

858
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,099
including crypto fairy dust

859
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:22,560
stuff we learned about startup lessons

860
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,280
the CSO report the Zappa and Boyle talk

861
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,640
that I gave at shmukh Khan and finally

862
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,920
Kiva if you want to join in under the

863
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,200
Kiva thing you can do that too there are

864
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,780
the URLs for all that stuff check that

865
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,700
out at your leisure if you have any

866
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,859
trouble getting to that you can just get

867
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:45,780
in touch with me easily by this

868
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,440
so here's my contact information feel

869
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,480
free to pop me an email

870
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,839
hit me up on Twitter I care about this

871
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:57,420
field and what we're doing and I really

872
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,060
jumped at the opportunity to be back at

873
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:04,260
Troopers in 2022 so I will see you in

874
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:08,540
2032. have a good conference

875
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,339
Phil

876
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:22,619
thank you so much my pleasure good to

877
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:26,099
have you yeah so thank you Gary and even

878
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:28,940
though we are already out of schedule

879
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:31,079
of course we want to give you room for

880
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:33,720
for you for a few questions so if you

881
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,119
could maybe get a little more light uh

882
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:37,320
you want to do questions for the

883
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,660
audience yeah I would like you you need

884
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,400
your laptop for questions oh yeah I do

885
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,020
okay I don't actually know it you're

886
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,820
gonna look the answer up I'm gonna look

887
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:48,000
it up okay so even though I can't hardly

888
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,460
see you ah now it's getting better

889
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,500
oh but it's yeah there's some light so

890
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,160
uh do we have any questions to Gary

891
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,500
come on don't be shy yeah

892
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,900
come on come on we know we we haven't

893
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,540
meet people real people like real

894
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:09,000
meeting in person for quite a while but

895
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,700
try yeah yeah no no I thought

896
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,500
everybody's raising their hand on Zoom

897
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,480
that doesn't work yeah yeah yeah don't

898
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,339
don't hit the button raise the hand for

899
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:18,900
you

900
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,099
so

901
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:23,220
okay maybe maybe everyone is like oh

902
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,579
come on you ask a question I'm asking a

903
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:27,480
question

904
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,099
okay Flo do you have a question

905
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:42,320
and everybody has questions

906
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,760
turn on the other mic the roving mic hey

907
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,660
nope

908
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,579
it's supposed to be on here's the power

909
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:54,599
button okay I think that's a mess uh my

910
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:57,359
question is uh it's Ten Years After the

911
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:01,079
initial keynote is it better or now or

912
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:02,339
is it worse

913
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:04,400
what is it

914
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,200
Global pandemic's pretty bad yeah but

915
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,359
security by Design and stuff like this

916
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,280
yeah is it a progress or is it getting

917
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,160
better we've made an absolute

918
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,619
ton in software security so 10 years ago

919
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:19,380
when what's sometimes called application

920
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,960
security was very young we had to

921
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,640
convince people that it was a problem

922
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,700
now I think most people know

923
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,480
10 years ago well okay so I do think

924
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,640
we've made a lot of progress

925
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,280
um especially if you use the main metric

926
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,680
for security which is how much money did

927
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,740
we spend on it

928
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:42,780
that's always going up and so is the

929
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,839
problem it's a perfect correlation

930
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,480
I I'm I'm optimistic so I will tell you

931
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,320
this

932
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,900
after working in security for 25 years

933
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,880
or maybe more

934
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,460
um a lot of people get jaded and they

935
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,260
get negative and they think ah we'll

936
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,900
never solve any of these problems but I

937
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,579
actually am optimistic I think we've

938
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:04,140
made lots of progress I think we've

939
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,880
learned a bunch of things and we're

940
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,980
doing a better job with security than we

941
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,140
were 10 years ago so hopefully that

942
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:13,819
answers your question yep

943
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,740
somebody asked a hard question

944
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:20,099
so yeah another question I started the

945
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:22,140
fact because that's the longest way

946
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:27,140
there he goes flow's running away yes

947
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,420
I was just curious uh what is that it

948
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,740
was the 40 second thing that you've

949
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:35,160
learned what was the 42nd thing yes it

950
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,920
was uh all those details

951
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,400
this

952
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:45,540
that that's uh number 42.

953
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,160
can you raise your hands again please

954
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,099
because my memory is there was one

955
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:53,220
here at the front yeah wow this is fun

956
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,380
no it's not now the next one we want

957
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,240
wait hello

958
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,640
so uh what is the state of machine

959
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,680
learning and artificial intelligence and

960
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,940
security standpoint okay so I forgot to

961
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,240
plug my own talk so at 5 30 In This Very

962
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,400
Room I'm going to talk about what I've

963
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,079
been doing for the last three years in

964
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:14,640
machine learning and artificial

965
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,020
intelligence

966
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,400
um and it's going to be for people who

967
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,900
aren't really machine learning people

968
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,780
but who do know a lot about security so

969
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,300
you know I'll tell you the main thing

970
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,160
though for everybody here's what I

971
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,099
learned not much has changed in machine

972
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:32,099
learning in 20 years if you knew what

973
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:35,880
was going on a long time ago even in the

974
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,460
late 80s early 90s when I was working on

975
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:42,060
it actively as a grad student you'll be

976
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,280
surprised to find out that all the

977
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,720
things we're working on now with deep

978
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,460
neural networks for example and

979
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,980
convolutional learning all of these Auto

980
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,740
Associated predictive generators all of

981
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:55,079
these things are the same technology

982
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:58,260
that we had a long time ago what's

983
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:01,099
changed is computers are way way faster

984
00:42:01,099 --> 00:42:03,720
lots more Cycles laying around to do

985
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,200
stuff and data sets are immense way way

986
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,020
bigger so more data plus more Cycles

987
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,940
Plus the same old stuff from 20 years

988
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,460
ago means we've made a lot of progress

989
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:18,000
in machine learning but like normal the

990
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,859
people that are working on the edge are

991
00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:21,619
not thinking about security

992
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:24,000
they're thinking about how to make the

993
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,099
damn thing work like they're banging on

994
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:28,440
it and changing parameters and you know

995
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,300
even the people publishing papers they

996
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,760
say stuff like we set this parameter

997
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,220
empirically to six

998
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,619
and you know what that means is we

999
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:42,119
screwed around until six worked so six

1000
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:44,040
uh but that's the answer if you want to

1001
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,099
hear more about that 5 30 this room

1002
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:49,680
more questions this guy over here had

1003
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,060
one

1004
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:54,560
yeah yeah oh

1005
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,200
hi I'm Henrik and I would like to ask it

1006
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,720
seems that we have a growing

1007
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,400
interconnection of things and that's a

1008
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,480
bad thing because a lot of things

1009
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,400
getting interconnected it's not very

1010
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,440
secure yes do you think we will reach

1011
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,819
like a peak and then people will

1012
00:43:14,819 --> 00:43:17,099
understand that it's bad and it will go

1013
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:21,500
disconnect it in the future no

1014
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,040
foreign

1015
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:27,489
[Applause]

1016
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:31,380
let me add one more thing a long time

1017
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,960
ago I identified what I called the

1018
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,180
Trinity of trouble Trinity of trouble is

1019
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,160
what we wrote about in exploiting

1020
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,680
software gosh I think that was 2008

1021
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,920
maybe I can't remember uh and the three

1022
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,740
things one of them was that

1023
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,599
connectedness

1024
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:52,260
number two extensibility you know I made

1025
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,240
it a virtual machine so I can run code

1026
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,880
on top of it it's a turing machine now

1027
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,000
yep so we're not going to turn off any

1028
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,859
of those things it's like Pandora's Box

1029
00:44:01,859 --> 00:44:04,140
as soon as you open it

1030
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,060
out everything goes

1031
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,819
it's better to just say nine

1032
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:11,530
oh thank you so much for the first rule

1033
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:15,430
[Laughter]

1034
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:19,440
I was wondering that uh this

1035
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,359
centralization of of the all the

1036
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,859
software started running on the public

1037
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:24,780
Cloud uh

1038
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,900
what kind of an effects it has on on the

1039
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:28,700
security

1040
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,200
[Laughter]

1041
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,000
let me ask you the question this is the

1042
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,579
question that was asked 25 years ago so

1043
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:37,260
we have this old code that we were

1044
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:40,140
running on this rack and you know and we

1045
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:43,440
Rec for and and it's all very secure and

1046
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,819
stuff but now we're going to connect it

1047
00:44:44,819 --> 00:44:46,140
to the internet

1048
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,140
you think it's gonna be okay

1049
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:52,560
and the answer was no man you just

1050
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,940
connected it

1051
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,520
and now all we're saying is well the

1052
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,200
thing you connected it to instead of

1053
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,240
having that in your room it's in

1054
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,180
somebody else's room

1055
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:05,520
in fact you don't even own it they do

1056
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,700
oh so it's the same as the as connecting

1057
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,640
it to the net you know I really don't

1058
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,380
think there's very much difference in

1059
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,900
having your own on-prem cloud and having

1060
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,660
a public Cloud except for this the

1061
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:22,260
people who run the cloud at AWS and who

1062
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:25,980
run the cloud at digital uh Ocean or who

1063
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:29,579
run the cloud at Google are better I.T

1064
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:31,740
people than your I.T people they're

1065
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:34,260
better so they might configure it better

1066
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:37,079
but you still have to use it properly

1067
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:38,940
fair enough

1068
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:42,420
yeah remember a distributed system is a

1069
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,579
system in which a computer you didn't

1070
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:46,980
even know existed can screw up your

1071
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,319
whole day

1072
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:53,119
any more are we done what do you think

1073
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,900
three

1074
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:55,020
two

1075
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,220
[Music]

1076
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,540
one

1077
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,920
see you later thank you

1078
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:05,219
[Applause]
