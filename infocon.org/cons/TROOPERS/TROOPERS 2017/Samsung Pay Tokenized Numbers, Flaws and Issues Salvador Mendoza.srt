1
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:16,149
oh you're still intact try to my

2
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:19,090
pleasure to introduce sabado mendoza to

3
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:22,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">you he's one of the guys who came in</font>

4
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:25,689
food here<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the tfp those who have</font>

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:29,680
been a<font color="#E5E5E5"> true part probably know that some</font>

6
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:34,059
slots that we say a time<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lots in</font>

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:36,909
different ways from there was people

8
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:40,599
will reach out to there were some people

9
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:43,359
who know we were being a before and we

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,510
do we know they deliver and then there's

11
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:49,899
a fee fee and the fee fee usually that's

12
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:54,010
a very very tough competition so it's

13
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:56,379
not many slot left and this year we had

14
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:59,530
like overall before poly number

15
00:00:56,379 --> 00:01:04,209
correctly 950 submissions or so for

16
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:06,190
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 slots and he is one of them who</font>

17
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:10,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">made</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it into four for a similar reason</font>

18
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:13,420
when we when we saw the submission I

19
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,850
mean he provided good material who have

20
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,670
certain stuff but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

21
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:21,789
is from what we see now has most basis

22
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:24,550
is a very very relevant topic which is

23
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:28,030
logically in this track as we know that

24
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:31,420
suddenly some of you guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> general</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

25
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:34,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">about this type of technology to use it</font>

26
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:37,000
in some type of product so very happy to

27
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,800
have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> here thank you thank you again</font>

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,920
very excited to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> here in troopers we</font>

29
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,420
part the anniversary so my<font color="#E5E5E5"> name is</font>

30
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">Robert Mendoza and I'm going to talk</font>

31
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,890
about Sam's up a token<font color="#CCCCCC"> his numbers class</font>

32
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:51,539
on issues maybe you are asking

33
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,540
yourselves who is salvadore<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mendoza</font>

34
00:01:53,650 --> 00:02:01,870
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm in security researcher I live in</font>

35
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,610
California and I'm Mexican so we're in

36
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:05,770
California sends people to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Heidelberg</font>

37
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:11,380
take on some divest its and the bad

38
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:13,420
hombres so some terminology for this tag

39
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:16,540
is about a Pepsi for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Near Field</font>

40
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:19,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">Communication</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> MST for magnetic security</font>

41
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:21,070
admission so basically how Samsung pay

42
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,410
would implements two protocols

43
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:24,459
simultaneously to make a purchase<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

44
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,590
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're going to make a</font>

45
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:29,800
payment we are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use these two</font>

46
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:32,260
protocols so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of these tubercles</font>

47
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:36,190
is that Samsung<font color="#CCCCCC"> fee can be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> accepted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

48
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:38,079
many terminals as possible VTS is the

49
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:40,150
visa talking service which are the rules

50
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,940
to make the tokenization process

51
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,100
tokenize numbers I'd surrogate values

52
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,920
which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking you need to see the</font>

53
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,810
surrogate values like an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITN a database</font>

54
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,989
which relates the primary account number

55
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:55,690
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> token is about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that you can use</font>

56
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:58,630
her for it for one transaction gets one

57
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:01,900
transaction<font color="#E5E5E5"> TSP is talking service</font>

58
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:03,609
provider tokens are a spoiler it played

59
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,830
like a main role in this technician

60
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,810
process because is like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a third party</font>

61
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,580
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system and the payment network</font>

62
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,130
so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example when you're going to make</font>

63
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">a payment this token go to the payment</font>

64
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:16,630
network on the token sorry spoiler check

65
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:18,610
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's valley and after that</font>

66
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:22,870
he validated pramerica number and

67
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:24,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">passport to my account</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> number why does</font>

68
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:27,280
samsung pay basically is in your

69
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,980
application to make digital payments is

70
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,840
very similar to Apple pay or to android

71
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:35,170
pay but the main difference is the

72
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,500
protocol an executor mission but it's

73
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:40,988
likely what is ms t there must<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

74
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,790
magnetic film for example when you'll

75
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:46,120
get close to the terminal I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

76
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:47,859
a payment the samsung<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay it has a coil</font>

77
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,739
something similar to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the picture which</font>

78
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:53,890
is a maxxtow device and this coil is

79
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:55,870
going to send bit to the terminal and

80
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:59,559
tremana is going to take this bit like

81
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:00,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're swiping a car this thermal</font>

82
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">interplay interprets that</font>

83
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,350
electromagnetic waves like swiping a

84
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:07,100
physical card of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course this doesn't</font>

85
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,470
have any security and they won

86
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:14,120
secure mission protocol it gets one way

87
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:17,360
so let's analyze it took a nice number

88
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:21,620
for temple when you sleep your car you

89
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:24,320
car has three tracks and some subway

90
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:27,500
tokens it's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> similar they have the</font>

91
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,820
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> token and all the tracks why why</font>

92
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,820
they have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same talk and all the</font>

93
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:33,740
tracks the main<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is for example it</font>

94
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:36,050
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter which track the terminal</font>

95
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:39,200
detects if it takes anyone the

96
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:41,090
transaction<font color="#CCCCCC"> can go through so we have</font>

97
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,770
Centennial separators and also they

98
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:45,739
follow the American banking association

99
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:48,349
format so it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a normal credit card</font>

100
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:53,480
so I have my samsung play I need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

101
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:56,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">an example what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a talking so</font>

102
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:59,360
i have my critical reader here i have my

103
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:03,170
sense of it so you to see it sadly wet

104
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">samson tokens look like so that's</font>

105
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:10,070
octagonal concentrate for example if I

106
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:11,810
live it if I live the application send

107
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,969
it the talking for one minute is going

108
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:16,820
to say the same talking again and again

109
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:22,910
because it doesn't it doesn't recognize

110
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:25,930
when the terminal detects<font color="#CCCCCC"> a talkin so</font>

111
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,930
let's go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to</font>

112
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:35,139
so how the talking is they they play the

113
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,840
role the pain level at some point you go

114
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:40,240
devote<font color="#CCCCCC"> so for example a coffee shop now</font>

115
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,830
you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make a payment the when</font>

116
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,330
when they send the data to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> payment</font>

117
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,940
network extended talking but also it

118
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:48,758
sends data from the coffee shop in the

119
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,350
payment<font color="#E5E5E5"> network they are the TSP a token</font>

120
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,900
sorry spoiler should take the talking I

121
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:56,860
it relates the primary<font color="#CCCCCC"> comm number so it</font>

122
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:59,169
sends data to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bank and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you respond</font>

123
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:03,099
if the transaction can go through or

124
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:04,750
it's going to eat the crime so let's

125
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:08,289
analyze each track it doesn't matter

126
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:10,750
it's tribe 123 the same data the last

127
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:12,699
fruit 16 digits are the new virtual

128
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:16,090
credit card for example where you have a

129
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:18,820
car and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Samsung pay what the</font>

130
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:20,979
tokens are spoiled does is it creates a

131
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:22,659
new built or credit card is no one to be

132
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:24,070
the same day you physically car number

133
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to give you a new virtual</font>

134
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:28,509
credit card but the main point here is

135
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:31,449
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots 20 digits of this with</font>

136
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:32,949
rock record which are like counters you

137
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:35,590
need to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this one like counters</font>

138
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:37,750
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last part of the day of the talk</font>

139
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:41,560
and the other two idiots the fields four

140
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:43,360
digits of the new creation date delay

141
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,060
the next two<font color="#CCCCCC"> days at the service code</font>

142
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,919
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most important things here is</font>

143
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">like when you have a chip and pin</font>

144
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,880
protection court and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you added to Samson</font>

145
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">plate samsung pay is going to change the</font>

146
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:58,060

you the user doesn't have the necessity

148

to insert the car the<font color="#E5E5E5"> terminal the next</font>

151
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:14,139
four or five transactions the next one

00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:15,699
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the transaction ID this one it</font>

153
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:17,889
doesn't matter is the massage the

00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:19,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">transaction goes through or not is going</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to increment plus one in each</font>

156
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:27,909
transaction and the last three digits

157
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:30,490
are the random numbers one of the

158
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:33,580
pictures or one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the issues is the way</font>

159
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:35,560
that depends how you say is like the

160
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:40,570
users can make payments and offline mode

161
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:42,800
I for me it's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue for example he</font>

162
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:45,199
doesn't matter if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have like</font>

163
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,629
in airplane mode or you have drawn with

164
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,509
the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can make payments using</font>

165
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:52,520
offline mode the main problem is like

166
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:54,680
the country in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle and the first</font>

167
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,900
paragraph is going to be constant if you

168
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,610
are an offline mode so the only thing

169
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,849
that is going to change our d id

170
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:04,400
transactions for example do 16 to 17 to

171
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:08,180
18 and the last three digits of the

172
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking when the cell phone connects to</font>

173
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,710
internet the counter in the middle is

174
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:15,889
going to change and it's going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

175
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:19,549
the process again I'm talk a little bit

176
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:23,180
about the angle like an old transactions

177
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:25,460
the the tokens<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some faces or status</font>

178
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:27,830
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to change depending how</font>

179
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:29,840
you're using the tokens for example if

180
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,029
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cell phone is not it's not annoying</font>

182
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:37,338
which means it<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs to request more</font>

183
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:39,079
data from the server and aptly connects

186
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:48,620
important one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them are the most</font>

187
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,860
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the provision target where</font>

use provision token ID and a picky

basically this is the format that<font color="#E5E5E5"> visa</font>

199
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:26,329
things samsung pay said is they never

200
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:28,189
store any kind of physical clicker<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

201
00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:30,589
the cell<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone but that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean</font>

202
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:33,949
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they stored data from the customers</font>

203
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:35,990
I found the code when I was reversing it

204
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:38,719
that they have many structure of the

205
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:41,720
databases and so important information

206
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">on like certificates connection to</font>

207
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,820
servers but also the status of the

208
00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:49,310
tokens when the directories and files I

209
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:52,579
found that they save a lot information

210
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:54,890
and the EFS folder which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one of the</font>

211
00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:55,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">more critical folders and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Android</font>

212
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,859
devices

213
00:09:55,939 --> 00:09:59,929
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is how we protect this</font>

214
00:09:57,859 --> 00:10:03,289
information for temple if a user can

215
00:09:59,929 --> 00:10:06,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">root the phone well they use a notch</font>

216
00:10:03,289 --> 00:10:09,470
umbrella the notes it's a layer of

217
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:11,749
protection when they can protect for

218
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:14,299
example the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Samson applications let's</font>

219
00:10:11,749 --> 00:10:16,759
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example this is a knob</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Slayer</font>

220
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:19,909
all application like Facebook Twitter

221
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:22,729
they are about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> layer but the Samsung</font>

222
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:24,949
applications are under this umbrella so

223
00:10:22,729 --> 00:10:28,099
for example let's say and user wants to

224
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:30,019
root the phone the system is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

225
00:10:28,099 --> 00:10:32,539
take that and you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

226
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:34,999
able to use some soup a again it's like

227
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:37,879
one of the protection they are using why

228
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:39,319
the idea is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like because they have a lot</font>

229
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:41,749
of information on<font color="#E5E5E5"> these kind of folders</font>

230
00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:46,488
they try to protect as much as possible

231
00:10:41,749 --> 00:10:47,989
using this kind of not layer also inside

232
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:51,499
of the Samsung pay they have a class

233
00:10:47,989 --> 00:10:53,059
from not dice a psycho checking the

234
00:10:51,499 --> 00:10:56,149
integrity of the cell phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> by its own</font>

235
00:10:53,059 --> 00:11:00,709
so let me take a look of the last

236
00:10:56,149 --> 00:11:02,539
database and SVP Jan encrypted let's see

237
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:04,728
one of the tables on the structure of

238
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:07,579
this table one of the fields very

239
00:11:04,729 --> 00:11:10,249
important is the provision talking ID on

240
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:13,608
the VPN<font color="#CCCCCC"> role MIT and the app / mighty I</font>

241
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:15,499
can relate these data how they are going

242
00:11:13,609 --> 00:11:19,399
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> update the status of the talking</font>

243
00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:21,169
maybe you're thinking this kind of very

244
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:24,079
good encryption how they have very good

245
00:11:21,169 --> 00:11:27,259
encryption<font color="#CCCCCC"> on these databases I found</font>

246
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,899
that they was using a study password and

247
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:33,169
one of the functions to protect

248
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:37,669
databases so it's really an encryption I

249
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:40,220
said substitution character that was

250
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:42,470
surprised me that it has not yet for one

251
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:46,519
method I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> for databases they use it</font>

252
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:47,869
for an organic metal for example to

253
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:51,470
connect to internet all that kind of

254
00:11:47,869 --> 00:11:56,089
stuff so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's very critical if someone</font>

255
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:58,939
can reverse this canal methods and they

256
00:11:56,089 --> 00:12:03,499
can get very important data from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Samsung</font>

257
00:11:58,939 --> 00:12:05,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">p some clothes on issues when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was able</font>

258
00:12:03,499 --> 00:12:09,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back up the database from Samson paid</font>

259
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:13,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wake up the SP database</font>

260
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,020
the SP device has a car table one of the

261
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:18,350
most important fields in this car table

262
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:20,300
was the token expiration date I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I figure</font>

263
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:22,580
out it was bank and the avira tried

that talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to steal life for example</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">let's say I asked him hey show me house</font>

270
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:43,640
on some big words I show me how Sam

271
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:45,530
Spade words he's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> making any purchase</font>

272
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:48,319
but he showed me how Santa p is working

273
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:50,540
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's generating one talking and that</font>

274

talking is going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a life even after</font>

275
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:55,010
he loved the phone because when<font color="#E5E5E5"> he opens</font>

276
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:57,079
the phone again or he hopes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> poppin</font>

thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> that someone intercept one of</font>

my tokens what about<font color="#E5E5E5"> I delete and add</font>

283
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:18,020
the same car again maybe we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:21,110
very random critical number but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

285
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:22,910
found was that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nets which were built</font>

00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:26,120
or credit<font color="#CCCCCC"> cards they are very similar</font>

287
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:31,310
they are not to my change using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> token service from framework so</font>

289
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:38,030
some attacks let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a little bit</font>

290
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,260
about the social engineering is the same

291
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,689
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

292
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:44,750
asking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> people like how something</font>

293
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:47,300
works and how we can exploit it I was

294
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:50,960
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a device that i can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

295
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:53,660
under my coat and asking someone like

296
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:57,050
the same thing House doesn't pay words i

297
00:13:53,660 --> 00:14:00,800
get a critical reader is more critical

298
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:03,650
reader so i create the<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking get to</font>

299
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,620
the token get to is a tool that you can

300
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:09,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">wear it under your coat you can use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

301
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,970
plus<font color="#CCCCCC"> people thousands of rewards and you</font>

302
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,880
detect it and you get the talking and

303
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:19,180
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at work let me</font>

304
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:19,180
show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a video so you guys want to see</font>

305
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:29,660
so I'm wearing the talking it in my left

306
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:33,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">hand and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start capturing the tokens</font>

307
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:37,160
what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> tool does it take the talking</font>

308
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:39,379
and it send it by email to attacker so

309
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:42,439
the attacker can get these tokens and

310
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:44,060
can use an older hardware to use it like

311
00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:46,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">Max coupe for example from Samy Kamkar</font>

312
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:49,219
you can see in the background they are

313
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:51,500
updating the talking to my email<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

314
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:55,279
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you Karthik tokens so now what</font>

315
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:59,209
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can update these tokens using</font>

316
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:01,370
maxvill these two is very simple and

317
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:03,439
it's very cheap you can use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

318
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:05,930
add it using<font color="#CCCCCC"> Arduino and I add the</font>

319
00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:08,469
talking I go to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Machine and I try to</font>

320
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,469
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a purchase</font>

321
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:18,370
I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the tokens for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about I</font>

322
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:21,550
call it the token and I wait for around

323
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:24,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">three hours so it's approximately like</font>

324
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:35,620
24 hours the process that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can have</font>

325
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:38,290
to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> these kind of purchases so after</font>

326
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:40,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was thinking what about something</font>

327
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:43,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">more automatically what about is an</font>

328
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,390
attacker can have like a boat's close to

329
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:49,870
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> terminal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and can jam the terminal and</font>

330
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:51,130
scheme that tokens what I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> without</font>

331
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:53,080
for example when you are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a</font>

332
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:56,500
payment the<font color="#E5E5E5"> terminal is an input mode</font>

333
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:59,590
but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you swipe the card the terminal</font>

334
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,660
is no more an input mode so what it was

335
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:04,060
what we're going to do is was I make

336
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:08,920
this device<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same signal with my med</font>

337
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:10,900
school and create like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a jammer so when</font>

338
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,270
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> close to the to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the terminal</font>

339
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:15,730
the schema is going to detect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the talk</font>

340
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:17,590
and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send it by email is</font>

341
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:20,350
the same process the main problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

342
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:22,360
was how i can connect the Raspberry to

343
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:27,670
the max<font color="#CCCCCC"> spoof to work together using</font>

344
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:33,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">eight pins from the raspberry so I</font>

345
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:36,490
designed<font color="#CCCCCC"> this boat it's kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of I try to</font>

346
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:39,250
do in this kind of size because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

347
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:42,700
see how would we have a coil which start

348
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:44,410
sending signals so the yam the terminal

349
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">that takes the tokens it's a paladin</font>

350
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:49,930
format but is no valid monetarily but

351
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:51,730
the schemer can detect sound some<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pig</font>

352
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:55,510
tokens when people get<font color="#E5E5E5"> close to a</font>

353
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:59,080
terminal let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me show you a video hi</font>

354
00:16:55,510 --> 00:17:04,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">wards so this video was recording</font>

355
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:07,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">various so I found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this can a</font>

356
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:09,880
cooh-terminal I put my<font color="#E5E5E5"> schemer and</font>

357
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,490
jammer close to a terminal and it starts

358
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:15,370
sending tokens and the terminal is too

359
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:17,349
busy<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to validate stockin's when a</font>

360
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:20,260
person get close to a terminal the

361
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:22,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">trainer is is no more an Incan mode but</font>

362
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:24,849
the talk and I extending is going to be

363
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:26,448
detected<font color="#CCCCCC"> by my skimmer and it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

364
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:29,209
send by email<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

365
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:32,059
use it with Max<font color="#E5E5E5"> poof very similar to an</font>

366
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:35,240
air attack the last part this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

367
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:39,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mexico is little bit different but it's</font>

368
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:42,230
the same idea so the main problem here

369
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:47,469
is like the talking is not disposal

370
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:47,470
after the cell phone is lock for example

371
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:08,870
so what about international<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense of big</font>

372
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:10,070
tokens<font color="#E5E5E5"> I taw the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> foot simple when you go</font>

373
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:12,469
to another country for example when I

374
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:14,360
have to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> here to Germany I had to</font>

375
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:15,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">call my bank to let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

376
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,810
was going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be here so I can use my</font>

377
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:20,810
credit card numbers oh my credit cards

378
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:23,810
so I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe the talking's</font>

379
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:26,120
they're going to do the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to</font>

380
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:28,639
call the bank to use this kind of tokens

381
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">in our country what I found interesting</font>

382
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,100
was i send one of my talking to one of

383
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:36,830
my friends in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mexico</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I told him a</font>

384
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:40,340
what about you try to make it purchase

385
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:43,100
in Mexico you seen Samson paid in this

386
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:45,620
case i sent the talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they use mac</font>

387
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:48,800
spoof an order<font color="#CCCCCC"> mexico to make it</font>

388
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:51,709
purchase and he's trying me to charge 20

389
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:55,879
metric and business but townsend pay is

390
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:59,540
not in Mexico yet so I was assumed that

391
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:04,250
this transaction wasn't go through but

392
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:09,230
it won't even he falsification I sign

393
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:10,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">true so the transaction went through and</font>

394
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:15,740
I got a notification sound something

395
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:18,550
that someone charged me 20 mexican pesos

396
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,550
and medical

397
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:34,630
so another issue it was what<font color="#CCCCCC"> about if i</font>

398
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:37,090
can make a tool that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can attack a</font>

399
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:38,770
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> real time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is in one</font>

400
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:42,220
terminal and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm in the north terminal</font>

401
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:44,470
close to him<font color="#CCCCCC"> ought to hear and what</font>

402
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">she's making the purchase i can get the</font>

403
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:51,330
talking and rapidly i can use in our

404
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:51,330
terminal so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> designed these two</font>

405
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:58,809
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I she got a notification</font>

406
00:22:55,509 --> 00:23:01,090
that I make a purchase while she was

407
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:02,710
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a purchase using the same</font>

408
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:05,699
talking that he was using that should

409
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,700
she was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

410
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:16,570
so now we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about the MST the</font>

411
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:18,130
magnetosphere<font color="#E5E5E5"> transition program so</font>

412
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:20,080
let's talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> near field</font>

413
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,880
communication protocol the near field

414
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,760
communication protocol by default is

415
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,350
more secure that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea even you</font>

416
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,660
twisted a little bit it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

417
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:30,549
commercial gear but I think it sounds

418
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:35,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">and play twisted a little more than that</font>

419
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:38,530
so how sons of implements to different

420
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:40,750
doctors per transaction I was wondering

421
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:42,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">that tangent paid it was going to use</font>

422
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:46,390
the same token for MST at the same token

423
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:48,280
for NFC but what I found was that they

424
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:51,970
used two different tokens for get one

425
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:53,620
transaction so for temple for magnetic

426
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:57,970
security transmission protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> they use</font>

427
00:23:53,620 --> 00:24:00,520
the 216 using the service code 101 for

428
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:04,059
NFC they used to one and the tidy

429
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:06,460
transaction is 217 which was very

430
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:09,790
interesting I said what about yeah use

431
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:11,559
that talking the NFC talkin I try to

432
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:16,360
make it purchase and another application

433
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:21,160
by the pound this couldn't be possible

434
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:23,649
because why by the power they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

435
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,120
secure element and then FC which means

436
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:28,150
when you are going to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a purchase</font>

437
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,739
with NFC you have cost a terminal I make

438
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:32,080
the connection and the connection

439
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:33,669
connects to the secure element and they

440
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:37,000
interchange the key programs and the

441
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:40,480
counters so they updated but what I

442
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,960
found was that the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> side it's</font>

443
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,720
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> Samson</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Playworks I think they</font>

444
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:50,860
didn't have any securement to make the

445
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:53,559
transactions but in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the log of the</font>

446
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:55,928
NFC tags I found that they use a

447
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:59,649
kilogram but it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> working correctly</font>

448
00:24:55,929 --> 00:25:01,900
the blue is the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second power</font>

449
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:04,419
of the track and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nets part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

450
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:08,140
crib program and after dicey the 9000

451
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:09,549
which means it's a successful

452
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:14,140
transaction which stirred full of

453
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:19,690
communication so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found was that</font>

454
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:22,029
it's possible to intercept NFC tags in

455
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:25,359
the temple

456
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:28,059
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> example I use MST first</font>

457
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:32,139
together talking for MST and after that

458
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:35,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">I gather talking for NFC using another</font>

459
00:25:32,139 --> 00:25:38,139
samsung device using a permit would call

460
00:25:35,739 --> 00:25:42,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">square card reader pro so I can get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

462
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:49,599
I took the the data from the track<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

463
00:25:45,249 --> 00:25:52,389
from the NFC and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> copied to to make the</font>

464
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:54,519
choice<font color="#CCCCCC"> for mac spoof but it's the</font>

465
00:25:52,389 --> 00:25:58,539
reducing<font color="#CCCCCC"> max book this time I'm using an</font>

466
00:25:54,519 --> 00:26:02,619
application for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android so you will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

467
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:04,989
the track to in a second in the last

468
00:26:02,619 --> 00:26:07,658
part of the of the lock you can see the

469
00:26:04,989 --> 00:26:12,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">track which you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use it to make</font>

470
00:26:07,659 --> 00:26:17,589
purchases after a while let me go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back a</font>

471
00:26:12,729 --> 00:26:21,070
little bit so I make these tokens using

472
00:26:17,589 --> 00:26:26,408
the same the same blog I create these

473
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:28,809
NFC tracks so why do was<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use another</font>

474
00:26:26,409 --> 00:26:35,769
application which call my<font color="#CCCCCC"> court</font>

475
00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:37,719
application and I added<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it so I save</font>

476
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:40,119
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the same track and i went</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

477
00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:42,700
machine<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a purchase using NFC in</font>

478
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:46,269
this case when it goes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the machine</font>

479
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:48,909
either takes the talkin just make it to

480
00:26:46,269 --> 00:26:51,460
action and the transaction<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

481
00:26:48,909 --> 00:26:55,349
transaction went through which was very

482
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:55,349
surprised for me because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was NFC</font>

483
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:04,229
after day I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the notification on</font>

484
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:13,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">sansom pray that I was making</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a purchase</font>

485
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:15,690
so what about<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting it talking when I</font>

486
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:18,750
was talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the time some guys they</font>

487
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:20,940
were very skeptical<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this kind of</font>

488
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:22,530
its kind of topic when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> told them that</font>

489
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:25,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's possible to get a talk and they say</font>

490
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:27,960
it's impossible because<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's say this</font>

491
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:30,750
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the video or they use in their</font>

492
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:36,570
website this kind of talking to

493
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:40,830
implement very random tokens that's what

494
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:44,370
I expect really<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's worth spec but</font>

495
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:46,678
let's say let's say I want to make a

496
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:49,139
lock I'm go to delete these tokens and

497
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:56,130
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to grab my son some play and</font>

498
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:59,190
let's try to capture some tokens to see

499
00:27:56,130 --> 00:28:01,200
how how they are related one to another

500
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:03,440
so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to capture around five</font>

501
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">cousins</font>

502
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:19,919
you can see there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no very random</font>

503
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:28,500
numbers I mean there are consecutive

504
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:31,170
numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> well you can see here is like we</font>

505
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:41,100
have let me put this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one in another</font>

506
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:42,660
format so you guys so we have the new

507
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,820
virtual critical numbers and we have

508
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:47,070
that talk in hard after that we have the

509
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:50,189
expiration<font color="#CCCCCC"> date we have the service code</font>

510
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:52,620
but also we have that bc see what we can

511
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:56,610
see that transaction ID is what it's

512
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:59,639
changing for the seats 47 48 49 and

513
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:01,679
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the random numbers let's try</font>

514
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:05,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get the net</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stockin as troopers</font>

515
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:10,170
giving number from 0 sin from 0 to 99 I

516
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:17,090
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 999 to try to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an epsilon</font>

517
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:17,090
give me number any number<font color="#CCCCCC"> given over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 9</font>

518
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:23,280
so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say we're going to be the</font>

519
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,130
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know there's going to be 51</font>

520
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:28,260
and for the transaction ID but the main

521
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:32,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea here is like to get the last three</font>

522
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:44,520
digit just impossible I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

523
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:47,460
198 so I told<font color="#CCCCCC"> him that what I found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

524
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:57,420
that is possible to basic talking from 0

525
00:29:47,460 --> 00:30:02,040
to 9 99 so how these sons of pipe it's

526
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:07,860
everything well they updated terms of

527
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:09,540
service they say you you cannot

528
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:11,850
interfere attempt to interfere<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

529
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:13,350
operation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Samson play also you might</font>

530
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:16,110
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> reverse engineered copy that</font>

531
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:20,580
compile<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and similar all the going</font>

532
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:23,189
tough day the idea was here is like the

533
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:27,870
implementation and the design by itself

534
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:29,820
is not correct it's impossible<font color="#E5E5E5"> III want</font>

535
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:34,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">say impossible it's very difficult to</font>

536
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:39,960
update this flaw because from the design

537
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:45,540
it's incorrect so I was like that and

538
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:47,640
after guy was like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

539
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:51,060
researchers I found very interesting

540
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:54,150
topics about Samson play from Asia these

541
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:57,929
guys were able to the tech talk and

542
00:30:54,150 --> 00:31:00,510
spawn 1.8 meters of distance they were

543
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:04,770
able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> skim tokens from 1.8 meters</font>

544
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:06,600
which is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very is a range it ranged</font>

545
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:11,670
very very long range for scheming

546
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:14,189
thousands but they have a this<font color="#E5E5E5"> channel</font>

547
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:16,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can see all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the videos that how</font>

548
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:20,190
they work with that they have like a big

549
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:22,050
coil connected to a jack how do so use

550
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:26,580
audio to detect these kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of signals</font>

551
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:28,790
very interesting so after all this

552
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,790
research

553
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:36,270
after much poop I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I decide these two</font>

554
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:40,170
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is called Sammy came from Samy</font>

555
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:42,870
Kamkar<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok this tool is for pen testing</font>

556
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:46,740
max I<font color="#E5E5E5"> information you can use it in</font>

557
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:49,679
raspberries the idea is like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

558
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:51,360
prepared tags on the display so you can

559
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:53,340
you don't have the necessity to connect

560
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,280
to any kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine or whatever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

561
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:59,129
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the very you can use a coil to</font>

562
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:02,460
send max I<font color="#E5E5E5"> information you can connect</font>

563
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:06,210
using bluetooth or what server and it's

564
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:09,720
very very<font color="#CCCCCC"> cheap where i'm using a five</font>

565
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:12,450
dollars raspberry pi so that's the main

566
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:16,020
idea so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i use this one all the</font>

567
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:18,720
time this from samsung pay of course you

568
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:22,020
gets put in and you are ready to use it

569
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:25,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">to make pictures or to test what I can I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">talkin they want to use everything is</font>

571
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:32,130
online it's an open source that people

572
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:33,330
want you they want they can send<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:35,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">print</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this kind of boards or</font>

574
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:39,449
whatever and they've course they can

575
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:40,800
update a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dekko for it some some</font>

576
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:42,030
takeaways from this tag is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

577
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,280
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> big has some levels of</font>

578
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:47,160
security but it's fact that could be

579
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,510
target for malicious attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> sunset we</font>

00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">have some limitations at the concession</font>

581
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:52,830
process which could have a customer

582
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:54,449
security and finally talking generally

583
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:58,379
by chance of a could be use another

584
00:32:54,450 --> 00:33:02,430
Cutler please you have any questions you

585
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:07,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">can ask me or you can contact me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to my</font>

586
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:09,920
phone from troopers well you can send an

587
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">email whatever</font>

588
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:25,259
yes thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for really twisting talk</font>

589
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:33,509
thank you what's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool it please</font>

590
00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:37,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">do you have any question afraid so</font>

591
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:38,549
basically it seems if the implementation

592
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:40,769
how some to paint cement text

593
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:44,759
organization process and everything

594
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:46,950
behind it seems horribly broken on<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort</font>

595
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:49,019
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like looking at MST it also sells</font>

596
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:52,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whore ability to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just broadcast</font>

597

your credit<font color="#CCCCCC"> catheter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the world do you</font>

598
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:56,519
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> like room for safe implementation</font>

599
00:33:54,779 --> 00:34:01,500
again so I see is of course possible

600
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:05,370
somehow but to implement MSC in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

601
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:09,418
way so kind of reducing the possibility

602
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:11,578
of being skin yes I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is the</font>

603
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:14,098
best idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this to use the MS state</font>

604
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:16,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology it's for temple when you're</font>

605
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:18,149
using your cell phone when you finished

606
00:34:16,109 --> 00:34:20,549
admitting or you<font color="#CCCCCC"> lock your phone all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

607
00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:22,980
talking have to get spy basically that's

608
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:26,010
one of the best or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy things that</font>

609
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:28,440
you can use of course they are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

610
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:31,379
be a range of the seconds where you're

611
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:34,319
transmitting but you you're like<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting</font>

612
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:35,909
rid of many American attacks but yeah

613
00:34:34,319 --> 00:34:38,609
basically you can do different things

614
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:40,589
one of them is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> inspire up tokens when</font>

615
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:41,969
you're you're finishing our you cause

616
00:34:40,589 --> 00:34:47,449
your phone or your<font color="#CCCCCC"> locket or whatever</font>

617
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:47,449
any questions

618
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:58,390
thanks for the talk can you talk a

619
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:02,560
little more about how you<font color="#CCCCCC"> jam the</font>

620
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:06,069
current<font color="#CCCCCC"> transactions sure let me go back</font>

621
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:13,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">a little bit so you can see the Yammer</font>

622
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:16,480
um let's say this picture are here under

623
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:20,049
and you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> right or left side</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

624
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,550
macbook max<font color="#E5E5E5"> loop he has a coil or did</font>

625
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:23,890
you originally they have a button on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

626
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:26,560
tell you when you click it you can

627
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:28,509
setting<font color="#CCCCCC"> out to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> terminal hi this this</font>

628
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:31,600
signal it's basically a credit card

629
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:33,910
number what I thought what i did was<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

630
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,710
connect instead of that button i connect

631
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:38,470
directly to the raspberry i use a peanut

632
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:44,440
I one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pins for a dry eye using a</font>

633
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:46,419
resistor 10k what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I start</font>

634
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:48,700
sending tokens every three seconds to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

635
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:50,440
terminal so the terminal is always busy

636
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:53,830
trying to capture these tokens and

637
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:57,190
trying to validate them using the max

638
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:58,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">wolf device in the same time I'm using a</font>

639
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:01,450
credit card or connect to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Redmond</font>

640
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:04,390
same raspberry detecting any and other

641
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:07,060
kind of critical numbers different than

642
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:09,250
the schemer I mean different on the

643
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:11,350
jammer when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get an order talking</font>

644
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:14,050
different than the jammer I send it by

645
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:15,490
email but basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> say a max cool</font>

646
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:18,880
device I used to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> butcher's</font>

647
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:20,770
connected to a raspberry and in a cycle

648
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,250
sending tokens like every<font color="#CCCCCC"> three or four</font>

649
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:25,870
seconds continuously until the terminal

650
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:28,090
is working and working are walking and

651
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:33,819
it is no more an input mode that's

652
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:37,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically how it works so basically if I</font>

653
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:40,400
am the victim and I approach

654
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:43,519
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> approach it with my device and I</font>

655
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:46,190
try to pay I will see that the terminal

656
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:49,250
is busy all the time right probably yes

657
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:50,869
yeah the idea is yeah yeah the idea the

658
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:56,660
terminal<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to be busy okay so</font>

659
00:36:50,869 --> 00:37:02,450
it's not it's not entirely spooked or

660
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:05,720
what I would know<font color="#CCCCCC"> something is wrong yes</font>

661
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:07,279
of course yes yes basically when a

662
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:09,828
person is in pain with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your phone at</font>

663
00:37:07,279 --> 00:37:11,869
that point they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> always ready with</font>

664
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:14,539
the point to make a payment even before

665
00:37:11,869 --> 00:37:16,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">you get to a terminal so when they get</font>

666
00:37:14,539 --> 00:37:18,890
close to turn out they always they are

667
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:21,169
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> the application very quickly so</font>

668
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:22,640
when you approach the terminal you will

669
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:25,130
see the display but you are already

670
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,319
sending the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the talking sometimes you</font>

671
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:30,500
will see and sometimes maybe you're

672
00:37:27,319 --> 00:37:33,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">already send each other via you will see</font>

673
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:36,890
under this part of the terminal<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so</font>

674
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:40,190
no I sonar attack that when you can

675
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:44,150
update or change the POS so that person

676
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:49,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that the POS is running normally</font>

677
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:54,829
but it's it's not and<font color="#CCCCCC"> one one more did</font>

678
00:37:49,819 --> 00:37:58,880
you try this<font color="#CCCCCC"> roach of what Sammy the</font>

679
00:37:54,829 --> 00:38:02,630
color weekly car allows the parent like

680
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:04,430
the hub with him when he recorded token

681
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:06,920
without telling them<font color="#CCCCCC"> than what he had</font>

682
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:12,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">dal tokens to use whenever you like to</font>

683
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:15,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">but I saw this talk in Def Con and 2015</font>

684
00:38:12,109 --> 00:38:17,089
14 i think is a carjacking<font color="#E5E5E5"> tak</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font>

685
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:20,539
there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was inspired that's why i</font>

686
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:24,470
get from samson fighting after the

687
00:38:20,539 --> 00:38:26,960
attack they make a distal call<font color="#E5E5E5"> roll jam</font>

688
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:30,919
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> world young what it does is like</font>

689
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:34,700
because 200 cigars what is connect to

690
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:39,170
that you say 20 basically what it does

691
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:41,450
is like 11<font color="#CCCCCC"> our radio is sending noise to</font>

692
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:44,960
one frequency very close where you open

693
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:47,960
your core which is close to form for 33

694
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:50,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">measures and another the another our</font>

695
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:54,560
radio frequency is that

696
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:56,599
in the new tokens but the main of the

697
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:00,980
main problem with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Simon research was</font>

698
00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:03,260
that every every new token let's say

699
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:07,579
mathematically is going to be greater

700
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:10,040
but you can use the last one and it

701
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:11,869
sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you can use the last one so</font>

702
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:14,089
does that mean the<font color="#CCCCCC"> main difference but</font>

703
00:39:11,869 --> 00:39:16,609
yeah i research about that too it's

704
00:39:14,089 --> 00:39:19,279
pretty cool stuff is no release because

705
00:39:16,609 --> 00:39:21,440
you know it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of dangerous but yeah</font>

706
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,569
we talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about i have a class with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him</font>

707
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:32,510
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of party frequent design</font>

708
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:34,400
los angeles yeah interesting hello if

709
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:40,280
you try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the token explode aight</font>

710
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:43,220
later no well I try by even work here so

711
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:48,140
