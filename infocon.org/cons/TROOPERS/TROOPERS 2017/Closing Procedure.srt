80
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,449
starting web writing in here apparently

81
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:32,910

82
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:34,080
person here here is yeah still the thing

83
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:36,060

87
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:48,180
networking and that's the top networking

88
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:50,250
guy is when it comes to Jesus and

89
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,550
networking so there was one<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy or girl</font>

90
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:57,630
or woman whatever who got 68 messages

95
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:18,659
phones trying to connect to our troopers

96
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,539
network but without having permission to

97
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:24,840
do that thats the statistics were the

98
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:27,900
phones came from so apparently like

99
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:30,570
nearly 400 from<font color="#CCCCCC"> germany and from a lot</font>

100
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,250
of other countries cause of the roaming

101
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:34,169
features who probably try to connect and

102
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:40,889
we had the best network at least in this

00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,740
of the hacker mouth it was very

159
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:23,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">comfortable to wear I felt like a</font>

160
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:26,500
magical hacking ninja princess and also

161
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:28,960
I had no was over here and like I said

162
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:31,090
I've heard multiple separate sources

163
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:37,060
tell me that he was on fire<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it was</font>

164
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:39,100
hilarious well speaking of this ring we

165
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:42,130
would like to share the origin so really

166
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:46,110
quickly forgotten the most important

167
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:46,110

00:09:53,519 --> 00:10:02,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">featured any troopers 2016 opening video</font>

170
00:09:57,749 --> 00:10:05,549
you can see here that the person that

171
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:08,160
bid on the ring spent quite a bit of

172
00:10:05,549 --> 00:10:12,209
money so it implies this person really

173
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,549
really wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it and we were</font>

00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:19,270
fishing expedition and original

208
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:21,370
originally the title<font color="#E5E5E5"> this challenge was</font>

dumped the Trump but we tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it</font>

210
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:27,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">a little bit more politically correct so</font>

we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> said you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know ambiguous bromance</font>

212
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:34,900
thing that we wanted to disrupt we had

213
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:38,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">six teams with eight combatants on each</font>

217
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:50,709
really packet master unfriendly name so

218
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:53,590
we were giving style points should get

219
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:56,980
some some perks of bonuses for that and

220
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:58,660
we went through you know that we this

221
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,430
year we did two battles instead of three

222
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:02,110
battles we had some technical issues

223
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:05,050
that once we got everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> online</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

224
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:08,290

225
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:12,189
be working and hopefully we had fun

226
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:15,640
there there are some honorable mentions

227
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:18,310
we didn't give points for Flair but the

228
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:21,040
first the the actual first people to

229
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:23,619
solve the first challenge where the

230
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,110
spectators so our our players actually

231
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:29,530
got off to a kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a rough start are</font>

232
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:31,510
those two guys out here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so let's</font>

233
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:33,880
hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for those guys because and they</font>

234
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,170
did a debrief much better than I or

235
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,880
Matthias could ever do it I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

236
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:40,270
gave me the debrief and all the proofs

237
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:43,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">in about 45 seconds so I think you have</font>

238
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:46,090
a future in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> sport but honorable</font>

239
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:48,460
mentioned here we had the aspect of this

240
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:50,450
so it was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> about fishing Trump to</font>

241
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:53,300
essentially get him to

242
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:55,580
click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a link that would lead him to</font>

243
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:59,060
some type of malware that would expose

244
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:02,330
his system and allow you to get the

245
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:05,209
evidence or the dump file to prove<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

246
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:07,400
he had the whistleblower assassinated

247
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:11,090
who was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to expose his bromance</font>

248
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:15,170
with his counterpart another country so

249
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:21,050
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really like this one because of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

250
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:23,360
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> felt this really understood</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

251
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:25,640
Donald because bike you know he<font color="#CCCCCC"> loved</font>

252
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,840
his<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter clown</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously if it</font>

253
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,270
was hacked he would<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to get it</font>

254
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:32,360
sorted out very quickly and then we had

255
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:36,710
this one very<font color="#E5E5E5"> official-looking with the</font>

256
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:38,420
logos and everything and and you got to

257
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:41,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">remember everybody was doing this at</font>

internet connections and then again

261
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:57,860
special special note to these guys who

262
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,680
brought their own printer and printed

263
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:02,780
all their proofs out in very packet

264
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:07,150
master friendly format even drunken

265
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:07,150

00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:19,269
did bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> a printer but gave me 200</font>

269
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:22,268
pages and did not have the right proof

270
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:24,519
