1
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:07,580
they're cool thanks yet so I welcome
hopefully all picked up with the option

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,190
out there

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:11,820
a great event for a good cause as he
mentioned

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,759
I try to give this talk at CCC with FX
we had to do a presentation

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,900
but I I'm currently in the air force in
our

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,210
in the intelligence community so I'll
really glad we ought to present this in

7
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,210
some for reform

8
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,480
but I think that actually makes it all
the more relevant so I hope to say

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,189
during this talk some things that anger
few people may beast

10
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,669
into debate 92 personal objection Draper
into a good debate

11
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:36,800
but as well as present a second side the
store at least my opinion

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,089
on to have a unique perspective I don't
speak for anybody but myself

13
00:00:41,089 --> 00:00:44,629
but I've lived in Germany for last three
years I work here

14
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:48,329
i'm happy as for the community I
consider myself a hacker but also work

15
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:49,570
in the US intelligence community

16
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,769
the air force so interesting the season
to stop

17
00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:56,730
my stance and when I think though that
is surprising tonight is that privacy is

18
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:57,969
great for security

19
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:01,640
that privacy is important for us so

20
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,370
hopefully what we to me adverse
reactions to this

21
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:10,040
so this is the or really talked to try
to keep me from going off on tangents

22
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,210
on I do have a built-in ramp part

23
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:17,570
saw grant a little bit on the stuff that
i've seen that's by

24
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:21,240
me uncomfortable for me in Germany
currently

25
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,030
I and some other things that I just that
bother me and all get into the privacy

26
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,390
for security argument

27
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:30,340
and enter my proposed solution sits on
the sea y aspect

28
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,509
I do work for the government but I
represent the government here is my own

29
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:34,159
opinions

30
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,100
and/or everything anybody else but
myself right so that's always fun

31
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,399
so background might by myself named
Robert Lee hi

32
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:44,820
US Air Force cyberspace operations
officer if the fax is here with me it

33
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,609
had to be drinking every time I say
cyber

34
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:51,630
I a PhD student not students guess I
should check my slides I

35
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,049
at King's College in London looking into
control systems cyber security

36
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,430
saying why basically it's not good for
anybody to be attacking critical

37
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,090
infrastructure

38
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,289
I and imagine lecture at Utica College

39
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:07,320
each individual friends XO I have
accepted by a season this is one of the

40
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,320
things I want their a first-rate so I
said all these things so what does that

41
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,450
mean to my perspective

42
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:15,440
all my accepted by aziz's one in the
military so

43
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,510
I like some sorta structure some sort of
hierarchy

44
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:23,700
at least I accept it by being there I
have some for desired under standing

45
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,500
rules and no

46
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,220
so wanna first questions that get out
there to preempt

47
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,920
is the discussion I love you know snow
and leaks information like that how do

48
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,140
you feel about it well

49
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,890
on I actually am saying privacy is
important but not coming on saying hey

50
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,680
everything that happens bring water for
hours

51
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,020
been approach is very wonderful but
actually don't have any problem with

52
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,170
these individuals either

53
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,620
I even though I like oaths even though I
don't support what was done

54
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,870
at least how was done and it is really
good value in the debate

55
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,720
i think is really good value for us to
learn from so that's an accepted by Aziz

56
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,160
another except by a tease for me is that
I have a view in appreciation

57
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,670
Intel missions to work in the US
intelligence community I would have to

58
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:07,020
completely get out if I did not agree
that there were some value their

59
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,450
I think targeted intelligence I is a
position that the state's take for some

60
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:15,410
aspect diplomacy it works targeted
intelligence doing cool things in the

61
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,320
intelligence community

62
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,540
there's some value to it right I'm not
trying to convince you

63
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,680
wouldn't do that specialist route and
the same I accepted biases

64
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,070
I also have I actually really like BFF

65
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,380
I and my view on AFF is probably
different

66
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:34,260
most I support the organization even
though I disagree with it

67
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,810
I think they present really good voice
in the community good counter

68
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,150
so I'm you know going tells me working
and things doing things that are great

69
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:41,790
and wonderful

70
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,160
I want to be countered I don't really
care if I agree or not

71
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,160
I think the secondary voice that is an
opposition voice generates good debate

72
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,820
good discussion and drive everyone in a
better direction to actually really do

73
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,540
appreciate

74
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,990
IFAB stance with the privacy leaks with
with

75
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,750
massive a little sack to disagree with
not them but nasa rather talk about

76
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,270
later

77
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,520
on but even when I don't agree with
their viewpoints are really appreciate

78
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,540
them as an organization

79
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,260
and then a PhD student as well as
teaching university

80
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,970
so I value sources and data points will
talk about this a little bit throughout

81
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:13,860
the talk but

82
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,959
in general I'm very biased towards that
I might appreciate

83
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:23,569
ballads sources more than normal
community one so my talks bottom line up

84
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:24,169
front just

85
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:27,719
for people that are I'm gonna lose or
what not it's simply saying

86
00:04:27,719 --> 00:04:31,300
the people involved in intelligence
community they're doing things he may or

87
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,110
may not agree with

88
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,629
I don't think they're bad people even
when I don't agree with non technical

89
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:37,300
leadership saying hey

90
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,199
from a national perspective not mess
with the US but in general

91
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,620
national perspective congress our
government leaders who ever even I think

92
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,110
they make wrong decisions I don't think
they're bad people

93
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,520
generally speaking an indigenous last
year no one wakes up the mornings and i

94
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,479
really wanna screw everyone over today

95
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,770
I don't be an ass today that's my job
well thats

96
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,129
usually now what happens there trying to
make the world a better place to try and

97
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:00,550
do something positive

98
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,990
so the first thing I would say through
my talk is

99
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,020
I think the people themselves are
probably good it's been pretty

100
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,169
uncomfortable for me since the leaks
working here in Germany

101
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:13,400
go up in uniform it's been a very
different

102
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,699
stance with the public than it used to
be I really love living in Germany but

103
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:18,629
I've gotten a lot

104
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:22,499
for a backlash for being a military
member here I go now in uniform

105
00:05:22,499 --> 00:05:23,219
somewhere

106
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:26,800
and looked at differently or people
approach me differently or been told

107
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,909
number times that I should get out the
country

108
00:05:28,909 --> 00:05:32,499
like its aid I am huge priority
supporter but just by virtue of being

109
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:33,520
the military

110
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,210
not even you know I'm actually in the
Air Force not the sava others cock is

111
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,449
like oh well

112
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:41,539
military American NSA leave the country
but

113
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:45,099
even the people I know in the USA even
people I know Intel community

114
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:48,539
the really good people and we should
remove that from a discussion

115
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:52,479
right not the people are and for me it's
also not about

116
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,530
agency or specific groups not about the
essay I if you really think that the US

117
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,349
government the only ones doing things

118
00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:01,699
you really not paying attention to the
discussion has been going on for

119
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:05,990
last 20 years not just in snow and leaks
information I

120
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,699
there's a lotta governments in a lot of
crazy things he went to Rodrigo stalking

121
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:12,189
is talking about the underlying
architecture and hardware and cool

122
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:13,639
things that can be done

123
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,620
if people know that can things can be
done there's probably someone

124
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,930
researching somewhere what other bad
news can be done with that as well

125
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,300
so that's another point my talk on

126
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,659
also I wanna say that again not all
surveillance no intelligence is bad

127
00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:31,029
I think there's a certain stance the
public as to come to a what is are

128
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:32,729
accepted value on that

129
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:36,069
my bias ease my understanding is that
not all that bad

130
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:39,430
I am saying though I am taking a stance
on saying

131
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,439
mass surveillance is both ineffective in
wrong doesn't get you anywhere it's

132
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:46,199
actually really bad for the analyst with
all talk about later

133
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,639
I am saying the nonpartisan ballot
absolutely wrong

134
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:52,919
and I am saying that it's not a privacy
or security debate

135
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:56,229
that that debate privacy or security is
absolutely

136
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:59,770
incorrect its privacy and security which
will go through later

137
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,990
so that's just what we're gonna run
through right so my rants

138
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:06,870
is going to be on the current state the
leaks as well as the sourcing and fear

139
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,620
uncertainty and doubt comes with it

140
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,889
and then sorta aspect hi loses outside
of our community so

141
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:15,639
our community we understand things we
think in technical were thinking you

142
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,449
know there's a lot of passion behind
this

143
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:21,050
go ask your normal person about the
information you get a much different

144
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:21,930
view

145
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:27,069
I was i at a I store in the US on a trip
back for conference

146
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:30,090
and I just wanted to get a data point a
reference to say from when people are

147
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,210
talking about this

148
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:35,120
so I asked the guys like so you heard
about that clothing store

149
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,580
I said you've heard about the the recent
leaks news and stuff right in the car

150
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,729
well no are maybe I did I actually
remember something about this new some

151
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:43,840
privacy discussions on

152
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,710
yeah absolutely okay I guess it's made
outside of our community in a big way

153
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:51,009
even the clothing I you know is hearing
about it you look at something about

154
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:52,050
like

155
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,080
Bradley or Chelsea Manning cat was

156
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,389
a while ago you were up to a whole
nother discussion point now

157
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:01,589
but there was a lot of people there are
outside a marker that are in our

158
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:03,050
community that haven't

159
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,379
grapple with this discussion yet and we
build up hype we lose those people more

160
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:08,770
than get them

161
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:12,110
so whatever the current see the leaks I

162
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,999
it was great debates whether you agree
with it or not whether you agree with

163
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:16,419
things being leaked or not

164
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:20,990
what a great discussion point about the
aspect of transparency and surveillance

165
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,740
on what could be done what should be
done by governments

166
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,749
I play have an opportunity though for
other people to push their own agendas

167
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:30,169
and for other people to push their own
conspiracy theories

168
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:34,630
I want iran says absolutely I'm tired of
seeing people make the NSA or other

169
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,630
people the boogie man

170
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,630
you lose value if you start on not
sourcing information if you start

171
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,870
the blaming everything on into these
then we drive the focus

172
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,730
incentive being furtive outward looking
and seeing where as possible and really

173
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:51,750
fixing issues we drive the focus into
just being conspiracy theorists

174
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,600
I just because you call yourself an
independent journalist doesn't make you

175
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,300
one

176
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,650
I've seen some people come out that were
actually activists

177
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:02,390
that had no experience in journalism
that all the sudden they had a story

178
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,380
with no sourcing or no information

179
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,510
and they wanted to submit to a paper
because its privacy beamers known

180
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:11,550
team now it's a a good piece to have in
a magazine or paper

181
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:15,240
and they certainly willing themselves
independent journalists journalist

182
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,420
so then that's wrong and I think that's
bad ask a silly because you're

183
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,830
presenting information

184
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,800
in a wrong way so without even sourcing
without even back to back up your

185
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,290
argument you're saying oh yeah

186
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,350
reader doesn't know me I want you know
that I'm an unbiased

187
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,480
independent journalist trying to capture
the whole story well that's not true

188
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,640
that what you're doing

189
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,690
you're misleading the reader and I think
there we have enough to focus on we have

190
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:37,450
enough good

191
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,510
back soon enough good stuff to say
something's wrong

192
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:44,580
without trying to mislead the people to
read the stories

193
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,660
I'm but there is value in being an
activist so

194
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,180
also polls are misleading I'm tired of
seeing like all 57 percent

195
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,960
americans are fifty you know three
percent of the germans a are absolutely

196
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,040
see in this is wrong

197
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,910
okay in if you haven't done the research
on the pole the at scene where they're

198
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,160
getting those values

199
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,640
they're absolutely worthless they go in
the poll a group of people they are you

200
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,320
know it's gonna be one way and the
person that number's up people

201
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,050
so it's just something to be aware I but
there again there's a lot of good

202
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,480
discussions have

203
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,540
is what I would describe a single source
arguments you get olive the stories to

204
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,150
come out

205
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,300
you know Reuters and Fox and CNN

206
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,340
and as I everyone comes out and sources
this information says yes we have all

207
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,430
these great facts about this community

208
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:29,610
and the track it back about these leaks
these great things being done

209
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:33,450
as a single-source debate from someone
saying why can't show you the

210
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,700
information but I've heard from in on

211
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,990
you know from an anonymous source deep
inside the intelligence agency that this

212
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,590
is the information

213
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:45,680
all that's a crap argument because what
happens you get some like this so unique

214
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,700
and read it as well

215
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,800
but wealthy about it is a you know top
page front page on reddit

216
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,660
we have this one thing you know in SA
now bugging 320 official then place the

217
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,370
Merkel

218
00:10:55,370 --> 00:11:00,470
including my most trusted people in
Merkel's organization this is horrible

219
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,720
see read the article it's actually a

220
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,680
build on Sun star article so probably
not the best

221
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,840
reference points brought out the best
data point Germany

222
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,810
pretty much the tabloid I but they're
saying yes at the noon on

223
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,830
known in SA leaguers come pouring here
the information

224
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:21,920
white but forget about being built on
Sonntag what I like is there

225
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,890
goes down and they say you know isn't
this a German tabloid they say oh yeah I

226
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,060
will we all become African was like the
last

227
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,140
article that they published but the
person says yeah right

228
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,340
you know dwn Reuters both came out and
said

229
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,400
this was also true they also sources
information

230
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,540
and I got a guy comes out the bottom
third yeah if you look they both called

231
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,730
on Sonntag

232
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,860
so Sonntag so we see this over and over
in the organization over over the news

233
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,360
media

234
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,500
when you get one person one organization
saying something

235
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,330
and then 30 other people come out and
say that's true then so we say oh yeah

236
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,970
we see thirty news organizations quoting
this

237
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,130
you go back and it's just one article
from one person

238
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,430
usually like an independent journalist

239
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,800
so basically if you build single

240
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,840
source arguments you gonna breaking down
pretty quickly

241
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,190
it doesn't take much from an academic
standpoint someone inside the community

242
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,750
to go this whole thing is crap so if you
want to go up against governments if you

243
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,850
wanna go up against

244
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:20,780
intellectuals outside the on community
you have to have a good debate

245
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,910
there's a lot of good information there
use it when you build single-source

246
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,350
arguments

247
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:29,050
you actually just doing yourself a
disservice because people aren't stupid

248
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,830
generally speaking I and I always think
this is hilarious because

249
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,720
if this is an argument on the Internet
if if we actually just threw up these

250
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,240
articles with this little sourcing on
the Internet

251
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,520
the OP would be called a lot of how
names only be asking for the real

252
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,560
thoughts right so that would be
absolutely

253
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,080
no way this was anything on on active
internet post on Reddit or wherever else

254
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,270
that have these arguments happy things
would fly but what end up occurring as

255
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,910
we want to believe it because it's
something we thought or wanted to leave

256
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,770
anyways

257
00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:00,350
we absolutely want to support
information that supports our own biases

258
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,210
and the problem with that is you can
literally say anything to make anything

259
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,810
up on the Internet

260
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:08,830
right so just because you call it
research and call yourself an

261
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,480
independent journalist doesn't mean that
that's what you're doing

262
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,850
and I think again that's something that
we have to address in our own community

263
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,820
if we want to take this privacy argument
outside our community we better be

264
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,960
strong and doing it

265
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,650
because there's going to be people
intelligent people tearing it down

266
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:26,080
but again don't be smart come up here
PhD student an adjunct lecturer

267
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,780
about sourcing Atwell periodical
pullback in Iran

268
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:33,210
every now and then don't be too smug
about it so I accept that he myself

269
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:37,770
going outside my own community I have to
be careful that I'm approaching things

270
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:41,970
with my own you know take no medicine or
and then it just in general try not be

271
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,680
gullible when you're going through
believing stories

272
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,750
again we use this constantly in the
community will work force things out to

273
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,500
people outside

274
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,600
InfoSec also the hacker outsiders the
cybersecurity have communities

275
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,360
people who only goal for so long and
then don't lose trust in you

276
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,280
the start looking at that community is
just hype and just line

277
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,670
so let's actually get more into the talk
now a rant over let's talk about the

278
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,670
actual argument

279
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,650
to the general argument people put
forward is that you can have security or

280
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:09,670
privacy

281
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:13,580
if you want to have more security you
must give up privacy

282
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:17,040
all we want to protect you we want to do
things for you says the government's you

283
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,360
need to give up privacy so that we can
do that

284
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,910
we've heard over and over again from
every elected leader on down

285
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:26,260
various nations right again not focus on
the US the USA

286
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:30,260
this is a widespread issue so there was
a very good debate that I went to last

287
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,040
year but

288
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,320
Sir David Oman you the former GCHQ
director

289
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,520
and he was debating Google privacy
advocate to an AI

290
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,830
Guardian privacy advocacy was actually
to the chief so they're up there

291
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:44,980
hi I individual known organization and
they started debating about

292
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:49,810
which is better surveillance or privacy
and coming into the talk they did a poll

293
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:52,810
love the people that were there and
everyone was all-pro privacy at this is

294
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,370
a really good discussion point by

295
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,020
really how can you really say
surveillance good thing

296
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:02,630
so 30 Oman ended up doing it some
awesome things in the debate

297
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:06,700
from a debating standpoint and went
ahead ending set the value in the debate

298
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,360
to say

299
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,620
we must except we must come the
commonality that you

300
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,670
you must accept that we at least have
I'll

301
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:17,660
are gonna leave this here is what
happens when TSA breaks your laptop

302
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,010
happen

303
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:21,770
a loner I that was nice had a TSA notice

304
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,780
I and my laptop on the way here

305
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,780
that said hey we check your baggage in
my screen is cracked

306
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:32,330
so again surveillance awesome I

307
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:37,800
I'm filed a claim but this back again

308
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,740
sorry if this is a USO Sir David I was
talking he said yet we have to set

309
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,960
at least some commonality for the debate
what I will say is that

310
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,520
there's this line up surveillance and
privacy and what we have to come to a

311
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,670
conclusion on

312
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:54,640
is that it is a debate about how much
are we willing to accept

313
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:59,410
and so I don't know this is awesome

314
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:02,810
so we have to come to including two that
lives we have come to the conclusion

315
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:07,000
that we as a society must accept what
value we're going to do maybe

316
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,830
the joke at this point would be the
innocent act like Peter budding in the

317
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,010
intelligence community

318
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:15,160
probably not actually accurate on

319
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,740
so friend of mine said yet what set this
value and so that's actually what they

320
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,390
did

321
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:26,180
the Google and the Guardian guy who are
arguing

322
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,410
awesome yes earth as I don't have a
laptop

323
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,920
don't mind it tells me i plug in USB to
I I would

324
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,149
hopefully maybe 12 staffers an hour in
the audience am

325
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:39,730
no well I knew about 50 up on alright so

326
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:43,519
the argument tends to be at what point
we can accept this value

327
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,259
as the Google and guarding I actually
said sure we'll go with that argument

328
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:50,689
now the problem that is you've set a
theoretical maximum and you're arguing

329
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:52,040
along the debaters

330
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:57,300
I peace there so there was no way for
them to ever win database for David M 11

331
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,220
the debate at the end they had a poll
which is better surveillance privacy

332
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:04,890
and almost seventy-nine percent think
left the debate switching their views

333
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:05,370
saying

334
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:09,600
ethics saying I believe that
surveillance is better for society

335
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,650
say lost value thanks lost value

336
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,970
in a very pro privacy setting just
because he debated well it took a source

337
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:17,870
academic approach

338
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,870
nom so I would actually say that's
probably not the right approach this

339
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:26,079
independent valuer there's a theoretical
maximum along that linear line

340
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,350
every bit more love surveillance gives
you a output privacy

341
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,649
so here when you're ready thanks so much

342
00:17:33,649 --> 00:17:39,370
so with that debate we generally don't
ask ourselves what you mean by pricing

343
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,399
what you mean by security

344
00:17:40,399 --> 00:17:44,140
so what is that they were actually
giving a privacy for what type of

345
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:44,809
security

346
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:49,600
so what I don't slides is go through
each aspect what I would call security

347
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,640
to have that the bay you define as
political security as economic security

348
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:53,890
is

349
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:57,940
physical security what are you defining
it as on where you want to have this

350
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,480
argument

351
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,809
so we look at point by point the first
one being physical security

352
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:06,070
the first that comes to mind is the
terrace the bay health care for gonna

353
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,590
when

354
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:10,250
9/11 happened we gotta have physical
security we gotta have surveillance

355
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,820
so that we can watch for all the
terrorists so we can protect you

356
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:18,059
the problem with that is that we have
any case studies with its really

357
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:19,059
actually effective

358
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:22,110
so it's bad it's important for an
impossible to have a case study of what

359
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,110
did we prevent

360
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:26,440
except for when the government comes
forward and says I

361
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,760
maybe one make maybe nine maybe we did
we're not sure but we think we prevent

362
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,919
it from terrorism cases

363
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,320
using this massive a la system or you
can even give one data point

364
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,669
whether class whether or not whatever it
is when you have a good argument you can

365
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:40,429
even come for

366
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:44,030
one data point to say yep weaver

367
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:47,250
we've helped physical security with this
massive a list system

368
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,730
well then you are defeating your own
argument so

369
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,470
to counter the point a physical security
I would say that we can come the

370
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,020
conclusion that mass surveillance

371
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,820
and on target surveillance really isn't
doing anything good I

372
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,179
a enough lol at a rape

373
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:09,470
not great beggars can't be choosers

374
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:16,470
brothers in granting

375
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,320
it's also a USO

376
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,630
the next point that I got to I after
physical security

377
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:29,820
was a that have have thanked was

378
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,429
I believe that economic security

379
00:19:33,429 --> 00:19:36,720
to come out and said okay what about
economic security breakdown further

380
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,570
well there's a very good case studies
say you know China and others

381
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:44,679
are absolutely looking at on community

382
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:48,630
so computer security being we've got to
get all this data to prevent the cyber

383
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,620
threats we've got to have all this data

384
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,890
so we can go backwards in time with the
suck it all up to do computer security

385
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:56,640
without mass surveillance you can't do
computer security

386
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,030
I transparency hurt the cause reveal

387
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:03,429
any bird a tower defense systems we talk
about the exploits

388
00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:07,750
we lose we can have any information out
there we have to have everything hidden

389
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,330
away

390
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:12,600
has declassified otherwise we'll lose on
the computer security side

391
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,890
so on it's entirely hard to be a
defender Nick and do it

392
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:21,270
right well what I would counter with
that is the saturation analyst this for

393
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:21,870
real thing

394
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,870
so anyways been on keyboard anybody's
been dealing with data the last thing

395
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,149
you want is big data

396
00:20:26,149 --> 00:20:29,890
last thing you want is mass amounts of
data you what specific targeted

397
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,030
information a look through

398
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:34,440
if you're actually doing any better good
computer security you're looking for TCP

399
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,539
modifications like

400
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:38,640
rhetoric was talking about or in the
morning steve was talking about

401
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,299
you're looking for actual advanced
attacks actual bad things

402
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:45,389
you what targeted very specific set
today to look at

403
00:20:45,389 --> 00:20:50,380
the Big Data aspect is anything that
helps an analyst arm

404
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,380
we've seen time and time again
throughout the community open source and

405
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,830
transparency

406
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:58,320
really help for systems we've seen that
open source

407
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,770
not defense systems really get community
by an

408
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:05,919
people contribute to and make them
better than ever before we also see that

409
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,539
exploits really don't become that much
less effective when they're known about

410
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:13,190
so all these people they usually go talk
to you on a on a cot cyber security

411
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,260
perspective say

412
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,580
all the nations data using 0 days

413
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,980
really cuz last time I checked most
that's what I saw from nation-states

414
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,580
were I'll you know reuse code wrap a new
rapper and that'd be defeated AV

415
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:29,520
here you know some aspect of low-hanging
fruit or phishing email that they were

416
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,840
able to get new computers

417
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,590
there is no aspect that we need massive
a let's do computer security

418
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:38,130
I mean forget about putting encryption
down into your CPU I would just

419
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,320
you loved rule out sequel injections in
the community

420
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,679
no we're not doing the basic things we
haven't come to the stance or mass

421
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:46,530
surveillance would really be useful

422
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:50,590
particular security okay so economic
security at us about a little bit

423
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:55,500
earlier prevent mitigate espionage the
1i have the Chinese still the f35 system

424
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,730
this is important to us

425
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:01,179
we mass surveillance and we need a lack
of privacy the bingo mitigate this

426
00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:04,980
economic in provider data important and
I would actually conceived

427
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,020
that's true the problem is again

428
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:12,149
even just from the NSA least we've seen
the community transition away from

429
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:15,700
the technological community in the US
we've seen I'm monetary

430
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,380
value lost in economics and our economic

431
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,350
of a whole because of the lack of trust
in the lack of transparency

432
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:26,580
in the system reuse the cloud-based
providers have been hit the hardest

433
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,059
because they get

434
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:32,130
supposedly secret orders that come to
the agency and other people and

435
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:35,340
well with the secret orders we can't
tell you anything about it so users

436
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,320
single screw although you somewhere else

437
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:41,419
I mean even the the most extreme example
when all the NSA leader coming I don't

438
00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:42,889
know how many people caught it

439
00:22:42,889 --> 00:22:46,500
but there was a cloud-based provider in
China that said

440
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,240
you can store your data here for free
and a lot of the community actually did

441
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,690
that there's

442
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:54,520
their numbers went through the roof that
will its China at least is not the US

443
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,710
for the NSA is

444
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:59,090
and if we come to that point the
argument I would say that we know hand

445
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,490
uses a case study to say

446
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:04,630
against your privacy security argument
you're really not doing yourself any

447
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:05,600
favor

448
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,960
on it had that low

449
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,110
so political security it your defining
security in that secure your privacy

450
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,649
arguments political security

451
00:23:14,649 --> 00:23:18,490
I would say there are no counterpoints
you should never be able to use any

452
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:19,840
aspect of surveillance

453
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,950
or privacy you know keeping your own
stuff trent

454
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:26,299
anything but transparent in a political
security

455
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:29,809
scenario diplomacy democracy

456
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:33,299
any aspect a free people has to be
transparent we've all come to these I

457
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:33,720
thought we

458
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,129
you know work this out hundreds of years
ago you can't use this aspect mass

459
00:23:38,129 --> 00:23:38,950
surveillance

460
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,419
does it protect their political security
it's exactly the opposite of what you're

461
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:43,379
trying to accomplish

462
00:23:43,379 --> 00:23:46,690
sorin have counter points for this this
is just so inherently

463
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:50,020
obvious in the debate that it's not
acceptable to come for any other

464
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:50,919
standpoint

465
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:54,179
and we see them Fisher spying campaigns
by governments

466
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:57,250
all around the world in goal return this
is in lab reports all

467
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:00,440
what they've been doing I government
should

468
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,159
Howard server privacy for the purpose of
saying it for political gain

469
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:09,340
it's just not acceptable and yeah US
Congress approval rating

470
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:12,480
is a little low that that wouldn't help
Italy

471
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,169
to cultural security another point where
this argument has even raised

472
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:20,270
always been about physical security or
computer security we generally don't see

473
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:23,110
the government community coming out and
saying well we want to have some sort of

474
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,429
cultural security

475
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:28,120
iight in that point generally speaking
those that come out and say

476
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,260
we'll keep the things they were we want
to keep our culture

477
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,980
or I wanna keep the foreigners out
channeling not

478
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,220
and accepted posture in society it
usually limited and thinking it tends to

479
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:39,899
be

480
00:24:39,899 --> 00:24:43,649
either racist or just close-minded I
innovations such as

481
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:46,879
openness and on the online anonymity
online

482
00:24:46,879 --> 00:24:49,770
is what made the internet the great
thing that we had it's what made

483
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,289
technology come for its what

484
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:55,110
change our culture not only from a
technological standpoint but from

485
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:58,480
and appreciation the news and sources
that we get I'm sorry

486
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,850
even if the US government has the
argument that we made the internet we

487
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,450
can take it back if we want which

488
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:07,480
was argument FX made last year troopers
what I would say is

489
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,000
all the people all the aspects of the
air that we actually use would like them

490
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,520
to be da

491
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,929
aspect in NAACP in those protocols that
we use

492
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:18,610
all the inventors a that part of the
Internet has come out and said well

493
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:22,470
we support privacy we don't support are
you doing it so the argument that the US

494
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,619
government made the end everyone

495
00:25:23,619 --> 00:25:28,090
back doesn't hold when I would say if
you want to stop using the World Wide

496
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:28,559
Web

497
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:33,889
truck stop using HD pt1 elected ARPANET
maybe we can have that argument

498
00:25:33,889 --> 00:25:37,320
so my proposals online security and
privacy

499
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,990
privacy is an integral aspect of
security we've seen this with open

500
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,350
source technology we've seen this with
cultural aspects

501
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:46,429
we see with economic value we broke it
down and said absolutely

502
00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:51,299
up it needs to have a privacy component
everything we do for one

503
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:56,429
increase security I am I i do think
there has to be some sort of balance

504
00:25:56,429 --> 00:26:00,369
solana partisans up and said beneath me
this balance between privacy and

505
00:26:00,369 --> 00:26:01,020
security

506
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:04,330
and that's okay you know early on you
can actually do that in our present a

507
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,679
model here in a second

508
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,799
that counter to the when you're 18
shoulder you know

509
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,850
screen crapped out on but national
secret intelligence missions thing I've

510
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:13,139
the

511
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:17,090
diplomacy target intelligent things like
that again but that the biases

512
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:20,360
it up are the argument that I'm I'm
giving that's what I that's the part

513
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,520
where things okay

514
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,760
my issue isn't art in dollars and mass
surveillance and you know

515
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:29,330
seeger court orders and things like that
so on that I think the model is it when

516
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,080
your think it's more likely

517
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,549
on I think it more likely changed over
time where

518
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:37,889
you know sure you can gain a level of
security through some

519
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:42,460
aspect loss of privacy maybe CCTV maybe
its checkpoints an airport

520
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:46,690
whatever it is that you want in the
community you could probably get to a

521
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:51,090
certain level higher security with less
privacy if you really wanted to do so

522
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:54,230
comin if you can't read between the
lines there quite literally

523
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:57,790
what I would say is the maximum return
on surveillance

524
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:02,159
for security has to be transparent and
it has to be bought and by that

525
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:02,960
community

526
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,290
so that's the ass trick on this kinda
chart

527
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:10,809
is that if you're community if the US if
germany however says

528
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:15,230
we call truly accept these few things
and you've been transparent how they're

529
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:15,889
gonna be done

530
00:27:15,889 --> 00:27:19,299
what they're gonna be done with where's
the data gonna go then yes you can

531
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:20,690
return some aspect

532
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:24,369
up security from that but as we try to
reach those

533
00:27:24,369 --> 00:27:27,609
theoretical maximum switch Sir David
Oman put in is the bait

534
00:27:27,609 --> 00:27:31,049
so eloquently we actually get is a fall

535
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:35,820
and security we see restrictive domains
and restrictive governments we know

536
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,000
all way back from the Algerian War of
Independence up to the US involvement

537
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,929
iraq

538
00:27:39,929 --> 00:27:43,389
we see restrictions and surveillance
States Russia good during the social

539
00:27:43,389 --> 00:27:44,450
impacts

540
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:48,559
on rushes surround system in general we
see those restricted states actually

541
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,929
return less security we see more
terrorism we see more outbursts we see

542
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:53,350
more people getting involved

543
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:58,059
and physical and damaging waz I'll

544
00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:01,690
but my proposal on who's right or who's
wrong doesn't really matter

545
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:04,809
so I can come up here and say I
broken-down security bass by bass and

546
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:05,080
I've

547
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,639
I've talked about our a model that's
different than what gently present in

548
00:28:08,639 --> 00:28:09,770
the community

549
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:14,470
but its really poorly structured
ultimately so one point out that it's

550
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:17,859
as poorly structured as the debate
against though you look from an academic

551
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:18,889
standpoint

552
00:28:18,889 --> 00:28:23,169
into this debate no one's doing a good
job on saying what's right and what's

553
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:23,590
wrong

554
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:27,109
the data points really aren't there so
what I would say in general I probably

555
00:28:27,109 --> 00:28:30,119
the other reasons the government does
things they believe their

556
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:34,080
doing right but I think the way they're
gone about its definitely the wrong way

557
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,220
but we don't have to be and I think the
most important piece to this talk break

558
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:41,440
this prize was rooting talk ever by the
most important pieces talk

559
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,389
from me being inside Intel community me
being a member that seemed different

560
00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:46,139
aspects

561
00:28:46,139 --> 00:28:49,470
and being apart the hacker community and
living in Germany is i'm looking at it

562
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,250
thinking

563
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:53,690
out loud we don't have to debate it we

564
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:57,149
art the ones with the ownership of the
argument

565
00:28:57,149 --> 00:29:00,760
the government or whoever's involved in
this debate that wants to take something

566
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,240
from us has to have some sort of proof

567
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,030
they're the ones with the proof the
responsibility for proof that the one

568
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,359
have to say

569
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:11,980
yes we want to take privacy on XY and z.
things

570
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:16,700
and you were going to get this in return
now you do you agree or not

571
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,940
so when we want to come back this is the
the last piece of a rant for me

572
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,010
when we welcome back to the community
and say

573
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:27,149
let's debate this let's talk about why
privacy is important I think its exact

574
00:29:27,149 --> 00:29:27,980
wrong stop

575
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,909
things iraq wrong for approach we should
say we don't have to be

576
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:35,799
you prove to us why this is important
and unfortunately have been doing that

577
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:38,210
they haven't been giving information
they haven't been

578
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:41,889
telling us why we as citizens to do
anything I differently than what's going

579
00:29:41,889 --> 00:29:42,859
on now

580
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:48,230
and i think thats part a problem the
responsibility proof was on them not us

581
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:52,809
so on wanna wrap this up relatively
quickly cuz after the auction

582
00:29:52,809 --> 00:29:56,450
and also I'm hoping that more debate
than just questions and answers typed up

583
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:59,970
up but I would say we tend to be biased
and leave stories writes that was the

584
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,109
beginning point

585
00:30:01,109 --> 00:30:03,950
and I would ask the community that wants
to go out national research that the

586
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:06,230
commute was actually involved in the
debate

587
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:09,549
to accept their own bias either as well
as looking at those that are writing the

588
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:13,139
stories except those by season try to
get a more realistic truth

589
00:30:13,139 --> 00:30:16,780
but come out and so she arguments have a
real discussion because there's real

590
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,080
discussion to be had

591
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,990
we look at AT&T tapping when you look at
Mass Ave Linden targeted

592
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:25,320
I surveillance and target intelligence

593
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,619
there's another information had to say
yeah this is wrong there's enough

594
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:31,940
actual sources to say this is something
we should look into without making his

595
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,950
hype

596
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:37,190
but type stories and I would also say on
this issue

597
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:41,179
on again we're not responsible for

598
00:30:41,179 --> 00:30:44,549
arguing it the responsible for arguing
us and then we can make a rational

599
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:48,389
conclusion with so backward right now
the community how this is working

600
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:51,659
and I just

601
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:54,730
again we're seeing the community losing
a lot of people inside intelligence

602
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:55,510
community

603
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:59,450
and let me lemme not again not speak for
them but let me just give you my

604
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,629
internal perspective

605
00:31:00,629 --> 00:31:03,980
there's a lot of really good people in
the government evening's other community

606
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,799
who are really passionate about privacy

607
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:09,359
were really passionate about doing
things right

608
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:14,179
but the hype the FIDE the screw the NSA
screw these guys that are actually

609
00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:15,159
working

610
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:19,549
the copper for a while they're on the
front page page in reddit go back to

611
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:20,309
read it but that

612
00:31:20,309 --> 00:31:24,070
a large part of people in the community
involved front page articles about

613
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:27,760
let's find the email addresses only give
them so they're spying on us let's party

614
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,230
their privacy

615
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:33,040
you lose people by doing that all those
people on internal that we're fighting

616
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,770
for change that wanted to do something

617
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:38,480
good you losing in the debate because
you're targeting them

618
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,730
Sol I know I'm savior's military guys
are making some sort a plea for another

619
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:43,510
community

620
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:47,929
but I would say if you really wanna have
a good debate don't target the people

621
00:31:47,929 --> 00:31:50,970
target how crappy the arguments are with
me drawing

622
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:55,070
XY well grabs on PowerPoint is back
screen with

623
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:58,840
you know black lines the whole point
presentation is actually kinda crappy

624
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,820
presentation

625
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:03,789
but its as crappy as the one being given
to us

626
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:07,490
make a better argument source your
arguments have a better conclusion but

627
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:10,080
don't forget about the people involved
in them

628
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,320
because those are usually your biggest
advocate

629
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,960
there's decisions I make on a daily
basis inside my spear

630
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,990
influence that impact this debate

631
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:23,429
and I do so really champing in
advocating for privacy both externally

632
00:32:23,429 --> 00:32:24,280
and internally

633
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,470
there is some risk associated with me
coming out at hacker type of written

634
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,419
thing

635
00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:31,940
I'm going down community here's my name
is my face everything about me

636
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:36,020
and I really support privacy with people
like that means I don't wanna do that

637
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,520
but you if you force them to not do that
if you force than that

638
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:43,049
thinking that they're the evil person or
you force them into a defensive corner

639
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:47,619
you gonna lose very important pieces Bay
you know is very important pieces

640
00:32:47,619 --> 00:32:50,950
invoices in the argument so

641
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:53,950
that's something that I've seen
something that's been really bugging me

642
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,889
is saying that human aspect of it was
thought by the argument let's talk about

643
00:32:56,889 --> 00:32:58,659
how crappy Lee the source

644
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:02,049
let's talk about that and move to a
better collision point so again I want

645
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:05,270
to open up more discussions points I
know maybe it's not usually

646
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:08,389
active that the military guy gets up
higher conference ok we have some

647
00:33:08,389 --> 00:33:09,500
discussion here

648
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,780
so who would like to start it

649
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:16,470
somebody

650
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:19,639
otherwise the night if I gotta I thanks

651
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:26,010
otherwise

652
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:28,399
otherwise it is that we got back on
schedule

653
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:35,399
when

654
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:46,430
publicly public yeah the jury sir

655
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:07,410
yes no

656
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:13,300
know and that's what I think is so I
really want to use this as they did

657
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,590
yeah yet so yeah absolutely so

658
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:21,180
way

659
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:24,670
yeah so one reason I wanted to come to
the stage

660
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:28,450
so again protesters a series about
PowerPoint but on

661
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:32,180
this is a test session I wanted to have
its important there's absolutely group

662
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:35,400
throughout the intelligence community on
the inside have discussions there's

663
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,870
online forms internally there's things
that we talk about

664
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:42,300
and there's movements internally that
impact a lot of decisions

665
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,570
and it's actually organizationally
believe are not supported

666
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:50,220
and so i i can't go into details a very
different orientation how they do things

667
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:53,650
but you'd be surprised with how much the
management positions

668
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:57,690
get people talking to them and saying oh
this is a better choice for this is a

669
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:58,630
bad choice sir

670
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:01,870
here's how we can do this better which
the community will support more out

671
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:05,340
and they go okay if you complete the
mission I really don't care it's not

672
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:08,010
ever that they were a malice in the
first place about their try the

673
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:08,660
malicious

674
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,240
it sometimes people are trying to take
on something that they're not

675
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,130
necessarily technically proficient with

676
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:17,600
and screw up but when the internal
organization says hey how do we do it

677
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,690
differently in there listening to the
community objectives community aspect

678
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:25,210
which has been extremely important so a
lot of the debate again about the FF has

679
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:26,610
been extremely important

680
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:30,910
into the internal seeing that so outside
your own community you tend to not

681
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:31,830
understand it

682
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,910
outside of the internal community the
intelligence agencies

683
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:38,670
you probably don't understand so often
hacking and security conferences

684
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:45,670
those those points are very helpful to
people yep heart all

685
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:23,390
yeah absolutely so

686
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:26,820
I'm affect the but the first when I talk
to you when he brings up

687
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:30,290
what happened community I keep talking
about the be for only talking about

688
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:33,730
decided talking about CCC what is it so

689
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:36,970
yeah absolutely bracket their quotes
what i've seen in

690
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:40,430
any community in from my involvement
more the technical side

691
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:43,460
I it doesn't get done what you do it
yourself

692
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:47,700
and then people jump on so I don't know
how long sergei and Travis and others

693
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,910
have been really focusing on

694
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:52,350
hey let's talk about this bus
architecture American in securing let's

695
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,320
focus on the protocols in a weird
machines

696
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,860
generally speaking it has to be you
speaking out and you saying something

697
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,640
intellectual saying something
academically sore for whatever it might

698
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,020
be

699
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:06,020
that it's your values and people jump
onto it and have met plenty of people

700
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:09,610
that have given me information to take
back but it made me better educated

701
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:13,820
have made me a better privacy advocate
internally just by standing up the first

702
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,240
time that I spoke to troopers are

703
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,390
the first time in about these
conferences so I would say absolutely

704
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:22,500
stand up and speak stamp maker but
opinion known get feedback on it the

705
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,080
Internet communities the first one to
rip you apart when you're wrong it's

706
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,780
actually really good feedback usually

707
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:30,050
just right now it's been the self
licking ice cream cones or support

708
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:30,900
itself because

709
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,420
know we all care about privacy when we
say snowed in you know the previous one

710
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,200
talk about missus

711
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,690
then I you know greenwald governor
pieces

712
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:41,750
say leakers and also the keynote speaker
you know all the sudden

713
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:45,360
got a presentation where normally
wouldn't have anything technical present

714
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,260
at a conference but

715
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,970
I'm that privacy is good therefore on a
speaker now don't do it that way

716
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:54,250
tried have a unique perspective to bring
and when you do that people ought or

717
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:57,820
come to you like even if you lose 90
percent the audience this community 10

718
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,200
percent talk to you and gives you could

719
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,480
takeaways and usually can support that
aspect so

720
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,840
in that hacker community how do you
instruct that how you get better

721
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,670
I think we have very good conference
venues in place is set up to have that

722
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,110
discussion

723
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:14,650
have those big breaks in the copy breaks
whenever talk about it and then you go

724
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:15,060
out

725
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,420
needs to your sphere of influence
whatever it is any make that aspect a

726
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,150
little bit better

727
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:26,150
up with the answer is not a question
yeah

728
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:15,890
yep so

729
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:19,170
to us really good question what I would
say i'm hopeful about

730
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:23,210
is there's a difference in just standing
up and saying AI poses in this important

731
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:27,040
and the other counterpoint which
actually way more effective as saying

732
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,410
you know what I poses and that's
important but forget that when you care

733
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,540
about organizationally

734
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:34,700
I can help you get there better you talk
about reducing cost and economic

735
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,980
situation that you can take your choice
right talk about a better product

736
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:41,200
better in product they're gonna focus
more on the way regardless if if they

737
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,240
care about your opinion

738
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,460
large corporations and large governments
and large organizations

739
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,460
don't have ethics and morality because
there's so many different pieces of the

740
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:48,920
puzzle

741
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,480
not morley in you know in more than not
moral the service away from that

742
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,360
argument they move in their own interest

743
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,310
so I would say absolutely a lot of
people fail in that they stand up and

744
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:58,570
say

745
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:01,810
this is important by what you listenin
put it back on their own terms

746
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:05,190
so that the trick to this presentation
is

747
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:07,800
I'm glad that we have this audience I
appreciate you coming but it's on

748
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,120
YouTube it recorded it will be plenty of
people and does

749
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:14,430
you reading my own by video here more
speaking to them in its presentation

750
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:16,370
about standing up internally in saying

751
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:20,630
hey something's important to me but more
importantly I can put in your language

752
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:23,880
mass surveillance is actually
ineffective for your mission

753
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,570
let me tell you a better way to do it
back if things changed

754
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:31,100
if you reach the conclusion if you reach
the objective the organization wants to

755
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,049
come to anyways

756
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:35,650
if you do it a different way that now
supports your ideas supports that

757
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:36,630
community objective

758
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:42,000
they don't care it's not like the big
NSA which are even who that would be

759
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,470
who wakes up and says I am the USA today
they don't really care

760
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:49,550
about the direction is laws is moving
into other objectives

761
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:52,750
so try to guide the objectives in the
direction that is good

762
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,960
we can agree on so

763
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:02,960
more more shots more questions yeah sir

764
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,960
yeah so this is

765
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,520
yeah I'm I i think we're in a better
position in the company's

766
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,360
aspects maybe it's cuz I'm in the
government I think commercial sector

767
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,430
still looks nice and

768
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:23,960
network I could tell me the even worse
me this debate there

769
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,500
but I think we're better off because
it's all the pieces being transparent

770
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,350
even if it

771
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:32,710
we sometimes in these long user
agreements the end up on covering some

772
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:33,990
aspect that no one reads

773
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:37,690
there someone that does that give a talk
on or someone it comes out and says hey

774
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:38,540
this is wrong

775
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:43,110
on so there's benefit in the commercial
sector and some other been public

776
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:47,390
a quite a bit not have had conversations
that I'm almost even in standing up and

777
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:50,280
saying all this there some cars is the
most timid approach here

778
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,620
and the dealings of corporations and how
they go about things that makes it very

779
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,400
very

780
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,830
in my opinion immoral I'm when you see

781
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:01,850
in news leaks or arguments or whatever
where this poor corporations being take

782
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:04,130
advantage of by certain organization

783
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:07,250
on sometimes that was a conversation on
this

784
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:12,690
barely started like we imagine I'm news
media organizations people with

785
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:14,360
financials people with stocks

786
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:17,640
very much take a biased approach and

787
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:21,490
the government isn't going to come back
out contradicted you nothing ever comes

788
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:22,210
back out

789
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:25,930
as a reserve reasoned argument against
said she almost say anything

790
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:28,840
Sony Corporation side there's a lot of
what I would say she in your dealings

791
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,600
going on

792
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:33,620
than people realize and its usually the
same people that a crime victim that are

793
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,720
actually supporting

794
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,020
the objectives or actually initiating
the conversation

795
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:41,680
now that's not for any organization
particular not talking about in SA

796
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:46,010
here I'm just saying in general I would
view that there is some bias Easter

797
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:50,010
story being presented and realize that
in that office considering made

798
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:53,700
was probably more 4.2 perspective on
just

799
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:57,140
accepts announces the competing
hypotheses

800
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:01,630
right not everything likewise me and
think how do you do something about it

801
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:04,750
those people as corporations going up to
something what I thought was incredibly

802
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,020
the wrong approach

803
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:09,040
and and even though I don't have any
personal

804
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,590
objection the joy as I don't have any
personal objection a green alternative

805
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,540
people

806
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:16,990
haunt known that could be outstanding
maybe I'd love to sit down and be with

807
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:17,580
them I don't know

808
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:20,700
have met him can't say that the traders
whatever I was involved in a

809
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,620
what I will say that I thought was
really the wrong approach is this year's

810
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:24,910
CEO there in the audience

811
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:28,890
nice through awkward this year being it
tells me I said nothing on the hacker

812
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:33,230
but what I would say about his approach
this year what you should go inside

813
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:35,010
these organizations grab the football

814
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:38,810
and take it out you should absolutely
saying hey go in and get their secrets

815
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:39,470
and showing

816
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:43,550
had a sysadmin unite the problem with
that is your asking people to fall on

817
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:44,150
his sword

818
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:47,250
for your cause you askin you in a very
damaging way

819
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:50,760
a way that they can go to jail or lose
their financial stability or whatever

820
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,410
some things just

821
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:54,990
inappropriate in general but the real
problem is you put these organizations

822
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:58,050
that might have wanted to have some for
a change that might've wanted to do

823
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:01,600
something on the defensive now they're
worried about leakers inside

824
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,420
now they're setting a different program
because all got join us on its called

825
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:07,150
hackers together in others a sysadmin
unite all coming force

826
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:11,610
was paranoid that gets involved so there
has to be a logical way to approach this

827
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:14,900
in that we're not doing hyper not doing
but we're not asking people

828
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:18,370
United an organization and go in
infiltrate

829
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:21,770
spy agencies but instead were dissing
from a community spective

830
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:25,540
do anything and moral ethical way where
we can actually having

831
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:29,400
good discussion and bring about as much
out through the process is possible to

832
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,850
have a transparent discussion

833
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:34,150
I think the government really this one
on that one you know the military member

834
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:37,800
in a corporation you can for choose not
to use their product military

835
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,800
really can choose not to use that
government unless maybe you're an

836
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,870
African state where happens

837
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:47,030
on I would say that

838
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:50,720
they really owe it to us they really are
more transparency and we've been arguing

839
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,550
about that for ever but there's a way to
go about that and show that

840
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:57,570
rather than just crying foul aka it
signed up

841
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:01,870
anymore russians questions I guess that
hopefully

842
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:08,870
cover to ask by

843
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:16,180
but oh yeah

844
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:19,870
I don't have any unicorns a go through
anything like that that out there

845
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:23,800
I actually do technical research
actually do technical things usually

846
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,840
this year I wanted a deep dive into ICS
protocols

847
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:31,210
and I and all that but I don't have any
tokens to give you to hack your bad

848
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:34,570
on so lemme let me take time out

849
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:38,530
and I all maybe even in the power to to
act value

850
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:42,000
whatever might be like it in action that

851
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,540
par this isn't s actually fully my fault
and not on

852
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:50,220
not commerce's I missed yesterday no
sick I flew into left on the

853
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:53,650
from another conference even though I
live in Germany and it was it was times

854
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:54,750
as food somebody

855
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:58,580
gave me some food poisoning on the way
funny was able to link up with them to

856
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:00,260
get the talking about on the slides

857
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:03,970
i no excuses excuses now in the
intelligence community got the

858
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,860
conference the town the guiding you be
the token

859
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:10,160
wonderful

860
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,650
yep this is a freebie just for sitting
through this really crappy PowerPoint

861
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:15,230
you get a free tokens

862
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:20,490
up like I said all my presentations
usually aren't this bad it's just I

863
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:24,140
the fact that that I just wanted it more
to be I'm getting up and saying

864
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:26,200
something versus the PowerPoint

865
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:31,150
I there's real value in talking to the
people and getting the people out

866
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:34,260
people have the experience the one
talking to them and said %uh vilifying

867
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,130
them

868
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:39,310
and hopefully more people whatever
happens on me after work re

869
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:42,810
why more people I'm that I know watch
videos like this

870
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:46,010
and what happen say something and
ethically where not talking about with

871
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:46,480
supply

872
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,000
stuff you know this process is like it's
hard to explain to people that actually

873
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,240
really good process

874
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,250
inside for bringing up information and

875
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:58,330
and I know people have countered that
argument but I've seen those internally

876
00:46:58,330 --> 00:46:59,610
and i've seen them work

877
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:02,880
i've seen legal counsel everything
inside intelligence communities where I

878
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,710
said I have a problem with something

879
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:09,040
and they worked through it but it's
usually not as fast as you want because

880
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,700
as we talk about any corporation or
large organization

881
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,990
it doesn't move at the speed and
sometimes it bothers people know the

882
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:16,600
waters with a blow up your responding

883
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,770
tomorrow but that's not how it works so

884
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:23,630
hopefully more people and organizations
world give talks about their perspective

885
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:25,800
and try to get things done internally

886
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,000
so anything else I tokens and other
questions

887
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,010
besides class what's up

888
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:39,010
yeah

889
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:52,220
I A

890
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:24,250
now

891
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:34,650
yes

892
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:44,780
Korea bothers me it does so here's the
the truth the fact is I

893
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:48,630
I work on a national team doing some
really cool things I see so amazing

894
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:52,570
resultado that do really good work and I
see all this debate all this really

895
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:54,190
crappy way to approach things

896
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:58,750
tear apart my team its members our the
community become self destructive I lose

897
00:48:58,750 --> 00:48:59,830
talented analyst like

898
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:03,330
okay given that work because I like wall
you know I'm tired being vilified

899
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:06,810
way home from work whatever it is we
lose good parts the mission

900
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:10,710
and then what replaces the good part all
that hype in crappy were trying to fight

901
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:12,040
against fills that void

902
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,350
and so the highly paranoid product gets
even worse

903
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:18,480
because we probably were approaching it
wrong the first place what I would say

904
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,350
though about

905
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:22,420
though that same preface to the argument
is it's not necessarily

906
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:26,130
back on with things happen with the
everyone's an enemy

907
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:30,890
approach there's a I mean I i can. on
the inside of you can't be there at all

908
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:33,800
there's a lot of the school programs I
heard about that Michael really have

909
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,570
that later

910
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:37,590
%um that's interesting on by

911
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:41,170
what I would say to that is some the
date is being read wrong some

912
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:44,510
like impose our PowerPoint slide and ten
people can get a different answer from

913
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:44,790
it

914
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:48,210
impose documents and people can that
have an answer from it and when I would

915
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:48,880
even say

916
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,810
is sometimes the not the most talented
people in your organization the ones

917
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:53,170
running

918
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:56,550
are points on there's an issue with your

919
00:49:56,550 --> 00:50:00,520
yours giving power points to management
and not your technical people right

920
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,930
you may have someone think a difficult
cool and where they do

921
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:06,790
the passion the code if you want its
weight management you break it down dumb

922
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:07,330
it down

923
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:10,840
say what it does and I hypothetical and
for our PowerPoint slide

924
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:14,430
and PowerPoint get leaked great somehow
we look really incompetent to

925
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:18,190
on to your point about the technical
information it's always fun to me that I

926
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:19,200
could absolutely

927
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:23,290
today week week a top-secret no foreign
slide

928
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:28,000
that says there's this program out there
you put on networking capture of data

929
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,840
pull out SSL a pull-out

930
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:33,160
you know passwords images leaving
recession eyes the data

931
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:37,080
and effects every known network out
there and its indiscriminate

932
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:41,210
and if you would like to ask for are
certain to download everyone a freak out

933
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:43,090
may be like oh my god bless a developing
this

934
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:46,800
industry skill now where there's this
order non-technical approach in the

935
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,940
community really not understanding the
technology that's been present for years

936
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:53,790
sorry I with it you just with that as
well but your point apparently a

937
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:54,840
break-in at a community

938
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:57,980
absolutely as a going back to the
physical security aspect

939
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:03,180
911 horrible to tell the community day
after day after day getting blamed for

940
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:04,160
not catching

941
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,370
horrible tragedy for not catching for
not seeing

942
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:10,390
not knowing why didn't you wanted to
share what it knew this

943
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:14,200
any to self-destruct internally without
going outside your own community to

944
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,400
self-destruct internally

945
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,600
how do we have to catch help it with
your network and this sort of paranoia

946
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,760
absolutely takes over

947
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:24,520
I wouldn't say every analyst feels that
by I think organizationally we're seeing

948
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,110
a result

949
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:28,430
that and slow corporations move you're
still seeing impact

950
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:32,500
911 12 years you know thirteen years
later because that's how long it take to

951
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,260
move through an organization that barge

952
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:37,960
though you there's definitely value in
truth in what you're saying

953
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:41,310
I'm but there's harlem's realize that
and try to change things

954
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:45,070
again that goes to the vilifying the
personal aspect I'm at the slow moving

955
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:45,510
peace

956
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:52,510
not trying to justify a mattress you
should trust yeah

957
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:03,560
yes I

958
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:17,240
yeah
