1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,990
the morning my name is 20 years and i
said i work for

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,930
Intel Corporation a however to be very
clear

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,969
I'm not here representing Intel in no
way am i representing Intel they have no

4
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:16,890
opinion shared with me if anything I say
sounds offensive they probably think the

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:17,900
exact opposite

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,970
and they are absolutely well-intentioned
well-behaved and I'm not in any way

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,720
think that originally or arm

8
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,070
as an aside I'm going to be speaking
today about

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,630
actually implementing dynamic access
control and dynamic trust based controls

10
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,000
up your environment when Daniel first
saw the presentation

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,280
we were still in the process are
developing and implementing it

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,190
and I was a much younger and more
disaster can

13
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,070
optimistic sort of individual I'm now
somewhat Satter maybe a little wiser

14
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,860
the benefit is that you get to hear
about what actually worked

15
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,760
some gonna go through a bunch of
different topics

16
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,880
this is the general gender I prefer
questions during the talk

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,820
so please if you have any questions if I
went clear if I use a term that doesn't

18
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:05,729
make any sense

19
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,219
if I start putting random poetry find
all

20
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:12,439
let me know and I'll move on if you
don't ask questions

21
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:17,530
I'm a and I can guarantee my questions
to you will not have anything to do with

22
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:22,079
information security or technology I'll
probably be anatomy physiology for Los

23
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,530
the other things that are much less fun
so it's better that you ask questions

24
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,920
before we start

25
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,749
a jerk a man and his family walk into

26
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:39,539
a talent agent office and he says I have
the most amazing

27
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:44,539
did you look this up last night no less
from I have the most amazing act for you

28
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:48,109
housing society family

29
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:51,139
acts snow wat I'm sorry this

30
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:54,929
it's amazing audiences re: give it a
shot

31
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:59,639
I'm nothing to stop the job because I
continue I can guarantee at least half

32
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:01,170
the people here will be really offended

33
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,869
if you're curious about the joke
actually is look up the aristocrats

34
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:07,979
on YouTube you'll see an entire
documentary on

35
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,220
the most obscene and funny joke and
possibly a matter will leave it at that

36
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:18,740
or catch me tonight not be happens how's
your conversion as a joke

37
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,150
arm sup in

38
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,540
about 2,000 7

39
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,760
some teammates in mine and I were
running into some other standard

40
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,560
problems that I think everyone in that

41
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,710
computer security industries running to
if you do defense right he security in

42
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,290
any way

43
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:41,210
you know these issues we're seeing cloud
we were seeing by: oh we're seeing small

44
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,910
form factor we're seeing iPhone

45
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,020
we're seeing all these things and of
course the users wanted to play with

46
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,330
them they wanted access then they wanted
to use corporate resources from

47
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,950
I got some great questions like why
can't I use my home gaming system access

48
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,260
corporate resources

49
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,410
course the responses do you do your
taxes on the system

50
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,690
no of course not why would I do
something silly like that why do you

51
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,900
want to access our resource

52
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,860
but of course they do we have to find a
way to actually deliver this

53
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:11,190
the problem is even today most of your

54
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,100
access control models are completely
static you either have access or you

55
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,520
don't

56
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,460
and they're all focused on the user so

57
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:24,150
if I log in from my laptop I get the
same privileges I get

58
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,480
if I log in from my daughter's help

59
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,920
this is a little strange considering
that doesn't make

60
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,420
is a radically different things to
intuitively obvious those are different

61
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,670
if I log in from a secure data center

62
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,060
lance is the same as if I log in from

63
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,170
a cyber cafe in Russia are

64
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,230
or you know cyber cafe sitting out in
the end

65
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,010
outside and it's a sign these are bad
things to do it should be intuitively

66
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,040
different so we've had to come up with a
solution

67
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,290
and the goal was

68
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,830
in general we wanted to be able to let
users do something out of work for

69
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:05,840
any device they possibly could from any
location it was not necessarily

70
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,950
going to be the same kind of work but
they were going to be able to do

71
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,260
something from anywhere

72
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,890
we wanted it field at in Britain every
single application in our environment

73
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,310
huge number many thousands applications

74
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,939
so that they could dynamically change
the level of access that users had

75
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:24,729
based on our trust %uh that user in that
specific situation

76
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:28,659
we wanted the environment just kinda
magically know or remember I was younger

77
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:29,349
and more rain

78
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:34,949
how secure your combination that user
device location actually are

79
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:38,030
so that you can actually give the right
kind of actors or add an additional

80
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,520
supplemental controls

81
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,639
because really the answer no is
unacceptable how many have you actually

82
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:48,590
get the same no on a regular basis as IT
people to get to say no to your users

83
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,259
you know yet not many of us do the
answer always has to be

84
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,509
of find a way to deliver that behind a
way to make it secure a plane a way to

85
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:57,530
make it acceptable so how do you do that

86
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,990
this is what we're trying to do you have
to be able to characterize cloud

87
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,740
environments in the same way you do any
of these other combinations

88
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,289
so how do you do this well we came up
with this concept

89
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:10,900
we sat in a room in a basement the data
center for a week

90
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,270
the stuff kids under the door to us and
they didn't let us out

91
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,099
and by about half way through a week
after week killed off the weak ones and

92
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:21,029
those who needed sleep inward showing
signs of sanity

93
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,770
we finally scholars are coming up with
interesting ideas we came up with was

94
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,439
this concept other dynamic trust
calculation

95
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:31,979
the notion is that you have a source
trust calculation

96
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:35,379
your destination trust and the result of
this combination is

97
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:40,150
your actual level access this gets
recalculated every session establishment

98
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,289
based on response from you die I
detective controls

99
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:46,870
based on a change in the characteristics
that make up the trust calculation

100
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,300
part of what you're seeing here and part
of what we're aiming for is exactly what

101
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,590
affects mention which is

102
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,289
you have to be able to deal with
recovery you have to be able to deal

103
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:57,069
with changes in your buyer

104
00:05:57,069 --> 00:06:00,319
sup how does this work well the source

105
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,960
calculation looks like this who are you
who's the user

106
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,800
what device do you have feature set
operating system hardware anything that

107
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,449
might make a difference in terms of the
platform you're getting with

108
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:15,039
and where are you physically this is all
divided by your actual confidence in

109
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,059
this information so if you have strong
authentication

110
00:06:18,059 --> 00:06:22,559
then you have strong confidence in your
users if you have

111
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:26,219
nothing but an IP address thing have
very weak confidence in your location

112
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,439
information

113
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:32,110
if you have self-reported information
and if you remember the are

114
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,499
there are couple companies for a while
that we're offering computer security

115
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:36,520
assessment

116
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,889
a via web browser plugin their songs two
companies

117
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:43,569
your buddies here yeah it was a great
idea that you could assess the security

118
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,860
in Perth profile a computer

119
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,020
based on a web browser scan out that
system

120
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:54,789
that's absolutely high quality data that
is right there

121
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,139
destination who are you what the
receiving application is what people

122
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,699
bilities the receiving application is

123
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:04,550
what do you want but the data
classification where's the data located

124
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,020
and again where the date is located
comes into play for some interesting

125
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,020
reasons

126
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,809
the goal for this is that you make a
decision

127
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:16,180
maybe axis tonight maybe access allowed
really what you want though is more than

128
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,610
either one of those because access
allowed is easy right

129
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,729
that's we just give access people get
what they want

130
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:25,089
axis tonight is frankly almost always
unacceptably have to find something

131
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:25,800
better

132
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,240
what do you do you give restricted
monitored modified

133
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,580
mitigated access in the middle you
change access method

134
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,939
you reduce the access Europe increased
logging you do something else

135
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:41,400
the problem is in order to do this you
have to actually have the logic

136
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,139
that takes that source calculation and
that destination calculation and turns

137
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:46,339
it into a decision

138
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:50,039
about what kind of access you're
actually wanting to give somebody

139
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:54,550
all that stuff is what we can start
calling a trust model

140
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,650
my teammates smart people that they were

141
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,089
looked at me and said hey Toby you know
we think it would be really cool if you

142
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:03,589
would take this on a run this whole
trust model creation

143
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:07,789
thing we think he'd be the right person
to be a good idea

144
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:12,080
never trust a Roman various right are

145
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,469
are Greek you never trust preferred
biggest

146
00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:19,279
up sup what do we do well trader this
thing is called

147
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:22,589
but certainly a trust model the trust
model allows you to

148
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:25,610
define the characteristics

149
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:30,449
other system and how you determine trust
based on those characteristics

150
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:33,580
it defines what privileges are going to
be granted as a result of it

151
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,880
and what work or controls are actually
required as a result

152
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,889
%uh the Trust and the privileges this
sounds pretty simple

153
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:44,219
yeah pretty straightforward her

154
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:48,279
for some definitions you've got two
pieces are the trust model

155
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:52,290
trust level and access level the trust
level is made up a combination

156
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:55,250
argue the conference you have in the
user's identity the devices security

157
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,320
location security your method have
access

158
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,209
and it defines increasingly restricted
set up who can connect with what

159
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:05,550
and from where and how

160
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,560
this is getting a little complex
accessible the amount of consequence

161
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,540
possible this is not just about data

162
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,959
classification lot of people tend to
default to think only about data

163
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,410
classification

164
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,449
it's an interesting thought you know
declassification it's an easy concept

165
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:21,269
people like to hold on to it

166
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:26,220
but the reality is how much class play
date is there in something like the NS

167
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,480
very much about DHCP not a lot of hype

168
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,120
highly sensitive data about your when
routing configuration it's not really

169
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,170
sensitive

170
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,199
mean you don't want messed up but it's
not really sensitive

171
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:41,480
how would you feel if they went down all
of a sudden it really starts matter

172
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,820
which is why we talk about consequence
much more specifically the data

173
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,470
classification

174
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:50,550
so these definitions are very abstract
don't worry we'll work through it

175
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:54,699
a simple very basic sample of what it
access level

176
00:09:54,699 --> 00:09:58,440
definition could look like this is a
very simple fire simple one a friend

177
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,269
said this was a useful enough that I
should move it

178
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:04,170
too early in a slight so don't worry
we'll bounce around to it way that

179
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:08,649
and increasing level of access you got
data classification a consequence

180
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:12,300
Maxwell privileges you can feed in you
can see how this flows

181
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,319
your questions on this

182
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:19,899
don't worry will get back sample
Trussell

183
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:23,610
you've got trust level you've got a
series of characteristics

184
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,560
you've got the definitions for teachers
carrot sticks notice that

185
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,029
in here we've got very very coarse
pockets we got very large scale

186
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:32,630
definitions

187
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,819
this is one of the things we ran into a
little tell you why a little bit this

188
00:10:35,819 --> 00:10:36,940
was not work

189
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,269
where we want to start we want to start
with ultra-fine grained

190
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:43,920
we wanted to be able to say we don't
care what your operating system is but

191
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,250
we do care about you in person other
than is we care about what

192
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,949
your %ah SLR quality is we care about
what the ultimate death

193
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:54,399
care about your key late we care about
your privilege model for the system

194
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,149
would care about all these other things
we want to be able to evaluate them very

195
00:10:57,149 --> 00:10:58,920
distinctly we care about what the LLC

196
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,300
got we want to be able to evaluate each
of these characteristics very distinctly

197
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,680
this is much closer to where we ended up
and you'll see why the moment

198
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,779
so what do you do with these things well
the basic concept is

199
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:14,709
when you to Sherman somethings trust
level then you can also define the

200
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:15,360
defaulter

201
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,740
controls that you need for

202
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,639
and then you are given direct access to
the accessible

203
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:27,160
this looked at August this is really
silly why would this need any sort

204
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,380
complex logic why would you need in
logic of

205
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,550
this reason you end up needing some
logic is because

206
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,670
what you can do then is this

207
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,699
and this starts getting really really
interesting the customers

208
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:42,110
to employees to users to the people that
you start working with

209
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:46,139
because all of a sudden what you can do
is if you've got

210
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:51,000
a low trust device or mater trust vice
in this case

211
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,259
and they want access to low sensitivity
content or low consequence information

212
00:11:56,259 --> 00:11:59,879
you can start removing things that annoy
them you can start removing controls

213
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:02,170
that are expensive for complex to work
with

214
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,490
you can reduce your cost you can improve
your user experience which

215
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,529
matters to everyone this makes
everyone's life

216
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:12,870
easier you end up actually creating
better efficiencies UN appeal spend your

217
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,440
time on things that matter

218
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,949
this is where it starts being useful
have the difference between the trust

219
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:18,480
level

220
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,019
and the access level and this is why you
start reading something like

221
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:27,560
a trust law now do any work in
healthcare

222
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,819
anyone healthcare no and Carol

223
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:34,819
that's right the medical gayaa so
they're probably all over there

224
00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:38,370
so on what are the interesting things
years ago I was involved

225
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:41,550
in a little bit at the health care stuff
and what are the things that came up

226
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:44,699
was that it's a real problem to do

227
00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:48,069
data security for healthcare
environments because you don't wanna

228
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:51,139
risk somebody's life by not having
access to data

229
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:55,379
this is a critical problem you have to
find ways if the doctors about to give

230
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:58,730
you a shot they need to know whether you
are allergic to what they're going to

231
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:59,690
inject you with

232
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:03,949
and if they have to do a request for
access to that data

233
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,089
you're in real trouble you're probably
dead by the time that happened so the

234
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:10,480
have this term you yet doesn't go

235
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,199
they have this term that they use which
is called break glass

236
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:18,079
it is like are with the om fire alarm

237
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,410
case of emergency break glass anyone can
do it

238
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:25,209
but you see that it has been done have
the ability to detect you have emergency

239
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:26,220
access

240
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,379
are Intel runs I don't know if you're
where they they they do a lot of

241
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:31,579
manufacturing

242
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:34,819
maybe you know it the they make things

243
00:13:34,819 --> 00:13:38,490
it's the lifeblood it's what they do
better than anyone

244
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:41,930
else in the world they have higher
quality chip development chip

245
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,870
manufacturing than anyone in the world

246
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,379
a coworker of mine said I want to be
able to sit in the most in secure

247
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:49,410
environment you can possibly think of

248
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:53,800
and do fall manufacturing facility
administration from there

249
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,410
why I don't know what's going on in your
life difficult that make this possible

250
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:57,930
for me

251
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,230
so I starting about how you do this the
beauty of the trust morrow

252
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,970
is that you can start defining this
concept to break glass access

253
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,050
let's say you're nowhere near your
computer

254
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:11,089
had a couple beers too many to drive you
know

255
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:14,759
15 2013 something like that you really
can't drive

256
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:17,620
but you need to get online deal with
something in the emergency if you're in

257
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,589
a position where normally you would not
be able to access it

258
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:24,019
if you are in this scenario where you
were sitting at trust level 1

259
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:27,029
and you need to be able to get trust
level 5 normally

260
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:31,399
your fault however when you start
looking at this sort of borrowing a look

261
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,959
at the adaptive controls

262
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:38,060
you have the ability to say this is an
emergency I wanna break glass option

263
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:42,910
now the normal answer for how you
implement a break last option is you say

264
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,540
alright fine we're just gonna break all
the rules were going to ignore in this

265
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,480
moment we're going to accept the risk

266
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,490
how many have you heard the phrase
accept the risk

267
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,560
yeah how many if you like the way that
sounds

268
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,860
now me neither give you a little its you
feel a little

269
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,250
dying inside just don't wanna cry a
little got

270
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,980
so the it's not a good thing so

271
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,050
the goal here is to allow you to create
the option %uh

272
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:11,300
how to do that emergency access that
emergency elevation

273
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,569
without having to accept risk one other
things that I've concluded as

274
00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:18,769
heart creating the trust model for this
is that you should not have to accept a

275
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:19,689
risk

276
00:15:19,689 --> 00:15:23,050
you should be able to choose to do so
but if you are being forced to it means

277
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,529
you were not sufficiently creative in
your design

278
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:27,990
you can come up with the right controls
you can have the right options you can

279
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:30,300
plan ahead and

280
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,230
this is where it starts getting really
useful in this is where we really start

281
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,759
getting very positive response this is
how we actually got funding to build

282
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:40,120
assuming we have time I'll actually show
demo what this trial actually looks like

283
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,620
and I got onto devices

284
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,860
another option any other example this is
what variable authentication looks like

285
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,449
so

286
00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:49,930
you go back to the previous model you
have the option to be able to reduce

287
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,139
controls

288
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:54,449
and gain access to more stock if you are
all the top

289
00:15:54,449 --> 00:15:58,639
use your device trust level on left you
see your target accessible

290
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,790
you can think this is where you want to
get to your own a strong secure device

291
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:06,480
and you don't care about the high
sensitivity the data action

292
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,050
you can give somebody really weak
authentication and all of a sudden

293
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,170
they're user experience is better

294
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:15,170
their life is better it gets in their
way less they're more efficient this is

295
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,769
a good thing for them

296
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:20,139
this allows you to give them better
access and this defines that sort of

297
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:21,339
dynamic change

298
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:24,649
access now

299
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:27,930
what you're seeing here is an example of
why this has been fairly hard to

300
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:28,620
visualize

301
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,839
and one other problems I had with it
because you have to figure out how to go

302
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:32,949
from

303
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:36,009
a view like this and like this

304
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:41,689
to a very four or five dimensional view
and it's a pain in the neck

305
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:45,649
I would love to hear people's thoughts
if you have any afterwards

306
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:48,930
so some other requirements when we sat
down to write the trust model

307
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:52,370
we needed something that can be verified
has to be able to be checked to be

308
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,920
correct you don't want

309
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,139
nondeterministic endings on this you
needed to be specific you need to be

310
00:16:57,139 --> 00:16:57,839
able to be

311
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,100
predictable again and again needs to be
logical indefensible

312
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,140
why does it need to be logically
indefensible well because somebody's

313
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,439
going to come along and say

314
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,900
you're not letting me do what I want I
think your model is messed up wrong and

315
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,250
here's why you should make an exception
for me

316
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,270
it's interesting you'll end up with
actually at least I ended up with

317
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:19,659
to responses first was

318
00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:22,839
this is too complex we need fewer levels

319
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:26,059
why don't we just have three was the
default answer

320
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:28,919
and then as soon as there is something
that they didn't get access to that they

321
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:30,150
wanted

322
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,200
the response was you need more granular
do you need more fine-grained you needed

323
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,710
to be

324
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:37,179
more complex so you have to have
something that is consistently

325
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:38,130
defensible

326
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:41,840
and explainable to people so you can
have very clear distinctions

327
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,450
now if you go back and I'll do so in a
moment to the

328
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:50,549
I trust levels you'll see very clearly
distinct at each level where the break

329
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:52,880
is it's a very logical break

330
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,520
doesn't need to be consistently changing
it something that doesn't have to be

331
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,799
updated every month when there's a new
piece of software being released

332
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,730
enables flexible controls eliminates
unnecessary controls you need this

333
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:07,429
to be predictable because if users can't
understand and anticipate what access

334
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:09,600
they're going to have

335
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,990
they're going to get confused and
they're not gonna want to use it needs

336
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:15,470
to be explainable not just to yourself
and to your peers

337
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,350
it needs to be explainable to the
engineers have to build it needs to be

338
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:22,429
explainable to the users who are going
to have to interact with it

339
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:25,720
it means integrate smoothly with
existing solutions if you contradict

340
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,919
everything that you've implemented to
date

341
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,080
you're not going to get this accepted
anywhere

342
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,130
has have the user experience and finally
you can't have magically come up with

343
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:38,900
new things and you can't just magically
say are going to have trusted secure GPS

344
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,940
location data

345
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,559
we don't know how this will come in ODIs
but we trust that a fairy will come

346
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,409
along and deliver it to us

347
00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:47,900
so you have to work with what you've got
so in theory

348
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,220
this is where we start this is Anna what
you saw

349
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,130
we were going to have a highly granular
highly dynamic model

350
00:18:55,130 --> 00:19:00,419
implementing the up trust model such
they could respond a subtle changes the

351
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:04,070
tiniest change a deal I'll change in the
system we're going to implement this

352
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:07,880
it was going to directly integrate with
all the applications in our environment

353
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,460
so you could transparently manage access
to each well as applications on the flaw

354
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,770
so the change a little subtle thing your
behavior changes slightly

355
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:19,289
and we can adjust for that we can modify
other controls

356
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:22,539
you're going to actually take and
location into account in a very fine

357
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:25,470
green we had this notion that we're
going to differentiate between

358
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,850
airport and coffee shops and your home
and the office

359
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:32,200
and which countries your it

360
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,159
that was the theory a great theory I
love this theory I was really excited

361
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:36,830
about it

362
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:40,190
let me start trying to actually write
this

363
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,960
what you run into highly granular ends
at meaning

364
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,000
you purely hard to validate you cannot
validate this

365
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,480
at least I'm not smart enough to do a
lot of the validation necessary for this

366
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,299
this is very much like rating a are

367
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:59,720
provably correct operating system this
is this is a a a

368
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,159
from the real issue is this the Orange
Book a ya

369
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:07,610
term for our provably correct operates
this measure

370
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:10,820
a one anyone operating system

371
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:15,059
this is really hard to do as soon as you
get complex it becomes impossible

372
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:18,940
highly dynamic means that users confused
if they're access changes because they

373
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,159
walk from one room to another

374
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:24,390
they're gonna be really upset they don't
like this it's a problem

375
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,700
and more to the point it's difficult to
support

376
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,750
so if the tech support people can't

377
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:34,390
determine whether a loss of access was a
mistake

378
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:37,630
or intentional how are they supposed to
say yes this work correctly or not

379
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,130
what's going to be the answer

380
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:43,529
let's turn it off the turn of you lose
so it has to be able to explain

381
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:47,669
applications applications are really not
very good at dealing with the concept of

382
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:50,409
anything more than a user

383
00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:54,370
so what do you do about this well you
can start creating multiple users

384
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:59,580
how many people in this room have two
devices on the right now

385
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:04,320
at least you how many have three any
more than three

386
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,059
no so I i have at least three I have for
right now

387
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,929
are what are the ways you can listen to
create separate user agency could have

388
00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:16,360
toi plus laptop Toby plus phone Toby
plus

389
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,630
I Pablito B-plus you

390
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:22,659
a refrigerator whatever you've got

391
00:21:22,659 --> 00:21:27,779
of course this means that if you have
10,000 users you just multiply that by

392
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:28,720
four

393
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,899
you've got a hundred thousand users you
rapidly creating a ridiculously large

394
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:32,730
user base

395
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:36,429
and how do you maintain the separable
privileges with the sufficient level of

396
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:37,059
overlapping

397
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:42,580
her critics abt don't do this well

398
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:47,140
what do you do when you change a
provision in the military and action

399
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,929
yeah breaks things pretty badly has in
it all the sudden something you were in

400
00:21:50,929 --> 00:21:51,880
the middle dealing

401
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,240
and your actresses are know your
permission to change sorry you can't go

402
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,330
back and cancel this transaction is you
don't have that permission anymore

403
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,460
oh and by the way you can actually move
forward with this transaction so what

404
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,330
are you going to do about this

405
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:06,710
in addition how do you get all these
actually with you know especially if

406
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:09,100
you're dealing with maps that are not
your product if you're dealing with

407
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,000
internally supported applications

408
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,909
these are things that very likely don't
have a lot of money in them

409
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:21,110
watsup dimensions this is hard to
visualize when I started looking at all

410
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:24,510
characteristics just in the trust model
alone in trying to explain

411
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,659
how a reduction in one piece but the
result in

412
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:30,720
a need for increase in something else
and the concept that

413
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,470
you had to have multiple factors that
moved up simultaneously well

414
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:39,250
a getting access to something it's
really hard to explain it visualizes and

415
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:39,909
I'm not

416
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:43,630
good enough artist to draw this for
people trying to describe it is

417
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,220
difficult enough

418
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,919
so if you can't visualize it you're not
going to be able to explain it to most

419
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:49,500
people

420
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,059
and eventually 11 other work I'd like to
go to others in things are

421
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:55,520
done this for a while I wanted something
else you need to be able to pass this

422
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,220
along other people

423
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:03,679
location location was probably one of my
largest disappointments

424
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,929
what do use trust know these are
trustworthy

425
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:10,200
you can't trust you can maybe trust GPS
data

426
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,270
a little bit of course the question is
how do you get the GPS data

427
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:16,490
get it from the application we trust
applications right

428
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:20,679
that stress right you trust are use you
try you trust I

429
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:23,940
the the operating system sure ray

430
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,710
why not and and of course nobody can
actually speak GPS that's impossible

431
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:32,510
right so when the news well the
interesting thing is that none of these

432
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,440
are worthwhile the only one that we
actually found that we could trust

433
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,620
was our own logs I love

434
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,860
devices connecting to our network

435
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,720
so in the end all we could effectively
determine was are the on our physical

436
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,679
process

437
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:51,820
private Persie's or are they not are the
connected to our network or are they not

438
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,860
that's awesome but if you've got a
device with a cellular modem in it

439
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,690
what difference does it make in what's
actually changing in their security

440
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:03,590
based on that location much less than
you'd actually think

441
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:06,940
we did start taking your account but
really nowhere near the level of

442
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,919
subtlety in interest that you would
actually think

443
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:12,360
this is coming at some point this is
going to be the case

444
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,330
and there are some interesting products
as a company called perspex is that as a

445
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,510
cloud proxy

446
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:20,799
were things that they can implement is
the use very weak geolocation night at

447
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,890
to determine whether he should have
access to something or not this is

448
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:25,390
interesting if for instance

449
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:28,929
you're dealing with the German works
councils on privacy and you need to make

450
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:31,769
data only available from within Germany

451
00:24:31,769 --> 00:24:36,179
it's coming but it's not here yet

452
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:39,630
sup which are looking at this

453
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:43,360
why do we build it well the answer is
that we looked around and nobody was

454
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,659
actually implementing this

455
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:48,340
we starting about this five years ago
there is nothing on the market these all

456
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,159
things are starting to come along

457
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,279
I'll there's no actually one company
mobile system 7

458
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,090
their really interesting there
absolutely worth looking at if you are

459
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,710
curious about this sort of thing

460
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:01,390
you should go check them out they are
really doing it stop

461
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:05,570
they hide the entire trust model and
they do a very intensely because it's a

462
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,440
pain in the neck to build what are these
and most people don't wanna holler

463
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,390
Microsoft got a little bit you've got a
detective authentication but it's really

464
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:15,460
not adaptive Access Control it's just
changing global authentication and

465
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,909
that's probably the smallest piece of
this

466
00:25:18,909 --> 00:25:22,919
missed it a little bit there's nothing
open source anywhere

467
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:26,010
so we had to build

468
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,470
any questions at this point

469
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:34,149
no blindingly obvious confused as hell

470
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:37,419
somewhere between your wake so

471
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:40,990
Lexington owner welcomed what do we do

472
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:44,880
we started with the natural choke point
we wanted to implement this internally

473
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,820
we want to implement this against all
applications everywhere

474
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,399
there's a very hot spot repair art
unfortunately

475
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:57,289
the reality is that getting it I did all
the applications really was not going to

476
00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:00,380
be a feasible place to start so we look
for choke point remote access was the

477
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,350
right simple choice for us to do so

478
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:06,090
we decided we would build there and we
would try to prove the system in would

479
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:09,370
build out from there an expanded out
from there actually now at the point

480
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:11,240
where we are expanding our

481
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,350
we could do the trust model itself into
a database

482
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:18,460
as the fundamental logic for the system
simply because it was easier to do it

483
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,029
that way

484
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:22,880
this is a first implementation was a
perfect concept it was a place to start

485
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,510
the Gateway square the trust broker to
determine how to handle the connection

486
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:29,679
you get an appropriate access level
based on that result

487
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:34,120
very simple we did this based on you AG
you can do it on a five you can do with

488
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,750
anything for whatever remote access

489
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:39,450
nung you have the concept of a truck you
can deliver different roles to users we

490
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:42,640
created a front-end for that would allow
us to dynamically change the

491
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,899
I authentication mechanism I can show
you that I

492
00:26:45,899 --> 00:26:50,370
at the end car this talk is not about
that P so this is about the actual

493
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:54,850
trust model that we built first wanted
to find what doesn't change so

494
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:57,370
as I started looking at this probably
realize it was getting really big and

495
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:58,169
really ugly

496
00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:02,230
wanna start eliminating as much as the
as it %uh as much as possible

497
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:05,820
a very smart friend a mine a reverse
engineer said that

498
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,700
when it comes to reversing what you
really are doing is you're not trying to

499
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,649
figure out what all the code does you're
trying to figure out how much for the

500
00:27:13,649 --> 00:27:15,159
code you can ignore

501
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:19,809
so that you don't pay attention to it
doctor rate arm

502
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:23,519
yeah and it was Billy and so I started
looking here to what I could limit

503
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:26,669
this doesn't change anything about usurp
religious is an important one

504
00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:30,049
understand users don't get any more
access than they would have

505
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:34,010
for themselves you're just modifying
relax this doesn't change regulatory

506
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:37,090
requirements you still that privacy
regulations you still that's awesome so

507
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:37,880
that paper

508
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,610
you still got anything else you can come
up with financial laws

509
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:45,600
all these are two things they still
apply nothing changes about any of them

510
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,950
in fact if anything this is just the way
I love

511
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:52,279
reinforcing those you define your
destination variables you need to know

512
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:54,919
your data classifications are for the
environment you need to know how many

513
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:56,870
levels are going to have

514
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:59,960
I started with as few as I could come up
with

515
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,200
and then I got pushed add a couple more
and

516
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,210
at this point I'm fighting aggressively
we've got five in a bit

517
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:11,970
and I'm fighting wrestling to keep it
out from growing any more than that I

518
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,519
started at four

519
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:18,409
and for now dancing around six and it's
not pleasant

520
00:28:18,409 --> 00:28:21,769
but its where we're standing up for the
moment define your source

521
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:24,730
characteristics this is where you start
getting into fun things

522
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:28,299
go wild play for a while thank you for
all the sweet things that you might want

523
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:29,950
to care about insider a platform

524
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:33,070
enjoy it luxuriate in the joy in the
night

525
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,750
detailed being able to actually come up
with all these things that you care

526
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,850
about

527
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:41,200
and then crumple it up and throw it away
and start getting much marinara list of

528
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:41,880
things

529
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,880
but you're going to come up with this
long list of device features

530
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,340
of hard work to module interesting
things

531
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:52,490
TPM all the search thing operating
systems you want to accomplish a

532
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:55,750
fine grain granular access control
inside the operating system

533
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:59,350
you want actual different users so for
instance if you actually care about

534
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,380
somebody being

535
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:03,789
able to be separated into more than user
and administrator

536
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:06,970
you might as well say goodbye to Android
right

537
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:11,500
because it doesn't have any other
options are there user admin on Apr

538
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,360
you want more fine-grained miss you
start thinking about these details

539
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,299
determine what options you have for
mitigating controls these are all the

540
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,179
things that are going to like elevate

541
00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:23,190
him forty or respond to

542
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:27,600
any of the unusual situations these are
you the tools in your toolbox

543
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,830
these are always consider any of them
perfect solutions absolutely not but

544
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,419
there are things that you used to say

545
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:35,789
re: you are at a lower level of trust me
want to get to a higher level

546
00:29:35,789 --> 00:29:39,279
access these are some other tricks that
we can use to modify it

547
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,340
these are some the tricks that we can
use to reduce the risk

548
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:46,049
and maintain an acceptable level address
to that were not at actually taking on

549
00:29:46,049 --> 00:29:47,139
more risk than we are

550
00:29:47,139 --> 00:29:51,200
we have figure out how your gonna
collect the information

551
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,090
you want to get it from the device you
want to get from the infrastructure I'll

552
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,169
give you a hint

553
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:58,700
much of the information that you need
you're probably already collected

554
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,730
Active Directory was using it your must

555
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:05,000
a India yeah somebody's using ActiveSync

556
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,639
yeah you already got a huge amount of
this information coming into you've got

557
00:30:08,639 --> 00:30:09,889
DHCP data

558
00:30:09,889 --> 00:30:12,830
you've got user information you've got a
huge amount of information that you

559
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:13,190
heard

560
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:16,289
tipping their caps you just need to pull
it in and start looking at it in

561
00:30:16,289 --> 00:30:18,130
combination

562
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:20,919
figure out how into the characteristic
stick together and how they're going to

563
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,539
impact each other

564
00:30:22,539 --> 00:30:26,309
so this is where you start getting into
the really hard puzzle some

565
00:30:26,309 --> 00:30:28,730
characteristics as they get stronger

566
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:32,190
make other characteristics less
important so for instance

567
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:36,570
if you have really well secure device

568
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:40,559
authentication is maybe doesn't need to
be quite as resilient

569
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,779
if you've got a very weak device if
you've got a very insecure device you

570
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:47,139
need of medication that's not going to
be able to be duplicated

571
00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:50,559
if you've got a very secure location

572
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,929
maybe you don't actually need transport
layer option is strongly

573
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:58,080
maybe you can use self signed cert maybe
you can do other sorts of things

574
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,169
this is where you start getting in the
actual mapping love controls and

575
00:31:01,169 --> 00:31:03,669
characteristics against each other

576
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:06,690
you're going to be writing this all down
find some way to write it all down and

577
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:07,940
start tying it together

578
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:11,730
I used a combination I love had paper

579
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:14,950
Vizio arm OneNote

580
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:20,169
text files I I tried every possible
thing I could come up with

581
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:23,740
and I didn't find one perfect model for
it

582
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:26,779
if anyone has ideas on ways to put this
together I'd be really interested to

583
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:31,090
hear

584
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:35,350
separate out your source and target I
didn't actually wanted to use it first

585
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:38,440
at the beginning there is only trust all
there's not going to be accessible

586
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,409
problem is you can't talk about the
elevation or the

587
00:31:42,409 --> 00:31:47,419
I dropdown from across the hall to a
different access levels unless you

588
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:49,340
separate out those concepts

589
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,880
and so you need to have them actually
distinct so you can say I met russell

590
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,100
398 get Russell 5 I'm a trustable to an
immediate Russell 1

591
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,200
are actually personal accessible yes to
do it

592
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,230
arm you want to keep them separate
because it lets you talk about that

593
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,289
differing set

594
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:10,009
are requirements and that offset
leverage all existing information

595
00:32:10,009 --> 00:32:11,250
sources like I said

596
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:15,730
you're going to take advantage of these

597
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:18,779
see start by classifying the
applications into access level you're

598
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:21,649
going to end up needing to put together
some definition a process for this

599
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:23,519
rather than trying to talk about

600
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,820
the applications and the details of what
they're actually doing

601
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,779
start defining and applications access
level itself

602
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:34,630
you start with coarse-grained definition
this application for this purpose

603
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:38,159
what this ends up meaning is that you
actually have

604
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,399
multiple applications for the same
purpose so you think this is a little

605
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:42,269
weird but you realize

606
00:32:42,269 --> 00:32:44,649
actually probably already doing this
today thinking about you're probably

607
00:32:44,649 --> 00:32:45,269
using

608
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:50,529
one mail client one native mail client
or model that Mitt native mail clients

609
00:32:50,529 --> 00:32:53,600
you deliver email separately and
differently

610
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,820
via ActiveSync or via a MDM

611
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,570
to small form factor devices there are
multiple different ways that you handle

612
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,309
this

613
00:33:01,309 --> 00:33:04,539
you're already doing something similar
to this today

614
00:33:04,539 --> 00:33:07,440
use flexible languages goes back to the
problem wanting to have something that

615
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,210
maintains and survives over a longer
period

616
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:13,380
if you get too prescriptive here you're
gonna see me talk about this again and

617
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,990
again if you get too prescriptive you're
not going to have the flexibility to say

618
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,889
how do we deal with this with the new
platform

619
00:33:17,889 --> 00:33:24,769
how do you deal with this with the new
environment

620
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:28,370
what are the interesting things I start
telling you about the the

621
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:31,700
desire to say our grandfather s a lower
talk about that we're going to talk

622
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,909
about colonel security we're gonna talk
about

623
00:33:33,909 --> 00:33:37,240
access control model and talk about the
lol sign a rental

624
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,340
diskettes impossible to manage

625
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:46,340
realize though that when we talk about
privileges we frequently use

626
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:49,919
containers we talk about pockets when
you say admin access

627
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,419
admin access doesn't mean anything

628
00:33:53,419 --> 00:33:58,600
its a term used to describe a large
amount of privilege

629
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,669
right so what you're talking about here
as you start reading those buckets

630
00:34:02,669 --> 00:34:06,330
I love characteristics and description
see can say things like

631
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:10,169
you must have a modern operating system
you must have a managed device

632
00:34:10,169 --> 00:34:13,869
you must have a current patch system

633
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:16,770
you were able to create these buckets
that make it much easier for you to

634
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:19,770
reason about these sorts of things

635
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:23,569
you start finding a privilege that scan
these all have to be generic enough

636
00:34:23,569 --> 00:34:27,629
that you can easily defend them and
break them into multiple chocks

637
00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:31,819
data classification user versus admin
versus big admin

638
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:35,599
how many different levels administrator
which one house

639
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,310
parts you separate out your user
administrators from you or

640
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:42,970
device administrators do separate out
your

641
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:46,780
client administration from your server
administration

642
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:50,210
to separate out your server
administration from your infrastructure

643
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,480
administration

644
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,069
infrastructure from your high
sensitivity application

645
00:34:55,069 --> 00:34:59,060
I sent it to the application from your
skater

646
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:02,369
start separating out these buckets you
want to think about how many you have

647
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:05,680
all the sudden when you start looking at
this you'll see

648
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,240
that

649
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,230
the trust model that you've got up

650
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:18,680
here you start wanting to have it

651
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,250
break very cleanly between jocks so

652
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:27,290
data residence at this level there's no
information

653
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:31,380
still the data residence very cleanly
limited data residence

654
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:34,579
always in her kid full day to residents

655
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:38,740
user authentication device management
nothing it trust level 0

656
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:42,030
still nothing partially managed

657
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:45,450
fully managed Queen defensible
explainable

658
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:50,550
blocks so you can say this is why there
is a difference between trust level 1&2

659
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:54,869
trust level 2&3 trust level whatever
this is how you start defining all those

660
00:35:54,869 --> 00:35:56,890
characteristics against each other

661
00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:00,359
likewise here how do you describe it

662
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:03,400
for standard user privileges and you'll
actually potentially break these out

663
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,349
more detail than I have here

664
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:08,770
to actually add an additional layers
here but this is where you start be able

665
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:11,310
to find those different characteristics
because I can guarantee you someone's

666
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:13,359
gonna come along and say

667
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:17,589
I think that I should be able to do this
thing from a lower level of trust

668
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:21,060
and that it should be at the lower level
trust pearly and you need to build

669
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,510
explained very clearly

670
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:26,400
why it's not a subtle distinction why
it's a big pocket and a big clear

671
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:33,400
obvious one

672
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,559
so

673
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:49,279
define your requirements use big buckets
like I've been saying

674
00:36:49,279 --> 00:36:52,509
Windows 7 Windows a Iowa skirt version

675
00:36:52,509 --> 00:36:56,709
Android current version you don't want
to try and say must have a soñar

676
00:36:56,709 --> 00:37:00,049
with this level of readiness I was
really displayed on which could be

677
00:37:00,049 --> 00:37:02,829
say things like that because really that
gets you to an interesting little

678
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:04,299
granularity and much more

679
00:37:04,299 --> 00:37:08,159
nuanced but it's impossible to manage

680
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,789
it just it doesn't work you cannot
manage at that level of complexity

681
00:37:11,789 --> 00:37:14,349
know he's going to keep track of it
nobody's going to be able to understand

682
00:37:14,349 --> 00:37:15,029
it

683
00:37:15,029 --> 00:37:19,309
and in the end it doesn't change of
enough to matter that significantly

684
00:37:19,309 --> 00:37:24,849
what have we gotten so far

685
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:29,239
so y'all have been fairly quiet but the
interesting thing is we've actually

686
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:29,679
gotten

687
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:33,449
really good results users have been
really impressed with it are

688
00:37:33,449 --> 00:37:36,649
we've been getting the process of
evaluating applications we got that

689
00:37:36,649 --> 00:37:39,519
pretty standardize app owners are
getting used to a pretty regularly

690
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:42,789
and we actually know have it fully
implemented would you be interested in

691
00:37:42,789 --> 00:37:43,849
seeing what this looks like

692
00:37:43,849 --> 00:37:47,549
yeah kar so I to

693
00:37:47,549 --> 00:37:51,359
I my daughter is here with me and I took
advantage of being prepared

694
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:55,059
to abuse her phone are because I can do
that

695
00:37:55,059 --> 00:37:59,239
so will start we'll see cape may refer

696
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:03,369
think of world

697
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:08,829
that's right you

698
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:11,889
on okay so

699
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:17,149
a we'll see captured

700
00:38:17,149 --> 00:38:24,149
is let's see if this works

701
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:28,870
perfect okay so this is my photo

702
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:32,040
this is a fully managed device are

703
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,850
indian-controlled current operating
system patched up to date running all

704
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,010
the necessary controls

705
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:40,330
it is a small form factor device and
there are limitations to what it can do

706
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:42,340
so it's not as secure as you might want

707
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:45,420
however see what this looks like

708
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:52,020
love it all backwards

709
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:59,020
okay serious

710
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:10,160
her

711
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,710
at K so

712
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:20,010
this is probably unreadable what you
should be able to see there is

713
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:24,260
based on security definitions your
device is trust level 3

714
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:28,470
and you'll see an entire list about the
cations

715
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:32,180
which are being weighed it out because
this is hard to look at

716
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:35,819
but

717
00:39:35,819 --> 00:39:39,250
notice that it went directly to it you
didn't see me doing on the

718
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,119
authentication

719
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:43,369
that's because the list about occasions
and I'm accessing are all

720
00:39:43,369 --> 00:39:47,309
either at the current roster or lower
trust level this is using a hardware

721
00:39:47,309 --> 00:39:48,510
type certificate

722
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:52,230
it's locked to the device the device is
fully mansion fully control

723
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:56,730
means that we decided for the
appropriate level access we don't need

724
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,260
to do any additional authentication

725
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:02,380
now in contrast ok its device

726
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:06,770
I lewd I tap

727
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:10,390
says determine trust level on this one

728
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:13,339
it kicks me and says that way to me you
actually have to have additional

729
00:40:13,339 --> 00:40:14,420
authentication

730
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:18,069
we're gonna require you to enter no TP
so

731
00:40:18,069 --> 00:40:22,030
Isaiah go ahead it possibly in and says

732
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:27,500
authenticate going to give it

733
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:34,480
actual indication here

734
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,430
and no I'm not gonna show you what I'm
sure on but its

735
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:44,640
a in this case music 30 people spin and

736
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,340
on this one well by the way the session
lifetime

737
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:52,420
is defined in part by your location so
on this world things we've done is

738
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:56,120
if you're in a position where your
device is likely to be stolen your

739
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:01,150
session lifetime drops down to
ridiculously short andia

740
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:04,440
affect is around you can actually do
anything anyways

741
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,390
so and again what you see here is

742
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:11,330
a different list about occasions now the
interesting thing is that there is some

743
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,090
similarity

744
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:15,310
see if I can it's not going to be
visible enough to actually give you the

745
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,040
distinction

746
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:20,080
unfortunately but there's actually is on
this one maybe you can see

747
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,540
the trust level there me that at all

748
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:26,700
not really mom this one a struggle to

749
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:31,410
on managed device unknown device but it
does have certain characteristics that

750
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:33,760
are installed on it there certain
information we've known about it

751
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,030
same operating system same user
different applications

752
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:40,860
different level privilege different
level access but I can still do work if

753
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,340
I need to from her device

754
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:45,680
so I need to get the surprise
information for instance I need to book

755
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,260
a bridge

756
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:49,460
your phone bridger conference bridge I
can do if I need to look up employee

757
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:49,940
data

758
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,630
I can potentially do certain pieces of
it on this device without actually

759
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:54,620
having to

760
00:41:54,620 --> 00:42:00,140
are change the security device without
having to be more invasive than really

761
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,630
is necessary on the device

762
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:05,900
this is what people have been asking us
for in this is why they like

763
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,790
because all the sudden when that you
have users who don't want to you to

764
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:09,920
control their device

765
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,950
you can actually give them some level
access so effectively what we got

766
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:19,070
is same user same location two very
different levels of access from two

767
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,010
distinct devices

768
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:23,140
and if I uninstall the Indian of your
this will

769
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:27,090
dynamically drop the session and I can
reestablish when it will be a lower

770
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:27,820
level of trust

771
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:31,100
so that the demo on

772
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:37,470
hopefully it was interesting arm future
work

773
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:40,700
we're going of here a

774
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,630
we're turning into an API currently so
we actually are driving towards the

775
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,040
model

776
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:50,200
love being able to in to rate this
directly with applications

777
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,390
how quickly applications are actually
able to use it it's going to be an

778
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:55,190
interesting question we're not quite
sure

779
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:58,890
I start playing with that move a little
bit Saunders akron-based policy decision

780
00:42:58,890 --> 00:42:59,580
systems

781
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:02,720
are really interesting for this and they
look like the right way probably

782
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,010
describe a lot this language some the
modeling tools actually look pretty good

783
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:06,660
for

784
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,810
funny options for dealing with legacy I

785
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:12,350
we're still trying to figure out what
this looks like it's probably gonna end

786
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:15,620
up looking very similar to what is on
here which is basically a

787
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:19,070
gateway that gives you control and
limited access to it and creating

788
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:20,190
multiple different levels

789
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:23,290
Mar access for the different
applications and finally

790
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:26,380
integrating dynamic modification attack
detective controls

791
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:30,100
this is a challenge you wouldn't think
that it would be in the first place

792
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:34,100
but how many have you remember I IDS
based shining

793
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:37,550
and if you remember yeah how many have
you

794
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:42,390
made the mistake of turning that on yeah
I like your idea say hey wait a minute

795
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:43,770
that looks like about IP

796
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:48,250
I'll look we've just blocked the 0000
slash

797
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,620
everything on we've just destroyed are
in town

798
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:56,350
yes so very very subtly very close
slowly were moving through in moving

799
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:57,200
into this model

800
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,410
your make

801
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:04,930
but so right now percentage

802
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:09,290
right now we're probably in given that
we've got

803
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:13,630
thousands of applications we're probably
in the

804
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:18,970
I'll under 10 percent right now and part
of that is because we are allowing

805
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:22,390
arm the application owners to push

806
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:27,180
the implementation rather than requiring
them to move into it so we we've been

807
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:30,920
are letting them come to us at their own
pace based on the user request we've

808
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,490
basically been letting user demand

809
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:36,920
drive the move are the applications in
the space and as that's moved along

810
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:42,040
I it's start to accelerate and so we're
seeing many more apps on a regular basis

811
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:42,530
come in

812
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:47,090
on at this point we're seeing a couple
week at it on

813
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:53,310
and we're going to the point where it's
actually not too hard to do conclusions

814
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:57,420
a trust model will actually allow you to
give users

815
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,870
increased access without increasing your
risk

816
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:05,000
if you're accepting additional risk you
really are doing something wrong

817
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,310
you don't have to do it you can choose
to do it because

818
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:11,660
you want to save money but you don't
have to accept additional risk you can

819
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:13,450
actually give people access

820
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:16,130
with a RBI while with their personal
information with their personal devices

821
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,640
all the strange places

822
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:24,640
without actually having to accept more
risk

823
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:29,980
up

824
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:33,740
on that note thank you troopers is over
a pair

825
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:37,210
yeah up right right exactly

826
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:41,110
you gonna have to make this a portable
the nuanced and finally settle things

827
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:44,360
are not going to necessarily be what you
start with this has to be something that

828
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,520
your technical support team can actually

829
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:49,680
help your users into land use and take
advantage of

830
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,520
you have to have y'all have engineers
they can build it you have to be able to

831
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,220
explain it

832
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:58,980
everybody you know the users were bad
enough the engineers working in the neck

833
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:02,860
but management was a real challenge
finding ways to explain

834
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:07,560
how this works your managers was a real
difficult thing to do

835
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,270
doing it right is going to take a lot of
time I thought this would be a fairly

836
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:11,420
fast thing

837
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:15,120
arm I got asked about it in

838
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:19,290
November one year and figured ok it'll
take me a month at you

839
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:24,350
or take train from time I was still
polishing a year later

840
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:28,170
are I've gone through so many revisions
and so many variations on it just took a

841
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:30,580
tremendous amount of time to actually
implement

842
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:33,990
and to do it right and you're going to
want to take the time because you do

843
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:35,340
need to do the validation

844
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:37,750
the validation actually ended up being
probably one of the biggest challenges

845
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:38,520
is

846
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,450
I wouldn't start the process I tried it
out and I'd start doing the validation

847
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:44,370
and IV the run into the fact that I

848
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:48,340
couldn't figure out how to validate
something on or I would find a hole in

849
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:50,540
my logic and I have to go back and I
change it

850
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:53,440
and then yes sir the validation process
entirely over and it's a pain in the

851
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,440
neck

852
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,440
keep it simple keep it really simple
because frankly

853
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,270
you probably not clever enough to do all
the interesting things that you can

854
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:01,980
think of

855
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:05,670
I was I'm looking for people who are
more clever than I am to do more

856
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:09,290
the interesting things but they have
more fun doing other stuff

857
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:12,270
granular is going to spiral out of
control every time you add a variable

858
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:14,900
every time you added to mention the
starts getting bigger and harder to

859
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,880
handle and manage

860
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,970
this is the end up all you guys have all
been fairly by 11

861
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:27,970
quickly any questions at this point yeah

862
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:34,710
well so I am the security guy

863
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:38,860
arm I'm actually I think although
there's a huge number of us

864
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:41,960
%uh so that's actually really
interesting point on the people came up

865
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,380
with this concept for the security

866
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:47,950
are this came as security team it came
out of our frustration at having to say

867
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:52,150
you want this new thing we're going to
have to spend a million dollars to build

868
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:55,230
all the infrastructure for we don't have
anything that crosses over we don't have

869
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:55,680
anything

870
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,590
art one other things that they did very
intentionally as when I started doing

871
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:01,190
the security architecture for this

872
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:05,220
I had other people in the security
organization take over the

873
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:09,690
penetration testing and the security
review for you can edit your own work

874
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:13,920
I fundamentally and you can't debug your
own cum

875
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,240
it just doesn't you can't do it well on
so

876
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,190
they're actually pretty happy with it I
want to challenge them so running into

877
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:22,890
with some with them

878
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:26,090
is the issue of explaining it to them in
that goes back to

879
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:28,730
keeping it simple enough that you can
actually communicate this to other

880
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:29,270
people

881
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:33,100
by for the most part how they like it
actually quite a bit because

882
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:36,260
it gives them the option instead of
having to accept more risk in

883
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:40,580
except bad ideas they can say are what
mitigating controls are we going to use

884
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:42,200
what options are we going to have

885
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:46,040
I it gives a significant ability should
not be

886
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:49,290
forced into a corner that the pro love
being a security guy

887
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:53,190
is somebody's going to come along and
say I know that you need strong

888
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:55,850
authentication I know that you need to
secure connection I know that you need

889
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,120
total device control

890
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:01,040
but we have an emergency and somebody
needs to update our land

891
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,380
routing tables from cyber cafe in Russia

892
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:07,660
and they have no

893
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:11,720
yeah and they have no authentication and
they have no heart token and

894
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,770
you can certainly trust their connection
because thats

895
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:18,740
are you know who would bother d'amato to
compromise around in cybercafe

896
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:25,010
Russian yeah so they're actually they're
pretty happy with the beauty here as you

897
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:25,570
can say

898
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:29,040
we actually have a model that allows you
to deal with that situation

899
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:33,840
Turk

900
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:37,810
absolute on this sure so I'll give you
an implementation are an example

901
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:41,750
a for exactly the scenario that i just
described which is you have an emergency

902
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:46,420
and so many needs access to some
application that is not in this set

903
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:50,470
very intentionally or they are there at
a friends house there are

904
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:55,050
apartment and they need emergency access
to

905
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:58,470
something that is just not accessible
what we created was

906
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:01,620
are a model

907
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:05,900
that allowed you to temporarily

908
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:09,900
get access to our show what he went
through them all that we use we create a

909
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,350
situation where if you're

910
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:14,540
up a approved administrator

911
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:18,100
with a certain level of privilege and
your management has agreed to it

912
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:22,090
you register your phone number you then
go to

913
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:25,100
are and externally available website

914
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:29,220
external email website you go and you
login

915
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:32,930
with your existing otep and

916
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:38,090
I your a couple other credentials and
you say I need to start an emergency

917
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:38,540
session

918
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:44,150
if at that point you get a response back
to your phone

919
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:48,870
that's a session to and you then go to a
separate site

920
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:52,720
use the session token in addition to the
various kinds authentication and

921
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,080
at this point you have said I need to
start an emergency session

922
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,500
with giving you the ability to for a
very limited period of time start that

923
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,020
session

924
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:04,320
and once you start that session you then
get of all terminal

925
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:07,450
remote access at the same time your

926
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:12,190
managers notified you're notified and
the other people with the same kinds of

927
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:15,040
accessing our fights that we've got
multiple levels and

928
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,090
notification you also are only allowed
to do this a certain number

929
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:22,860
times we debated how many of how many
times but we basically said you don't

930
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:25,400
get to do this more than about twice a
quarter

931
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:30,430
get oil

932
00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:36,670
a little actually know in real time

933
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:39,800
so see the question with military
operations into the secure operation

934
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,510
centers one group that's notified

935
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:45,520
and while they may not go and monitor
the application that you're acting with

936
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,080
directly

937
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:49,450
you can expect somebody shop at your
desk the next day and say why are you

938
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:50,230
doing this in

939
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:53,780
the luxury good your managers well in
say where you where this did you approve

940
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:54,080
it

941
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,870
do you know about this now will this
prevent somebody from doing something

942
00:51:57,870 --> 00:51:59,890
horrible in that window

943
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:03,420
not necessarily but that's why to break
glass in there

944
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:07,990
the idea is that yes we are giving this
emergency access the other thing is that

945
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:12,260
we are intentionally didn't make it easy
I just describe a fairly complex and

946
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,500
painful set of steps

947
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,030
which if you're three sheets to the wind
at a party

948
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:19,430
you really are going to want to go
through but the point is that isn't

949
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:22,410
supposed to be easy this is supposed to
be emergency access the you don't use

950
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:23,670
very often

951
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:26,760
and by making it only emergency exits
you free yourself from a lot of the

952
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,000
standard search have

953
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,580
positive user experience issues that you
would run into

954
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:35,850
that makes sense

955
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:39,430
no comment are we've tested actually at
lunchtimes

956
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:42,820
I we have I we have

957
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:46,230
we try we try to avoid using I mean
really if you're using the break last

958
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:47,100
option you

959
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:49,850
missed something but yeah we've had a
couple cases where its action if

960
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:50,660
necessary

961
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:54,600
and are people have been

962
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:58,860
I think the first time it was actually
was it was very satisfying first time

963
00:52:58,860 --> 00:52:59,280
the

964
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,530
the admin was catching and bitching and
whining and moaning about how difficult

965
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:04,780
it was to use

966
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:08,320
and we pointed out that the other option
was that they could get back in the car

967
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:12,420
and drive two hours into the site and do
everything that they need to from the

968
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:14,940
physical location because they were the
ones who managed to be in the wrong

969
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:16,640
place when they're on a call

970
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:21,250
and in the shower and and said thank you
very much for creating this thing that

971
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:24,120
makes our life so much more useful

972
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:31,120
they work very well for that other
questions

973
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:46,290
yep

974
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:50,290
absolutes so to be clear that one of the
break glass options that's not the only

975
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:50,870
one

976
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:54,050
%ah to question was what do you do about
deadlocks in this goes back to

977
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:57,380
Center disaster recovery sorta questions
is enough if you're depending on

978
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:00,080
authentication system in the
authentication system goes down what you

979
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:00,460
do

980
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:04,920
answers I we've implemented differently
class solutions for different parts the

981
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,920
environment we've also got standard
Disaster Recovery Pro implementations

982
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,530
that had a lot of the scenarios

983
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:13,700
it's like you always have a dial in line
for your router because you really just

984
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:17,210
always need to make sure you've got
cereal access session

985
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:20,410
I'd not necessarily special plan B but

986
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:23,870
I said a distinct disaster recovery
options that are pretty Center discussed

987
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:24,120
as

988
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:27,720
in some level this is kinda Dr parts
that don't change

989
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:31,360
you know it for every critical interest
BC researcher you need to have a

990
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,640
disaster recovery planning business
continuity plan

991
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:38,080
this is no different so you implement a
disaster recovery plan you figure out

992
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,210
how you're going to get in

993
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:42,400
if this system is down yes you're not
going to be able to use it if the

994
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,850
authentication Ford is down

995
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:48,840
if that happens at the same time as
other critical infrastructure failures

996
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:52,180
then you start having cascading
consequences and that becomes a question

997
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,280
of how many

998
00:54:53,280 --> 00:55:00,280
sa simultaneous failures you want to
plan for and budget to Cup

999
00:55:04,089 --> 00:55:10,030
cool

1000
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:17,030
to

1001
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:25,750
yes but it doesn't become the question
is why would you not for the disaster

1002
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:28,410
recovery options is part of a trust
model and the answer is

1003
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:32,690
I you take into account in building the
solution you don't necessarily have to

1004
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:35,240
characterize it as part of the trust
model itself

1005
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:39,550
so you have to have a plan in the
disaster recovery model

1006
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:42,830
you have to have a plan that there is
one but it's not part of the trust

1007
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:44,390
calculation because it's

1008
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:49,250
orthogonal its its a separate function
it doesn't actually be integrated

1009
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:53,440
arm and trying to be a better situation
should probably do it afterwards during

1010
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:53,880
a break

1011
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:57,070
yeah you'll be around I will you

1012
00:55:57,070 --> 00:56:00,550
confront

1013
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:05,710
said I'm easy to find they're also more
papers on the surrender

1014
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:10,080
yeah occur their papers on this on
Intel's website you can find them you

1015
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,860
can also but me and thusly and I will

1016
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:15,890
happily talk your ear off about this if
you have ideas on making it better I'd

1017
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:16,750
love to hear

1018
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:19,870
there are very few people that are
working in the space and it would be

1019
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:21,450
willing to get some better ideas

1020
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:23,550
if there's nothing else to go
