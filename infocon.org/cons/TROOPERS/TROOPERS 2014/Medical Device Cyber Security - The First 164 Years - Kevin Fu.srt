1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,529
sacks I was chairing a session at USENIX
security I'll ask so who's heard music

2
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:08,140
security

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,440
manage its ok it's sort of a US centric
thing I'm chairing the conference itself

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,270
this year

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,990
we have a record I think over 1,000
authors have submitted papers this year

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,840
we're in the middle %uh reviewing them
now

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,339
and we had I think about 250 submissions
so it's quite

8
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:27,339
challenge but glad to be here glad to
come out

9
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:30,880
I'm I'm gonna talk about medical device
acuity day I and I saw

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,970
for in stock this morning so it will be
I think

11
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:38,030
dovetailing in with some other themes
and I come from the world the Bakken

12
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,199
dnes I'm a professor about computer
science and engineering out at Michigan

13
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:47,660
I'm where I director a a center for
medical device security in industrial

14
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:52,210
supported center for medical by security
and whenever I get these kinda talk they

15
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,070
always have a disclosure slide because

16
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,559
a you this is traditionally what we do
when anything involving patient care

17
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,300
generally

18
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,140
you talk about your various funding
sources single read this on your own

19
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:02,780
time

20
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,030
I one interesting point maybe I'll a
raises the third bullet there is

21
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,250
actually some standardization going on
right now in the world medical device

22
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,290
security mainly driven by the industry

23
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:16,640
and the regulators the regulators
basically bring the industry to the

24
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,340
table

25
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,979
and so that they start to talk with each
other and

26
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:24,470
not gonna speak directly about the
standards making doesn't make for

27
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,640
the most exciting talk talk about
standards and

28
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,439
but but we'll talk about it indirectly
am

29
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,630
so one we might hurt some the the
research I've been up to

30
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,780
I'm a dates back to

31
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,840
gosh what they are used so I used to
work in on hospital I T in the

32
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,229
early nineteen nineties in the
mid-nineteen ninety's and we had to roll

33
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:46,780
out

34
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:51,180
paperless a medical record system is
what is called at the time

35
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,240
and so we put computers in every single
patient room we had

36
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,119
these little un solid state he's with
the positions in the nurses could

37
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,469
authenticate to

38
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:03,799
enter all their data and of course
everything works right

39
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,060
now I so it was quite a challenge to see

40
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,090
how introducing not only computing but
of the security into the medical

41
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,160
a community was was very challenging

42
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,810
and I think person I think it's mainly
because ovens in the human aspect that

43
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,400
we often ignore or downplay is not
technical enough

44
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,310
and but I was part of a big team back in
2008 were reanalyzed

45
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,010
defibrillators are bred actually won a
long on I

46
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,800
if I can trust you to give this back
I'll pass it around

47
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,590
it's been the danger so it's got
smallpox in the shock

48
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,870
shocking ports and but in this isn't so
this

49
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,849
please don't take this it's it said

50
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:50,170
all okay alright but here he wants you
to different later isn't there you go

51
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,930
it's from a patient no longer needs it

52
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:57,170
and and then on this is a an electrode

53
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,940
a I you know actually what happened is
he

54
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:06,760
got a replacement 3 got a new device up

55
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,769
and this is a an example the electrodes
that are moving through a sacrifice

56
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:11,700
blood vessel

57
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,970
the Nano usually depends on the country
in Germany I believe they do a little

58
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,069
bit different than the US

59
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:20,230
but this is woven through a blood vessel
and then

60
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,170
at the tip because he looks like a
grappling hook there's a but two

61
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,700
different styles but this one's more
like a grappling hook this actually is

62
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,459
inside the chamber

63
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,450
part doing both sensing as well as
sending shocks whether it be pacing

64
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,879
shocks such a tiny shocks

65
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:35,500
we're different relationship talks with
which a much larger young pass it around

66
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,159
to

67
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,260
I'm just please make sure comes back but

68
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,879
this just one example a medical device
and I'm gonna talk about a home in two

69
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,379
different kinds of devices today

70
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:48,689
but as mention this morning and so the
US Food and Drug Administration is

71
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:51,739
yesterday driving the conversation right
now globally

72
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:56,079
there the first regulator I'm aware of
who's released draft guidance on what

73
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,260
they expect to see

74
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:02,620
for manufacturers when it comes to cyber
security and to an IT security or to a

75
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,840
security specialist

76
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,180
you might dismiss some love what FDA is
saying is true like

77
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,500
pedestrian elementary but it's actually
huge step forward compared with the used

78
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,060
to have

79
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,360
and I think the rest the world a certain
watching to see what happens in the

80
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,220
United States when this becomes final
guidance in about to

81
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,580
I think seven months so wanna talk about
today the time I talk is that the first

82
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,470
hundred sixty five or so years about
medical by security the reason why bring

83
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,120
that up

84
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,480
is on there's a Hungarian a

85
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,970
doctor who did a study

86
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:39,950
on but 165 years ago and he basically
said you know physicians are to wash

87
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,900
their hands

88
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,400
if they're working in the morgue in the
morning and then they go to work with

89
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,200
patients later in the afternoon

90
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,800
because if you wash your hands the
patients are less likely to die

91
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,560
he did a control study we had two
different groups of students

92
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,100
those who wash their hands in those who
didn't in the statistics were

93
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,190
overwhelming

94
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,200
you know it anyone who saw the
statistics it should be obvious yes you

95
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,340
should wash your hands

96
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,380
it was met with the Nile I one position
responded doctors are gentleman and

97
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,920
therefore their hands are always clean

98
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,340
and and to this day we still had trouble
with some basic hand washing technique

99
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,930
a in in clinical care but I'll try to
draw some parallels with

100
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:19,070
the the world security I'm

101
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:22,100
so but before I could answer to the doom
and gloom and

102
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,610
actually it's not all doom and gloom i
think is actually a lot of hope on the

103
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,300
horizon but i wanna talk about to some
other benefits

104
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,320
so there a lot of things out there that
you could do mechanically are using

105
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,140
purely analog components

106
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,330
but there's certain kinds of therapies
where just be extremely difficult to do

107
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,890
without some kind of computation

108
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,920
so for instance a left ventricular
assist devices a is a little pump that's

109
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,070
implanted in the body it's basically a

110
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,790
a bypass pathway for blood I actually
did what

111
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,280
and in recent reports showing that it
has improvements over the earlier

112
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,400
purely mechanical model and and there's
a lot of work going on in radiation

113
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,580
therapy

114
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,180
would be difficult to do without
computers of course computers also

115
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,020
introduce new risks of their own

116
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,070
and you can just go read that there are
25 report from the early 1990s if you

117
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,580
wanna know about

118
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:10,280
risk silver suffered radiation therapy

119
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,400
but what I for front cover and we're
gonna try to cover a lot of ground here

120
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,360
not just security bit of a safety to
give you certain context

121
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,540
a what how the

122
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,630
safety community thinks about security

123
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:26,840
where they learn this morning at with
the heel height:

124
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,060
a him right okay

125
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,480
so up anyone here position

126
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,420
okay all rights well and you're going to
all becomes her to sue doctors at the

127
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,900
end to this at least as far as an
implantable scale

128
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,020
so and let me give you a quick history
tour a peacemaker sandifer later so

129
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,450
about fifty years ago

130
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,760
the first peacemaker was implanted
actually used to be

131
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,730
a rather large external advice needed
the nurse big burly nurse actually

132
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,380
carted around for you in the batteries
external

133
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,470
on but then it was made small enough to
implant

134
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:02,190
beneath the clavicle in actually in
Germany I understand that they

135
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:05,870
implanted beneath the muscle for
cosmetic reasons but in the US

136
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:09,330
it's more typically do above the muscle
and but UNC have a

137
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,550
what's called a Juan it's using
something on inductive coupling kinda

138
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,790
like an RFID tag

139
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:17,170
and its setting it to 60 beats per
minute but was

140
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:21,700
interesting to me was that in around
2003

141
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,730
was when the major medical device
manufacturers began to introduce with I

142
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:28,150
would consider forms of wireless
communication and networking

143
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:31,370
is limited but but but it was sort of a
milestone

144
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,940
in the design of these devices am

145
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:39,020
so here's a picture uva a min early
implantable

146
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,650
cardiac device an and

147
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:47,230
this is not wirelessly controllable
there is no kinda RF interface to change

148
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:47,850
it

149
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:52,910
so one a how do you think he would
change device

150
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,310
if you don't have wireless control

151
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:00,100
crack them open crack one open the
patient

152
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,850
yeah so the in the old days the way you
can actually change the settings on an

153
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:04,690
implant is

154
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,180
this is not actually this little metal
is not actually there to hold it up

155
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,210
that's actually how they change the
settings

156
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:13,630
you take a needle yes the patient to
raise their arms pointed to their armpit

157
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,450
in the new twist a potentiometer

158
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,890
and that allows you to change the rate

159
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:22,670
so they're actually extremely good
clinical reasons to introduce wireless

160
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,230
communication

161
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,990
because this is an issue sterility you
were introducing

162
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,600
potential infections and actually
infections is the

163
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,030
leading cause of complications as well
as death

164
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:38,110
for the routine implantation

165
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,250
course I can go all willy nilly with
wireless I'm

166
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,740
and things get a lil bit crazy I in the
US I don't know if this product is

167
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,000
available here we have this protocol
beakers and they say just put bacon on

168
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,770
everything that makes

169
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:53,900
everything bit better and I i've sensed
this with wireless communication is

170
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,850
prickly on every medical license was
make it better but

171
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,510
I'm not not always and so on my
colleagues at the food and drug

172
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,280
administration actually

173
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,600
he put out a little a assert a 101 on
wireless security lease with the

174
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,310
regulators look for

175
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,820
I'm here's a quote they look for safe
secure and reliable wireless medical by

176
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,830
systems

177
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:16,360
and they talk about what they expect to
see from manufactures when they're

178
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,660
putting the device through what's called
the fight 10k clearance process this is

179
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,260
a

180
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,070
a regulatory pathway to get permission
to market a device in every country or

181
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,720
something

182
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,370
fairly similar am back peacemakers so

183
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:32,590
I'm but 2007 or so hours to go around
calling places trying to get pacemakers

184
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,670
and most people have hung up on me

185
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:39,260
on but I I found a sympathetic position
after reading his research papers in his

186
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,480
medical journals

187
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,940
and and its kinda cool when she opens
things up a

188
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:48,000
on the inside the vast majority of
volume and weight is just battery

189
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,010
a very high and battery today typically
needed to solve any oxide

190
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,830
and but a very small sliver that is
actually used for pacing

191
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,300
more for deferred relation mostly his
wife answer like overhead for the

192
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:04,750
the the the microcontroller up what's
also interesting is just trends in

193
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,110
software and medical devices

194
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,210
am so not going to bore you with all the
data but

195
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:14,840
on suffice to say in 2006 there's
assertive magic milestone in the medical

196
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,150
community were now

197
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:19,440
mom most medical devices use computation

198
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,880
and software not just in the design of
the device but in the actual operation

199
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,970
and so different leaders pacemakers they
all have

200
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,910
firmware and pretty much every device
I'm wearing today has some kind of stuff

201
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,400
are involved

202
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,910
I'm such as kitchen ideas into the scope
here and

203
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:39,020
and giving idea of just how software FX

204
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,150
recalls leasing United States on

205
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:46,390
there were over 537 recalls because I've
software-related

206
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:50,760
issues and this affected about one and a
half million different devices

207
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,250
on the market

208
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,420
okay so before get to the security part
I Y again

209
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,420
cover though the ground with safety but
I think you'll

210
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,770
immediately be able to see some the
security ramifications

211
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:08,720
so on various countries run databases
this happens to be the US database exam

212
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,030
II I'm more familiar with the US system
this is a an infusion pump

213
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:18,150
and what happens is when a clinician
sees patient injured

214
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:21,590
or killed they are required to report
this

215
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:24,040
if they just see something goes wrong
they don't have to report it but

216
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,350
sometimes they do

217
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,440
on here's the dialogue that was
submitted by the manufacturer you notice

218
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,010
I highlighted buffer overflow

219
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:36,210
on so what happened on this pump with
the buffer overflow

220
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:39,280
welp a the patient was

221
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,550
under does what happened is this pump so
the

222
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:47,080
let me explain an infusion pump is a
this is a little bedside device

223
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,380
it had you typically see a bag a saline
in a bag of other drugs in the computer

224
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,350
is what

225
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:57,010
mixing the cocktail of drugs that's been
put through vein into your body

226
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:00,340
am so in this particular case when the
pump experienced a buffer overflow it

227
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,760
its safety a failsafe was to turn off

228
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,980
I'm so when it turned off the drug start
going in but unfortunately as patient

229
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,690
needed the drugs to live

230
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:14,050
so this caused increased intracranial
pressure followed by brain death

231
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:18,050
like most powerful overflows this was
very difficult to reproduce

232
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:22,190
at service time but they actually
figured out later on that I had to do

233
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:25,310
user lately but there was taken by a
software upgrade

234
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:29,340
so apparently this both buffer overflow
had been there for years but just

235
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:34,470
and actually on manifested itself until
the software update

236
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:38,360
am so that's just an example through the
low-hanging fruit

237
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,160
that we're gonna find inside medical
devices today

238
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,480
on I want to emphasize to the human
element we we have a tendency so I'm not

239
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,900
I teach cryptography I have background
did my doctor working cryptogram how

240
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,170
since I love crypto in math but

241
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:57,950
unfortunately it comes to medical
devices there there are some

242
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:02,750
I think arguably as important perhaps
more important issues with human factors

243
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,850
so

244
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:08,470
let me just give you an idea of how what
is it like to work with medical devices

245
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:13,370
when people do get harmed by the advice
for people were killed

246
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:17,740
forgetting security problems for just a
moment I there been over 500 s

247
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:22,470
linked to malfunctions or problems with
these infusion pumps

248
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:26,680
I'm usually having to do with the user
interface or or the software itself

249
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:31,800
so on my wife claims that I did this a
we had a child just experiment to get my

250
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,390
hands on some medical devices she wanted
to remain anonymous

251
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:38,180
so that's me that's are pumping that our
baby

252
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,640
on be fuel pump in the back years on

253
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,120
a rackmount a infusion pump system if
you've got three different

254
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,410
sort of modules to it this happens to be
one that was recalled a few years ago

255
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,700
met the guy who had been put in charge
recalling it he said he had to

256
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,110
physically shred the metal

257
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:01,010
when these devices were recalled I'm but
over 700 deaths were linked to these

258
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,910
kinds of devices because I've

259
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,760
incorrect dosage that is the nurse
entered the wrong data

260
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,580
but don't blame the nurse gotta think
about the user interface to

261
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:14,950
as well as now functions and software
let me give an example of the kinds have

262
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:15,510
just

263
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:19,860
really sir did a drop-dead horrible

264
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,230
user interface issues a

265
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:27,670
recent history so this is an implantable
infusion pump it doesn't typically

266
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,370
happen in

267
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:32,610
and exit has earth a little a a
semi-permeable membrane we can replenish

268
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,490
the drugs

269
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,510
analog port work and does the drugs into
the body

270
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:40,070
and then on the left is the user
interface that the

271
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:45,660
a health care professional uses to type
in %uh the kind of drug delivery rates

272
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:50,120
so I'm can anyone see a what is the size
the ball is what what

273
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,130
how much drugs in the body in for how
long

274
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:59,360
kinda hard to see so let's assume in
there I'm so if the if you see there's a

275
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,330
single both duration:

276
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:05,120
and it says well we're gonna do it for
20 minutes and 12

277
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,339
seconds for a fixed amount of drug

278
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:12,790
so that pump is then going to it act on
that command

279
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:17,570
so this is a picture of the user
interface after the recall was issued

280
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:21,820
so can anyone guess what was wrong in
the original user interface

281
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:28,640
that would lead to potential death

282
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,649
the date yeah so they're only eight
things missing from the

283
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:36,300
earlier user interface each age colon m
callin s

284
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,850
s so what happened was this user
interface was presented to the health

285
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,240
care professional in a way

286
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,570
that encouraged error making is very
easy to mix up

287
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,670
minutes and hours so what happened

288
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:52,960
a according to the report in Ft Mon
database

289
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,130
is that this patient was discovered to
have given

290
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:59,470
a a quantum a drug this is a ball s

291
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,080
this is a chronic quantity over a twenty
minutes instead of twenty hours so this

292
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,100
is a sixty times overdose

293
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,660
I'm and don't forget this is an
implanted pump am

294
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,920
the recall was very simple it said we
labeled it

295
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,700
you know FDA requires manufactured label
it unfortunately for this patient

296
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,870
I here she passed out while driving
because

297
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:24,500
up the pomp and then later died after
the family remove life support so

298
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,520
I don't know if you can argue that the
user interface directly killed the

299
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,170
patient but it certainly was a key
contributing factor

300
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:35,910
to those risks oh and I guess I have one
out of order slight but

301
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:39,510
in there you go I gotta put it there
center near not too far from Italy

302
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:45,190
and a but let me move forward

303
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:49,740
okay so that's an example the safety
world to just to put it

304
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,270
in in context patients are injured and
killed

305
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:56,490
all the time from problems and medical
devices and

306
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,110
in the safety world you think about risk
management anything about balancing risk

307
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:03,540
anything about on basically population

308
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,520
so you and public health I am so they
don't usually think about the whole

309
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,990
thing individual person as much as they
do

310
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:13,429
population so when they're deciding when
a regulator deciding whether to approve

311
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:14,780
a clear

312
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,420
a new device they have to think will
more people if we prove it

313
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,589
or more people if we don't I it's not a
matter of

314
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:26,069
a will people be harmed or not its

315
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:29,290
all about relative risk see gotta keep
that in mind especially comes to

316
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,510
security

317
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:34,370
because just because there's a security
problem doesn't necessarily mean

318
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,929
the risk is going to be different
perhaps fewer people will be harmed if

319
00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:38,480
you don't

320
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,550
deploy security solution but you need to
make an argument for that

321
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:47,929
so I'm when I think about security think
most exciting things management

322
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:51,030
a anyone here manager okay

323
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:55,650
a good I'm so I used to collect on the
easel dialog boxes whenever I get a

324
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,809
software update on my computer

325
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:01,240
nowadays it just happens I know but even
tells me I guess

326
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,380
on but this happens on medical devices
to

327
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,740
I'm so you might recall a few years ago

328
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,460
there is no problem with McAfee software
update

329
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,500
I where the McAfee software the
antivirus program accidentally

330
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,440
misclassified a critical Windows DLL as
malicious

331
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,870
and quarantined it on after the
quarantine this

332
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:26,710
its a basically went into this blue
screen of death

333
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:30,309
and as it is constantly lockup in

334
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,580
have to reboot every time now

335
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,380
actually this is the loaner computer so
miss

336
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,760
I actually left my computer at home so

337
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:45,210
on in

338
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,630
she didn't update your computer recently
where do i click

339
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:52,420
30

340
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,140
good

341
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,580
just getting okay okay

342
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:01,320
but not that this actually happens in
hospitals thank you thank you very much

343
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,780
thank you very much tonight folks I

344
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:09,740
try the veal a so this actually happens
in hospitals

345
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:13,830
the some other problems are you would be
amazed what clinicians have to deal with

346
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:18,310
I recently saw a picture from a hospital
a big Kerberos authentication login

347
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,250
system

348
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,990
after the electronic health records
where it was so poorly designed from

349
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,960
user interface perspective the
clinicians actually put a piece of tape

350
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,480
up on the monitor with a big
experiencing don't click here and

351
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,390
literally

352
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,290
it's a piece of tape you know the old
joke about putting white-out on the

353
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:33,680
screen

354
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,100
actually did this because the user
interfaces are so bad

355
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:41,600
but down anyhow in this case a in some
hospitals they stop admission admitting

356
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,310
patients

357
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:45,350
except for those with severe issues like
gun shot wounds because just the system

358
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,210
wouldn't work

359
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:49,620
I'm how now we're

360
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,380
here's another issue though users are
kinda helpless so by User I mean

361
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,810
providers hospitals

362
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:58,710
people in hospitals because they're the
at the end of the day they need to treat

363
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,470
patients

364
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,670
and they need to procure systems to
treat patients doesn't matter if they're

365
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,090
safe doesn't matter to secure they need
to treat patients

366
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:08,450
and so imagine if you're told

367
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:11,520
well you know you just invest in a
quarter million dollars in a pack system

368
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,960
which we learned as a picture archiving
communication system

369
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,550
but it needs to run on an old version of
Windows XP

370
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,760
would you do you downgrade right

371
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,830
so downgrade to service pack 2

372
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,830
and then when you put your security had
on like oh wait a minute

373
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:30,760
on service first Service Pack 2 ended
years ago

374
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,980
a Microsoft isn't supported anymore and
moreover it has Windows XP in general

375
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,050
goes of support on April 8th this year
so there are still products

376
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:42,080
in development that are going to be
using Windows XP in yet

377
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,530
its offer life cycle is is just
completely incompatible

378
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:49,160
with what one would expect in in a
clinical care

379
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,570
and it brings up all sorts of securing
compliance risks some other software so

380
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:56,300
all that Microsoft doesn't even have
dates anymore

381
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,950
on is it's just amazing the difference
in

382
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:04,860
suffer life cycles used in general I T E
verses in the medical device community

383
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,250
am so FDA used to issue

384
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:12,660
this this certified this guidance that I
poked fun at quite a bit called shared

385
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,200
responsibility these two just

386
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,040
the 100 ministration would tell
manufactured hospitals but please just

387
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,790
get along

388
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:22,830
you know everybody let's work together
on

389
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:26,780
and so of course nothing happened rate
so they would say keep your systems up

390
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,950
to date you manufacture should update
the software and in

391
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,080
and very few manufactures providers were
able to

392
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,840
to do actual things from so recently FDA
has issued much

393
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,480
I think more specific I didn't smoke
mostly for the manufacturing side

394
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,930
because that's what they regulate

395
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:46,130
and I think it will actually a improve
security not solve it improve

396
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:50,240
so you know managerial issues who's
covered I think we are

397
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,520
I'm but down let's get into that the
security side now that

398
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,600
I've seen you a little bit through the
safety stories 9:30 begin to understand

399
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,860
oh this is why people don't like me when
I come to them with security issues

400
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,790
on so let's think about the the world
sabotage for a moment

401
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:09,990
I'm so again back in Nam 2007-2008 we
did this to

402
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:14,920
analysis of a deferred for later and we
wanted to know how secure was it because

403
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,250
it was using some kind of wireless
communication

404
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:21,150
so one a study this by going into the
operating room in seeing a number of

405
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:24,380
patients getting the implantations to
just learn the workflow and how things

406
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,070
work

407
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:28,460
and basically goes through four steps
and the doctor

408
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:32,520
actually team about us 527

409
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,880
it depends in in the US they actually
have a nurse just for billing

410
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:40,590
on so so it depends on what country inn
but you have about a half dozen people

411
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:43,950
maybe one or two surgeons they said
certain patient information on the

412
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,490
device was the device by the way

413
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:48,870
to quick I her care I'll take that back

414
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:53,510
for I I've left the Sun many podiums and
I get the email at a conference saying

415
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:59,110
you're gonna be shocked but on so after
that you you set the patient information

416
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,670
the the team surgically implanted
beneath the clavicle typically

417
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:06,030
and then test the defibrillation and
typically

418
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:09,050
this is what it looks like you have
fluoroscopy going on

419
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:12,610
this is a a form a bomb a

420
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:16,160
being able to to see actually where the
electrode is being woven through the

421
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,950
blood vessels

422
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:20,020
and then typically the patient later
receive than at home

423
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,670
monitor this is like a little base
station and it clicks information from

424
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,630
the implant

425
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:28,530
and then provides it to the clinicians
in the cloud

426
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:31,680
quote securely and so

427
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,390
I'm at the time I was really curious but
stern price you could find too much

428
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:39,700
out about it so I gave crack team of
graduate students a defibrillator an

429
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,980
oscilloscope

430
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,470
they went another key for nine months
and when they came out they said

431
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,900
okay we got am so I'll

432
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,540
get gotta keep in mind these are these
are computer scientist who didn't know

433
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,880
anything about a lot to engineering

434
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,310
so they they did all the symbol decoding
the modulation

435
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:59,470
and they discover there's no encryption
at all on this particular defibrillator

436
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:03,600
so in terms privacy see basically
everything isn't clear

437
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,320
using a you know the US art piece of a
defined radio

438
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,990
we have they were able to you basically
decode everything going on between

439
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:15,200
with the positions used to program a
device and the device

440
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,590
basically an entire electronic health
record but privacy some people care

441
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,910
deeply about privacy some people don't

442
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:26,460
and I think there are many patients who
if they had to choose between living

443
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,460
we're giving up some privacy thing many
patients would choose to live

444
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:34,330
if they have to make that choice on but
when it comes to security

445
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:37,690
and we are very curious about this you
know a

446
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:40,800
what we're kinda defensive measures were
in place and so this this is widely

447
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,050
known now

448
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:45,270
on but you see what we did was a

449
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:50,110
I took out a antenna from in all
pacemaker connected to a soccer radio

450
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:53,520
and then we we recorded literally this
is a really gross hack

451
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,950
we just recorded basically the analog
communication and then replayed it

452
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:01,530
on so if you recall on

453
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:05,210
I said that when the implantation
happens needs that the positions

454
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:08,760
tests to make sure that the implant is
properly planted

455
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,080
how do you think the team tests if the
deferred later

456
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,640
is properly implanted in a patient's

457
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,460
I would you test you send shock okay
send a shock here

458
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:26,170
a heart which is a normal sinus rhythm
is still fine

459
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:30,240
you have to induce a deadly heart rhythm
so built into every device is a wireless

460
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,880
debugging command to induce particular
formulation which is a a

461
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,430
a deadly her to them so I'm wearin it's
called a command shock

462
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:40,920
so we recorded this command shock

463
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,960
and then we replayed it and before we
did that we recorded the command to

464
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,640
disable all therapies

465
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,620
and so we disabled all the therapy
basically all the triggering events that

466
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,400
would

467
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,410
stop the life-saving shock and then we
sent the shock that would induce the

468
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:58,240
ventricular fibrillation we couldn't
find anyone willing to do this

469
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,610
breast so we we had to do it in vitro

470
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:06,170
and but it did indeed working we
measured a large shock coming out a bit

471
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:09,760
and some students at MIT recently
recreated this on

472
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,950
on on a more modern than we did it on
the inductive coupling interface which

473
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,460
was in the kill her strange

474
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:19,670
at the MIT folks did in the four hundred
megahertz range us that's far afield

475
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:23,330
you talkin several meters I believe that
on the order like 10

476
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:27,910
her forty meters or so what they're able
to get

477
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:31,370
kills well I'm but gotta keep in mind
though I

478
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:35,270
they are having to balance security and
safety they could have done better

479
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:38,910
but on this is this is worth a side note

480
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:42,380
I think unlike many

481
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,760
so you take elektronik voting for a
moment from when I can reserve

482
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,030
electronic voting as far as I can tell
the manufacturers

483
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:53,040
and and the security researchers really
had completely different

484
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,060
use a reality and and shall we say it
seems like

485
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,580
the electronic voting machines are
having a hard time improving the good

486
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,500
news about medical device manufacturing
is

487
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,170
I think it was just a matter if they
didn't understand the security and now

488
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:09,950
they are beginning to understand it and
and certainly all the medical device

489
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,880
engineers I encounter

490
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,180
really care about getting security and
safety right there just not sure how to

491
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,050
do it

492
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:19,350
and and just like any institution
companies

493
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:22,980
depends who you talk with it to talk
with sales person there

494
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,450
the problem don't know what you're
talking about a if you talk with an

495
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,360
engineer the prague and tell you

496
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:32,020
but they think rather than the company
line and there's a connect that needs to

497
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,350
happen and so

498
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:36,740
what tends to work best when security
researcher can help

499
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,770
the engineers at the front lines to
commence upper management

500
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:43,110
to do the right thing on

501
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:46,890
Barnaby Jack the I recently deceased he
knows

502
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:50,700
a had a interesting an hour 7 insulin
pump

503
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,030
we did a WebEx with with Burnaby a
couple years ago he made this user

504
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,070
interface

505
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:58,970
a so that's an insulin pump and he has
this user interface that uses dump

506
00:27:58,970 --> 00:27:59,900
insulin

507
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:04,150
I'm not exactly sure how it works that
he didn't tell me exactly what he did

508
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:07,900
and I for different takes from the
manufacturer but on suffice to say he

509
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,710
was able to you

510
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:12,260
cause the device to dispense the entire
insulin cartridge which

511
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:15,890
is a highly undesirable thing and yeah I
suppose you could just get a whole bunch

512
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,760
bags potato chips but

513
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,669
a its its it's not something you want to
tinker with

514
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:24,950
I mean when you're diabetic on

515
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:28,230
we've also done some work with them
security embedded

516
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:31,720
software updates on external
defibrillators in that's just one

517
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,940
example cuz there's tons of external
bedside devices

518
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:39,340
so here's a device you typically find in
the hallways ver corporate offices and

519
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,390
in airports

520
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:43,919
being see it says device compromised on

521
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,410
and the interesting thing about this
particular device related to how to

522
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:48,520
report to people

523
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,660
we couldn't figure out how to contact
the company I

524
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:55,240
so fortunately when we got a software
update the forgot to strip out the

525
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,110
symbol table

526
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:59,220
so we found all the user names of all
this offer developers images one by one

527
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,419
mail them

528
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:04,130
I am a we still have heard back

529
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:07,450
it's been about three years

530
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:11,390
but anyhow yet it's not too hard to find
security prompt medical devices

531
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:15,330
on but I think it's important to do so

532
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:18,990
because otherwise it's hard to visualize
what's going

533
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,990
what's could potentially go Ron but if
you want to find our

534
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:27,470
just go to a hospital am so here's an
architecture one hospital and I'm not

535
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,340
gonna pick on this hospital

536
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:33,350
this is just 8 a one hospital and

537
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:39,280
and every hospital is basically
suffering these kinds of problems

538
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:43,169
so on this this fella give me a
presentation a couple years ago

539
00:29:43,169 --> 00:29:47,100
any he says well we've got 664 computers
that are

540
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,820
legally classified as medical devices
inside I always liked it

541
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:54,150
check numbers and add them up to make
sure they add up quickly so I looked at

542
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:58,990
this is said Windows XP 600 devices I'm
on my way to me women you know

543
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:03,030
if you add up windows xp service pack 1
2-3 I get sixteen

544
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:06,730
I think you you've got a table here any
said Kevin now

545
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:10,300
no thats Service Pack 0

546
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:14,490
I they have 600 Service Pack 0 Windows
XP machines

547
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:18,070
because the manufacture in the hospital
were able to come to an agreement on how

548
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,919
to update

549
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:23,380
the software sometimes manufactured just
doesn't provide any software updates

550
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:27,820
other times it's become its
operationally not possible

551
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:31,780
the meantime to infection is twelve days
on these kinda devices when they don't

552
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:34,780
have a traditional IT security products
like anti-virus

553
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:38,410
but even when they do have something
like anti virus which has its own risks

554
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:42,470
I it typically doesn't last more than a
year before getting infected

555
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:47,190
you can imagine the workload put upon
the IT security specialist inside a

556
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,690
hospital

557
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:51,940
but how does now we're getting I'm

558
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:55,110
I was surprised that so I talk a lot
with Don physicians

559
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:58,870
and they they tend to send me there were
stories I'm when the most common war

560
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,300
stories I'm picking up

561
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,810
is vendors that install malware by
accident

562
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:06,850
and so the

563
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:10,250
there was one story by a a woman from
the Veterans Administration

564
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:15,400
I in the US so this is the there are 150
year so clinics that serve veterans

565
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,490
in the United States a and Tom

566
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:21,500
one day she was watching her intrusion
detection software and she just saw

567
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,950
these intrusions just pop up up up up up

568
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:27,669
and correspond exactly with the vendor
who was going on with the USB stick

569
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:32,310
updating the firmware on medical devices
so this third-party contractor was

570
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,130
actually

571
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:36,970
the source of the infection in their
hospital on

572
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:40,530
I i no one other case where malware got
into the product line

573
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:43,780
as they were manufacturing above the
kinda crowded accidentally

574
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:47,429
as a likely to get unleashed into the
world but I wouldn't be surprised if

575
00:31:47,429 --> 00:31:49,030
this happens at some point

576
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:52,400
and then in another case well I get into
it in a moment

577
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:57,690
butts it's just its is mindboggling some
the problems they have to go through

578
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:02,840
I mean there's a great done a xkcd
cartoon on this vital read it at

579
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,080
it drawing analogies with electronic
voting machines but

580
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,590
I think I'll just go for it here I'm

581
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:13,050
so I like to download random stuff on
the internet run it

582
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:17,050
I'm and I have a colleague of mine
actually German colleague a news promos

583
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:20,810
does this is well as an engineer Google
and I'm

584
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:25,250
so one day I noticed that there is a
recall on a ventilator

585
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:28,270
and so i try to download the software so
I went to the

586
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:32,610
product manufacturers website and went
on a bottoming out kinda surprised I

587
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:35,380
could download it on the internet when
the few times you can

588
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:39,150
I i've seen downloading medical I saw
from the internet so I okay

589
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:42,190
a better archivist so that you know you
analyze it later click

590
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:45,510
and this popped up

591
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:49,660
as I went to download the ventilator
software update

592
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:53,590
so I think most people in this room
probably know what's going on here

593
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:57,010
I for every speaking to a non security
krajina you might not

594
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:00,620
on but right this is the Google safe
browsing service

595
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,970
as sonya is provost with a halo over as
head there

596
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:08,270
on good German boy I'm and sword maker

597
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,840
what he does is he goes around the
internet with his offer was on the

598
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,440
Internet

599
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,060
just downloading random binaries and
then runs them inside virtual machines

600
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,690
and sees it the virtual machine it's
compromised

601
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:21,820
its virtual machine is compromised in
Google flags it is a much a site

602
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:25,970
in any time you click on a link going to
any sites Google pockets as a warning if

603
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,880
if you have that plugin

604
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,800
so for this particular manufacture
according to the Google safe browsing

605
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,010
web service

606
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:36,020
they had 38 Trojans and three scripting
exploits

607
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:39,360
that brings a lot of confidence and what
I was really wondering is

608
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,440
how many hospital biomedical engineers
actually just clicked through that link

609
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,720
and download I'm gonna guess most of
them because if I had to do my job

610
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,590
United wanna make sure that the main
leaders are safe but probably in the

611
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:54,130
process they infected their own machines

612
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:57,600
with who knows what kind of malware

613
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,640
am so I saw an interesting note in

614
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,669
other ft databases about here software
update

615
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:08,620
and where a compound was infected with a
virus or compound ur

616
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:12,399
is a pharmaceutical machine its a way to
make me quit drugs

617
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:16,609
so it takes as input I think sixteen
different files we have one of these in

618
00:34:16,609 --> 00:34:17,710
my laboratory

619
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:21,200
a you input the highly country drugs in
the top

620
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,669
in any other saline bag as the output
and that's when you give

621
00:34:24,669 --> 00:34:29,120
to the patient to create a custom just
in time drug delivery

622
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,190
and so this compound ur runs Windows XP
Embedded

623
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:38,149
and it got infected with a virus and the
response was from the manufacturer

624
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:41,500
we do not regularly install operating
system updates or patches

625
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:45,909
that's their policy I'm and this really
confused me

626
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:48,960
and so actually a lot of manufacture
still to this day

627
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,540
say that they don't offer patches are
software updates in the usually cite

628
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:52,940
some

629
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:56,429
RT non-existent FDA rule and

630
00:34:56,429 --> 00:35:00,040
and so FDA has been trying for years to
try to dispel this myth

631
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:05,220
ft actually expect manufactures to
regularly patch keep things up to date

632
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:09,810
I'm and they have ft is released this
really long boring dock Mennonite

633
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:13,070
you should keep your software up to date
so I sent you guys really need a

634
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,040
one-sheet

635
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,720
kinda thing to give to give the
manufacture I created one

636
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,570
and so here goes it says homer prevents
me from passing class

637
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:26,170
a your favorite dating site prevents me
from getting dates and FDA rules prevent

638
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:27,300
suffer updates

639
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,900
bullshit you know on so there is some
truth to this

640
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:36,470
but the point is FDA and most regulators
do expect the main faction could suffer

641
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,440
up-to-date

642
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,560
the hard truth however is that there is
a real cost to it

643
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:46,620
so keep in mind that updating medical
devices not as simple as

644
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:49,990
downloading a you know I you know some

645
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:53,260
the new Linux package there's

646
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:57,350
some pretty sophisticated verification
testing that goes on

647
00:35:57,350 --> 00:36:00,589
takes a huge amounts of Engineering time
they need to validate that everything

648
00:36:00,589 --> 00:36:02,680
they produce matches their models

649
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,640
they have hazard analysis they wanna
make sure that everything matches up as

650
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,620
expected

651
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:09,910
so it does take snake significant amount
of Engineering time to do

652
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:15,780
however the the manufactures do have an
obligation to do this

653
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:19,910
alright who cannot so

654
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:22,850
this probably not a question it comes up
in this audience but certainly question

655
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:23,710
that comes up

656
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:26,890
I went off in medical manufactures a you
know

657
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:30,170
do we really need to worry about
security aren't you guys just you know

658
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:34,200
venture you know a fanatic you know
perfectionist might have everything

659
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,160
secure

660
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,830
and you know that there's a little bit a
bomb you know that they have a point

661
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:41,870
I'm but to actually there are cases

662
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:44,960
released in the pharmaceutical world
people causing harm so

663
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,390
in 1982 in the United States others it's
still an unsolved mystery to this day

664
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:51,270
somebody deliberately tainted

665
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:56,339
extra strength tylenol with cyanide and
put this back on the pharmacy shelves

666
00:36:56,339 --> 00:37:00,800
an entire family died when ingesting it
and then later the funeral

667
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,980
more family members took the drugs and
they also died a

668
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:07,640
overnight all tylenol was pulled from
shelves in the United States

669
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,920
possibly even know here in Germany I
don't know

670
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,839
I'm but that's why a we have this Sun

671
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:19,010
should've tamper-evident and metallic
foil typically on top other

672
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:20,569
over-the-counter drugs today

673
00:37:20,569 --> 00:37:24,400
because this particular incident so
things tend to be a lil bit reactionary

674
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,550
there hasn't been

675
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:28,480
this kind of incident in the medical
device security will then I hope there

676
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,000
will never will be

677
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,010
and but at least I'm I'm trying my
colleague

678
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:37,150
trying to make sure that we never deter
worry about that particular thing

679
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:41,569
but that people do exist and we would be
you know unwise I think to think that

680
00:37:41,569 --> 00:37:43,060
everybody means well

681
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,490
so there is an epilepsy support the
website where somebody decided to just

682
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:49,609
post flashing animations to cause
seizures

683
00:37:49,609 --> 00:37:53,960
I am so if you leave the door open
somebody walk through it

684
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,589
and and another common refrain I hear
from manufactures you haven't yet

685
00:37:58,589 --> 00:38:02,120
experience the whole security life cycle
as well you know we look at our

686
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,190
statistics

687
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:06,609
and there have been no problems and so
mapping out ten years from now there

688
00:38:06,609 --> 00:38:08,240
will be no problems

689
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,800
and so you can use the Macintosh example
I get sick I could use the SSL example

690
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,400
now but

691
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,870
am oh my god I can't believe Apple but
on

692
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:22,089
you know overnight basically this virus
on took over happily mcintosh's

693
00:38:22,089 --> 00:38:26,930
as so the the medical community doesn't
yet understand the model unintentional

694
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,910
failures there used to looking at sort
of gal seein

695
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:33,490
accidental failures where they can where
previous behavior predict future

696
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:34,450
behavior in

697
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:38,120
you know it's hard to describe security
in those terms

698
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,300
am so computer virus spreads the humans

699
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:44,510
am I suppose it could happen am

700
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:50,280
so in the United States we have these a
again about 150 medical centers for

701
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,390
veterans and

702
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:56,150
they're actually on the the leading edge
understanding security problems

703
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:59,490
believe it or not they discover that
every eight seconds they still find

704
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:01,170
username and passwords in clear

705
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:05,910
on the hospital networks and a curious
out how that is in the private sector

706
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:09,480
but to deal with this whole mess they
have about on have

707
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,069
600,000 computers up with about 50,000
our actual

708
00:39:13,069 --> 00:39:16,359
medical devices and the only way they've
been able to preserve the security and

709
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:17,350
all is to create

710
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:21,920
just a ton virtual lands so think even
as virtual firewalls

711
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,960
on but some other side effects is their
intrusion detection suffer no longer

712
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,050
works on the things they protected so

713
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:32,060
when they come back and they see that
nothing's infected with that means

714
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:32,830
nothing

715
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:37,450
on the outside is infected and so so
they've lost a lot about inside what's

716
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:40,560
going on in that ass a very prone human
error

717
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,120
other been instances where manufacture
just for a split second

718
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:48,870
open support on a device to do a
software update min Conficker gets in

719
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:52,430
and let's move on a little bit on

720
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:56,220
solo but a good news though I'm a and
this is I think different from typical

721
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:59,620
sorted a security researcher goes in

722
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:03,870
a a to the corporate world %uh the
manufacturing

723
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:08,190
are actually paying attention to the
message so well the president ever

724
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:12,210
David Rubin medtronic was recently
actually raise the word security

725
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:15,410
up in part with safety which in english
is is actually different

726
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:19,960
a and out it down Boston Scientific

727
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,640
of the leading manufacture about cardiac
implantable on other things

728
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,990
they actually think about security in
what they call the concept phase

729
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:30,950
this is this is radical thinking okay so
the concept phase means

730
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:34,460
the whiteboard okay this is the white
board before you've even written the

731
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,660
requirements document for your device
does

732
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:40,710
so this is you know good news to hear
that security is making its way into the

733
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,870
beginning because the old refrain you
know you can't

734
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:46,790
both secured an after-the-fact need to
build it and they are actually trying to

735
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:47,480
build in

736
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:51,330
not every manufactures doing this but
some the

737
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:54,520
the manufacturers who are the more clue
for are are doing so

738
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:59,730
I'm I did briefly want to talk about a
couple approaches aren't improving

739
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:00,650
security

740
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:04,610
and so I'll talk about as one of them
coming out the research lab

741
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:09,660
this is a system a couple my students
built over the last few years is called

742
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,670
what's up doc

743
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:14,430
but down well we basically do the
measure power consumption

744
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:18,530
at the power outlets and from the park
consumption patterns we can tell if your

745
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:21,400
device is infected with malware with
extremely high accuracy and precision

746
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,490
and recall

747
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:25,620
so this is our compound this is what
makes drugs in our

748
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:29,480
laboratory you see is running Windows XP
Embedded am

749
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,910
and it's known to be infected as to when
it gets infected

750
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:38,320
on things change interrupt fire at
different rates

751
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:42,350
different things happen packets go out
Jeep use might kick in

752
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:45,450
interesting things happen and that
changes

753
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:49,480
not necessarily how much power is being
consumed but it changes at what rate

754
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,370
powers been consumes if you look in the
frequency domain if you do for your

755
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:54,170
transform into part consumption

756
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:57,190
you'll be again to pick up subtle
changes

757
00:41:57,190 --> 00:42:01,870
and not just it's not a signature a
malware but its behavior

758
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:05,600
have a abnormal a things like malware

759
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:11,140
so we built a device this is basically a
power outlet is a machine learning

760
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:14,940
and from that you can actually detect
them now where on

761
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:18,990
this is an older version of it the newer
version a was using a

762
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:22,840
a Raspberry Pi but down there's a

763
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,160
if you wanna learn more about actually
detect an hour without having to change

764
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,510
a single line software

765
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:30,770
we got a couple publications up there
they can go look up

766
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:34,430
mainly from at the USENIX health tech
venue

767
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:37,940
am but that the reason why this this is

768
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:42,060
I i personally things interesting is
because in the medical device well

769
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,940
that's it it is challenging

770
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:47,290
to allow third parties to change Safran

771
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:50,960
inside the device because it's the
hazard analysis and regulatory

772
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,610
requirements

773
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,650
and so the nice thing about this is it's
outside

774
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:58,640
it's it's really cool interview trusted
computing a basis outside your validated

775
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,370
space

776
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:03,740
so it's not considered a medical device
so it's it's much easier to maintain my

777
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:10,740
traditional IT ways up

778
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:19,490
right so what as over pizza as a point
now one other

779
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:23,020
excuses used by manufacturers is the
cost there to validate the cost to do

780
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:23,910
all the testing

781
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:27,510
to do something new I think here is you
can actually if you discover any

782
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:28,760
security problem you can

783
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:32,910
send it out to the power outlet which
doesn't need two go hand in hand with

784
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,100
the testing the device

785
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:37,470
because it's outside the scope am

786
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:41,320
one other thing I'd like to introduce
you to one you might already be aware

787
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,270
the

788
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:45,560
signal injection attacks but none I'll
try to make it a more real

789
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:49,500
so on you know the heart is just

790
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:53,660
bunch signals right happens have some
muscles in it Anderson interesting

791
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:54,750
things you can do mmm

792
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:59,140
when you can control what the sensors
think they're seeing on a medical device

793
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:02,750
this extends to skated devices as well
so

794
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:08,220
how what we discovered is that we can
create specially crafted electromagnetic

795
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,180
interference

796
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:12,860
that you can probably all heard about
things like don't walk near high tension

797
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:16,920
power line with with a certain kinda
medical device that could interfere

798
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,130
thats accidental your interference if
you can create

799
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:24,160
specially crafted interference such that
the medical device

800
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,060
d modulated in a chosen way you can
actually

801
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:32,570
command that device what betsy is on the
analog to digital converter

802
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:35,660
so let me explain how that's done I'm

803
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:40,130
so this is a typical a single cycle
about the heart rhythm

804
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:44,350
so it's called the QRS complex and if
you look in the frequency domain

805
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:49,030
a you'll see that most of the signal for
year your cardiac rhythm is concentrated

806
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:50,010
in 10

807
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:54,510
to about I 150 hurt yourself a pretty
low frequency

808
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:58,460
so what does this mean this means when
you have a sensor on a medical device

809
00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:59,250
for

810
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:03,360
lease cardiac signals it needs to let
through all the things in the tender 100

811
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:08,830
a hurts space so it's not going to
filter out the signals so

812
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:11,920
if you can create malicious let a man
who your parents

813
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,960
in the baseband its gonna get through
all the filters

814
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,880
its gonna get to the device

815
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,000
so we have a fun with this was in
testing

816
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,380
and we do actually have a cadaver lab on
so

817
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:29,390
actually the state of the art of some
kind of feeling bad PC 69

818
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:34,180
NC 16 I it's a standard for you put
enough salt in it news a refractometer

819
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,180
to make it

820
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:38,350
the same salinity is the human body to

821
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:42,560
basically simulate how on RF propagates
through the body

822
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,340
a plea of these a synthetic cadaver here
with our for Oscar P

823
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:49,590
and what we're trying to do here is
understand

824
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:54,160
can we actually do this to a peacemaker
defibrillator take cause it to do

825
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,180
something that it shouldn't

826
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:59,290
am so night here's a here's a

827
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:02,330
zoom in on what we did and what we have
here on the right

828
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:05,600
is called the a programmer this is the
device the the

829
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:09,240
clinicians use to change the settings I

830
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:13,310
on a an implanted device and we've got
some magnet wire over here

831
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:16,490
just very simple magnet wire acting as
our antenna

832
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:19,790
to inject interference and inside the
saline bath

833
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:23,190
is our implant okay so

834
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:28,030
what we wanted to know what a what car
trade is the monitor seeing

835
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:32,510
so when we injected this noise a which
is effectively noise you can see

836
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:36,140
it's picking up these what's called
ventricular sense in particular pacing

837
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:37,940
and I think the onset so

838
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:42,430
we've been able to trick this particular
device into thinking there's a heartbeat

839
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:44,250
when they're actually is no heartbeat

840
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:47,680
and so from this a peacemaker that
spacing on demand

841
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,800
would stop pacing and so you can stop
the peacemaker now the good news is

842
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,600
as far as we can tell this attack
doesn't actually work in practice

843
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:01,450
because the moment you get much a tissue
in from the devices attenuate the

844
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:02,220
signals

845
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:06,870
huge amount I'm so it be very difficult
thing to do this in the Vale

846
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:10,140
on but the device does allow us to send
signal

847
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:14,320
a through its filter we did some other
experiments with them

848
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,660
a Bluetooth headsets it's a completely
silent room

849
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:21,300
I but we transmit electromagnetic
interference

850
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:25,120
that actually we measured the on

851
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:29,590
resonant frequency the peaceable wire
going between the microphone in the

852
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:31,180
amplifier

853
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:34,240
and so from that you can decide what's
the best kind

854
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,420
love carrier frequency used to deliver
your chosen signal

855
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:41,870
and we deliver classical music a to this
particular Bluetooth headset the room

856
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:44,830
silent but when you're listening she is
beautiful music

857
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:48,260
and it's actually higher fidelity the
way to get over the microphone

858
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:51,850
I because we're able to bypass the
microphones actually really cheap

859
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:54,980
so we can bypass them I can get higher
fidelity music

860
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:58,380
but the point is I all sensors

861
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:02,610
have amplifiers and filters and it's not
too hard to measure

862
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:06,570
the resonant frequency love the physical
wire between the sensor

863
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:09,670
in the amplifier from that in create a

864
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:13,260
carrier up the optimum frequency and
then you can modulate

865
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:17,720
onto that the chosen signal you want and
then this whole system

866
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,950
on the device access and unintentional
the modulator

867
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:24,520
in the delivers the signal to the
computer

868
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,880
so I'm looks like we're at

869
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,470
just about a time so you know wrap-up
I'm going back to that original

870
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:34,950
knowledge about hand washing 165 years
ago

871
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:38,410
you know back then again some a vice is
basically saying hey position should

872
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:39,730
wash their hands

873
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:43,100
a doctor my eggs were saying

874
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:46,560
doctors a gentleman there for the intro
is clean I think if they were alive

875
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,390
today

876
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:51,110
in talking about security the argument
goes like this: that some advice would

877
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:53,160
be saying medical basis should be secure

878
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:57,770
and doctors a gentleman and therefore
the computers are always secure your

879
00:48:57,770 --> 00:49:01,650
I'm but let's just examine that promote
why could that be true the reason why I

880
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:02,870
might be true

881
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:06,350
is well actually back in the 1840s

882
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:09,350
not all hospitals had running water

883
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:13,840
latex gloves didn't exist yet so is
physically difficult proposition

884
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:17,680
to clean their hands you can imagine
physicians

885
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,380
being told by some other person call
please wash your hands like ok

886
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:23,920
Washington yeah that's easy I gotta go
down the street or I gotta use this

887
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,100
caustic liquid that really hurt my hands

888
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:32,250
and so you can understand why physicians
might be upset at that suggestion

889
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:34,900
I think the same thing can be true for
security today because there's no silver

890
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:35,900
bullet

891
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:40,510
so to tell a medical manufacturer to
tell a biomedical

892
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:43,850
a engineer or clinician hey you need
better security

893
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:47,790
of course they're gonna laugh because
there is no silver bullet that can buy

894
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:51,660
I'm whereas in the safety world there is
no silver bullet either but there are

895
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:52,390
some

896
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:55,820
well-known techniques they can do taken
165 years

897
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:58,620
but there are some well-known techniques
and products they can use to improve

898
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,910
safety so

899
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:03,280
I think in the security community we
need to figure out in the next hour 65

900
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,380
years

901
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:08,720
how to make this I'm not the silver
bullet but how to make it

902
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,290
presentable to someone who wants to get
the security property

903
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:15,859
the course wanna designed in rather than
bolted on actually this

904
00:50:15,859 --> 00:50:19,470
the thing I recall the had one for my
son the called a bumble

905
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:22,570
but you know don't don't %uh bolted on

906
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:26,140
am and I'm sure you've all heard about
the but what I call the pixie dust

907
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:29,370
approach to security probably heard
these in your travels

908
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:32,400
you know the these are my favorite
oxymorons down here as medical

909
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,130
manufacturers are looking to buy silver
bullets

910
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:39,150
Windows XP securities when my favorites
on private networks

911
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:42,290
yet despite the word private in front
and everything's okay

912
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:45,580
and proprietary security on

913
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:49,530
I mean we laugh would laugh at that here
but there are many medical manufacturers

914
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:52,180
who just don't yet understand that
proprietary

915
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:57,140
doesn't mean better in terms of security
and if you approach manufacture and then

916
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:59,430
laugh at them they're not gonna respond
very well

917
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:02,260
so you need to figure out a way to
deliver your message without calling

918
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:05,180
them jerks

919
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:09,320
okay on I don't forget the economics

920
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:12,990
so what I like to tell the manufactures
is a

921
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:16,260
today by and large the kinds of problems

922
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:19,680
that a security problem devices today
are mostly I think accidental

923
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:23,210
now we're getting in by accident as
collateral damage

924
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:26,050
it just happens to be running a
commodity operating system should

925
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:27,690
valuable to send spam

926
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:32,010
and you can pick your favorite study but
you only need to have a one person at

927
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:33,340
twelve million a robot

928
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:36,490
respond to pieces spam to make it
profitable

929
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:40,080
and and they're actually medical devices
that participate in botnets

930
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:44,940
so if america manufacturer can design
their medical devices to be

931
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:48,740
less on her ex's me more

932
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:52,760
a you know worthless basically to the
spammers I mean something even a simple

933
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:53,580
as turning off

934
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:57,700
or 25 might actually reduce the economic
incentives so

935
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:00,960
their I'm not saying these are sober bro
let's but there are ways to actually

936
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,690
reduce the incentives for

937
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:05,950
medical devices to be compromised
accidentally am

938
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:09,340
if you talk about targeted malware
that's a whole other thing

939
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:13,359
so on cyber security now for medical
devices what we call a

940
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:17,030
foreseeable risk this is a legal term
meaning manufactures are expected to

941
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:19,290
deal with it in their hazard analysis

942
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:22,470
so as a manufactures designing a new
medical device

943
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:25,890
after basically list all the way they
can possibly fail

944
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:29,640
as per their hazard analysis and now
cyber security is expected to be part of

945
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,510
that

946
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:34,310
on so I would argue that although it is
important to think about hackers

947
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:37,100
breaking the medical devices I don't
think today that is the man

948
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:40,990
the the most significant problem I it is
I think going to be a problem in the

949
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:44,260
future but right now the biggest problem
is now religious actually get sent

950
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:45,200
because we're using

951
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,680
commodity operating systems that urges
vulnerable Windows XP

952
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,020
I do have an MRI machine in Boston
running Windows 95

953
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:55,300
on so there's some really old software
out there

954
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:59,090
and the risks from this are not your
traditional wrist when it comes to

955
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:00,580
security the big risks

956
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:04,930
is as far as patient safety goes as a
result of security or things like

957
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:09,440
wide-scale unavailability a patient care
matching a hospital

958
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,540
and all one thousand have your infusion
pumps suddenly stop working

959
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:17,560
you know that would be a wide-scale
unavailability another significant risk

960
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:20,150
is the integrity of the medical sensors

961
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:24,350
so if the medical device begins giving
incorrect data to the position the

962
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:25,380
position may make

963
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:30,550
the the wrong decision am now in
practice there are

964
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:34,830
a checks in place service sanity check

965
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:38,500
you know if if your pulse were you know
one thousand beats per minute you know I

966
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,950
would hope the positions they know
something must be wrong with this device

967
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:45,000
on although I have a funny story on that

968
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,200
it what when when my my son was being
born

969
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:51,810
a they they had a contraction sensor
that had to be implanted

970
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:55,840
and the the nurse in the doctor couldn't
figure out how to connect a contraction

971
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,430
sensor to

972
00:53:57,430 --> 00:54:00,900
a to the monitoring device I because
they had

973
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:04,820
two different kinds reports on it and so
they were talking about gender benders

974
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:07,940
as they're doing this as my son was
being born but and

975
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:11,020
so integrity medals medical centers that
was important because it now we're

976
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,880
breaks into a device

977
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,930
could start changing the interrupts and
don't forget if you miss an interrupt

978
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:20,620
maybe you'll skip that sensor reading in
your YouTube added to the doctor

979
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:23,700
United traditional security problems

980
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,950
and if you're interested in some more a

981
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:31,140
information on this I have a blog gets a
blog doubt take your medicine that word

982
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:34,130
every now and then I'd post these kinds
of stories as they picked them up for

983
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:35,190
manufacturers

984
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:40,150
and if you do find a problem a in a
medical vice bombing security

985
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:43,740
there a lot of different ways you try to
report it you try contacting the

986
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:44,890
manufacturer thats

987
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:49,040
you really hard because they the usually
aren't set up to receive such data

988
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,440
but if you don't mind talking to the
United States

989
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:57,200
I mean I guess we're listening to you
right I'm

990
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,690
a you could use what's called the
MedWatch form

991
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:05,470
3500 this bureaucratic speak I is a
document that the FDA

992
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:10,710
uses to collect data on injuries and
deaths related medical devices be can

993
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:14,620
also use it for things where you don't
know the death

994
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:18,310
but wrapping up am the

995
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:20,820
if you're thinking about getting a male
who I security I think it's a really

996
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:23,790
great place to work because you can
actually help people

997
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:28,060
and it's also a place where the
manufacturer's do you actually want to

998
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:28,910
get your help

999
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:32,540
number you need to speak the language in
the need to understand the culture

1000
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:37,080
on so we actually how the workshop last
year we had about sixty five people from

1001
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,590
medical manufacturers show up at
Michigan

1002
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:43,420
where we all sat down times use of the
record so I can

1003
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:46,930
Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in and
basically every manufacture got up and

1004
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:49,760
said what the problems were at the end
of the day they look around he said we

1005
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,520
have the same damn problems

1006
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,790
but also all this so we we actually
started solving all other

1007
00:55:54,790 --> 00:55:58,050
the low-hanging fruit at our meeting am

1008
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:01,120
so if you interest in nineteen oh look
at they are comedians website

1009
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:04,580
on and I'm supposed to embed these
tokens in in

1010
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:08,620
my slide so for a good time use this
token am but I think I am there

1011
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:13,330
if we have any time for questions and I
think a break is coming up this point

1012
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:16,880
up

1013
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,030
wall reference thanks %ah
