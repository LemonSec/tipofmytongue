1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,029
thank you purposeful have me mom my
tongue is going to be about

2
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:10,059
love it isn't the sufferer the some

3
00:00:10,059 --> 00:00:15,480
Alan we mostly walk within 25 min so
also give you an introduction about

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,029
what and two by Vince think about Seth
what's that option rate

5
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:22,929
and what new challenge overcoming in the
South era

6
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:26,849
on will also be talking about three
vulnerabilities

7
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:29,900
because they're really relevant to new
challenges

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,160
and so just a little bit about me

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,360
my name is non-lethal I

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,280
developer and a game I'm to Chief
Software Architect a fat alone

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,250
and i'm for months I will team leader in
the idea and

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,850
my hearing is not so good i main bling
pink floyd so if you have any questions

13
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:49,320
just

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,410
talk a bit louder and

15
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,350
I really want this to be more discussion
the electoral so

16
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:01,129
please feel free to mail your hand ask
question and would like to make do with

17
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:01,559
time

18
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,030
I own is my second home add

19
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:09,440
I have no more than 25 bottles announced
people well as passionate the security

20
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,000
of me

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,920
aunt was found in the in 2012 by former
members

22
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,780
a few neat a $200 on one of the founders
was actually my commander so

23
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,890
if you wanna get some gossip about me
you can go and ask em

24
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,430
on it's named after the ad how long
bridge

25
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:29,990
in lab on which is the North Point the
Egyptian army

26
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,780
came to doing the Independence Mall so

27
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,990
enable in if I it's basically the tone
for the last line of defense

28
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,330
the bridge it's very exciting mom so

29
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,430
all monies on South adoption

30
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,940
is going to skyrocket it's already
skyrocketing

31
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,070
it's become a very viable alternative on

32
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,790
for on-premise services its an
affordable alternative

33
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:59,470
for small and medium companies and that
his deal is bound to repeat itself

34
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:04,380
the same solution that we saw and the
last 20 years in the on-premise wall

35
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,009
firewalls IDS is Antivirus is

36
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:11,959
we believe it going to repeat itself
because the same problems

37
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:15,879
are still there only does the new
frontier no tools for it

38
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:19,530
mom we believe sassy secure

39
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,950
at vitals they spend a lot of money in
in for social security

40
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:29,109
and they do a very good job they'll
spend money on app security on their own

41
00:02:29,109 --> 00:02:29,709
app

42
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:33,200
arm but it to the edge isn't because

43
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,709
and yourself in the south I'll every
well even you will love to see a holding

44
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:38,459
right now

45
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,680
those are potential point is a breach a

46
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,859
where you can get on your company's
information arm

47
00:02:45,859 --> 00:02:49,109
so my purpose is to show you how

48
00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:52,299
enterprises at three tough when they
think about it

49
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:56,939
whether to buy those are more likely to
adopt South and one enterprises will

50
00:02:56,939 --> 00:02:58,109
stay away from it

51
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:03,030
as long as they can on I wanted to start
thinking about South security

52
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,790
its not that you it's now I would say

53
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:10,200
mainstream for two years old but still
no a

54
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,480
very good solutions are out there and I
also wanted to start questioning the

55
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,370
transparency of South security

56
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:20,599
we had the same process in a softer
world well vulnerabilities

57
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:25,049
does now a good process of disclosing
viability does a CVT

58
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:28,680
then VD what about South applications
what are we going to do about

59
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,920
vulnerabilities there

60
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,650
are they going to be silently fixed on
our on

61
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,959
so just to break the ice I want to know
how many have to use

62
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:42,180
South publications just place your hand
gnomish I grape

63
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,579
we all do I'm going to show you how so

64
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:50,670
let's just cleared the just basic
vocabulary arm

65
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,939
the first feel you here we talk about
cloud is

66
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:57,719
clout it's a marketing puzzled annually

67
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:01,189
of to use it as less as you can arm

68
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:04,969
so we're going to refrain we're going to
talk about sass

69
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:08,689
and other terms which are more relevant
on

70
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:13,359
we usually compress SAF with on-premise
on-premise all those data centers you

71
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:15,109
have in your organization

72
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:18,419
if you have an Exchange server that on
premise other

73
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:21,890
and Seth software the device

74
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:26,390
in contrast to buying a hard were and
soft 119 for it

75
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,720
is simply put your dollars at the
service that you want

76
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,020
and you get it for example I guessing
that

77
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,400
alarm you use Google you have gmail
drive

78
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,890
only the South publications even
Facebook is a South obligations but

79
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:46,340
we are the actual product to Facebook so
at drop box office 265

80
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,710
all of the horse ass I am

81
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,950
in the club owners also pass in the ass
play through the Service &

82
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,700
Infrastructure as a Service

83
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,979
I but they're not really element to the
stop

84
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,860
so well on going to mention them here

85
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,740
Tom so let's do it fast crash course I'm
going to contrast that with all also

86
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,150
first I'll explain

87
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:12,560
what dole is when we talk about the old
world we mean

88
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,760
simply on-premise not talks at you

89
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,520
have enterprises all around you and even
the prices they have

90
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,530
very well-defined perimeters

91
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:27,000
insiders perimeters you have instant
messaging services males

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,520
you have CRM on systems HR management
systems

93
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,240
and file cooperation mom

94
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,960
you see an internal network with all the
so says and some services are in a

95
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,510
demilitarized zone

96
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:45,490
and dev kind of and by those have been
around here for quite a long

97
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,460
for twenty years and us they have these
many

98
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:54,080
on national security you have firewalls
wafts IDS is deal P

99
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,860
every if we look like when you can come
up with it exists in their own planet

100
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,230
security world

101
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:03,170
this is the latest baby information
rights management just like the RM

102
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:07,670
up Adobe and Microsoft really wanted to
start using

103
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:12,070
the software for managing the simulation
view document

104
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:17,830
but basically meant by you have several
users and that might not fit all of them

105
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:22,080
unicycle users the nine to five years of
well we sure these

106
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,320
and you have the pollies earth sometimes

107
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,170
executives IT staff they need access to
the

108
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:33,570
company so says from home of a mother
locations

109
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,960
and some companies you also have the
travels which are

110
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,040
users that are always on the road and
always need access

111
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,980
from wherever they are because that's
their walk

112
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:50,500
on so how do we enable users from your
remote access to company sources

113
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,110
and steel keep it safe

114
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:59,130
so every sect also the decides on a
solution that fits

115
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,350
its restrictions for example financial
sectors

116
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:06,840
and the me and medical institutions now
the I would say the toughest one

117
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,890
and they'd try to prohibit as much more
taxes as possible

118
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:15,310
I because there's money involved and
those personal data involved

119
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,530
on some do allow Excel Access

120
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:22,090
the usual a couple it with two-factor
authentication

121
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:26,350
and addresses into prices they have BP
and clients and these

122
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:30,240
have several levels of feature sets

123
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,650
up some companies use managed laptops to
enforce the security policy

124
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:39,990
and some companies simply use a VPN
client to make sure that you have

125
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:44,480
and whiteness is operating system an
up-to-date anti-virus

126
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,970
and inactivated file on

127
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,750
so now I have the traveling salesman if
he's using a company laptop than

128
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,340
he is inside that to limit those well

129
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:59,940
and he can walk but although nothing
without problems

130
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,730
security often stands in wave woke
people do walk better with mobile access

131
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:09,060
they all como also and they simply are
accessible anywhere

132
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,430
am if you'll corporation needs to be
deployed in multiple countries that

133
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,450
a they mention of hell you shouldn't

134
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:20,470
want to walk into I am having latency
form

135
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:24,080
cell accessing solos from Asia a those
that are

136
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,200
located in Europe that's the latency
hell

137
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,420
you didn't imagine to and also I did
stuff has

138
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,849
very slowly sponsor can you need a if
one of my department's

139
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,259
need in your application to do with walk
battle

140
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:42,759
IT staff usually takes a month or two to
evaluate the soft or

141
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:48,170
evaluate the risks around we sometime
standing where folk

142
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,720
mom and of course those the
ever-increasing cost

143
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,129
skilled IT people as you know cost money

144
00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:58,639
new hardware new licensing how will
break down

145
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,269
they all cost money if you want the
disaster recovery site

146
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:06,290
that's a lot of money to spend

147
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:11,759
and the point is you always as a cue is
your IT security staff

148
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,350
if you don't have good people in
security is going to be

149
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:18,999
full of holes into letting sass

150
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:22,149
all you need is a browser does no
deployment hell

151
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:25,839
and you have a very predictable cost
model if you have

152
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,040
at ten thousand users and

153
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,569
you want several million names all you
need to do is put money on it

154
00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:35,850
the need to buy more sellers to support
will use those

155
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,949
the only problem in the IT world well
blowing money and it's all

156
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:42,329
with and Seth is the access anywhere
world

157
00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:46,050
no matter whether you in Asia Europe
United States you simply use your

158
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,189
service

159
00:09:47,189 --> 00:09:50,350
om and it's been marketed as secure

160
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:54,499
suspenders do invest a lot of money in
for social security

161
00:09:54,499 --> 00:09:58,800
but and it'll security is a different
story and what we have here is a new

162
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,379
frontier

163
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:05,180
am ruffles nothing is without problems
and don't believe anyone who says so

164
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:10,490
for the first time data is r-va site
someone the cloud but what exactly

165
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,579
when our backups being done where are
they physically

166
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:17,069
with access to them will I know if they
were accessed

167
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:20,399
am how do I know if my data was being
accessed

168
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,600
what happens if there are problems are
used to have the phone with my caso

169
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,110
I call the man I shouted at him to fix
stuff now we can do anything

170
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,319
and those also some privacy issues with
some companies mostly european

171
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:40,319
the cleanest like the wall of sass
implications that you can use

172
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,889
am so with every new solution though
also

173
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:47,209
new security challenges this is an axis

174
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:51,279
anywhere world so it means I can access
my data for many location

175
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,999
any computer any operating system any
browser

176
00:10:54,999 --> 00:10:58,230
I might not even have an antivirus does
know

177
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,399
no restrictions on it mom

178
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:06,160
I'm at the mercy of my Fassbender well
not what operations is nothing

179
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,160
for example in office 365 the only log
data modification

180
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,480
if I were to if I someone would download
my entire office 365

181
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,779
I would only know if that happens to
edit the documents

182
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:22,120
which makes no sense this effectively
new in broad

183
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,399
attack bechtel if you have twenty
thousand years old that means

184
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,339
you now have 20,000 attack vectors
waiting

185
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:34,819
at home and I didn't even count the
mobile devices which now can also

186
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:41,309
axes data and when was the last time
when you use sassy got an alert about

187
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:45,180
I suspicious activity on potential
breach

188
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,769
and eat enterprises you seem systems to
manage security incidents

189
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:53,110
do sass a applications lays seem

190
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:56,290
incident com

191
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:01,019
so to better understand if they took the
very popular tax and I saw them into

192
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:05,259
three categories and the infrastructure
allow the application layer and then use

193
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:06,339
a lower

194
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:09,410
now in the old Wall all these

195
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:13,160
while the responsibility of the IT staff
and del job

196
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,869
was very well-defined you have company
computers

197
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:20,100
the inside the perimeter if they're not
to be managed

198
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,209
and you have to protect against all
these three

199
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:28,499
in the south wall then fought till layer
and application it is the responsibility

200
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:30,639
of the shuffle vital now

201
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:36,339
and the they IT staff is left only with
attacks on the end user

202
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:39,779
but the new old also says that for now
my day

203
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:43,499
made it can be accessed from any home
computer on my wife's computer or my

204
00:12:43,499 --> 00:12:44,449
sisters

205
00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:47,740
how is the IT staff supposed to protect
this

206
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,720
simply have no control no governance
although these tax

207
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,050
on so don't say this I want to walk you
through

208
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:58,369
a very rudimentary I'll

209
00:12:58,369 --> 00:13:01,949
and now attack scheme and we're going to
Pete

210
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:05,649
at Taliban attack of on-premise so says

211
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:09,019
and South applications one against the
other

212
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:14,749
fell to that of an on-premise would
basically be comprised the five stages

213
00:13:14,749 --> 00:13:20,209
you'd have the break-in stage the latch
on expand gathering next for trade

214
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:24,259
I and because this one has been here for
quite some time

215
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:28,990
you can fine for every stage a list of
tools that are supposed to prevent

216
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,249
at this stage in the next stages for
example

217
00:13:32,249 --> 00:13:36,949
for a break in we have IDS is which
should be able to find show called

218
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:41,649
you if I was we ought which are supposed
to block among mobile services

219
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:44,910
for the latch on you have the endpoint
security solutions

220
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:50,040
mom for expansions use different subnets
indians even firewall rules

221
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,410
and I D S is mom for the gathering
exfiltration

222
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,910
you too high to control as much as you
can what data comes out of the

223
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,160
organization

224
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,779
and rocket arm you also have some DLP
solutions if you want to

225
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:06,910
asleep sensitive data from coming out

226
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,949
but in the south wall this is

227
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:13,290
really easy all you need to do is the
break-in stage

228
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:17,040
and a gathering stage and what do you
get over here don't get all the data

229
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,949
you simply gather the credentials of the
user and I'm not talking about Israel

230
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:21,819
apostle you can

231
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,949
gather his toe can always indication
cookies

232
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:29,179
any simply get out does not play there's
no reason for you to stay here

233
00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:32,899
you simply go to whatever you want you
so many toll on Sat 19

234
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:35,990
proxies and simply axis the South
solution

235
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:42,139
for many well so want to get the keys to
the kingdom in the got on stage

236
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:45,749
it's game over no one knows where you
access the service from

237
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:48,949
it started love someone enough and does
know

238
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:53,559
I traceable evidence on that attacked
climb

239
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:58,929
mom so you don't understand what the
keys to the kingdom all

240
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:02,399
I'm going to walk you through the
evolution of authentication in the cloud

241
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,480
era

242
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,300
so if you can all guess the starting
point is simple he is an impossible

243
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,800
but you know once you use twenty so this
is

244
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,769
doesn't leave a scale it's obvious have
their own powerful policies

245
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:17,829
and we currently expect my a my so this
is

246
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:21,970
my so we may use of to remember twenty
different passwords

247
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:26,550
mom so whenever the when there's a
problem the solution

248
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,740
it's called single sign-on single
sign-on

249
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,749
provide also identity providers also
come to solve this issue

250
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:37,759
user provisioning in the provisioning
and what happens if I have

251
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,170
a thousand users what happens if I hired
a new one what happens if I'm letting go

252
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:46,949
of a of someone for employees and I need
to go to twenty different South

253
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:47,989
applications

254
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:51,689
and the same his account in any of these

255
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:55,329
mom so the the also

256
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,470
isso providers in the cloud a simple
violence

257
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,610
an on-premise don't own this world is
very

258
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,769
amateu mom for the cloud

259
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:08,110
someone your guesses wanna be in an Oct
a an on-premise

260
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:11,850
Microsoft has its own Active Directory
Federation services

261
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:15,199
and IBM solution HBSS solution

262
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,970
an like everything does a portable wall
what should everything support what the

263
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:23,100
most common standard for all
applications so

264
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,779
this political will is kinda over down
2.0

265
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,800
kinda announced this victorious

266
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,819
that is unless you ask Microsoft which
have a different very weird stuff said

267
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:37,420
to them and they called oh yes for the
nation

268
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,980
om so

269
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,369
I'm going to the just give you a quick
overview sample

270
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:47,619
an my point is to show that it's hard

271
00:16:47,619 --> 00:16:51,970
any stuff to get it right and we believe
that though many vulnerabilities because

272
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,089
it s

273
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:56,540
so as families security assertion markup
language

274
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,839
and its elevated its 9th birthday last
week

275
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,699
an it's used to exchange claims about
someone's identity

276
00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:07,529
for the first time instead of going to
this to a service in giving him

277
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:11,809
hi my name is not on this my passport
you simply come with a signed claim

278
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:16,039
that says okay I'm norm this guy says I
am who I say I am

279
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:19,740
if you trust them let me go am than a
similar law

280
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,169
arm Pollock also being used throughout
the web

281
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:27,220
ideal in South applications all between
different South applications

282
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,220
for example if you log into your bank
account

283
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,470
and you go to you credit card statements
am

284
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,610
you might be redirected with a signed
certificate

285
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,799
do credit card company that'll
difficulty sign

286
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:42,820
I by your Ben

287
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,429
mom you also have difference of
applications

288
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:52,039
for example office 365 is comprised of
different products fused together

289
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:55,840
and to get for one product to another
get lead directly with a signed

290
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,179
certificate

291
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:00,230
send false I integrated walked out Kong

292
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:04,690
into the service and therefore when you
go from cell phones to all the cum you

293
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,350
go

294
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,480
with a signed certificate I am

295
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,600
so then walks the every time a flow has
three parties

296
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,620
the cell is provided the consumer those
their their browser which is do you know

297
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,789
and %uh the Identity Provider and the
brothers

298
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:25,159
basically moved around between the FBI
and ATP

299
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:28,669
and the reason it's the browser that's
doing that is because sometimes they

300
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:31,250
don't people vital is an on-premise
service

301
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,740
which is not always accessible from the
internet

302
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,250
am it kinda looks like this I'm not
going to

303
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:42,049
boy you my goes to show you that it
clearly it's complicated

304
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:45,440
and it's hard to get it right and sample
is

305
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,110
kinda elaborate and complex

306
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:52,710
and this is a potential Achilles heel of
many sassa plications

307
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,320
it's really difficult to implement it
right you can

308
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,620
take advantage of someone who is like
live-action a sec

309
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:03,630
but even when you do that you still have
lots of stuff to implement yourself

310
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:07,690
there's no mainstream standard
implementation and built ewbal earth

311
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:12,029
which is closest to that but it's Juve
only in not many people use it

312
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:15,929
so everybody's gonna implement it on
their own and wing it

313
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:18,929
and because it will always be complex
the often mister

314
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:23,640
they often missed security stuff and
when you have different

315
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,090
implementations you also have
compatibility issues

316
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:31,120
and issues of hey this code will only be
viewed by two people

317
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,250
know by an entire community like us and
also

318
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:40,830
we believe that they are not a bother
waiting to be discovered in this area

319
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,990
and not many people looking at it and

320
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:48,490
a there were already something simple
discovered and we're going to see lots

321
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:51,570
we believe in the following yes mom

322
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:56,220
and now ninety talk about some
high-profile vulnerabilities

323
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,840
I wasn't done going to talk about the
Facebook remote code execution

324
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,179
which was an ass is so bad basically
we're going about to talk about the

325
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:05,309
enemy within which is

326
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:09,080
currently responsible disclose all
stages I'll

327
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,510
in about the I thank you which is this
messing office 265

328
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:17,080
token disclose about mom

329
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,720
other questions there now

330
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,049
okay go on so the Facebook

331
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:27,179
viability was found by original film I'm

332
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:30,440
in November 13 and it

333
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,919
by the way paid Facebook's highest
bounty

334
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:40,130
and to allow it to Philly 3.5 K and it
resides in the Forgot Password flow

335
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:44,350
when you face you can you forget your
password you can use your Google account

336
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,519
in order to prove

337
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:49,630
that you own a specific Facebook account

338
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:54,330
now it's not there forget my password to
need to send a link to my main flow

339
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:58,880
it simply you I Facebook link directly
to Google

340
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,370
and then we'll send you a little
difficult saying okay this is a Google

341
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:02,809
user

342
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:07,600
you can pass them and it while teasing
Open ID which is not death

343
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:13,100
and similar to and Sam and Facebook
leaving lib X amount to process these

344
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,730
XML

345
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:17,139
and the rest of the logic the
implemented himself

346
00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:20,669
om any turns out the default settings
for leave XML

347
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:24,970
permits a feature called XML external
entity

348
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:28,870
i dont know this feature basically means
that you get to open local files and

349
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,880
connections

350
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,990
com to run simply took advantage of that

351
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:38,080
the first I was able to read was there
at the ATC possible file

352
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,120
and immediately contacted Facebook and
you also had an ad-hoc an Escalade at

353
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,730
on to a full remote code execution

354
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:50,159
com the fix was very simple it was to
add

355
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,360
remixing now the same entity low though
the thing is that this I believe

356
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,789
out packed with features and when people
keep

357
00:21:57,789 --> 00:22:02,970
implementing the same code over and over
again the only bound to make mistakes

358
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:06,419
and the truth if the these things are
quite common in quite easy

359
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:10,059
to do and default values are not always
a queue

360
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:13,139
for example in our code we wanted to
implement

361
00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:16,480
action a signature validation with
lyrics in a sec

362
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,779
and the default value is a live-action a
sec allows

363
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:23,010
allows one to a list

364
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:28,679
a list of acceptable I certificates when
you give an actual for validation

365
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:31,870
which means basically that it's not
validating

366
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:37,419
again for the gift you gave on

367
00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:41,760
then within is a vulnerability in one of
the top 10 fat publication

368
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,929
and i cant coldly disclose which because
it's

369
00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:49,960
in responsible disposal faces on
anything for advantage of the paradigm

370
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,330
that

371
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:53,880
suffocation consider their own domains
to be safe

372
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,139
at but what happens when a suffocation

373
00:22:57,139 --> 00:23:01,580
allow users to customize their pages all
even at low JavaScript

374
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,440
that paradigm broken and it allows us to

375
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,200
easily in silently make a drive-by
attack on

376
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,600
and get it ok Aaron Cook is a few years
ago

377
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,740
mom the film on a million went up about

378
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,850
is there nice second arm

379
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:23,049
so we need many times they are because
it simply leaves no trace

380
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:27,309
just like a nice again it melts away an
its aircraft

381
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:30,600
HTTP response which it leaves one office

382
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:35,490
365 token which are basically the keys
to the office 365 Kingdom

383
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:40,809
on we found it in the wild at one of our
clients in April 13

384
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:43,960
and we set up a temporary fix two days
later

385
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,779
and we'll report it on me 13 mom

386
00:23:47,779 --> 00:23:51,200
Microsoft released a patch on the summer
for 10

387
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,419
arm so I'm just gonna give some
background

388
00:23:55,419 --> 00:24:00,009
com so I'll proxy encountered a very
unusual HTTP request

389
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:03,549
and it was flagged by Al Euless TX due
to reasons

390
00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:07,929
first of all it was destined to a and
unknown toll gateway

391
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:13,519
I talk to web and second the request was
performed by Microsoft world

392
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:16,850
we shouldn't happen for domains which
owned company controlled

393
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:21,100
am it was automatically scheduled for
their

394
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,580
review by Adam left because it exceeded
a certain threshold

395
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,580
and of story begins arm

396
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:31,389
I'm going to do see you very quickly to
office 365

397
00:24:31,389 --> 00:24:35,909
showed the differences between an
between at their

398
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:39,950
on-premise office solution houghton two
races to cloud I'm

399
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:45,759
so basically office 365 is Microsoft
cloud offering for organizations

400
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:50,100
om I would say its main competitor is
collapse for businesses

401
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:54,990
what they really wanted to have is to
have this unified solution will you have

402
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:59,519
instant messaging emails document
management and file-sharing

403
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:03,190
and every month scrambling to have the
best solution outer

404
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:07,490
mom so office 365 is comprised of

405
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:12,169
very different I very different product
lines for pollack lines

406
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:15,340
little fuse together with some clue on

407
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:19,470
you have to Exchange Online which you
can use for host to the mail services

408
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:24,090
you have show point on line for
collaboration at one right bro for file

409
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:24,980
storage

410
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:28,460
and Office 2013 desktop applications

411
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,740
I am now

412
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:36,429
office 2013 with changed at radically in
order to integrate it for the clout

413
00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:39,519
Microsoft is putting lot of its money

414
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:44,340
on the clout and office 2013 is the
perfect example for that

415
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:48,110
I we're going to talk about wall mounts
Lee but it's the same for PowerPoint

416
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,279
Excel in 10

417
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,889
and outlook wasn't changed that much

418
00:25:53,889 --> 00:25:57,570
for clout except for integration with
one drive

419
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:00,799
am so basically office 2013

420
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,409
in South Seattle on both you sign in
with your and Microsoft account activity

421
00:26:05,409 --> 00:26:06,440
product

422
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,130
if you want to use show point and one
drive you have to be signed them

423
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:13,950
and there's also this psychological
campaign to get you to sign in

424
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:17,059
you you will see these are the corn if
you're not signed in

425
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:21,070
am when you go in save a file these
options show up both

426
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:27,070
no lead and the little ones an once you
are signed in its kinda looks like this

427
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:30,490
arm so when you design in

428
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:35,539
a wat simply takes your usually
impossible then exchanger feat for talk

429
00:26:35,539 --> 00:26:35,880
and

430
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:41,799
its told the token internally n if you
do try not to the shop inside 01 drives

431
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:46,830
or want life mom than wat simply gives
that ok into the

432
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:51,590
to decide to get a cookie in a town at
the cookie is a short life span for the

433
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,830
token has a really long one

434
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:57,259
on so back to our case

435
00:26:57,259 --> 00:27:01,409
mom when a foot race after queso we
started

436
00:27:01,409 --> 00:27:04,720
checking one device into region in on it
what time

437
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,960
on we got to this specific amply that
their

438
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,639
when he was on the computer made a the
request for the document

439
00:27:11,639 --> 00:27:16,059
and we reconstructed his actions when im
we founded the trigger

440
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:19,820
was this highly-touted fission mailed
the will send to him

441
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:23,299
it was kinda like I spearfishing and it
contains

442
00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:27,120
not only data element is Java don't know
contained

443
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,399
his name from information about and mom

444
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,590
and the destination link was hosted

445
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:37,590
on it all gateway om it was using it
also miss

446
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:41,710
which away a posting at this would be so
this is without letting me know

447
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:44,860
what device Lee hosting them on am

448
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:48,210
when we continue the investigation we
found out that of course

449
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:53,320
they even so it was no longer accessible
and IP in the one was anonymous proxy

450
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,490
am no no documents to investigate
because

451
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:01,080
he didn't have the document amply and
the 105 house because we didn't have the

452
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,490
document ido

453
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:07,250
on now I'm going to show you the demo

454
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:11,659
we're going to do it step by step and
please feel free to slow me down if

455
00:28:11,659 --> 00:28:13,409
something is unclear

456
00:28:13,409 --> 00:28:16,490
and with ninety is below to the web
debugging proxy

457
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:23,490
you can get it for free and but it

458
00:28:27,859 --> 00:28:30,659
so the first thing are you not seen this
her

459
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:37,659
the FAC up

460
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:54,830
nato great so the first thing I wanna
show is

461
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:59,080
what world looks like when it's trying
to get a document phone

462
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,269
I don't show up in sight so I just set
up this document a few

463
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:06,710
hours ago going to open it and

464
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:10,630
you can see this document we just leave
it from the SharePoint site

465
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:14,820
and we're going to just see exactly what
ATP quest will being done

466
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:19,779
I know to get a document so the first
request was a probe

467
00:29:19,779 --> 00:29:24,360
I done by Walt in order to assess
whether or not it can access

468
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,760
directly on the ball was being done to

469
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,730
well the document the site and the
response that will got was 41

470
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:36,980
unauthorized it needed to be that means
you not authorized yet but you can

471
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,330
continue in tight

472
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:41,769
unauthorized am you can also see this

473
00:29:41,769 --> 00:29:46,649
hint which says I how should i
authorized with what mechanism should i

474
00:29:46,649 --> 00:29:47,320
authorized

475
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:52,049
and the says hey you should authorize
with the people side Ecol mechanism

476
00:29:52,049 --> 00:29:55,740
when this is the end point you should
contact so

477
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:59,470
walled being the good boy here mom

478
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:04,419
just simply send an authorization
request to this and finds you can see

479
00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:05,029
over here

480
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:08,710
and a also sends its token

481
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:13,149
along with it and office 365 simply says
OK

482
00:30:13,149 --> 00:30:17,039
this is a good one you can this is your
cookie from now on you can use it

483
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,409
whenever you access the service

484
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:22,990
and world have my document now I am

485
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,789
so just to make this a bit easier for us
om

486
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:30,559
I've ended the real simple script it's
will

487
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,010
pop-up anytime a token is be is sent

488
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:37,860
the summer so we're going to close world
one more time

489
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:44,860
going to clean fiddler saving the
document office

490
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:53,210
and let's to start again now every time
we see this window we know

491
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:58,909
a token will send some well at this time
it will send to shopping dot com so

492
00:30:58,909 --> 00:30:59,559
that's okay

493
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:03,340
I am so what I'm going to do now

494
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:08,049
different let's wait for Wat to stop the
stuff loading dock in great

495
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:11,279
what I'm going to do now I'm going to
try and open

496
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:15,730
document for malicious web server I said
this web server up but it's

497
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:20,360
and not having any document so the
question go out but it will not succeed

498
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,320
because there's no document dislocation

499
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,970
and you can see wall to doing the same

500
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:29,110
it's probing just send broke to my
malicious site

501
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:33,450
and my webserver replied okay you can go
ahead no need to panic 8

502
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:38,580
and we'll just continue to get the file
but what if I am so we're all the same

503
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,970
way the chill pointed

504
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:44,190
askin him afghani 210 decay on so let's
do that

505
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:47,960
in order to do that we're going to use a
mechanism called auto responder

506
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,580
and I filler has a very

507
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:55,330
need up with one it simply lets you at
the walls for specific

508
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:59,399
a request so we're going to add a
willful dis

509
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:03,990
request and all we're going to add we're
going to apply the same way

510
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:07,029
the chill point just did so we're going
to

511
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:10,620
copy the way show point applied and

512
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:17,620
I'm going to call it options reply if
I'm going too fast just tell me

513
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,679
on and if also if there are any
questions and be

514
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:26,720
happy to answer up and so

515
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,210
when we're going to do we're going to
add a wall which whenever someone

516
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:31,760
requests this URL

517
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,659
going to apply to him with the plywood
just wrote

518
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:39,000
months it safe great

519
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,149
so next time someone is going to ask for
this year well

520
00:32:43,149 --> 00:32:47,260
world will happily will chill fully sent
OCR

521
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:51,850
that give it a go so I'm going to open
my malicious document

522
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:55,659
and you can see that my token with just
sent

523
00:32:55,659 --> 00:32:59,679
to the militia site on so just to give
you

524
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,679
I'll explain better more this in a bit
just to give you an example of

525
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,279
what you can do with this we're going to
make the same

526
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,470
the stain request wat sent to my web
server

527
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:14,559
we're going to execute it again but this
time we're going

528
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,860
to send it to Microsoft this request

529
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:22,419
is meant to convert the talking to have
in hand to kooky

530
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:29,419
so that's exactly what we're going to do
solely up

531
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,320
yeah I just 100 a token I know great

532
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,529
so as you can see a shell point was
really kind and just gave me

533
00:33:46,529 --> 00:33:51,549
a cookie for my usage and if I were
malicious attacker this mean I wouldn't

534
00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:58,549
have to talking for this so as you can
see I can't login without indicating

535
00:34:02,059 --> 00:34:07,340
give me the login page the login page
but when I'm going to do I'm going to

536
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,530
add a cookie manually

537
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:11,990
the SP oh i the CRL cookie

538
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:15,389
we just got pancho point on

539
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:19,290
and going to access the site one more
time

540
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:23,639
this I was going to look different so

541
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:28,250
sending a malicious site and asking
israel to open a document though

542
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:32,359
is all you need to do in order to get
his office 365

543
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:36,780
token but we did managed to confuse what
a bit because

544
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,440
now thinks it's not signed in because we
didn't

545
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,250
exactly malate how shell point both but

546
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:48,030
it's not that easy and so the

547
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:52,010
just a matter of adding more walls like
this phone I just main entrance

548
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:55,820
on let's Adam

549
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:59,599
up

550
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,210
now I'll purposes for some 120 opens a
document

551
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:09,020
he should be able to see a document that
the document that impressed in

552
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:12,210
and shouldn't be aware that he was just
being

553
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:15,930
prank for his token so I just clicked
this

554
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:20,160
federal just found the token and the
document just got

555
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,310
some document they found my computer
which is great

556
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:27,160
I could also feel this just like in our
case when a document billion $11 for

557
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,220
that specific user

558
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:32,160
I include anything that's also what is
saying the him protected you

559
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,160
in five on the night can be contain
viruses that great

560
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:39,790
comp

561
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:44,080
quite so other questions

562
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:48,700
okay just a min

563
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:52,650
great

564
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:56,130
so we manage to fully reproducing
develop you see for this

565
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:59,850
am and work on it in the Microsoft
Security Response Center

566
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:03,640
on the 29th me with a detailed research
in walking PLC

567
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,300
and we began a quest for cash om

568
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,560
it took over six months for the patch to
come out even though this was their

569
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,920
fun in while vulnerability and a very
critical one

570
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,930
ennui took us a few weeks to bypass
Microsoft bullshit filters

571
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:22,250
reproduction took down a few weeks even
though we gave them

572
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:25,510
walking PLC and without wondering

573
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:28,880
once a patch came out was this a
responsible disclosure over the

574
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,010
responsible one

575
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:33,280
I mean users will viable for a very long
time

576
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,250
mom maybe we could have done something
to prevent it or maybe

577
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:41,260
minimal as the time the panel had no
pressure on him

578
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:45,670
to fix this issue and also in the
meantime some companies could have

579
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,000
protecting themselves

580
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,330
may be using some may I D S fools may be
sending some walls on the proxies

581
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:55,220
I am well with a good guys or the bad
guys

582
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:58,640
want social and

583
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,030
we also wondered why was the beloved the
classified as important other than

584
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:02,780
critical

585
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:06,040
you need understanding in the finest
death

586
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,260
the only metric IT staff cares about
they care about

587
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:13,480
how critical is this to fix should I
postpone it to the next battery fix it

588
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,100
right away

589
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:17,710
am so we got this weird ansel for
Microsoft which has

590
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:20,980
which have okay its I'm so it's not

591
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:24,850
critical because it's not a remote code
execution but

592
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:28,130
were talking about the South application
the goal of

593
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:31,190
my of me is to get the day Dover
corporation

594
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:34,720
idoney remote code execution for that om

595
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,920
so we thought thinking how the
addressing southwell abilities

596
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,520
are they using the same metrics from the
Windows Phone a

597
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:47,170
could do we need or use a new metric a
pneumatic for

598
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:50,370
vulnerabilities in South arm

599
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:54,510
1.0 you that most have this my abilities
are fixed silently

600
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:58,320
and no one knows about them I am that
there's no

601
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,300
see the landlady for South applications
suspend all simply use their own

602
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,080
discretion whether or not to report a
vulnerability or not

603
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:10,030
on they really don't want to have one
because the need to keep up this image

604
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:14,490
being sick you and they are really
reluctant to fix the reported once

605
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:19,230
because time is money and they can make
money adding features not fixing bugs

606
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,340
and basically my messages that

607
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,690
it's all share responsibility we should
insist on having

608
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:31,050
I'll a CB Anthony for everybody and one
little bitty we finally both

609
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:35,410
we should push for unified disclose a
mechanism for Seth just like we have

610
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:39,370
phone price of 20 and we should also
insist on apply

611
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:42,660
bushel for early patching arm

612
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,790
so I'm

613
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:50,410
really glad to talk and I'll if there
are any questions I'll be more than

614
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:57,410
happy time for

615
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:02,120
this list ever a good to use

616
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:06,180
a4 external entity loading that was not
a security hole

617
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:09,940
well in some users specifically in
opening de

618
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:15,870
it is useful but and you do need to
employ some the safety mechanisms that

619
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:18,290
obviously weren't engaged on Facebook

620
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:21,660
on so that the goodies were

621
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:26,250
that I am

622
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:29,900
I'm not sure because for what i saw. you

623
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:34,590
can always walk around a it's more the
of doing stuff more comfortably

624
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:38,930
and having suffered more maintainable
then the new usage

625
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:43,450
point view yes

626
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:46,680
focusing on I tax the

627
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,940
his juror

628
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:57,150
up

629
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:02,250
there or his

630
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:05,360
question well

631
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,500
the assholes whereas I'll

632
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:13,260
your with these anyone law what about
you

633
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:18,250
all okay

634
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:22,990
so the answer the second question and
the first I

635
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:26,240
as I said a someone's ass implications

636
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,570
do have Valley high-level flogging I

637
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:33,220
some only keep logging for modification
and

638
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:37,310
dealt indication logs are sometimes
missing some information

639
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:41,940
and some platforms don't even keep track
of what I peel dingell request form

640
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,170
on now big enterprises have

641
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:49,170
seem systems the to use to constantly on
data

642
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:52,950
from for me these applications that the
most use in primis

643
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:56,430
and still South obligations

644
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:59,530
have no well-defined interface to send

645
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:03,200
the auditing data to the same systems so

646
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,620
the really huge gap over here if there
are logs

647
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:10,160
no one's you no was looking at them
regularly and

648
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,040
usually when dollars though incomplete
and

649
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:21,040
you just might be the first question
thanks I C

650
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:32,670
you mean attacking the infrastructure
and application up

651
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:38,620
show show so these attacked services
have always existed even when you have a

652
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,670
corporation

653
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:42,850
then you have your own support staff in
your own IT staff

654
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:47,160
I says companies we'll have more

655
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,350
bang for buck on that earlier than you
own enterprise

656
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:53,480
the simply invest much more money in
that because they know

657
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:58,120
it their ass on the line and and earning
and we've actually walked with their

658
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:02,130
quite a few ass ass vandals and with the
security staff

659
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:05,850
and the really top-notch people I am

660
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:10,300
I just wanna comment about the
combination of both a few questions

661
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,340
what about audit the logs for action
done

662
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:16,460
by the staff the South provider so

663
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:20,980
that's a very sensitive area iron most
south for viols don't log

664
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:24,140
actions done by the support staff at

665
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:28,290
now many companies that's fine the
swallowing ample examples

666
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:31,820
at sensitive companies that use a
LivePerson

667
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:35,080
on to bad chat with serviceable
tentative

668
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:39,600
though very sensitive data going in his
life was in chat maybe even credit card

669
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,670
or bank details

670
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:45,250
and companies only Waleed who can see
these data

671
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:48,600
can to help desk of live person see this
data

672
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:52,070
on so that yet that's

673
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:55,350
Valley a good point and

674
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:59,410
thanks okay

675
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:06,410
additional questions

676
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:15,130
just inside up

677
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:18,330
projected is just said

678
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:21,990
a Christian it was you

679
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:27,500
I'll in in my assessment services
provider we had sounds

680
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,680
a a an apple ability that disclosed

681
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:34,650
not just my own data but that I love

682
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:39,440
other says customers commingled a
comment ferry flight database table was

683
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:39,820
only

684
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:43,250
customer ID's separate do you find this
rampant

685
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:47,790
practice so what what we're talking
about is multi-tenancy how

686
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:52,470
cesspool vitals a separate its customers
they don't I am

687
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:55,570
postal they provide very little data
over that

688
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:59,410
and they do try to project the image
that those an entire

689
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:02,850
tenses separation but in actuality the

690
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:06,120
levels of operation highly differ and

691
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:09,930
you will find that most suffocation

692
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:13,740
do store data on in the same

693
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:18,160
a in separate databases but on the same
machines

694
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,710
some South providers it depends on
what's there

695
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:25,510
the pallet industry do separate machines
for data storage

696
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:29,140
and very sensitive in the sleeves can
also

697
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:32,540
if the wall for all money for assessment
though they can

698
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:36,130
even get a private instance on the same
South application

699
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:39,510
in separate data center it all depends
on how

700
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,940
how much bargaining power you have on
but

701
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:46,060
this area it's like goods from you to
him like

702
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:51,760
it's all over the place okay it's are no

703
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,090
addition christians where you

704
00:44:55,090 --> 00:45:00,070
was so I just wanted to ask you

705
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:03,620
what do you think are some areas and
suspenders can prove as far as

706
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:04,250
disclosure

707
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:09,370
like would you expect to see the as far
as like a security researcher doing work

708
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:10,150
in the space

709
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:13,450
think what would you expect the
suspenders a reasonable is close

710
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:18,480
I would expect them to at least document
all their

711
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,920
on the vulnerabilities that are being
reported to them the status light now is

712
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,270
that

713
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:26,880
the not required to do that it's not
somehow expected of them

714
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,670
you may have been a little bit is now
that well exploited in the 72 wouldn't

715
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:35,730
tell you about it because they don't
have to they do all they can to keep

716
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:37,170
this image have been secure

717
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:41,030
and will the other side of death we want
people to know

718
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:44,660
I when stuff being fixed and what

719
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:47,990
a so my expectation is to have

720
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:51,110
a CV for South liabilities

721
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:54,930
and that's what we push for that's what
we want and

722
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:58,440
that tool for doing that is applying
pressure on the suspenders

723
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,220
and phone security stuff companies

724
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:05,470
that are responsible for adopting South

725
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:09,510
okay

726
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:13,120
so if the are no additional questions re

727
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:17,230
can take some time left: just another
announcement a move closer

728
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:20,840
talk contribs to at 4 p.m. so

729
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:25,330
if you have any tokens and arm want to
print

730
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:29,490
another paper for the lottery take your
chance to do it and 25

731
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:33,040
at 4 p.m. and I think at least because
real

732
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:37,730
10 minutes too early but it's great
because it gives you the advantage

733
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:40,970
I am 22 to go to the printer

734
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:44,930
and the other one system the talk okay
since you after the coffee break and

735
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:45,870
collect at Oak Street

736
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:46,510
ca
