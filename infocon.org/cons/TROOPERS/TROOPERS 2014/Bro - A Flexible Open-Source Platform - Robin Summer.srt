1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,190
thanks for the introduction so I'm Robin
summer I'm a

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,280
research are at the International
Computer Science Institute in

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,110
and Berkeley kinda funny random other
spending the night with my time with

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,260
their own smoking national up working
with the operations team them

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,689
on any established asking

6
00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:22,259
who has heard of parole before raise
your hands

7
00:00:22,259 --> 00:00:25,720
I'm not that many okay I'll

8
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,320
so I'm trying to basically give an
overview talk it's are both very

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,700
kind of complex for them it can do a lot
of stuff for 30 minutes for the attack

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,800
but I have for you what I can do thought
that he actually start by explaining

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,219
limited the high-level one is pro
actually and

12
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:45,410
as I saw that the title for this tract
infection def

13
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:49,850
attack and research I think and the
previous talk with a point to the

14
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,190
attack part I it supports research
arrest me because both really a defense

15
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,300
toward right it's a known and from
operation a defense to a man is coming

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,410
out of academic research there's a lot
of

17
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,609
kind of book going into the first turn
over the years

18
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,970
on someone we texting a boy is actually

19
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:12,570
on to look at a few other to its first
that network operators

20
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,200
I'm and security incident responders
responders typically use in their

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,890
and any operational life so knew
something like

22
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,229
you to be a maybe for Pacha can
capturing packets actually looking at

23
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:28,380
what's on the white house then maybe why
a shock to look into the protocol it see

24
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,640
what actually if they're going on at the
protocol ever

25
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,390
I'm they might be using from the next
not behind the attacks

26
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,590
and band usually some kind of loving
earth

27
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,020
carried out like I'm recording the net
flow of this longing

28
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:46,039
and then and that is an interesting
observation I'm

29
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:49,049
most most administrators and operators
you some kind of

30
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,969
addition scripting tool to an AFP ideas
together our two post-processing

31
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:56,770
and the kind of crunching the data they
recall it and and and the getting of

32
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:57,780
these two what's right

33
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,850
and idk if you like flexibility
abstraction and abstract

34
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,740
21 way to look at bro actually

35
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,070
if the kind of draw a line there and
outgrowth provided within the sense of

36
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,030
them on these

37
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,950
may ask you for your post in packet
capturing roasting traffic inspection at

38
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:14,860
the protocol ever

39
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,379
campaign attacks and it doesn't
extensive amount of rock recording for

40
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:20,879
that you actually get an archive one

41
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,930
of what's going on a national the most
important point however is that actually

42
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,500
brought comes with its own scripting
language better than

43
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,980
and has a its own domain specific
language which provides couple correct

44
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,540
medium for this kind of setting

45
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,840
and there are two kind of tired these
layers together in the way you couldn't

46
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,000
do if you just have all the separate to
its

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,220
and that way I often say both

48
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,190
no but like a domain-specific papon for
the different language to be sure if not

49
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,060
happen but it's has the flavor of

50
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,459
on you can both stuff with it and you
get a lot of them up from show collected

51
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,690
items then elaborate coming with a
system already

52
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,819
great and another way to say kind of the
same

53
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:06,730
if both really a platform this is kind
of the high number what you thought

54
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,459
what you do if you tap your network like
with any peek at based application

55
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:15,110
you get the packet on their and both
stopped processing those packets look

56
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,170
for the protocol its

57
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,250
and then you get this programming
language the standard library

58
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,420
and then on top of that you can actually
build applications

59
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,489
and the traditional application with

60
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:29,019
intrusion detection and music or bro bro
I D S

61
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:32,810
I'm the kind of I'm not doing that
anymore and

62
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,720
once because I D S just confuses people
they thinks not but both really

63
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,989
quite different and the thing that's
what you can do much more with

64
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:43,830
this platform right so you can do when
ability management final analysis

65
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,319
traffic measurement traffic control
compliance went on all of that you bid

66
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:50,640
basically the writing scripts on top of
Justice platform

67
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,950
habits which

68
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,670
so if I go into more details on

69
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,360
democrats talking on the phone actually
using it anti-federal coming out of

70
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:03,989
research

71
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:08,409
and university's research lab
supercomputers and others kind of the

72
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:09,459
traditional user base

73
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:13,930
but these days it's actually a very
worth a lot of government organization

74
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,560
thoughts of my youth thing at 4.0 ring
and the state also like fortune twenty

75
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,420
enterprise if we have a web widespread
deployment based on the commercial for

76
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,450
anti that you like and crowd are

77
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,000
I don't work in national nap and see if
they the

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,210
National Center for Atmospheric Research
and

79
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,370
at the University Indiana University in
the US actually running one of the

80
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:35,940
largest

81
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,930
to but nothing wanna try it to you this
way: 62

82
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,280
don't security i mean that that is this
the security focus Linux distribution

83
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,450
like a life DVD essentially you just
plug it in

84
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,370
both pre- and thought they are and you
can immediately I'm get a top-five

85
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,710
and and and play with it you do do these

86
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,440
I annual meeting Sufi I would like them
to be at that NPF a

87
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,240
acting the author 2011 wine and and
usually they'll

88
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,510
make 5280 operators from from thirty to
forty of institution showing up

89
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,790
and they're all usually incident
responders before the people actually

90
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,330
using

91
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:15,720
the system operationally day by day

92
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,210
saw I'm going to break the rest of the
talking to

93
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:23,300
into into three parts of a crow can do
for you one is La Plata

94
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,550
producers I a record of going on a
netbook

95
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,400
at second as I got second notify you of
interesting stuff

96
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,200
and third on you can customize

97
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,860
let's look at the first one and I'm

98
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,750
I hope that the US Army sexually calling
these low of five coming off brought the

99
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,340
network

100
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:48,010
ground truth because Italy costs when it
ceased on the Y are independent of

101
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,070
whether you trust the end systems and
you kind of a

102
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:54,370
do any knocking and independent of the
KX the instrument them to do something

103
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,180
for you

104
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,110
it just because of what what their
that's the country

105
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,140
let's look at some command lines
international talks tho

106
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:07,130
youth a two-run growth actually if the
UNIX fight application for the run from

107
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,310
the command kinda

108
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,740
in the same path mode you give it an
interfaith

109
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,660
and then you a phone number it crime
just the packet from the wire

110
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,770
and then you get a bunch of prophets
coming off it

111
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,800
you see from elec a quite like
Electronic Arts

112
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,460
on and and I'm going to look at a few of
them in the following

113
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,150
they all hard money for just asking a
lot for their when structured

114
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,260
you look at one of them the calm not
know basically you get a

115
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,860
accelerator for my daughter of column
coming that often the NTR

116
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,320
and each line in the condo not in
particular issue s1

117
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,380
session as a bottom the water like
usually when TCP

118
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,310
flow on or you can search

119
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,550
and then the following I'm going to look
at a few more is locked in a kind of

120
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,560
because that's why it know how to fix
the slight

121
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,900
and I'm going to just look at the column
so you think the entry of this conduct

122
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,180
ok

123
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,500
and this is again what you get for every
connection the way of the 14 of his

124
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,960
account and that the UNIX

125
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,200
a second since the park I it aside the
unique identify a

126
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,380
to every connection which have been used
to kind of give it across the lot for

127
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,150
you can kinda identify nato

128
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:17,600
either activity relating to the slot
fire and get the IP addresses

129
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,040
get the protocol you get the application
as service SMTP in this case

130
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,200
on interesting yes there hasn't been a
product of the bright you look for the

131
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,280
content

132
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,470
affect even of Park way she looks and
the

133
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:33,360
I'm content of the payload to figure out
that this is ness SMTP session it

134
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,000
doesn't matter

135
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,440
which part that's you get the duration
you get the bites been trying for

136
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,260
a you get like history of of the TCP
never flax

137
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,600
and the last one is interesting part
apparent in this case is empty

138
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,970
bed who doesn't I don't book actually
eat under

139
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,540
I'm things like IP and IP or tornado

140
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,050
right so it doesn't care whether the
SMTP session would be tied up with

141
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,840
something into strips out the other
Hialeah and then got into it at http

142
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,390
internet case

143
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,960
you would see here the unique connection
identify of it out

144
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,640
on top and a cringe

145
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,580
those kind of the most simple all I'm
know but I cannot flow but it actually

146
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,250
be better be direction and you get one
way to find and cheaper

147
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,730
connection it should be no not another
one

148
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:24,590
for every HTP request on the wire to get
one entry like this

149
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:28,210
I don't forget to thank them to tell
through which connection I was on

150
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:32,159
the IP addresses again I before the post

151
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,849
and that the host the your eye referral
if they have it if there were any

152
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:41,020
and saw you look at the once down here

153
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,860
it ought to look at the content of an
HTTP session and it takes you out the

154
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,980
first check from our

155
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,180
I'm going to be using that magic for
that though we have probably searching

156
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,100
for something

157
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,360
on forget by every should be certain to
get that

158
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,770
I yet to get the fate of court for your
fee basically but the Somerset

159
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:07,770
for pointy ears both sides of 1857 Asia
call it together and produce a single of

160
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:14,300
at seven o'clock on very essential in
the way of any kind of part

161
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:19,550
you get a breakdown of I but pen stands
at peace again then the safer spinning

162
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,240
and youth

163
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,630
that the certificate arm

164
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:27,080
more attention for the certificate and
also actually brought hence that

165
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,120
certificate acid

166
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,290
kind of crap said of the wire 120 meters
at the checkout

167
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:38,290
forgets getting indicated whether that
is a valid certificate

168
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,620
to show outwit them but of all kind of
more

169
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,260
and apprise the internal protocols when
this is look so we have a first look at

170
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,360
a house on bro

171
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,620
which basically picks up all it's a slow
communication the wire

172
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,530
and put that into our prior so if you
get if

173
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,990
planet Earth HD session fight them
originally but then it would be sent to

174
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:57,580
the central

175
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:01,410
just like summer my except the public
key for this user

176
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,210
from this IP address is kinda cool
because actually had only does this look

177
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,010
for any more

178
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:12,270
if you control the network just grab the
first look: methods of the way

179
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:17,380
DHCP lauck I kind of things keen again
this time you know and basically

180
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,120
the mac Address earth which are
associated with an IP address a

181
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,430
basically what the US should be sore
hands out

182
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:29,000
for every time there's a new niece you
gonna rock

183
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,920
for from the store basically protocol
based off what I thought on protocol

184
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,400
you get on up I'm the next two examples

185
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,120
I stuff which is kind of which
aggregates information out of my

186
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,180
democratic right into a single place

187
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:46,650
and that once offered a clock for
various protocol analyzers and broke and

188
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:50,110
identify be found for for being a new if
they could be a user agent

189
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:53,150
on a study session I as you see here

190
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,330
physically had fewer okay I'm I feel on

191
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:59,840
an HTTP brother I with you a gin and up

192
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,940
Dropbox desktop client from this IP
address

193
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:07,130
on the other get that from S&P 500 the
user-agent

194
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,780
a or you get that from an FTP server
basically what the

195
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:14,720
but the benefits photo it's aggregate
stephan you can kind of see through that

196
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,390
nato

197
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:19,920
and theory which tryin system on my
network was running width of language

198
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,690
Russian at that

199
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:25,240
at that time

200
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,400
and monastic them before the log files
I'm

201
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,220
and this is the reason capability in
probably one of the most powerful thing

202
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,880
for everything he added to the system
with the fights that long

203
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,910
hi on

204
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,210
for any product heights can transfer
files in one form or the other

205
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:45,490
shep obviously there FTP there's email
attachments SMTP

206
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:50,070
credible basically picks out all these
pilots that extra high content

207
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:54,279
and then passes on to its fine and as a
sub for them and then posits the fire

208
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:56,029
untimely

209
00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:59,200
thought guess you if I

210
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,970
way the past and then it has unique file
identifiers in this case similar to the

211
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,840
unique connection and the first

212
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,450
it into a trough for more for that which
connections I'm with coming from for

213
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:08,810
this

214
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:13,029
on often as SMTP session for I wasn't
even attachment

215
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:16,490
for and it does the MIME type detection
which I to

216
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:19,680
sure you're ready for the hd2 stuff
though this was an executed but I wasn't

217
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,960
executing on a patch to NEMA

218
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,800
and actually computes the hash earth
over the prior contact

219
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,210
know you can pick the session go through
some black dress for example which

220
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:32,450
I if you like like like a list of

221
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:35,670
no matter something up something like
that you can check that and i actually

222
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:38,360
going to show that later

223
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,880
you could also the still has the last
line here got extract the file to disk

224
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,029
if you want

225
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,840
kinda kind of electron five maybe on
executing both

226
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,529
on with another small you could just
record on the fight if you want to

227
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:55,110
which to effective pretty cool from
operator respectfully

228
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:58,760
perspective because suddenly when you
have all the executed with

229
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,130
some user in your network transfer have
it on this can you can run your AB stuff

230
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:06,930
on the park's

231
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:12,400
to know if the last long fight on one
thing many people use these lot 54

232
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,590
is actually understanding the network
better because I'm you can do like lech

233
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:19,540
a bit of crunching on that and you can
kind of the statistics

234
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:24,870
if the recent for example I'm using the
five thumbs-up as a short

235
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:29,050
get this fuken brought up bad brachot
which pics on certain columns on at the

236
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,430
st. step separated from its

237
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:34,610
this case I think just the main type I
thought if you need it

238
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,720
thought I have a number and what you get
is from

239
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,080
breakdown of what are the MIME types
transferred

240
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,690
in your network contention in time for
fire and that of the numbers because

241
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:48,080
this is very bad for Pacific they mean
network looks different of course but

242
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,839
it's

243
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:52,490
this kind of the test they've I really
have for often for of operators

244
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:57,279
and because he's trying to get an idea
what are your people actually doing

245
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,100
and you can use this this kind of style
of another from all these not for use

246
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,770
with either to aggregate basically

247
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,500
on all the features I show tonya second
exam but if

248
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,250
when is the tough top software being
used in my network in terms of number of

249
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,070
Hoth

250
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:14,339
comment on it a bit more complicated
because now you need to on

251
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:17,610
a good bye bye 22 but essentially and
unique in-between

252
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:21,390
but you see the distribution of in the
fifth booking process because in that

253
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,870
but most of the traffic s

254
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,029
HTTP traffic INEC

255
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:29,410
chrome is probably hear the the most
popular brother followed by the other

256
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:33,510
ones and some time update stuff purpose

257
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:38,610
for this earth but what people often
just the wonders of

258
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:43,740
and includes my my lock hightower part
of the of the talk

259
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:48,070
second part is signed up for work and
obviously look for interesting stuff

260
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,270
intention to

261
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:53,620
at the idea sparked on all the

262
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,040
are not get recorded in 2010 hi again
structured in the stiffness

263
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,490
after four hundred shown in the country
action for some people automatically

264
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,060
blocking on the scanner for example

265
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,550
today in the face the to their firewall
and just putting brought in place with a

266
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:08,730
friend

267
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:12,990
on these are all in the %uh that's
probably for it can generate

268
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:16,200
and I'm going to talk about their fall
one exam both

269
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,540
which I'm boat for the thought of
something simple

270
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,839
and that is just like him like a very
simple a toothbrush juristic for finding

271
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,920
suspicious suspicious SSH logins

272
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,460
I'm 1s so for many fight that hunt out
that

273
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:36,260
and they there really any half log in
from other countries

274
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:40,560
i think %uh price for the US a so or
maybe though that the the

275
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,920
the fourth countries pay CFH looking for
misconduct may contain at least

276
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,600
so broken easily watch for countries
people often from every kind of success

277
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,180
with a strong enough GOP

278
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,620
goip lookup mentions that again from
reckless the wetness whatever you like

279
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:00,649
and basically can generate an hour

280
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:04,800
on second heuristic if and interesting
post in arkansas

281
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:10,190
automation is that if somebody from
external flowing into your side

282
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:13,480
and then %uh H login comes from

283
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,649
a system the DNS name for example of
SMTP

284
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:20,790
dot something well kinda fought for most
systems right i mean SMTP server from

285
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:23,680
external for not really talking to your
network

286
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,920
I most likely that that s and they
deserve a compromise and some is

287
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,670
confusing if I hope to get into your

288
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,830
and temperature sticks actually pretty
effective have found a number of

289
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:36,310
compromise for strength a or potentially
compromised system for

290
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:41,710
a as the slogans coming

291
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,980
more interesting with more sophisticated
is intelligent integration

292
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:49,200
so basically this is the basic that idea
to check in at work

293
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,910
both us looking for staff and you can t
find earth stop Mary flexibly and earth

294
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:57,010
in the center of it in given
intelligence like back to earth

295
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:00,810
of IP addresses blackness of bad DNS
names

296
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:04,959
you at spiderhouse basically all these
that its various very thoughtful feet on

297
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,110
the network

298
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:10,300
I fifth the collective intelligence
framework which in the US is

299
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:15,199
I'm a a list of youths distribute them
on the university's

300
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,939
and recipes the button energy kind of
feed off of bad stuff

301
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:23,530
and time you know spend house and many
enterprise customers actually have

302
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:27,850
customer proprietary fits so you can
take this back let's put them into bro

303
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:31,010
and then the interesting thing is tokyo
stocks monitoring for these things

304
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:31,660
basically

305
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,710
everywhere where and IP address let you
know if their shows up

306
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:39,940
for an HTTP quite fast after summer had
a ride and that's a DNF name

307
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,260
and at the National cup of coffee after
on the cause

308
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,970
SNTP in the received line death and the
Nasdaq DNS name

309
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:50,330
forever one of his back is that the Half
Men shows up

310
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:54,410
project this is an example I'm not

311
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:57,559
in this case if you feel a whole lot
between the posts

312
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:01,640
I it's unknown earth here collective
into framework

313
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,020
this worth about the main being followed
and actually coming out of the FTP host

314
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:05,850
header

315
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:11,010
and defeat of putting in your loss I
private fleet

316
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:14,679
so and this what works on view times we
can update this is the blackness

317
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:18,250
in real time as you can you this message
was put into a fight and every time you

318
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,200
update the fibro as it works at

319
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,340
at the process is in part we're just
pick that up

320
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,420
and upstate entirely at their
instructions so you can basically

321
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,650
continuously don't know if you can just

322
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,679
get my trip

323
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,750
just for reference these are all the
places but if beef intelligence

324
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:39,480
pieces are being searched facie there
should be all set and they arent and

325
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,510
lots of other

326
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:46,750
I call this passive intelligent
integration and the fans that why you

327
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,410
provide the data

328
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:51,540
ultraPro too bro you put it on discuss
something on

329
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:56,890
there's another version of that
religious active intelligent integration

330
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:01,340
on the way she goes out and on demand to
look for stuff and you guys might

331
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,270
but no the attack in Cali on here I have
never had a library

332
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,670
you can basically you have to hash of a
mad bomber and

333
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:11,850
on you you ask the ass library Dr

334
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:16,240
dia up reassess get them and if they
have to remember and you

335
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,890
after billion St of Canada has my body
is that that basically do you know about

336
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:20,590
this

337
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:24,640
is this bad stuff you could do that
manually by

338
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,600
essentially getting the hash out of the
title of into index but actually broken

339
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,390
do that

340
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:33,320
in real time so ask for price a fire you
can't add it to

341
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,490
20 NS look up with the matter have to
register in every time

342
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:41,940
if they're there for you coming back and
actually lots that

343
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,540
tonight as the on that spot in my final
pop is the custom logic part

344
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:50,929
and and this is also a colleague of mine
actually I'm he says the test paper

345
00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:54,980
doughnuts were both can do for you think
about in the way what do you want to do

346
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:59,230
and the three though the report comes in
I and is about 30 minutes for talks

347
00:19:59,230 --> 00:19:59,730
actually

348
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:04,420
cumshot I'm just trying to trick flavor
of of this point

349
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:09,429
on that fate yet ask if you want bro to
find on map requests

350
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:12,760
of this strange they need their but true
Perth

351
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,890
and maybe the thing you've never K

352
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:20,570
here's how you do that in in both groups
code estado de its programming language

353
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:24,480
it's an event this language from what
you face every time there's an FTP

354
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,360
request on the wire

355
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,340
you know that man information but that
so basically what's the HD matter what

356
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:30,690
the

357
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:35,570
I being requested on and then you love
coat that is both good thing then wish

358
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:38,700
and look at the earth straightforward
it's almost not style

359
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,290
thing that I mentioned I for every
method which affect gaps

360
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:46,429
a you try the same expression here and
at the Metro threat no doubt this is the

361
00:20:46,429 --> 00:20:51,410
end and turn a function which kind of
hands-on after the notice must

362
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:56,580
I'm another county have my about this
one likes to say

363
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,230
as interesting as what you see here is
what you don't see

364
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:03,840
for you to only buy this for every STP
request please do something

365
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,920
you don't need a camera that from point
A T when I that it may be inside the

366
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,210
pant a connection

367
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,270
you need to care about that is a mystery
I hear something going on to basically

368
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,020
get this abstraction of these key steps

369
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:19,210
I which can just then used to express
yourself

370
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,480
and the second and last example is I'm

371
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,160
just a simple scan detect a failure path
if count the faith and love connection

372
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,000
attempts Press of address so that's
really just

373
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,190
neglect when I get off probing at work

374
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:36,640
it and this is kind of the most basic
version of how you could implement that

375
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,290
in both scripting language

376
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:42,020
in this case on you keep a bit over
table that's like a

377
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,380
ok has to be in power hine eitan right
in the mix it by ear

378
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,429
by ever since new method to the number
of has a column of

379
00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:51,890
and to that of a tenth so far

380
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:55,090
for no reason for any connection
rejected which is basically erased by

381
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,090
Bro deceive and

382
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:59,410
every time there's a TCP session
probably try to set up a projector with

383
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,920
the recent

384
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,290
every time that happens this code run
and you basically take the return

385
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,559
address the truth in this

386
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:08,970
disconnection record here and idk if
confused by the dog house that's just

387
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,410
the reference operator like the doc and
see

388
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:14,980
just for syntactic a reason for its
effort to thank you protect the fourth

389
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,610
address

390
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:20,690
you increase the count or and if they
felt pressured reach I left

391
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,370
and practice that there's going to there
is much more complicated because a lot

392
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:26,320
of link on a case with and a different
things to watch for

393
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,920
but the favor he is this is very typical
fall for both good for you remember

394
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,960
stuff all the time

395
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,880
st. Stephen's come in you can fuck or
anything like that from kind of evens

396
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,820
together

397
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,620
you can for example context your
interest here if you want

398
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,920
it's one thing to keep state remember
things to check occasionally and and to

399
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,470
generate

400
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:46,840
I know it's not just us whenever
something interesting

401
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,040
programs that more than 10,000 lines of
this kind of coat

402
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,970
pre britain at first then I'd like we
never talking about at the beginning

403
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:53,840
right

404
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,429
I third just no need to get that out of
the box and and maybe the

405
00:22:57,429 --> 00:23:00,720
the main can a thing to realize the F

406
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,510
basically all others I'll put a show to
find all these are not the shortest par

407
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,610
is really just prosper there's nothing

408
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:11,700
hardcoded into brought into the process
them about how the flock light snow

409
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,870
I'm which means you can write your own
but it can generate your own of I too

410
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,660
can customize then you can

411
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,710
I exclude column to Canada include
additional columns with our

412
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:25,280
taxable you can generate you'll notice
of the same way

413
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,090
and there's a growing community but
inter-party scripts last year there was

414
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,870
this a bit you wanna be caught by Manian
for those who know it perhaps

415
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:34,620
basically support within a day as a as
the only system that quickly

416
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:40,630
to find for these to look for these
indicators which many entry point

417
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:43,710
for this summer's market talk about
about on

418
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:47,220
running out of time for just basically
made my main message he is both really a

419
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,179
platform that supports all these

420
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:52,880
applications II focus on the intrusion
detection pot on

421
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,880
I don't be compliant when trying to
actually much just looking at looking at

422
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,669
the stop lights maybe

423
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:01,040
I from entering software he's not
opposed to run which earth

424
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,870
binary mode has an impassioned your
compliance requirement might be

425
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:08,220
on you have to run patch software

426
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,900
on nothing went right thing so I'm
around tonight out tomorrow if anybody

427
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,510
want to talk about any of these other
things here

428
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:18,440
and otherwise I just want to thank the
National Science Foundation because they

429
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,110
actually a

430
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:22,660
with their funding in every much of this
work for for many many years now

431
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:26,010
contact information for the mall project
um

432
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:29,460
me on twitter through the bride EF hand
a the topic change

433
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:34,200
up both was taken and and actually
recent development be offering

434
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,540
commercial support these days so there's
a company called brought up

435
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:41,179
I haunted by the by the key members of
the protein I

436
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:45,450
which works with enterprise and
government customers

437
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:50,110
anybody happens to see gober on any
point in tupelo

438
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:53,290
might save them sometime after

439
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:53,880
thank you very much
