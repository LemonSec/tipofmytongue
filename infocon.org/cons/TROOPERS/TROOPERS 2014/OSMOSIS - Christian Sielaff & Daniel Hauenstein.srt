1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:05,529
come 230 both day number two I'm

2
00:00:05,529 --> 00:00:09,860
I'm question that the new and be able to
show you a little bit about open for

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,250
monitoring and thought

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,490
something cute issues about that I'm

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,940
yes just the topic on the unknown um

6
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,359
first both the to slight we r with

7
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:26,400
term for for the youth the results the
more respond to them medications of

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:26,760
course

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,340
I am not to do come with the

10
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,890
you quite you company we are booking and
at least

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,199
the I think fifty countries worldwide if

12
00:00:37,199 --> 00:00:40,269
proppant excess more by

13
00:00:40,269 --> 00:00:44,729
and also fixed line stuff and also IPTV
customers

14
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:48,080
the area come from

15
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,750
good information for qtr we are
responsible for

16
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,510
from to cutie climb and be a 30 min that

17
00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:01,369
abuse team testing and so on open fourth
monitoring software

18
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:06,210
a.m. I know they such kind of soft earth

19
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,450
uncritical for the administrator earth
for the day did

20
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,770
business that they're doing I'm the
government to end the you to the network

21
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:18,340
and also the it if you to the hospital
as well

22
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,140
the main focus we r a for village you

23
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,729
availability to earth such warnings that
means Twitter a.m.

24
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:31,350
all function for all solution fear
discovered

25
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,590
uncommon to agent-based that means that
a.m.

26
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,499
the them for monitoring system Alexis

27
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:41,950
to the parliament into the server and
the other paste

28
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:46,740
other scope out the subs put like min

29
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,829
okay if we started I'm

30
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:52,850
out-of-court I'll security monitoring to
a commercial

31
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:57,200
with hopeful intrusion detection at
washington's putting put it into

32
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,420
to

33
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,350
um well it what what other threats to on
soulful general

34
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,979
meant monitoring software as we use in
math works well partly principal

35
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:11,349
it's a week which is are component to
see them everywhere

36
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:15,280
I guess all the vietnam some kind of far
or any mean

37
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,299
like and and means of monitoring
internet work might be

38
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:21,810
are some good luck bro which is more or
less art security networking

39
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,080
but and how but also all not he asked
the things like that I guess you

40
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,390
all hurt them its isn't actually
everywhere um

41
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,099
also per se are those solutions are

42
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:36,769
centralized solutions I mean after
menopause multiple network so that's

43
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:37,780
what you use them

44
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,060
um which means usually those solutions
of

45
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,470
the position in the net with pretty deep
as an closer to the Atman at work not

46
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,450
what near the year the the internet but
while doing in in the internal network

47
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,890
that's interesting for from the attack
upon review that's interesting

48
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,780
right um and is not used in all the
almost

49
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,510
all the environment see about their
could be home network it could be

50
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:07,110
definitely enterprise networks eyes peas
tell calls everywhere so what's so

51
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,170
interesting about

52
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,560
special so special attacks against when
it wants to software will

53
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,519
first of all as a Sep before the
location location location of the

54
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:16,390
location of the net

55
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,480
of the monitoring solutions are
interesting but also

56
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,860
a brings up new attack that also a new
attack possibilities

57
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,650
we came up with the super cool acronym
that's a

58
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,739
MTA CA and CTA MTA CA

59
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:34,110
what the hell does that mean I'm well
that simple

60
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:37,340
it means machines that act as clients
attacks

61
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,810
and clients that excess machines that
act as clients attacks

62
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,909
and you have no idea what I'm talking
about but but but it really make sense

63
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:48,000
of the demonstration on it's just a
different way how to attack

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,390
applications and way how machines are
interconnected

65
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:57,689
I'm well as I said before the rest

66
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:01,530
on monitor suffer apparently isn't more
valuable target because

67
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,400
you know the Lord because of the
location and the excess the different

68
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,430
networks and systems

69
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,239
um and also um the monitoring software

70
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,370
usually does a lot of input data policy
again bro is

71
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,900
is good except for that um but he apt
past La Paz S&P traps

72
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,820
um all that information to get in you
have two parts and displaying and way

73
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,220
um other news web quiz

74
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,620
which is pretty interesting well at
least the one we had a look at arm

75
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,860
which brings up like whole new 12 above

76
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,840
possible box arm like the all with top
top top 10

77
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,080
and actually that's what we found mainly
in all three applications and I'll see

78
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,280
if some homebrew agents on every system

79
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,560
quite frankly I don't like the idea of
installing agents

80
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,850
on a system arm but does sometimes is
necessary to monitor the system's

81
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,290
not gut feeling I don't know and also

82
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:57,930
um as a separate bowl locations
interesting

83
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,940
um it has potential excess a lot

84
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,180
networks and systems he wouldn't see
otherwise

85
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,300
if you were to attack a system Indian
from the internet or

86
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,430
India genes that or whatever

87
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,200
so that the point wrists when the attack
a network itself

88
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,300
software okay I'm

89
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,430
let's have a quick few holes with 18
points of is typically implemented in

90
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,490
any network a yes of course a lot of
that month

91
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,450
the that meant normally you for that
client withdrawals or whatever to access

92
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,870
the central monitoring system you've
discovered

93
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:39,270
subsystem this of course excess to a lot
of network elements with a new netbook

94
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,300
that can be fireworks with us the truth

95
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,620
excess point whatever the youth the it
in basement P author of course

96
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,750
and also the same monitoring system with
long

97
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,280
excess to any services in with a new
network that the

98
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,640
Fiserv odeon author and

99
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,880
mostly inanimate books you have also
excess

100
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,040
I'm my own text insert foot checks for
example to application for

101
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,000
to VPN get her to a backup system
whatever

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,450
also the system to be used to get
information from the chocolate mint

103
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,900
in other on officers victories

104
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,730
ranchers and put in the sponsors who had
also

105
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:26,380
guys that witnessed with us a calling
back without collecting back to the

106
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,510
that the monitoring system %ah

107
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:33,660
who I I'm so what we cover here

108
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,350
um was a poor on and it's really
important to ask this is not an academic

109
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,370
talk

110
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,330
so we're not talking about the potential
attacks or something that could happen

111
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,370
out there

112
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,260
but while the what's really exportable
and at I would say at the end

113
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:49,640
arm its its it's something we learnt
from

114
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,560
what we've seen out there and we
actually use every day

115
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,700
um while consoles will

116
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:01,320
it's also is kinda easy to audit that
kind of that really depends on the call

117
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:01,890
quality

118
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,910
but I mean it's its its kinda something
you can do

119
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:08,170
on your own you can just have a look at
the source code and see if there's any

120
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,800
security box what

121
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,480
arm just to make sure we don't want to
point out that

122
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,040
opens this is less secure than cloth
sauces just the approach we have

123
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,400
and wow it was easy to a sexy all that
this this kind of software

124
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,360
um about the everyone else at least a
chance to make sure that this

125
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,490
about the software you using specially
this comes off West kinda secure

126
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,860
right and also we focused on
market-leading and the interest and not

127
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,680
a software solutions on later see a list
of what we had to look into

128
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,320
arm that was important to us

129
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,390
with it not cover are as I mentioned a
cloth also commercial solutions

130
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:51,050
but that was just a like around decision
um week might do this in future

131
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:55,840
culture oMG would it not expect any
architecture software flaws because the

132
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,240
ass

133
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,080
quite some on an awesome stuff like
checking of SSL Certificates

134
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,350
um don't get me into this are as pretty
bad

135
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,560
wouldn't have a look into the so we were
actually just looking artist this

136
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,280
the software component secure as in
secure program

137
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,070
um wouldn't have it any look into
critical features stuff like

138
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:21,620
oh I have a centralized monitoring
system and I allow the system to execute

139
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:26,080
any random art command online on my on
my part systems

140
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,990
that's a no go and apparently does not
is not recommended but still

141
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,500
you have to the functionality well thats
that security problem per se so we can

142
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,309
have a look at that

143
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:40,089
ada we did not have a look into
additional plugins a future so I don't

144
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:41,259
because he had like

145
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:44,370
a gazillion plugins arm those could be
buggy

146
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:48,170
and that's not fair I mean it's not fair
to you are to blame a bloody

147
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,920
by Ciara at on a plugin and blame this

148
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,160
plane the plane the it's also good to be
insecure bomb

149
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,319
anyhow we have a look at one plugged in
but parking is a very special one and so

150
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:00,310
on

151
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:04,050
bed with me we'll see later a but we
didn't have a look at this

152
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,639
in general and also we can have a look
into the the that the

153
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:11,620
the agents they might be in secure again
with enough time for to

154
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:17,560
arm we might do this in the future

155
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,579
I'm to discover thought about USA

156
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:24,339
machito them won't work on

157
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:27,680
I S doesn't perform from one

158
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,730
phrases from the from their own homepage
a thoughtful and courteous

159
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,399
up both not for one on one point system

160
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,089
worth a lot of the to be with you there
Chelsea interface you the tofu daughter

161
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:41,310
both at least at committee

162
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:47,139
their growth of course industry standard
im everyone uses I think

163
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:51,740
second cause quite interesting million
at on but it's quite

164
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,269
into a single of perspective nearly no
solution this own agents if known

165
00:09:56,269 --> 00:10:00,029
configuration management and what that
they have known logic behind that and

166
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:01,110
all the while

167
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:04,730
the love you and thing was also

168
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,860
based on a goth them but was also quite
interesting from

169
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,240
the workbench of youth the San and it
looks

170
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,290
up a little quite interesting that the

171
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:19,730
knee replaced deep in a network and just
two of the Fort Worth

172
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,019
a possible to get to the opportunity too
low to former

173
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:27,029
HTTPS secure that site love plane GDP

174
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:31,220
and yes even that a collected at least
and the DNS stuff both

175
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:36,509
find things are running their 14
poisoning

176
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:39,509
a also if discovered burn on

177
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:43,100
long incident in the last year's they
are also

178
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,079
remote buffer overflow within our youth
on

179
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:51,019
and and have to talk to her total for 12
up

180
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:55,509
also into things the it's not a case
possibly only in Germany available was a

181
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,850
min

182
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:00,660
I'll English translated article
available within the Internet

183
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,389
the button to think that long them for
negative system both

184
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:11,389
long compromise with a rootkit

185
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,610
so what are the results um well

186
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:18,339
results we actually found critical
issues in all its solutions

187
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:23,230
are critical issues out in our memory
corruption Buffalo heap overflows

188
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:27,199
arm of taiwan's cross-site request
forgery cross-site scripting

189
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:30,569
arm remote code execution up to repot
excess lot

190
00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:34,129
all a bit pretty much arm and also

191
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:37,300
actually we fight the phone many
web-based box which is pretty

192
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,100
interesting

193
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,529
on because there's that you will have to
look into on just

194
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:46,430
clear from this we at you from from a
buffer overflows but they're pretty hard

195
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,790
to exploit on modern systems

196
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:52,379
yet they're still in there world FX now
that they happen in their

197
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,939
on well exploiting for a buffer overflow

198
00:11:55,939 --> 00:12:00,300
I was not as reliable ass exporting
weapons box so we actually focus on that

199
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:00,819
one

200
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:07,819
and yeah

201
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,839
i think thats quite what about you

202
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,639
about to go to the youth in fall the the
men interesting part

203
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:20,850
for my thought is the the world with a
number of confining

204
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:24,940
every third have a lot going on they're
not guilty not fixed by the way north

205
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,079
and flight was kept afloat you can
reserve

206
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:34,040
later so can we get the show on turf who

207
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,259
I arm so what we're trying to use

208
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:41,620
others play he is arm what up on
potential

209
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,839
attacks aka with those box we filed

210
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:49,050
arm we set up to us

211
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,319
well as much light sample network just
make sure so what other

212
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:55,430
the potential waz arm we chose this on
Yin

213
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:58,850
because you have this kind network
security have known in yet like a

214
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:02,920
the the in a part which is and this in
this case it's yet minute walk

215
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,579
and you are monitoring at work in a team
that and the Internet

216
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:13,579
on yeah trying to our we're trying to
actually are we set up

217
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,889
an environment like this so on over here

218
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:23,180
does the hacker as

219
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:27,410
usually at me arm we have a team that

220
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:31,130
Danielle you like to see this is one of
those systems being monitored by the

221
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,230
monitoring solutions

222
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,959
um and one stone

223
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:39,410
that we have far capped the and on the
on the is so

224
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:42,440
an open-source up like a bundle of

225
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,699
monitoring software I'm which is pretty

226
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:49,990
predicament PNET use because it's all
pre-packaged and I can just install

227
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,139
use it and that's that's cool any of the
Atman

228
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:56,540
network with me atom I'm good guy

229
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:01,709
I he's a good guy and a backup backup
iight

230
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:05,230
um what are the assumptions

231
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:09,480
on the first of all we tried to cover
the four installations

232
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,560
doesn't really make sense if we change
like the tweets

233
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,779
all the configuration are that way that

234
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:19,260
we could exploit very very niche like
our box

235
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:24,010
so our its before insulation no become
Federation no plugins

236
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:28,339
um elements before we will not

237
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:32,880
look into the insecure by architecture
box something like the way how

238
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,680
the system's communicate I'll

239
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,459
we didn't set up a fake networking is
really important I'm really really

240
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:42,389
really hate those

241
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:45,490
presentations to AC like an attack and
you like well

242
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:49,930
okay this is really bad but you will see
this kind of network only in the

243
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:50,980
researchers lap

244
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,750
I've seen so many presentations were 16
as I was broken

245
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,500
and Cup those broken everything well why
the fuck do not break

246
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,970
every system out there I mean seriously
so that was the idea

247
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:07,480
are the environment should not be fake
so

248
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:12,490
first box and here the shell snow notes
we see some shelter mode a self

249
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:15,920
that saw first book up with boxes kak ti

250
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,220
aren't there were no acting like

251
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:25,779
with autism network um the box we're
looking into is

252
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:30,420
possible across like request forgery and
Tom

253
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,250
ek will yeah except like functions being
called

254
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,790
untrusted input arms I think anyone know
not

255
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:42,149
know what caused that with grief that's
for 3s its web-based pop

256
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:49,069
okay cool this its importance that white

257
00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:52,300
um resonates the Atman to login

258
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,569
of course um so what's the problem here

259
00:15:56,569 --> 00:16:00,519
um kept the house a couple of
configurations you can set up

260
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:04,380
up

261
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,220
um and one of them is you can you can
fill in

262
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,670
I'll username and functionality is
called Graph Expo

263
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,970
what it does is actually export growth
onto our

264
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:21,970
a the next on system like an FTP server
up

265
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:32,349
I don't need a looking within a minute
little

266
00:16:32,349 --> 00:16:36,749
diver quite interesting with long you
confined on the continuation

267
00:16:36,749 --> 00:16:40,849
menu a the 13th part and also the quest
export part

268
00:16:40,849 --> 00:16:44,289
a any user with access to the book

269
00:16:44,289 --> 00:16:47,619
export wanna go i conferred the that

270
00:16:47,619 --> 00:16:50,629
saw got everything with a you have to
say but

271
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:56,129
the word I don't know

272
00:16:56,129 --> 00:17:03,129
to you can them

273
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,220
for Twitter

274
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,010
they were you the export yep

275
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:21,209
um so tedious actually are you fill in

276
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:24,809
information as to FTP username which is
being down there

277
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:28,480
on the site and it to get

278
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,900
the cross guess forty gets executed when
the app in

279
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:36,210
surf the web site a clicks on a link are
you all

280
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,840
visits a malicious website something the
ACA I did set up

281
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,230
so what does it look like right

282
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:51,230
arm find the ACA at school

283
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,950
so to exploit this I need to know the
URL

284
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:02,660
up the captaincy elation and others pipe
this is how it works

285
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,690
so um I need imp be euro

286
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,890
also the captain station because

287
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:15,890
that's where the crosswalk just forget
strict so I set up a web server

288
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:25,020
and waiting for the admin since like
Surf the internet and did my

289
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:30,150
website or click on a link and that's
what he just ate

290
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:34,360
and nom stopping handler and his
handlers actually just waiting for

291
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,150
that connection I'll takes about a
couple seconds at

292
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:44,420
there we go so as a kitty hostname I'm
on the cactuses

293
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:48,770
that is not good well as we can see if
they have a look into

294
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:52,530
into this configuration if you refresh
this

295
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:56,290
right now we have a we have the
change-up the setting

296
00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:00,380
FTPS is in a word and also if

297
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,640
that interest of in the to be used so

298
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,910
first chap alright so

299
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:12,800
what we actually did is from the
internet

300
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:18,430
we attacked a monitoring system arm

301
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:23,060
so what are the pros and cons when I say
pro I mean of course Pro is an attack on

302
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:23,820
Khan ass

303
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,910
as an attack bro is we have shell that's
awesome

304
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:30,740
um and that's pretty much it the cons
are

305
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,900
well I need to know the captain's the
nation well which is kind of

306
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,980
annoying I mean sometimes is not a
secret but still

307
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,960
on the Atman needs to access a link or
website

308
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,250
um outgoing connections may be
restricted

309
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:49,540
and the Apple needs to be locked in I'm
not really

310
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:53,050
why not really I mean as we saw before

311
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:56,590
apparently he has to be I'll locked in
because cross that's how cross

312
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:00,560
with forgery works well yes there's
another attack

313
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,610
what if the administrator logs out

314
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:08,120
like hooking up the fashionable disable
that

315
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,580
and all soaking up the field here the

316
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:18,580
well secret

317
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,890
with earth and I also look out to the

318
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:26,170
when it on them he's locked up arm

319
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:29,430
once again a start

320
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:32,870
another exploit and trying to trick the
app and to visit my site

321
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:36,580
what's happening now is trying to put
forth

322
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,920
on because of the URL I can't run from
foster

323
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,380
I think this time it's not working

324
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:50,380
with this

325
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:55,060
and I was it mom wafers per second

326
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,240
simple no where the quote was from

327
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,500
yes

328
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,150
yes than one the other quote they've I'm
afraid I can't do that

329
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:10,350
yeah you to that was hell

330
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:17,350
from 2001 business of dole's a sweeping
waiting waiting

331
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:22,750
could take up to a minute beso what
happens actually the crime doc

332
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,110
the export to conduct only getting once
once every

333
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:31,840
every minute %uh

334
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,970
anytime you can have a look into our
act-up

335
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:38,440
see if you look ten yep there you go

336
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,420
so he's not include developing but
apparently I could force the are the

337
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,860
password as you can see

338
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:48,570
I put forth kinda I think 100 200
passwords and couple seconds

339
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:51,710
if that were website were to show off
some

340
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:55,260
kept with video or something like that I
would like five minutes

341
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:59,090
a group of thousands of rockets also
shell

342
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:04,340
alright

343
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:10,190
so that was khaki arm we find a couple
more bucks but this is the most

344
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:10,860
interesting

345
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:15,350
but yet I mean as emitted know the URL
does not really fancy there's just a

346
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,050
simple process

347
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:19,770
transport rewrite so um this next thing

348
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:23,000
check MK taken case back into are for
Nakheel's

349
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,380
an ass a couple bucks as well it does

350
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,730
again have crossed leg press request for
Rielle bach

351
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:34,100
it does self except like functions
because an untrusted input

352
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,840
and that's the that's a really one and

353
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,810
no which Arctic spot across that
scripting getting interest in their

354
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:41,470
trust me

355
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:45,470
so taken K arm

356
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:52,470
I can get the Atman please login
technical

357
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:02,690
though it looks like so it's just the
liked them

358
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:07,290
temple dust bowl and got all the
warnings and the whole spin on it up

359
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:11,020
um STEC Inc a has one functionality:

360
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:15,070
and up that is so it's not as cold snap
shots

361
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:18,100
it small is just back up take a backup
configuration

362
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,290
we saw it and in total

363
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:24,780
the other the under administration to
work there too

364
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:28,330
and you have here to pick up his two
front there's a kitty

365
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:33,890
its natural you can also upload snapshot
again if you've crossed that request for

366
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:34,630
you can upload

367
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:38,460
snapshot what does it mean well
snapshots a

368
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,710
when they when i get some uploader and

369
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:45,020
unpacked you can a or by the way this

370
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,540
up learning can be achieved due to
missing cross just for treetops

371
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,800
on and of the up no it is not just a
snapshot

372
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,600
but he gets executed so the snapshots
pure parking called

373
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,070
which is need because I can build
complex payloads

374
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:03,040
arm gets executed as soon as sexual is
on packed

375
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,350
so again this is pretty straightforward

376
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:10,620
we have to functionality all I have to
do is set up a website

377
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:14,460
artkraft special pay don't trigger the
Atman

378
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,740
been tricked the app into our with my
website

379
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:21,770
%uh penalty on trigger this upload and
trigger

380
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:25,180
another well enough about of a actually
pipe shop

381
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:32,180
how does that look like

382
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:41,620
again for that I need the URL as we can
see up there

383
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:44,980
so sawyer

384
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:48,720
I thought might spoil actually same as
before I set up a website

385
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,260
are tricked the Atman to visit my
website

386
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:57,030
you know that quote it do

387
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:00,110
should know India excellent yes

388
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:04,250
and these Machel that's much quicker
than before because I don't have to wait

389
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:04,630
for

390
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:08,000
for the for the corrupt roundup and I'll
tell

391
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,860
again on I'm on the monitoring system
day

392
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:19,020
shell but thats

393
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:23,580
more or less the same as with before arm
again the Pro S

394
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,880
shell a

395
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,810
and as a person shall about I can't I
can just write anything on the park

396
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:31,230
system

397
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:35,840
I've piping a coat can we don't know
what the Kong

398
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,780
or anything still need to know the URL
uptick in K

399
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:44,090
this could be hot like does information
it could be hard to get

400
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:48,000
um the open its excess a link or site
still

401
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,540
it has to be hit with it website weather
sparks

402
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:55,400
gets triggered the at Ministry locked in

403
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,470
at

404
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:02,110
outgoing connections may be respected
ever since we've seen before

405
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:05,820
if you have a secure network which
although of course um

406
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:09,680
the connection I'm having a connection
from the monitoring network

407
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,800
to the Internet no that should be fine
with between

408
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,980
and they're off I what's well is one
connection that trust that

409
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,930
and it's a connection from monitoring
system

410
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:25,710
to the system which is being monitored
and that's

411
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:30,340
watson's Indians at so I can use that

412
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:35,540
that connection arm

413
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:39,470
I can use that connection

414
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:43,280
but also I still need to you well of
taken K

415
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,290
again is something I don't necessarily
have this information but we can do

416
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:47,780
better

417
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,810
because what it gets displayed on

418
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:54,010
all the installations um

419
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:57,680
with you later special string act and
uses cross site scripting

420
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:03,470
cross-site scripting triggers special
features and what gets displayed

421
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:10,010
is always the agent string all can have
a look at a I'm

422
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:13,140
confuse the host and the

423
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,160
and up there that's an agent strut their
thin string

424
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,720
that's hard coded in the aging on the
target system and get this play

425
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,810
well unfortunately it gets display the
encoding

426
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:27,790
and also we can reuse the connection

427
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:30,810
as I said before there's a connection
from the monitoring system to the system

428
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:31,950
which is being monitored or

429
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,340
which does have a connection to the
Internet um

430
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:39,160
I don't need access to bypass all the
all the files because there was for that

431
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:39,590
right

432
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:43,490
cell on what do we need

433
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:46,760
well apparently I have to modify the
agent

434
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,350
arm ok can we do that

435
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:54,200
well I can I can try and break into a
system

436
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,760
being money talk and check a and change
that agent string

437
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,760
and this is actually a technique that we
doing right now

438
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:07,760
so let's say um that sigh I know about
this

439
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,780
the system in the interwebz which is
being monitored by

440
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,940
some run company and I'm on scanning

441
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,810
network on this case

442
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:28,810
this IP address the 10 09 like 970

443
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:41,310
will comes up taking a walk

444
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,570
is only up for twenty 20 arm

445
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:50,710
so logic conclusion reports course

446
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:57,710
let's try and break this one I'm

447
00:29:05,459 --> 00:29:09,419
so I'm doing right now is brute forcing
a system which is exposed to the

448
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:09,959
Internet

449
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:14,440
that happens all the time right taken
what

450
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,679
and to have some secure password parts

451
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,809
123 456 that's true path what awesome

452
00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:25,029
again I mean %uh the fact that a

453
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:29,320
system which is facing the Internet has
been hacked that happens all the time

454
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,950
so

455
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:37,349
STIs are as the Pacha I know

456
00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:44,349
how to get on the system

457
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:49,980
meet so on I'm on the system and let's
just check

458
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,130
apparently I do have far to interface
and its

459
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:56,180
I mean apparently after one interface to
the Internet and 12 the

460
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:00,510
monitoring network right here

461
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:04,080
is the internet IP address but still

462
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,980
how can I use to information to trigger
a box in the back at

463
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:14,980
bicep object to the

464
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:22,520
change are they to string and chicken k
agent which is just a shell script

465
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,590
and um because I need the

466
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:34,299
the IP address of the insulin interface
because of what I'm doing is actually

467
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:38,049
intriguing object during a show called
executed

468
00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:41,250
on check and K taking the back
connection

469
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:45,020
up using this system as a proxy

470
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:48,529
and boxing the south to the Internet so
I need to know this internal IP address

471
00:30:48,529 --> 00:30:55,529
up that make sense

472
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:07,990
so when I start the exploit a it spits
out the information

473
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:11,769
I have to enter all how I have to modify
the

474
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:18,769
chicken k agent and that's what I'm
doing right now just replace the string

475
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:27,100
and that's that's just across a
scripting triggering here and also

476
00:31:29,149 --> 00:31:32,880
at the so what's what's but this task is

477
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,659
is waiting for a certain connection
string so the Tek Inc a ajuns as

478
00:31:37,659 --> 00:31:40,340
runnings win for certain connection
string if that shows up

479
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:43,950
it will proxy the connection out to the
Internet if it doesn't show up within

480
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:47,669
about .5 seconds just built the usual

481
00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:50,960
are taken care information so the
administrator will never

482
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,019
actually see any any change and socials
of ass a functional system

483
00:31:55,019 --> 00:32:02,019
as although but we have sharp as witty
alright

484
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:08,620
I'll so again it's taken a while till
this updates

485
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:15,059
are we can force it it in a tunnel

486
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:19,010
certainly up early this does the timeout

487
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:25,409
this happens because

488
00:32:25,409 --> 00:32:28,419
up that's because in

489
00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:33,490
and I'll and meanwhile up taken kate
tries to update the dust bowl

490
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:36,649
and I have to change change all the
usernames passwords

491
00:32:36,649 --> 00:32:43,649
be complicated but is how it works

492
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:56,759
nicholson articles

493
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:04,930
room

494
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:12,730
harder

495
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,720
documents meeting

496
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,529
alright both on yep that's what we're
lookin'

497
00:33:27,529 --> 00:33:34,529
it work on Tuesday

498
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:44,900
arm it doesn't work now so I think my
ideas some

499
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,530
idea would be skip that one

500
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:52,030
and put it at the end because RSX a more
interesting coming up now

501
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,160
arm I get to this bit later

502
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,790
that part of a lifetime

503
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:04,570
yep well um kinda running out of time
song

504
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:08,350
trying to get that one so the pro if it
works is

505
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:11,540
ago we have shell arm with missus show

506
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,950
a I don't need to know the URL as it is
in browser

507
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:18,480
arm I can use an existing connection

508
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,000
point out on connexion a fan of conch
shell is only get

509
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,719
getting at when the equinox and partly
because that's when the agent strings

510
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:29,700
in this play right now the the conscious

511
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:33,800
weenie excess on it monitored system um
you don't always have to

512
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,960
so

513
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,330
what if what if

514
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,760
on owning the system as I did before is
not an option

515
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,659
arm because some of them harm is
actually doing later

516
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:53,490
we will harden the target system are 134
56

517
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:58,270
is not a good pass what use is HK swipe
arm

518
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:02,120
but is a fun thing we can all the system
without on the URL

519
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,710
the own anything with just one SSH

520
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:09,540
attempt even if up public eres

521
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,960
is complete and why's that was a
cross-site scripting and the username

522
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,740
of the essay connection and now Marie
Claire Carey Price what I've mentioned

523
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,360
earlier

524
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,920
this attack trigger this across that
scripting the triggers across what

525
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,160
risk rest for three triggers an upload
the trick is a shell

526
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,170
so it's actually months due to multiple

527
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:31,610
armpits chain fixed exploits more or
less on

528
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:35,760
but I want endemic really attacked
Yetman and I never attack

529
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,470
the target system I attack the
functionality of an app on

530
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,380
using monitoring system I am

531
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,030
when it got watch for that what lock
which is actually just 11 more plucking

532
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:50,100
that why functionality that watches a
lot of fights

533
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,029
and is actually something you do on a
daily basis when you do monitoring right

534
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:56,010
and the default installation where the
again

535
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:59,750
I've install this I did not change a
single line

536
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:05,490
and a couple configuration as the
default installation from

537
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:08,420
as I mentioned earlier the cross of
scripting gets triggered by specially

538
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:08,890
crafted

539
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:12,180
SSH connection string which contains
dollars grip

540
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,540
and the old fart all hackers in here
might remember

541
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,180
a similar bach and up but we'll sort
disclose

542
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:24,210
I'll more than ten years ago by HD Moore
what if you actually that was

543
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:27,370
if I know about the escape arm

544
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:30,700
a welcoming

545
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:36,230
a separate asia's I'm so any finals
actually

546
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:39,570
if the if you want to lock or something
any year a

547
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:42,850
to manipulation and it has certain IOC

548
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:46,330
characters in their you may be able to
execute code

549
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:50,730
um and it's interesting article as kitty
its assault on you so

550
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:54,040
buttonhole article you can just replace

551
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,410
Alterman image terminal emulator with
browser because

552
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:00,500
this is what we use nowadays we don't
use tunnel to use pals

553
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:04,450
and the same box which are 10 years old
after that

554
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:09,080
so

555
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:14,290
how does that work arm

556
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:17,380
I think what I'm doing right now is I'm
restoring the system's

557
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:24,380
just make sure we'll start from scratch

558
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:42,150
up

559
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,930
and the next up is actually the
administrator being a good administrator

560
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:57,339
hardens the target system so what i did
earlier

561
00:37:57,339 --> 00:38:02,119
brute forcing 20 PCs in the white you do
that by

562
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:07,130
up by Commission permitting only our SH
publickey based authentication

563
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:11,890
it but went on to the target system I
get the

564
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:16,240
with white of course then like it

565
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:23,240
access to the SSH demand configuration

566
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:35,770
that look for them needed to further

567
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:42,430
I get to watch to unveil the possible is
ok indication is currently in a bit

568
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:49,430
I to to sever that of course

569
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:57,260
and we stop on time see message

570
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,630
phone ally protector well key try this
again

571
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:04,260
a try to login as root connection
refused

572
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:11,260
how I again

573
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:32,670
ok

574
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:36,980
what we started engine the top

575
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,980
up in North texan about ministration

576
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:45,020
apparently not

577
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:48,300
on Flickr yep

578
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:55,300
it worked with at the voting machine

579
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:11,380
again I get access to the motion machine
I'll

580
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:18,380
change the age human configuration

581
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:27,980
not only quoth Minnesota with

582
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:32,850
to do that

583
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:39,850
yeah

584
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:55,580
Klein come

585
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:09,189
and with talk that the man again

586
00:41:09,189 --> 00:41:13,359
yet so openly now I do not FXS because I
need a publicly right

587
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:17,319
on and that's a good thing from from
that point of view

588
00:41:17,319 --> 00:41:24,319
well what

589
00:41:25,259 --> 00:41:29,130
if we explode because it's getting so

590
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:32,259
what are you doing right now I'm
starting to exploit I don't need any

591
00:41:32,259 --> 00:41:32,880
information

592
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,150
not you l open IP address nothing it
spits out the information

593
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:40,249
I have to Aunt on my system that's
connecting

594
00:41:40,249 --> 00:41:47,249
to the target system with a string

595
00:41:47,289 --> 00:41:50,769
should long it looking as the admin I

596
00:41:50,769 --> 00:41:54,039
no local from the target system and

597
00:41:54,039 --> 00:42:01,039
thought if I for

598
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,240
right so

599
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:13,240
of crew nothing happened arm

600
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:18,710
and that was it not really exciting is
that

601
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:23,900
but I just have to wait because when I
just ate its

602
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,040
are I'm injecting cross-site scripting
on JavaScript code

603
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:31,030
on this website and I your all it does
is proving

604
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:34,150
exactly what I've seen before on a love
note

605
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:41,150
a snapshot lot loath payload and

606
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:55,200
there's much help cricket so what does
that mean

607
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:00,960
um but that was just an SSH connection
attempt

608
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,390
it's all the fault I didn't change
anything that's the default installation

609
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:10,860
a pro we don't sell

610
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:16,270
thanks for looking and this paper
approved home a tough sell

611
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:20,300
I mean this one shows up because I wanna
make it really obvious

612
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,930
well are I don't have to arm

613
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:27,170
I there's no need know the URL
beforehand

614
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:31,550
at all and a up it only triggers when
the unlock that

615
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:34,980
what and the calmness I will still win

616
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,860
outgoing connections on but you can use
DNS lies in peter north

617
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:42,930
I could use trick I talk before using
all the interim so will the proxy server

618
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:47,560
so he's is an evil one

619
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:51,900
what if I spit out the string up for the
interwebz

620
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,370
port 22 and set up a website

621
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:58,730
and waiting for those shells popping up

622
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:02,110
because that's all I have to do just
spit out the string

623
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:05,120
and arm it should be fixed by now

624
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:09,630
but not necessarily be patched on all
the systems out there well

625
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:13,830
and results profit partly and that was

626
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:20,830
them apart now back to the mediation

627
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:35,900
okay though after we have

628
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,910
total sloth bill overly connecting to
develop of

629
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:42,160
a that's quite interesting because

630
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:45,980
on a lot of the developer them doesn't
offer you a tenth to

631
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:50,140
such 'em give them the information

632
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:53,660
privately saw on a lot of them have only

633
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:57,130
a public meeting with available on there
you can trigger but as I think it's not

634
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:58,069
a good case to

635
00:44:58,069 --> 00:45:02,650
such long printout thought the problems
on me on a public meeting with

636
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:07,280
all with the phone of course a lot of
women about this in the DNS registries

637
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,220
on demonstrations and presentation on
any confluent the thought we are able to

638
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:12,500
get

639
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:17,740
in contact with the the developer and
death just want to loosen it

640
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:21,170
thing up they're the only ones cellphone
they are privately

641
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:25,099
to given only content and private
information with to the developer

642
00:45:25,099 --> 00:45:29,790
a.m. the time and also an interesting
party to the case

643
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:34,339
I think one of the solution meets us
about six days to fix all the problems

644
00:45:34,339 --> 00:45:40,170
and to listen was a new release another
solution needs up to 85 days

645
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:43,349
to fix it and want to know

646
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:47,030
unfortunately they are want and what
with losing them that doesn't provide

647
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:47,960
any update

648
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:51,520
to know a what people do of other

649
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,740
plan to appeal to both and leave a
published author information

650
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:57,740
in about the cloth

651
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:01,780
written a paper

652
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:06,400
on it what some people we got we talk
about software we all use in on at once

653
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:06,720
right

654
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,559
arm the census of somehow I guess

655
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:13,869
so what's the feedback from developers
well

656
00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:19,210
also present what oh well St for the
poor team didn't even know they exist

657
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:22,280
that other something like security got
line that's cool I've never seen that

658
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,950
they sell this so they sell our
consultancy

659
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:29,799
on and support a contracts that's
important

660
00:46:29,799 --> 00:46:33,450
arm what the eye and watch fault is a
feature

661
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:36,990
yes in is also back to us you can see
but they call it the future

662
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:41,170
um my favorite what to think use for
scanning

663
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:44,760
we did not scan its open sauce

664
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,900
we that have a look into the soft-core
and we fall

665
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:51,240
box we did not use any any scandals of
fancy

666
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,470
proxy scandals up what r whatever um

667
00:46:55,470 --> 00:47:00,020
why and that's that's really terrible
why should we fix what you see is a

668
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:00,940
security problem

669
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:04,380
we never asked for this or that yes
exactly

670
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:08,230
that was my reply what the hell so on

671
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:11,660
that's kinda right but we I mean its own
salsa can

672
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:15,890
of my source code as much as I like and
I kind report box and I do it in the

673
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:16,250
future

674
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:19,960
well why not and also we have no
response at all

675
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,339
so some of them didn't reply at all
apparently were not interested or didn't

676
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:24,619
see it as a security problem

677
00:47:24,619 --> 00:47:28,170
are we won't name any any companies

678
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:32,030
because we know what about us too hard
on them but yeah that's what happens

679
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:35,910
unfortunately the and

680
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:39,549
and it worth you can't fight no no
information about

681
00:47:39,549 --> 00:47:43,859
any security flaws they have no 10 truth
is that we got it all to have no

682
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:47,970
information on the type that will sort
the indictment doesn't look like

683
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:51,089
for new function he over the wall
saltwater both

684
00:47:51,089 --> 00:47:54,630
the version of the so system on

685
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:58,290
also credits what that

686
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:02,440
you find any flaws we find any long too
cute issues with under oath

687
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,500
and solutions a 100 alt on way

688
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:09,190
you want the consent of course the that

689
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:13,680
only one to over the professional going
with this if lucien

690
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,829
froth thing the team the

691
00:48:16,829 --> 00:48:20,980
think that really early age we all
really fix

692
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:24,809
really quickly they have I'm into the
fixes to the back

693
00:48:24,809 --> 00:48:27,910
backport follow versions and they have

694
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:31,410
the morning TV numbers into the old make
a public

695
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:34,530
thought that the only solution going

696
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:37,540
the globe in a professional way with us
trough

697
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:41,510
on

698
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:45,760
to make a broken that's not the only way
I think the

699
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:49,359
try to fix it makes a make the world a
safer place and length

700
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:54,280
a lot of time on one must consider the
the guidelines

701
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,569
their phone in full solution cell for
not getting thing ever

702
00:48:57,569 --> 00:49:01,130
available the they are for example also

703
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:04,420
pointing not think that with you word on
tix them

704
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:07,950
taken to a politician and so on a of
coffee

705
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:12,339
general basics you already know password
don't use it for possible to have shown

706
00:49:12,339 --> 00:49:14,349
that in weakened due process remotely

707
00:49:14,349 --> 00:49:18,450
the hot access to the system me know
open the application

708
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:21,569
a hardening of course and also on

709
00:49:21,569 --> 00:49:24,680
if it doesn't need such future like that
Vettel

710
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:31,680
on stickam car removed 27 at I'll

711
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:35,549
also and at what level you can will not
pool

712
00:49:35,549 --> 00:49:39,810
mitigate such worth long put your

713
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:43,510
systems not threaten the proper network
youthful level testing of high-level

714
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:44,839
before the system

715
00:49:44,839 --> 00:49:48,280
to ticket on

716
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:52,200
also considered as a great

717
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:56,319
function based monitoring system for
that not your fault and assistant to get

718
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:57,250
access to all of

719
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:00,310
gonna talk in a month and they are

720
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:03,140
unfortunately no internet for the
monitoring system and for the

721
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:04,910
administrative officials were

722
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:09,020
that means that don't know the innocent
no unless you P

723
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:12,720
and also on the application Americans a
good bit of course

724
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,950
the sloth consider that for the white so
place

725
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:22,319
him another the three of them not can be
done

726
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:26,310
and another problem we have is also the

727
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:30,900
agent their youth to get information
from the system unit of course people

728
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,160
the truth

729
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,440
a the

730
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,650
yes as a result the scope but they also
feel so and

731
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:41,910
another discussion projected old and

732
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:45,780
one of the the North and consider to

733
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:49,540
makeup xxx over SSH daemon you must be
configured

734
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:52,549
carefully because and a new on the way
to get to know each other

735
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:55,650
from the political get to the hotel to
help

736
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:59,240
systems and

737
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:03,079
one solution we also have from identify
it as

738
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:06,200
a James communication of change the
communication

739
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,220
of between the sent resistance and

740
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:13,109
agent that means on

741
00:51:13,109 --> 00:51:17,299
that minute anyone compromise isn't a
monitoring system he is not able to get

742
00:51:17,299 --> 00:51:18,270
access to ALL

743
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:22,589
connecting undertook elements of us and
for all this in such a competitive edge

744
00:51:22,589 --> 00:51:22,880
in

745
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,210
or solution you can't move without
thought anything

746
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:29,660
to the configuration the it looks quite

747
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:34,450
course will quite busy by the contagion

748
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:37,849
not remotely over is if you look at

749
00:51:37,849 --> 00:51:41,810
take it in locally on your system put
the open for fire

750
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:44,960
until file secure solution like this

751
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:50,430
SEP SFTP to us and went on to them
interested in monitoring system

752
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:53,810
the tech information and get a while
since make them

753
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:57,450
make put it at that monitoring and

754
00:51:57,450 --> 00:52:01,369
this case you see unit look Architektur
looks much better

755
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:04,650
like the other wondered if you consider
also heartening part

756
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:10,060
the might be a more secure monitoring
solution before

757
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:14,299
conclusion on take a vote to use a new
network

758
00:52:14,299 --> 00:52:18,329
take about where you get the fossil for
the sake of course on

759
00:52:18,329 --> 00:52:21,470
when you use on fourth of the doesn't
mean the secure

760
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:24,520
earth of course the

761
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,740
into open talking or more little of a
few other

762
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:30,880
most %uh solutions isolate up in the
switch OES

763
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,930
bring taken off the internet

764
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:37,240
of course and pulled over develop of

765
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,309
yep takeover of stuff

766
00:52:40,309 --> 00:52:43,420
okay thank you clip
