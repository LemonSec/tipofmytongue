1
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,360
you know welcome to my talk the title of
this talk is

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,990
psychology of security the subtotal
security is human behavior and

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:12,930
experience

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,340
first I would like to introduce myself a
little bit so you can see

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:21,750
sorry human factors

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,040
should work no

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,450
great perfect a so first

8
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:32,289
as already stated on the president of
the MacBook Institute of security

9
00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:33,010
research

10
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,140
we r a private organization we are not
affiliated with the University of

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,379
MacBook officially

12
00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:42,069
butts too much bureaucracy to get this
done so we decided to make a lil

13
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:45,449
our own thing um on also the

14
00:00:45,449 --> 00:00:49,249
editor of the mcdougal goes on on
solutions for some we do have

15
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:52,260
an online access an open-access online
journal

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,569
in our institute which is online for
offense or three years ago

17
00:00:56,569 --> 00:01:00,159
most of the articles hosted are in
German but now

18
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:03,479
we are currently producing the
proceedings for the deep sec conference

19
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:04,239
in Vienna

20
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,070
so we're getting a lot of
english-language articles i'm for

21
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,500
example we already have online

22
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,930
the English language article for not
intrude on our people six and snort

23
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,450
and the next article coming up a spot
through we want more about taking

24
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,950
medical devices which gave a
presentation also area

25
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,600
I'm on the freemen security consultant
America

26
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,900
I've been involved in the NetBSD project
for some time

27
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,500
by studied educational science and
psychology

28
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,550
with a focus on Industrial and
Organizational Psychology and Social

29
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,860
Psychology because I'm

30
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,730
interests that in social engineering do
it as a tester

31
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:43,000
as a pen tester user but I'm also
interested in doing the research behind

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,670
social engineering and this is done on
psychology because it's about you

33
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:51,080
behavior I'm also interested in security
awareness

34
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,450
and as a psychologist I see that
awareness is only the first stop

35
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,450
awareness is great and you need
awareness to get things done

36
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,120
or 22 keep things in mind but you also
have to be

37
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:07,130
able to response to security task that
means you have to train your

38
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,080
organizational members your workforce

39
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,370
you the people on Wall the training part
still looking we don't have

40
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,819
a times or certificate program how to
train people

41
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:21,030
the for security proposals so the

42
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,410
talk here is about a research program
that recently started

43
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,569
on the talks broken down into six parts

44
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:31,590
the intro why the storm them from the
mental research approach because I

45
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,550
assume most

46
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,880
he people here don't have a background
in scientific psychology or humanities

47
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,940
there for a graphical short rundown on
how research

48
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,750
works this feels than from the main
topic is organizational development and

49
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,660
security

50
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,430
the fourth part is cultural differences
because if you want security worldwide

51
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,880
we have to keep security

52
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,560
the cultural differences in mind and my
favorite part of the research programs

53
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,220
deduct

54
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,440
security how to teach security the
relevant part if you want to train

55
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,569
to work force and in the end I'm short

56
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:08,300
topic is the mall knowledge base we need

57
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:13,000
to know so introducing the introduction
what this is all about

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,750
I'm psychology is an empirical and few
hours ago signs

59
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:22,480
for we describe explain and predict
human behavior and experience

60
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,200
this is what psychology das this is a
German definition of cycle

61
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,560
the English language definition the
American definition is a bit different

62
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,420
but this is the definition we use here

63
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:36,020
in Germany and since we invented so I
called you it's okay to use it also

64
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:42,870
internationally what for psychological
research institute was like 60 its

65
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,040
pretty treatment um human development

66
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,270
a.m. NP internal human development and
the internal and external causes and

67
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:56,099
conditions whole to research this is
mostly done by developmental psychology

68
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:59,940
which is also the father of pedagogical
cycle

69
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,310
whenever someone studies to become a
teacher in germany has to take losses on

70
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,370
educational

71
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,400
and on the political psychology and
developmental psychology and

72
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,840
we also got a lot of research all of
knowledge about how to train people from

73
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,310
these

74
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:19,209
research so even this fundamental basic
research is required for

75
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:23,020
this topic of IT security other parts of

76
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,690
cycle genes that are involved or
differential and personality psychology

77
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:31,260
personality traits arm I gave a talk on
the deep into lost your own

78
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,570
psychological profiling for social
engineering that's one point where you

79
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:35,190
can use

80
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,240
knowledgeable personality so called
because no

81
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,660
the personality traits of a person you
can attack them better

82
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,300
and more effective a.m. social
psychology which is

83
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,650
actually social engineering but also
Industrial and Organizational Psychology

84
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,360
these the parts a psychologist actually
do work

85
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,810
for example for organizations and
training people in them do

86
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:01,040
creating assessment centres creating
training courses in South

87
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,320
and this is all the part we use from
psychology for this research program

88
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,120
so the next point is the since I'm have
a background in education science and

89
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,280
the humanities

90
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,050
on know that we have to time or
explicate

91
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:21,260
the concept to use and are you broke my
bachelor thesis about how to measure

92
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,510
security Road eighty pages about

93
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:28,639
the differences of the technical
approach on 21 in 20 security

94
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,150
and the psychological approach my
definition of security

95
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,320
this one hears here security is a letter
and

96
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,740
social construct and has to be treated
as such

97
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,580
psychological and sociological methods
and tools are required

98
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,790
if the security of a system should be
enhanced a diagnosis prognosis

99
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:51,490
an intervention is required and doing
diagnosis prognosis and

100
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,630
and intervention at the very core
psychology

101
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,650
this is what's the code is all about we
diagnose

102
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,880
things we do prognosis and beans we want
to intervene

103
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,490
but psychology therefore I think
psychology has a lot to say about

104
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:08,240
security I'm security is

105
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,270
for my point of view a psychologist made

106
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,590
by was concluded by making decisions

107
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,669
decisions only make individuals a.m.

108
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,790
individuals make decisions based on the
biography

109
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,940
the situation and how they perceive
environment

110
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,220
we always have to Street Journal in
Organizational Psychology we have the

111
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,650
individual person

112
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,889
we have the organization and we have to
situation

113
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:35,699
and all these three factors influence
each other each other

114
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:39,290
interdependent Lee so every sector has
influence on the other

115
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:42,720
sector and by so so you cannot

116
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,220
the use very simple approach and say
that up

117
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,600
characters of people personal
personality traits

118
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,100
which make persons better suited for
security months environments or not

119
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,090
it's not only the person but is also the
organization and every situation you're

120
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,210
in

121
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,310
so um this is our

122
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,180
all my approach if you want to read
something about this has been discussed

123
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,500
in German

124
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,430
by Nicholas money into a pickle to
prophesy social science

125
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,620
behind some toast or in Vienna born

126
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,699
he studied physics but also the

127
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:22,740
he moved to the US in 1946 and 1947 and
was involved a lot with the

128
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,009
some political movement with Macy
conferences

129
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:30,000
any published a lot of papers on
cybernetics and society

130
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
because the the roots of social
engineering the original meaning of

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,560
social engineering was how can we design

132
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,710
societies with philosophical
psychological methods

133
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,610
this completely fails if you want to
read about it read 1984

134
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,080
some young teen I am so he was a critics
of this

135
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,190
technological approach and they
discussed for those interested in

136
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,569
mathematics

137
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:55,710
John Spencer Browns the loss of form

138
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:00,180
are a great book and these are used for
the social system theory of Nicholas

139
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:00,880
moment

140
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,780
so the social system theory because my
Creator

141
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,229
no spec appointed its roots in the
mathematical

142
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:12,410
tucker's map mathematical Deauxma

143
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,970
I am so I called you use of course the
signs which researchers these topics

144
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:20,680
the whole cycle with is required to
restore security that's one reason why

145
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,300
we need psychology

146
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,500
I'm I also would like to say you
emphasize that

147
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,960
psychology the only signs able to
research the basic fundamentals of

148
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,419
security

149
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:36,010
computer science electrical engineering
also do a lot of recent on security

150
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:36,719
topics

151
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,200
but they are not able to researchers the
basic fundamentals of security because

152
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,020
the basic fundamental security

153
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:47,910
is human behavior and as I already
stated human behaviors only

154
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,470
research in psychology social science
occasions such

155
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,790
but this is a basic fundamental every
thing every computer program

156
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,860
am every every back every security
features made by

157
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,170
man and man make decisions and

158
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:07,089
and therefore we need psychology to do
research on this topic

159
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:10,149
I have some examples of this I'm

160
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:13,450
against the stalker for the first time
in the and other for two suit

161
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,500
example about washing the hands

162
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,060
some of you might know the name it not
some injuries he wants physician he

163
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,870
studied in

164
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:25,220
test the past and then move to be an and
he realized

165
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,600
that more pregnant women don't

166
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,730
the Vienna General Hospital than in a
monastery operated by nuns

167
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,890
and he said that's thats that cannot be
the situation that

168
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:42,020
the trained physicist physicians have
more have higher fatality rate

169
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,050
than nuns never studied medicine

170
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,870
and he did some research about this in
the nineteen century

171
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,279
and he discovered all he assault

172
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:56,310
that physicians transmit picnic
pathogenic agents

173
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:01,450
and he proposed that physicians should
wash their hands

174
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,690
it's totally normal today to see a
physician was a tent but

175
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:08,700
at the time of the not some advice his
idea was rejected

176
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,410
and he was considered to be crazy he was
sent into psychiatry

177
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,600
on his fellow physicians for proposing
that food

178
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,000
physicians should wash their hands

179
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,200
this behavior all the whole situation
can only be researched

180
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,490
and explain possibility we even have a
name for it because every vice effect

181
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:31,899
whenever you propose something you
people trying to reject it because it

182
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:32,670
means

183
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,760
by have to invest on a lot of
psychological work

184
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,540
into creating a new view they have to be
able to for example

185
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,560
a.m. at the time and then we both

186
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,600
the pass again Asians were not known
there was not much knowledgeable and

187
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,640
bacteria and viruses and such

188
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,070
therefore people did new how these
pathogenic agents worked

189
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:56,330
it was only thirty forty years later
this what coke and we passed through

190
00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:00,269
that people got to you about the pass
again agents

191
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:04,100
their forum the move was completely a.m.

192
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,860
field with this proposal that physicians
should wash their hands

193
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,830
another example more or less from IT
security

194
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:15,630
this nice for you arianna 5 flight 541

195
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:19,200
some of you might remember 1996 the
first flight

196
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,740
a.m. arianna 5 ended after 37 seconds
with

197
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,399
300 for billion for

198
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,540
euro firework because the walls

199
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,980
some problems with the software
development

200
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,070
I'm one of the problems with around five
what

201
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:41,820
that the year software for the control
mechanisms was taken from ionophore

202
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,779
and there was a typecast a row

203
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:49,040
but the usually when you use many
program

204
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,529
44 space flights or for the

205
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:55,850
eflite industry the most programs are
done in other

206
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:00,279
compared with a programming language and
they have a lot of security checks

207
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:04,700
this it's not your average CC C compiler
but it's a special compiler

208
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:09,800
which emphasizes security and of course
it also done simulations of the flight

209
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,950
but they never realized that the only
other for developers disabled several

210
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,010
safety checks and security checks

211
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:19,180
because a.m. a uniform never reached

212
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,890
the speed arianna hype and therefore
there were no problems with typecasting

213
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:28,510
unfortunately I'm gonna fly for tomorrow
was much faster the bigger acceleration

214
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:32,709
and run into problems with podcast the
number so that means a greater

215
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:36,079
and on this is what happened at the
first flight

216
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,019
there was a typecast mistake the
computer sort the rocket is currently

217
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:40,740
going down

218
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:45,839
therefore I'm the self-destruction
button was hit on the computer destroyed

219
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,660
the arianna including all the satellites
aboard

220
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,670
and the research was done this report
available by the ESA European Space

221
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,339
Agency about this incident in the
problem was

222
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:00,740
but the safety measurement of the safety
sex disabled by the arena for developers

223
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,670
but they were fully documented there's a
project Manuel then it was written down

224
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,529
the perfect

225
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:09,320
project Mon all that they have been
disabled because these problem we'll

226
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,240
never applied

227
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,440
ionophore and the around 25 developers
ret

228
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,720
that project Manuel but they never
talked to safety expect on

229
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,760
this is something we usually discuss an
organizational psychology knowledge

230
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,890
management

231
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:28,600
why do people they the rat what was
described and explained what they should

232
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,620
do but they didn't do it

233
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,760
this issue namely the problem you also
have when you try to to implement

234
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,110
standard some eyes on

235
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:39,980
9001: stuff or something like that we
have standards so people should be

236
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,570
and most of these standards don't go
down on the psychological level

237
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,950
of people knowing rules but ignoring
them

238
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:50,440
my favorite example for this is there
are so many physicians and Germany

239
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,560
medics who smoke

240
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,970
that's actually it doesn't work the
opposition's but they smoke they

241
00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:00,000
should know that smoking expect you but
they do smoke a lot

242
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,279
and this has to do with a lot of
psychological factors

243
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:08,010
other examples weak passwords the
discussions about weak passwords at

244
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,529
least 25 years old it's not even older

245
00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:15,279
but still we have users who use weak
passwords with currently program

246
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,519
in my hometown a movie try to train
teachers from schools and

247
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,870
teenagers in school into most of them
don't even understand why they should

248
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,060
use a password

249
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:28,200
so we have to explain the body uses use
a management passwords and such

250
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,690
and they have no idea how the system
that the computer the technology works

251
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,519
and therefore

252
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,459
they don't understand why this why they
should use a password

253
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:40,660
I'm users are not interested in security
that's a typical problem most users

254
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,709
are just interested in using their
computer or doing the work

255
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:47,670
when doing security awareness campaigns
among the system administrators a

256
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,680
security guard usually perceived us

257
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,519
the best price before me to do is a
terrible stuff like entering a password

258
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,550
or looking my my desk or something like
that they don't

259
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:01,750
understand why security is relevant and
the other not interested in

260
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,680
users don't understand security but we
still have problems programmers create

261
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,269
before overflows and forget safety
regulations

262
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:12,690
around five won this one example but the
buffer overflow is well documented well

263
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,560
known and can be easily be prevented by
the program

264
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,560
but still we have programs with
proposals

265
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,700
my favorite example is the OpenBSD PF
with the remote

266
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:26,500
executed before overflow which gave the
attack the root

267
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,899
so I see you manana a computer operating
system that focuses on

268
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:34,120
printing t-shirts and doing security is

269
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,190
doing such mistakes I'm administrators
forget

270
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:41,339
to patch don't perhaps operating systems

271
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:45,699
members also has to do with that happens
are usually not formally trained

272
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:49,620
is informal scientific base a
science-based training for system

273
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,610
administration

274
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:55,480
at least not here in Germany um you can
study computer science but computer

275
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,820
science usually is different approach
than

276
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:02,029
only system administration among other
problems of course that

277
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:06,320
for system administrators of are ignored
by the management level the don't get

278
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,800
they don't it will find that they have
not enough work force they are ignored

279
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,470
the has to change developers

280
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:18,079
developers use md5 has a password hash
think of two years ago when

281
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,350
her I was in

282
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:25,769
when city committees securing

283
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:29,240
you got them

284
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:34,290
the search had all CIA from the US got
hacked two years ago

285
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:38,329
known as big over the other ones we're
all their former CIA agents work and

286
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:38,880
they do

287
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,970
security reports on straight for

288
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:45,810
just right for back a.m. the strut for
use the database will stall

289
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:49,420
and every password with only has to 95
separate

290
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,760
only take some hours to get I use my old

291
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:57,510
for for your MacBook in the first 30
percent volumes a counselor

292
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:02,940
cracked in 20 or so this can be easily
prevented by using a different password

293
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,610
method

294
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:08,029
even you by such simple method as
methods as using assault

295
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:12,759
but developers don't use it I'm social
engineering is a completely different

296
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:13,459
topic

297
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:16,819
my approach is that social engineering

298
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:21,499
a can never be present social
engineering aims at manipulating people

299
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:26,419
and whenever you introduce a new
security a new technical security beria

300
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:30,299
your trading and you approach for me as
a social engineer to protect your

301
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,830
organization

302
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:35,460
so the typical approach in the IT
security processes we need more

303
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,729
computers we need more technology we
need

304
00:17:37,729 --> 00:17:40,850
more programs that morning to all the
people

305
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:45,749
and the the the people behave in a bad
way we should get in a row does

306
00:17:45,749 --> 00:17:48,749
shot on something or something like that
computers on

307
00:17:48,749 --> 00:17:52,090
able to monitor human behavior only
humans are making decisions

308
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:56,679
and my approach is that you have to
train your humans who work force

309
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:00,889
to create security you cannot get
security especially missiles lansner in

310
00:18:00,889 --> 00:18:02,929
contact with technical measures

311
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:06,299
because all technical approaches have to
be touring computable

312
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:13,029
you for your Turing machines sitting to
russians can't make decisions

313
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:16,679
so we started this research program

314
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:20,049
I'm the first idea for is with the
Vienna program for cyber peace I give a

315
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:20,609
talk

316
00:18:20,609 --> 00:18:23,859
to three years ago at the deep sack
Indiana

317
00:18:23,859 --> 00:18:28,399
when all this talk about cyber war grew
up in the media center

318
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:32,220
let's stop this discussion so I was not
possible at least use

319
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:36,960
them because its definition of or let's
talk about creating security let's talk

320
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,869
about five apiece

321
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:41,509
so I wrote a program with some steps
that have to be

322
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:46,509
taken and some psychology of security is
one from the mental part

323
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:49,619
there is a lot of research looking arria
the

324
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:54,419
I'll a.m. areas where psychology plays
an important role for example

325
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:58,759
there is engineering psychology which
plays a vital role in

326
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:02,220
in space for its of life industry

327
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:07,210
also the people who operate nuclear
power plants are usually

328
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:10,629
trained in their psychological human
factors

329
00:19:10,629 --> 00:19:15,029
stuff so are examples we can use ass a
rumor mill for this what we are doing

330
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:15,739
here

331
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:19,090
and we started with the program the
first

332
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:22,489
research faces three years estimated and
we started

333
00:19:22,489 --> 00:19:26,440
just two months ago with this research

334
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,789
so what we need in this research program
we need fundamental research about the

335
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:32,309
perception of security

336
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:36,159
how do people perceive security why on
uses ignoring security

337
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:40,289
why are people like us so interests a
focus on security what makes us happy

338
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:42,859
and researching and making and breaking
stuff

339
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:46,070
what do most people ignore security how
can this be changed

340
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:49,229
we need a fundamental the tactics this

341
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:52,909
has to be funded by this fundamental
research this is really a low-level

342
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:53,749
research

343
00:19:53,749 --> 00:19:57,389
approach from psychology but it has to
be done without this we don't know how

344
00:19:57,389 --> 00:19:59,129
people perceive security

345
00:19:59,129 --> 00:20:03,119
and if you don't know this week on to
any for the work

346
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,429
and we need some research not
personality attitudes and security

347
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:13,369
other personality traits that correlate
with security where behavior

348
00:20:13,369 --> 00:20:17,679
for example there is the Big Five it's
the standard model using personal it is

349
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:18,539
a call these

350
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:21,769
5 factors for the

351
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:25,090
a whole personality can be described in
one them

352
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:29,450
factories openness openness to new
things I assume that most hikers have a

353
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,340
very high level

354
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:34,259
ok nice among other people not in one
could for

355
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:38,379
make people see you this that openness
of a as a personality trait correlates

356
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:40,960
with security relevant behavior

357
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,639
but this sympathies this has to be the
made empirically songs we have to do

358
00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:46,789
empirical research

359
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:49,950
we have to give up question yes we have
to a.m.

360
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:53,549
measure I'll try to measure security we
have to measure personality traits of

361
00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:55,249
persons and try to correlate these

362
00:20:55,249 --> 00:20:58,729
see if there is any influence this is
basically

363
00:20:58,729 --> 00:21:02,470
I'm what is done for example in
assessments and so whenever

364
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,470
the human rule resources department is
trying to hire new people

365
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,999
they do this the youth this matters

366
00:21:09,999 --> 00:21:14,749
a mess it's at the basis for deciding
who fits into this organization who does

367
00:21:14,749 --> 00:21:15,269
not

368
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:18,830
in this organization and the might be
a.m. this might be a good

369
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:24,059
base we can use for the further
development of organizations

370
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:28,340
'em another part organizational
development knowledge management

371
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,399
these are all parts that are relevant
because organizations have to evolve

372
00:21:32,399 --> 00:21:33,769
have to change

373
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:38,299
and there are several theoretical
approaches and how organizations should

374
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:38,849
work

375
00:21:38,849 --> 00:21:42,090
whole organizations are able to survive
and changing markets the

376
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:45,599
economists management also very
interested in those topics because

377
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:49,849
if you're organization can change to
survive in an evolving world

378
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:53,869
think of the a common fact Rosa
loathsome died in the last twenty thirty

379
00:21:53,869 --> 00:21:54,580
years

380
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:59,090
and for example to your time folks warm
have completely different approaches

381
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:03,679
holder organization is organized but yet
they are both

382
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,849
the most successful common fractures
wellpoint

383
00:22:07,849 --> 00:22:11,210
I'm another porn cultural differences of
course

384
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:14,369
the hot definitely cultural differences
regarding I'm

385
00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:17,580
IT security my favorite example for this
is

386
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,749
them the deaths by 10 which is
apparently

387
00:22:20,749 --> 00:22:24,899
prevalent in the cost to you in the
nineteen fifties

388
00:22:24,899 --> 00:22:30,039
the the South Korean government um
created several posters which stated

389
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:32,919
that if you leave your fam on during
nights you will get

390
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:36,039
cold and then you will die and this was
actually done

391
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:39,330
to keep the or get the persons to
through

392
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:43,049
safe electrical energy because they had
a lot of problems because of the Korean

393
00:22:43,049 --> 00:22:43,979
War in such

394
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:47,830
and this the proper gonna

395
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:51,129
firm was widespread and people in South
Korea know of

396
00:22:51,129 --> 00:22:54,389
do believe that if you leave your pen on
during nineteen will die because

397
00:22:54,389 --> 00:22:57,979
the call and this only works in Korea
because they have this

398
00:22:57,979 --> 00:23:01,169
hate this program the nineteen fifties
and they also other

399
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:06,429
other stuff other a.m. differences from
coming from different cultures

400
00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:11,229
I'm my favorite on my most interesting
part of the pot I'm most interested in

401
00:23:11,229 --> 00:23:14,909
is deducted X is about the teaching
methodology of security

402
00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:18,619
how can we teach security for different
people can be reach them

403
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:23,419
hosted teachers trying to tease all that
security stuff

404
00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:26,710
and of course the last part what to
teach the fact we need to teach does

405
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:29,960
every user end-user have to know about
in the pickups

406
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,029
however is all work so is it sufficient
if he knows which

407
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:36,820
options he has to pass to be in PG to
create a

408
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,039
a secure key and always pass by Chip
does

409
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:43,989
does the use or need to know more

410
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:48,049
so no going to the part a fundamental
research

411
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:51,989
I'm what do what we do in these
subtopics

412
00:23:51,989 --> 00:23:55,159
I'm the perception of security locker
already mentioned

413
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:58,440
we take the radical constructivist
approach

414
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,950
which was pretty common Germany the
whole German school systems based on

415
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:03,690
this

416
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:08,009
construe the stick approach them on the
scoop school systems

417
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:11,149
there are other school systems which are
still

418
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:14,789
rooted for example imperialistic
approaches where people get rained like

419
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:17,249
public trained his docs

420
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:21,080
firm the the basic of constructivism

421
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,519
is that each individual percy the world

422
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:28,719
in one's own way and the way how people
perceive the world

423
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:31,969
it's shaped by their former experiences

424
00:24:31,969 --> 00:24:35,139
so even if 100 people sitting even 100
hackers

425
00:24:35,139 --> 00:24:38,619
who studied computer science in Germany
a sitting here in my talk

426
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:43,590
every one of them a.m. perceived might
walk in a different way

427
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:47,119
every person has its own will to you

428
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:50,590
and we have to explore

429
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:54,200
this will too in depth this is usually
the first step in doing new

430
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,289
basic psychological research we going to
do a lot of qualitative research doing

431
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:02,489
interviews with people psychological
interviews with media interviews

432
00:25:02,489 --> 00:25:04,269
psychological interviews

433
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:07,710
them where we trying to explore why
people the mall security while they are

434
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,769
not interested in security but also

435
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:13,200
we want to interview on T security
personal hackers and such

436
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,889
why they are interested in what what
experience

437
00:25:16,889 --> 00:25:21,859
shape to will to you and this is the
longest taking part because it's a lot

438
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:23,489
of work doing qualitative research

439
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:26,929
it's also a lot of work and getting
getting people who want to be

440
00:25:26,929 --> 00:25:27,719
interviewed

441
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:30,909
because most people or actually we do
need to get

442
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:35,029
people who are not interested in IT
security in participating in a question

443
00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:37,619
and no interviews but those people who
are not interesting

444
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:41,619
we usually cannot reach so well there's
a huge problem in getting

445
00:25:41,619 --> 00:25:46,389
getting empirical sound done

446
00:25:46,389 --> 00:25:50,960
the next point we have different tools
and methods

447
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,989
for France for example qualitative
semi-structured interviews

448
00:25:54,989 --> 00:25:58,979
we use also the autobiographical
narrative interviews permits method

449
00:25:58,979 --> 00:25:59,649
developed

450
00:25:59,649 --> 00:26:03,219
by a professor MacBook where people just
talk about

451
00:26:03,219 --> 00:26:06,710
how the biographer is unusual for

452
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:10,529
how people do you the with new
experiences and the biography

453
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:14,460
hole they change their world view of
themselves hold the change to all the

454
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,529
creative you

455
00:26:15,529 --> 00:26:20,200
they have of themselves and this is
analyzed and this might help

456
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,249
in changing what shapes the haikus mind
and

457
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:26,649
mobile IT security the normal I T them

458
00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:30,539
users mind about mighty so we are
interested in

459
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:34,059
doing research with hackers researchers
um

460
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:38,529
the most all these the fundamental
question is what shapes I think its mind

461
00:26:38,529 --> 00:26:42,809
how do you use to see forty security how
Kansas perception be changed

462
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:47,889
perception can be changed the problem is
only in its resources muted needs time

463
00:26:47,889 --> 00:26:48,859
its money

464
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:52,840
and how can this be made in a better way

465
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,719
and then from the next part is all the
signs by security ones too

466
00:26:56,719 --> 00:27:00,899
so there are a lot of companies offering
security awareness campaigns on the

467
00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:01,499
design

468
00:27:01,499 --> 00:27:05,519
whens complaints but most think they do
or not science-based

469
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:10,049
just doing something sometimes it works
sometimes it does not work

470
00:27:10,049 --> 00:27:13,279
we will science-based well as tools
which means

471
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:17,509
we can predict at least in the range if
they working hard working within which

472
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:18,309
situation

473
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:21,690
so we want to make it signs not only
something

474
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:26,759
we try boy trial and error

475
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:30,049
I'm risk among the stars is my

476
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:33,809
paper topic from industrial psychology
it's about

477
00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:38,239
risk behavior and risk behavior is
controlled by different variables

478
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:42,479
personality traits organization
organizational traits

479
00:27:42,479 --> 00:27:45,969
I'm situation you were in and other
stuff and

480
00:27:45,969 --> 00:27:49,809
them risk will stop phenomenon that has
been research revell

481
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:53,559
a.m. it's about self-perceptions subject
skills

482
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:56,789
object schools perception of risk risk
acceptance such

483
00:27:56,789 --> 00:28:00,210
for example the up two different ways
waste obscure

484
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:03,570
all schools a.m. there's

485
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:07,889
there is a skill set which himself
perceive and sometimes you the sink they

486
00:28:07,889 --> 00:28:09,669
know something about security but

487
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:14,409
if you just measure it objectively you
realize they don't know anything about

488
00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:15,450
securities or

489
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:21,369
people sometimes a.m.

490
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:24,499
people sometimes um or sometimes people
think

491
00:28:24,499 --> 00:28:28,059
that they understood the topic but in
reality they didn't understand it

492
00:28:28,059 --> 00:28:31,309
how this applies to everyone and you
just have to find

493
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:34,509
the right topic well someone doesn't
know something about

494
00:28:34,509 --> 00:28:37,940
so this is the first problem we have for
example

495
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:41,070
this is addressed in industrial
psychology for example traffic

496
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,190
controllers and pilots

497
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:47,330
together thought a tough for a training
on these factors so they know that they

498
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:51,399
when the a run into this problem

499
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:54,759
the workers in nuclear power plants are
trying to motor vehicle operator

500
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:58,799
want to study in east germany in the
early nineteen nineties

501
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,169
I'm the typical taxi in east germany was
a border

502
00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:05,349
russian-built all Soviet Union built for
Carl

503
00:29:05,349 --> 00:29:09,219
which have no electronic support ride
was a typical it was at the technical

504
00:29:09,219 --> 00:29:12,129
standard of the 1940s 1950s

505
00:29:12,129 --> 00:29:15,989
a.m. in the early 1990s the taxi drivers
and restraints which

506
00:29:15,989 --> 00:29:19,799
over two months since been stuck sees
and the result was

507
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:23,960
not there where more accidents with
Mitzi dispensed talk sees them before

508
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,960
with the russian-built

509
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:31,570
all-star comes because the taxi drivers
were no

510
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:34,809
another problem of health perception and
risk assessment this author love

511
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:37,070
computer sematech see me know have

512
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:40,549
a ABEX an ESPN all the stuff in our
taxis

513
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:45,099
know I can do can accept more risk

514
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:49,229
there is no there is a lower perception
risk now and therefore

515
00:29:49,229 --> 00:29:53,309
they created more accidents because
place or the car will save their ass if

516
00:29:53,309 --> 00:29:54,159
they take

517
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,450
if the if the drive to pass or something
like that the result was

518
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:01,960
a that they have been more accidents
with them or more in common with the old

519
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,570
ones

520
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:06,849
this is Steve the most interesting study

521
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:09,979
uprooted study done about this topic

522
00:30:09,979 --> 00:30:13,049
a twenty years ago in Duluth and it has
been replicated

523
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:17,029
and another experiment was done in the
ass

524
00:30:17,029 --> 00:30:20,589
with by cyclists where helmet

525
00:30:20,589 --> 00:30:25,989
and whenever they wear a helmet I'm the
car drivers who take them over

526
00:30:25,989 --> 00:30:30,059
a are leaving less distance to the bike
because they're wearing

527
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:33,289
helmet and if they're wearing a helmet
to protect it

528
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:37,009
the bicameral does not protect much
against the two tone car car which is

529
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:39,309
driving with 100 kilometers per hour

530
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:43,729
besides you is usually ignored but this
is one of the effects

531
00:30:43,729 --> 00:30:47,519
so the the variable a change in this

532
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:51,859
in this a.m. experiment was very novel
by comment resist

533
00:30:51,859 --> 00:30:55,960
not wearing a bike helmet and you could
predict if that were possible driver

534
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,559
war a.m. helmet the distance between car
and bike was

535
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,570
significantly lower because the convoy
was

536
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:07,200
had two different risk perception or

537
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,450
from IT security when I was
administrated University

538
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:14,190
we introduced a.m. and the price of
course anti-virus

539
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:17,999
thing and when we installed and rolled
it out and the user's came just

540
00:31:17,999 --> 00:31:21,969
great now I can visit all the shady
Russian web sites because we have

541
00:31:21,969 --> 00:31:27,779
anti-virus installed the same the same
problem from IT security

542
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:30,919
I'm like Orissa personality and security

543
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:34,129
there are different theories of
personality

544
00:31:34,129 --> 00:31:38,190
the most so that the biggest difference
between persons with

545
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:41,409
between amenities and psychology and

546
00:31:41,409 --> 00:31:45,440
finds a slow computer science electrical
engineer lem Athens we don't usually

547
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,549
have the one accepted theory but we have
different theories

548
00:31:48,549 --> 00:31:51,999
and you cannot prove them correct or
incorrect legally try to

549
00:31:51,999 --> 00:31:55,940
to invalidate them but you can proven to
be correct

550
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:01,779
I'm we want to XO my personality traits
and security relevant behavior

551
00:32:01,779 --> 00:32:04,889
because personality traits a very stable
over a lifetime

552
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:09,219
this is the definition of its a
personality trait that for

553
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:12,679
if I make a test with you when you're 20
years old you will have almost the same

554
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:13,399
result

555
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:17,249
as if you're forty years old sixty years
old all these traits will not change

556
00:32:17,249 --> 00:32:18,940
much over a lifetime

557
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:22,409
unless for Tampa motivation motivation
is very blah to

558
00:32:22,409 --> 00:32:26,289
and it can change within minutes when
you wake up you're motivated to change a

559
00:32:26,289 --> 00:32:30,799
life and then after breakfast you
certainly spend another they'll read it

560
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,859
and I'll looking at kid missus

561
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:37,879
much more fun than cleaning the house or
something like that

562
00:32:37,879 --> 00:32:41,619
you know the most popular with Big Five
which consists of

563
00:32:41,619 --> 00:32:46,309
all these morris's extraversion openness
contention

564
00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:50,099
at this what you can read it and
agreeableness consciousness whenever

565
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:50,769
trying to

566
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:54,399
prim I don't get it

567
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,469
term another psychological theory is

568
00:32:58,469 --> 00:33:01,619
the series of motives people

569
00:33:01,619 --> 00:33:04,669
have usually different motives which can
be excellent motives

570
00:33:04,669 --> 00:33:08,709
also stable over a lifetime and motives
are usually

571
00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:13,619
a huge factor motivation you can say in
an object-oriented programming would say

572
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:16,440
these are the father causes or something
like that

573
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,570
a.m. they the influence the motivation
of people into several

574
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:23,599
motive for example power achievement
oriented

575
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:27,769
orientation and other I'm nowadays
currently in the lot of journalists

576
00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:30,679
especially in american newspapers are
you doing this motives

577
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:34,679
to describe what is putting doing the
trim confirm from the pole

578
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:38,070
orientation of putting this very high
therefore he wants to

579
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:43,089
invade crewmen such I am so the
questions you're holding the correlated

580
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:43,399
with

581
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:48,149
security relevant behavior I'm we going
to do empirical research

582
00:33:48,149 --> 00:33:51,700
and then we want to develop methods and
tools

583
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,959
term which can be used to predict you'll
be having different situations

584
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:59,369
read Assessment Center I'm training
methods and such

585
00:33:59,369 --> 00:34:03,849
so this is the fundamental thing we need
for organizational development for

586
00:34:03,849 --> 00:34:05,519
training in organizations

587
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:10,460
and all support self-assessment

588
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,250
'em organizational development and
security is a huge topic

589
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:17,589
it's about management and it's about
training it's about how

590
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:22,279
organizations work and killed when
security is huge in hot topic

591
00:34:22,279 --> 00:34:27,240
inthe in companies lots of money is
spent on security weapons and training

592
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,549
there are lots of different method in

593
00:34:30,549 --> 00:34:33,559
X's in knowledge management leadership

594
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:37,669
organizational development these are
a.m. topics research

595
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:41,629
boy psychology by social science boy
economy management theories

596
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:44,819
a lot of people working on the stock
a.m. box

597
00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:48,200
a there are no studies of theories

598
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:53,119
on organizational development and
security relevant behavior

599
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,710
there are or some work done read regards
to information security

600
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:02,180
or for example standardization approach
like easel 1,001 in such getting

601
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:05,329
the certificates for your system
administrators and such

602
00:35:05,329 --> 00:35:10,019
but from doesn't mall this have the
standardization approach

603
00:35:10,019 --> 00:35:13,670
which usually ignores from the behavior
of people

604
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:17,400
person so for example standard to the
state's your

605
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,859
system Administrator has to be trained
in course 101

606
00:35:20,859 --> 00:35:23,920
and if he has a certificated he will
always be a security

607
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,890
compliant but has already set
organization and situation have a huge

608
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:32,099
influence even someone a.m. with the
correct

609
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:36,349
with with the correct formal training in
security IT security

610
00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:42,059
might to in secure stuff from time to
time like that physicians who smoke

611
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:46,849
I'm one point district who refuse can
easily be attacked with social

612
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:47,519
engineering

613
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:51,200
you just have to use that iraqi a but
also

614
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,420
organizations know he rocky which is
actually an oxymoron

615
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:59,730
every organization has iraqi it's just
coded in differently

616
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:03,260
all those fancy Newmarket that design

617
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:07,250
agencies that were created in the early
2000's also had a rocky

618
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:11,000
but the use the different encoding for
the hurricane iraqi models

619
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,990
didn't use the BMW car or the huge task

620
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:18,059
a bit different encodings and they also
have to work

621
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:21,490
so every organization has a tricky and
every

622
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:25,269
organizations here a key can be used in
social engineering attacks

623
00:36:25,269 --> 00:36:28,940
you just have to find out how this is
encoded it's pretty easy in the military

624
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,539
because the iraqis prodigy on the
shoulders

625
00:36:31,539 --> 00:36:35,589
the but another other organizations also
you just have to find out how these

626
00:36:35,589 --> 00:36:37,490
codes work

627
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:40,869
now this is this is normal look for some
boudin by

628
00:36:40,869 --> 00:36:44,230
PW fringe philosopher firm

629
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:47,380
who spoke about I'm how

630
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:51,789
group all the group behavior is used to
determine if your

631
00:36:51,789 --> 00:36:54,930
in this group or not for example the
rich people all those

632
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:58,660
the people who get managers in the

633
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:03,130
the large companies because they have
behavior even if I study economy and

634
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:03,779
work

635
00:37:03,779 --> 00:37:07,519
a.m. up to get to those lovely still you
that are coming from coming from a

636
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:08,369
working back from

637
00:37:08,369 --> 00:37:13,930
working-class background and not from
there money background

638
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:17,359
a.m. cultural differences reports point

639
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,740
a.m. culture influences organizations

640
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:23,829
and individuals there is so a lot of

641
00:37:23,829 --> 00:37:27,200
debate about culture 'em there is

642
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,980
a lot of discussion about culture
differences task for example

643
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:34,170
cultural awareness training there is a
nice

644
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:37,609
there has been a nice at in Germany from

645
00:37:37,609 --> 00:37:40,839
an agency that offers such cultural
training in the

646
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:44,019
to German managers visiting China and

647
00:37:44,019 --> 00:37:47,599
invited to to lunch and the senior
manager

648
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,720
the senior German ministers over we in
China

649
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,089
in I've heard that you have to eat all
the time so that's on the table

650
00:37:54,089 --> 00:37:57,420
otherwise for your offending or our

651
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:01,529
costs and actually it's by southern
China have to leave some

652
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:05,410
lunch on your platters on if you don't
do this you will get

653
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,589
more lunch because the host

654
00:38:08,589 --> 00:38:12,549
has to provide enough food to for

655
00:38:12,549 --> 00:38:17,160
for for the guests 0 the needs and every
time they finished the cutover happy

656
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,950
that they have shown respect the Chinese
culture

657
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:23,569
and the Chinese look at it I'll and
another man Chinese oh my god those

658
00:38:23,569 --> 00:38:27,010
Germans in so much pain will meet on and
then they bring in more meat

659
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:30,930
and the sands in the loop and this is
this is one example it's

660
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:34,049
its from how cultural

661
00:38:34,049 --> 00:38:37,880
inferences behavior and your the
questions

662
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,579
what are the differences in different
countries and how can the influence

663
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:41,309
security

664
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:44,349
for example the management style of
leadership style in Germany and the US

665
00:38:44,349 --> 00:38:45,150
differ lot

666
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:49,319
and there's also has to do for example
with the formal

667
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:53,700
TV system the technical vocational
education and training system

668
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:57,740
the system in which we train our
trainees here in Germany with a very

669
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,809
very formalization

670
00:38:58,809 --> 00:39:02,539
no approachable certificates we have
formalized trainings

671
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:06,279
these do not exist outside of the
german-speaking countries Austria

672
00:39:06,279 --> 00:39:08,410
Switzerland in some parts of the
Netherlands also

673
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:13,220
subsystems but most countries don't have
such a system so we cannot

674
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:16,819
export amo approaches him

675
00:39:16,819 --> 00:39:20,599
a.m. other countries on-the-job training
for example in the english-speaking

676
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:21,890
countries

677
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:25,960
there's a lot of on-the-job training
other countries for example Spain and

678
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,490
France have a more college

679
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:31,039
multi reticle college approach to a lot
of training is done at colleges

680
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:34,079
and people get their degrees and then
going to companies

681
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,309
and then they have to be trained on the
job to fulfill the top

682
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:41,430
requirements so we have a lot of tools
and methods

683
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:45,200
that already exist there are a lot of
recent resume spot

684
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,049
we have to check if the can be
transferred no problems I think there

685
00:39:48,049 --> 00:39:48,960
will be

686
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,250
more problems but we can easily check if
this inferences IT security

687
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:57,829
but his security behavior

688
00:39:57,829 --> 00:40:00,940
so not coming to my favorite part doctor
X

689
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:04,579
I'm the tactics the signs and learning
and teaching I'm currently doing a

690
00:40:04,579 --> 00:40:08,029
Masters in international location
education MacBook

691
00:40:08,029 --> 00:40:12,279
it's a corporation a program between my
German University and the University

692
00:40:12,279 --> 00:40:16,619
about this potential training and the
tactics is huge

693
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:20,690
um topic at all research in no
University

694
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:25,359
and the first thing or or professor of
deduct excess this is also pretty German

695
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:26,490
signs because

696
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:30,480
we have a lot of discussion and research
about this deduct the combatants because

697
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,000
we have

698
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,710
have this formal training system
universities

699
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:38,920
we have a party that system where the
trainees are trained in schools

700
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,420
and therefore all the teachers working
those schools have to be trading this

701
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,900
teaching methods

702
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,220
and for example if you compare the
German Wikipedia side on the tactics

703
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,630
with the English one

704
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:51,920
you see huge difference because the
germans like this really huge

705
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,269
and said okay let's use the pd-art to
translate all the concepts

706
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:58,539
because I have to find the correct terms
the switched over to the

707
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,819
english-language Wikipedia

708
00:40:59,819 --> 00:41:02,950
uniform is such a small stop didactics

709
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:08,440
so I'm I see that this is one of the
first culture differences we have

710
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,980
it's about teaching methodology it's
very well research

711
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:15,200
that's both 102 canceled because

712
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:20,430
we have to train all teachers and thus
stuff and we do also have

713
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:24,299
since 1997 I T professions

714
00:41:24,299 --> 00:41:27,569
so people can get rained on the German
professions called

715
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:31,819
Informatica which means you don't go
have to go to university but you're

716
00:41:31,819 --> 00:41:33,309
trying to achieve its cool

717
00:41:33,309 --> 00:41:37,049
your practical training in your you know

718
00:41:37,049 --> 00:41:40,960
training company on a training company
and you have your theoretical background

719
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,759
to get on the T that's cool

720
00:41:42,759 --> 00:41:47,000
and there are several curriculum
existing for these professions

721
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,849
and we are currently I'm developing a
new curriculum

722
00:41:50,849 --> 00:41:54,930
for the German for Informatica those on
TV system administrators

723
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:58,250
with the focus on IT security and them

724
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:01,440
of course we also have to provide the
material for the teacher

725
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,740
32 have to be trained on how to teach
the store and

726
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:08,259
we have to check what they have to know
so the question

727
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:12,259
might be do they really have to
understand the mathematical the crowns

728
00:42:12,259 --> 00:42:12,569
of

729
00:42:12,569 --> 00:42:16,450
the pic of good in the tickle
cryptography or something

730
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:20,650
you can only ordered University studying
mathematics computer science

731
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:23,930
and other discussions so we have to
discuss

732
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:28,119
what want what they have to learn and
hole they have too long but

733
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:31,329
or how it has to be teach tort

734
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:34,819
so the main question is how can we teach
security

735
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:38,109
which method work best under which
circumstances

736
00:42:38,109 --> 00:42:42,390
the the scientific mathematical approach
necessarily understand could cover for

737
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:44,269
you can you do hands-on approach

738
00:42:44,269 --> 00:42:48,539
is a trip to party good method to teach
people to graffiti

739
00:42:48,539 --> 00:42:53,039
from doesn't work blended learning facts
theory practical approach

740
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:56,769
huge discussion because usually among
the companies in germany

741
00:42:56,769 --> 00:43:00,910
usually climb that for example students
know a lot of fury but not

742
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:04,480
not enough practical stuff so here we
have two

743
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,819
XOM on find a good balance between these
parts

744
00:43:07,819 --> 00:43:12,109
the council is relevant Germany the TV
moralists

745
00:43:12,109 --> 00:43:15,200
their evil accepted we export

746
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,460
this training model via the Queen s cool
to different other countries for example

747
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:21,740
or university is responsible for house
East Asia

748
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:25,680
so we are training Chinese I'm teachers

749
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,539
and they absolutely do not except the
practical hands-on approach

750
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:34,539
Chinese professional schools
professional training in china is a

751
00:43:34,539 --> 00:43:37,980
there are two hundred students in one
room and then there's a teacher in

752
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,559
standing at the front desk

753
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:42,900
and he's showing how to sold or some

754
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,990
IC devices together and this is
projected to

755
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:49,720
the wall using a projector and thats
their practical approach

756
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:53,579
as a student students what the teacher
doing something

757
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:57,980
that's not practical training Germany
because practical training he means that

758
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:01,819
the students are soldiering on this
whole thing have to do hands-on

759
00:44:01,819 --> 00:44:06,099
this is this is huge discussion it's a
huge problem when

760
00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:10,970
different training backgrounds and
cultural backgrounds on board

761
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:15,230
we have well research model you in
Germany is called competence model

762
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:17,210
competence and capacity

763
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:21,069
use in psychology it's not about the
former competence being

764
00:44:21,069 --> 00:44:24,069
lot to do things it's a psychological
approach being

765
00:44:24,069 --> 00:44:28,920
able to do things people from the
Beavers stick approach

766
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:33,339
another theoretical backgrounds and it's
currently

767
00:44:33,339 --> 00:44:37,529
introduced from your old old in every
German at school

768
00:44:37,529 --> 00:44:40,859
month point is which makes it great is

769
00:44:40,859 --> 00:44:45,130
not all the facts told also studying and
research methods

770
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:48,890
so every trainee was not trained in 10
also learns how to

771
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:52,230
teach himself all two new stuff

772
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:56,000
because there is the so-called problem
obsolescence

773
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,720
all the mess it's method stored in the
tea that's cool

774
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:03,049
a someone obsolete for my father

775
00:45:03,049 --> 00:45:06,509
members are trying to come by and he was
trained in the early nineteen seventies

776
00:45:06,509 --> 00:45:08,099
and

777
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:12,599
the stuff numbers now learn in school
they have computer stuff they have new

778
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:16,410
material stuff pulley went on and all
those plastic stuff they never happened

779
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:18,869
the 1970s oh my father would not be able

780
00:45:18,869 --> 00:45:22,430
nowadays to work as a plumber because

781
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:26,519
all the method strange and of course we
know naughty they are changing fast

782
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:30,880
and than income being electrical
engineering so the Chinese also have to

783
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,380
learn and understand

784
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:36,119
know that the message they learned might
be obsolete on time and they have to

785
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:38,319
learn how to get the new facts

786
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:44,069
to train them I'll the should be able to
organize too old for that occasion

787
00:45:44,069 --> 00:45:47,220
I'm independent learning simple voiced
them how to keep the knowledge

788
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:51,230
and what went on a.m.

789
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:55,970
yeah how is the biggest problem when
talking about it but it's pretty easy to

790
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:58,319
develop curricula list of

791
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:02,460
skills that should be trained but we
also have to make

792
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:06,769
background for the teachers on how this
has to be toward what are the best

793
00:46:06,769 --> 00:46:08,700
message to develop those competencies

794
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:12,740
should play returned the mathematical
approach whole computer works what is

795
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:15,309
the Turing machine was touring
computation

796
00:46:15,309 --> 00:46:18,700
what from Norman architecture and then
they can try to prove

797
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:23,380
from the medical staff that viruses
working horses were all my to the better

798
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:26,009
idea to give them a medal sport

799
00:46:26,009 --> 00:46:29,640
and and made us portable virtual machine
and let them use may just want to hack

800
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,130
into

801
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:34,150
a computer so hands-on was a theoretical
approach think

802
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:37,750
must be bought balanced

803
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:40,859
project work and other stuff methods we
can use and

804
00:46:40,859 --> 00:46:43,869
something we still have in germany when
doing the the training

805
00:46:43,869 --> 00:46:47,299
is the masterpiece it's actually the
ideal the gills had

806
00:46:47,299 --> 00:46:52,009
back in the 12th century whenever you
finish your training process of usually

807
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:53,339
three years

808
00:46:53,339 --> 00:46:57,019
you have to do your masterpiece which
has to be present

809
00:46:57,019 --> 00:47:00,750
at the Chamber of Commerce something you
have to pretend it is cuz it and when

810
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:01,509
you

811
00:47:01,509 --> 00:47:04,839
when the people think you look as

812
00:47:04,839 --> 00:47:08,079
well done the new are now a trained
skilled labour

813
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:11,849
when you get a certificated you can work
on your own and this process has been

814
00:47:11,849 --> 00:47:14,650
used in Europe for several hundred years
it has been a bend

815
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:18,400
love country talk some before answering
them but we kept it alive

816
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,680
Germany and we know to use it in this
into this

817
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,960
a good thing to to

818
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,960
make people able to practical stuff so
they don't only get

819
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,319
sirica background but they are actually
able to

820
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:35,769
a lead the project on your own to do
work and

821
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:39,150
get an extermination yeah

822
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:42,539
who passed through on what of course
there are several roles

823
00:47:42,539 --> 00:47:46,559
in IT security system administrator
developers and users

824
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:49,559
I'm we have to find or create different
roles and d2 mine

825
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:52,740
what usual has two which is actually

826
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:57,009
pretty up the whole to teach it all to
be learned

827
00:47:57,009 --> 00:48:01,299
is more different no he spoke about what

828
00:48:01,299 --> 00:48:05,999
and yeah web-based teaching with
interests that are currently cooperating

829
00:48:05,999 --> 00:48:10,369
with several organizations on creating
web-based teaching

830
00:48:10,369 --> 00:48:14,529
you doing blended learning is an
interesting approach

831
00:48:14,529 --> 00:48:17,920
some in the US there is currently huge
discussion about

832
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,200
these online trainings like an economy
and other stuff

833
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:27,480
I'm we want to develop curriculum murai
stricken with different roles

834
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:31,039
so we want to solve the basic training
for everyone and then we want to for all

835
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:31,819
build

836
00:48:31,819 --> 00:48:34,950
them several models for managers for

837
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:38,499
system administrators for developers
because they all have no difference

838
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:42,619
we also want to include those people who
are not working in IT

839
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:47,249
jobs for example managers all the clocks
working in the office because it's

840
00:48:47,249 --> 00:48:47,990
usually

841
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:51,039
o'clock that gets the reads

842
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:54,829
most of the emails and they get attacked
by phishing attacks it's not the

843
00:48:54,829 --> 00:48:57,930
system administrator fiscal such stuff
but usually the

844
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:01,999
the the lady is sitting at the desk and
answering all the emails coming

845
00:49:01,999 --> 00:49:05,599
in that in for its dot com so

846
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:08,960
someone to adept at four different roles

847
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,329
we want to use different methods
including mobile learning and we also

848
00:49:12,329 --> 00:49:14,779
want to include test and certification

849
00:49:14,779 --> 00:49:18,410
an online training is nice but without
certification

850
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:21,990
them it's hard to get acceptance for it
and we have to find some ways to serve

851
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:26,099
Kate the people who attend this training
so they can present

852
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:30,670
certification on the apply for jobs want
to get payment because in

853
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:33,809
skills and such

854
00:49:33,809 --> 00:49:36,819
the last part a.m. knowledge base

855
00:49:36,819 --> 00:49:41,069
a huge problem with IT security is too
much information is floating around

856
00:49:41,069 --> 00:49:45,400
so when you look up a problem um you
always find another web sites and

857
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,450
maybe ninety percent of those website or
actually altered

858
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:52,539
I had huge discussion about this with
some friends

859
00:49:52,539 --> 00:49:56,099
when they traded did workshop at
University on using latte

860
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:59,289
for writing technical documents writing
documents

861
00:49:59,289 --> 00:50:02,880
and when you were around for for several
problems

862
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,130
you might encounter when using test you
find

863
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:09,680
those in support science and a lot of
them all tate is all wrong

864
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,559
have been made in the nineteen eighties
or 99

865
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:17,170
1990s the horse in webpart you if you
take a

866
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:20,200
Usenet you find some statements from the
nineteen eighties

867
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:24,930
so the problem is there is so much
information that many people get

868
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:25,940
overwhelmed by it

869
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:30,019
and that's also one of the problems for
a lot of of companies or people don't

870
00:50:30,019 --> 00:50:31,999
use open source for example in also

871
00:50:31,999 --> 00:50:36,210
previous deals because I'm when they
have a problem with Windows computer

872
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:40,420
always know someone who knows more than
that who was able to answer the question

873
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:43,829
but when they're changing or switching
over to Linux or FreeBSD

874
00:50:43,829 --> 00:50:48,109
a.m. they know have to move it around
and they cannot say which information is

875
00:50:48,109 --> 00:50:51,269
correct and which information is pretty
much made a bold

876
00:50:51,269 --> 00:50:54,690
and that's a huge problem but also
exists in IT security

877
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:58,910
for example there it was was an article
in German newspaper about

878
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:03,269
secure relation of our clients because
some politician was involved in this

879
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:06,809
and the first thing that came yet please
use the button method its

880
00:51:06,809 --> 00:51:10,759
33 times writing over your daughter but
most people

881
00:51:10,759 --> 00:51:15,369
don't know that got one and moist hard
drives in 1994 and looked at the

882
00:51:15,369 --> 00:51:18,930
coding methods they used and modern hard
words don't you

883
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:22,900
this coating more methods anymore
therefore got months agrees

884
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:27,440
as stated by himself is obsolete but
people see think it's so the three times

885
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,529
33 times is bigger than seven times
there for good must be better

886
00:51:31,529 --> 00:51:35,490
because they don't know that all the
technical background completely changed

887
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:39,380
and this is one huge problem in doing
those trainings so we have to find

888
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:41,420
methods to identify correct knowledge

889
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:46,609
to rate maybe knowledge base some
colorful the compy of IT security

890
00:51:46,609 --> 00:51:50,279
um but then the question is who decides
it's about peace

891
00:51:50,279 --> 00:51:54,499
contents who all the experts were able
to cite this

892
00:51:54,499 --> 00:51:57,660
is was not the only one who understands
cryptography and therefore he should be

893
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,059
the one

894
00:51:59,059 --> 00:52:03,910
well de mi got who is able to decide if
cryptography

895
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:07,519
religious good or bad

896
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:11,650
so from what to do I'm almost finishing

897
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:14,670
what do we have to do we have to finish
the fundamental research

898
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:17,799
we have to discuss what to teach we have
to do research about cultural

899
00:52:17,799 --> 00:52:19,140
differences

900
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:22,450
and we have to form adequate teaching
matters that's our

901
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:25,609
again there's a lot more things to do
but thats

902
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:28,700
the current program we r run because we
have to

903
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:32,960
back break it into several tasks 'em

904
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,130
just another information the copy and
pasted

905
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:39,230
for those speaking German I'm I
published them

906
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:42,380
the book one-and-a-half years ago
together with

907
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:47,019
a coded a political scientist it's
mostly about the cyberwar discussion we

908
00:52:47,019 --> 00:52:48,660
have some technical

909
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:52,589
articles and some articles from
political scientists about all this

910
00:52:52,589 --> 00:52:55,670
international conflicts I warn such

911
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:59,599
the last the first chapter is an article
by me or talk to me

912
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,630
written about cyberwar and the last
chapters

913
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:07,210
written about cyber peace the you find a
lot of information I get from the store

914
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:10,559
so if you're interested in you can buy
this book

915
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:15,009
or you can use our online Joan because
all the chapters also published in or

916
00:53:15,009 --> 00:53:16,470
join

917
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:20,970
I'm upcoming days those of you
interested in a career working together

918
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:23,589
with the chamber of commerce in Potsdam

919
00:53:23,589 --> 00:53:27,630
gonna go on hacking and social
