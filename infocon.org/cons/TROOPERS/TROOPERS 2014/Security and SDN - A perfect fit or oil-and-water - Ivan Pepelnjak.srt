1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,960
how many love you have a good idea what
as the N is

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,679
km

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,549
a so for everyone else %uh go through
the introductory part

4
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:20,720
and then I'll talk about 23 curity
related issues because after all this is

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,080
a security conference

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,439
one a how the how vulnerable

7
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,990
is this architecture and the second

8
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:33,220
part where can we use it in security
solutions

9
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:38,360
and if anyone has any questions
afterwards because I we really have to

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,750
stay pretty high level

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,750
I will be around here so just pick me up

12
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,790
or this evening at the dinner and we can
go into

13
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:51,809
s many details as you wish I have the
unfortunate

14
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:56,340
privilege being networking engineer
scenes 1985 or sell

15
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,600
so i've seen so many things being
proposed and failing

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,409
that I cannot help myself whenever I see
something new proposed I

17
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:11,500
immediately compared this new thing to
some whole thing and it turns out that

18
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,680
it's almost on

19
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,200
on most always identical to the old
thing just three market

20
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,430
and so it's immediately obvious what
will the wrong

21
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,790
and of course people don't want to
listen and do it does go

22
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,220
rock and is the same with as the and you
see that it's nothing new

23
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,750
it primarily hype

24
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,810
other things I'm usually doing

25
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,079
and I'll worry larch net

26
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,170
cloud networking solutions as well as
some ipv6 and then

27
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,649
yes still up to %uh start with what

28
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:48,920
is software-defined networking and it

29
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,170
at the answer depends on whom you ask

30
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,470
so there is this one

31
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,880
entity called Open Networking Foundation

32
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,170
and their definition of as the NAS as
the end is the

33
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:06,790
physical separation of the control plane

34
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:11,540
so the brains of the network and the
forwarding plane

35
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,870
that does the packet forwarding so it's
like you have your sweet you have your

36
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,870
router you have your firewall you take
the brains out

37
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,160
they have to be physically separate
somewhere else

38
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,209
and now this remote the brain is
controlling not the one

39
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:33,950
devise but multiple devices as their
definition up as the end mom

40
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,290
the acronym s somewhat weird because

41
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,970
as far as I remember know what software
running on the networks

42
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:44,640
starting with IBM's front and process
orders

43
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,580
and then even mow them scat software so
when someone is telling me that this is

44
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,550
now thought to be fine

45
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,360
Network Inc I just go like go away you
know nothing about history

46
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,360
but the acronym is there

47
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,830
and it will stick unfortunately now when
this thing became popular which was in

48
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,440
summer of 2011

49
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,220
all of a sudden we could see all sorts
of as the and washing

50
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,830
so every vendor that had some think
which was

51
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,000
a bit more and see a lie it could just
be

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,629
and API like netcom they started calling
that as the N

53
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:24,510
so for most vendors

54
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,950
out there when they say we cap as the
end something

55
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:32,099
it means we have whatever we capped with
have just three labeled it as the end

56
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:32,440
because

57
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,230
its popular three years back it was
clout

58
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:40,080
now it's as the N and

59
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,680
for startups this was just a huge
opportunity

60
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,860
too high whatever it is that they were
making

61
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,590
to the venture capitalists so

62
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:55,340
startups were selling new as the end
something Inc

63
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,909
and sometimes it had nothing to do with

64
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:02,780
this bird what mostly it had nothing to
do with this for the finish

65
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,420
so for example there was a company

66
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:12,060
that tweet the TCP stack so that their
load balancer work faster

67
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,180
and because they hadn't

68
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,199
API well RESTful API to be precise with
you could

69
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,740
for example call from job I applied or
from a perl script

70
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,639
or from wherever they call that thing
the as the N

71
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,979
it was just the load balancer sup

72
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:36,729
as the N world is full of hype

73
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:41,220
and its up to us unfortunately the users
to figure out

74
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,840
what's hype and what 30 and mostly

75
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,400
sup on the other hand I think that this
is to

76
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,280
constraining I do think that we need to
do a lot of things networking we are

77
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,630
doing a lot of things wrong

78
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,720
but this is not the solution for

79
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,860
this audience

80
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,000
so who propose that this definition

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,009
well oh an app started ass

82
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:11,729
a bunch of worry large cloud providers

83
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:14,750
and this is what they wanted

84
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,970
Google was building their own switches

85
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:22,570
for years and years they even have their
own routing protocol because it's

86
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:28,650
somewhat heart run OSPF in one area on
five thousand switches

87
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:33,650
so they build their own routing protocol
and some small company was building this

88
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,100
which is for them

89
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,449
and they were running this author and/or
switches

90
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:41,660
now if you do that the only problem you
have is that you are tied to that

91
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,050
particular companies design

92
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:48,460
so they want to have a more open
architecture where they could just buy

93
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:52,650
switches from any supplier as long as
they conform to a single standard

94
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:57,840
and of course use that as a leverage to
bring the prices given for dow

95
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,860
that was the only thing they had in mind
they wanted to become

96
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,810
a switch and router manufacturer and
they did it

97
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,880
will benefit us now of course

98
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,210
will you invest in building your own
router software

99
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,250
no I hope

100
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,210
Yahoo had a totally different take

101
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:26,430
they have interesting problems with
their network

102
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:30,069
I don't want to comment on that I

103
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:34,819
but you can go and look at the
presentation that

104
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:39,509
eagle vision ski hat at OpenFlow
symposium in 2011

105
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:43,150
and the I remember correctly one of his
life was thirty percent of my CPU is

106
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:47,870
used by the spanning tree protocol

107
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,479
arm so what he wanted was the

108
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:55,460
ability to have special features

109
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,970
he said I know how my data center is why
art

110
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,400
corporately I know otherwise we have a
bigger problem

111
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,220
so I don't need spending three I don't
mean routing protocols I don't need a

112
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,349
number of other things I would like to
cast

113
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:10,979
something that serves me

114
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:15,789
and he said in I totally understand that
I will not get it from any vendor

115
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:20,389
because it's too expensive no bender
will give me my special feature

116
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:25,449
forty amount geared and by because then
they have to support the special peter

117
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:28,699
in all the upcoming software uses for
next 10 years

118
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:33,300
and regression testing on it so he was
very realistic saying

119
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,539
a I will not get I want to be able to
build

120
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:43,259
my own things and supplement what the
sweetest are doing

121
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:46,680
he was not interested and low-cost white
labels which is

122
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,110
he was interested in getting his
features so that he's network would work

123
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,569
the way he thinks he's network should
work

124
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:56,009
we just honestly a fair idea

125
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:59,840
a facebook on the other hand they are
pretty

126
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,810
focused on doing things that doesn't
matter to them

127
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,900
lag data center staff and networking
stuff and my sequel star

128
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,400
and PHP compiler and who knows what else
is in on their core business

129
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,780
the core business are the likes I

130
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:21,940
so they are pretty open about these
things and a cab even published

131
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,900
a reference architecture I lost Mike

132
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:32,240
gap

133
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:39,240
better now

134
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:44,110
its on maybe we're out of batteries

135
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,290
yet

136
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,510
wear out the batteries talk

137
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:56,460
you can hear me right

138
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:01,020
okay so I yell I

139
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,650
so they are pretty good at open sourcing
thinks

140
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:09,900
and drought the right now they are at
the phase where they have a reference

141
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,350
architecture for 8 top of wrecks which
what they're missing

142
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:20,540
is the softer and they hope that someone
will miraculously appear

143
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,680
and somehow the open-source router
software will

144
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,510
is potentiated itself and with

145
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,790
with all the problem now in real life
what

146
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,830
people like us want to cap is

147
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,320
we want to cap past their software
development we want to deploy things

148
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:38,810
fast

149
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:42,350
we don't want to wait for I don't know

150
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:45,880
whoever we want the cup but the
provisioning

151
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,150
man a friend of mine det

152
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,320
the and analysis up how long

153
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,530
it bakes in his organization it's pretty
decently sized data center

154
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:02,610
to implement a new firewall rule it
between

155
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,870
a week in 10 days we just

156
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:10,130
ridiculous its standard

157
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:15,000
but it is ridiculous so we want the calf
but the provisioning

158
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,200
and weak on Capp at the provisioning if
we are acting like see ally monk

159
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,840
is and type things in I mean see light
is fine a lab seal I

160
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,140
I always say well we need to. I but

161
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,440
this is not the way to programmatically

162
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,310
access devices so we need programmable

163
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:38,850
elements and finally distributed systems
a great

164
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,900
rather so great I mean after all

165
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,590
internet works so what

166
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:49,130
but sometimes

167
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:52,530
it's great if you cast central busy
bility into thing

168
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:56,580
X sometimes is great if you can take a
look at the

169
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:02,420
end to end bath and say okay this is the
exact path that my packets are taking

170
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:07,890
or and even simpler example you know the
mac Address

171
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:13,550
of that phone does not work now try to
figure out where that phone is connected

172
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:20,020
that you have to go from device to
device to device to device the device

173
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,610
and do show mac address table some think

174
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:27,750
to see whether it's on that particular
device how stupid is that

175
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,820
you

176
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,570
on this fine

177
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:42,570
think ok

178
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,300
yeah

179
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,480
it works so this thing is not bad

180
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,150
the idea is great I just don't want to
have the

181
00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:00,000
central brain somewhere because if the
communication between the central brain

182
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,230
and my box breaks down I have a brain as
box

183
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:08,090
so this second several requirements

184
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:12,430
makes most sense more sense for most of
my customers

185
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,610
day and on the other hand

186
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:20,860
if we talk about programmability and
orchestration and things like that we

187
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,540
can't get

188
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,460
in 1992 week at the

189
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:31,620
customer database which was honestly a
text file week at a perl script

190
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:36,970
kept together in the afternoon and that
perl script was reading this text file

191
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:42,870
and producing configurations for all the
routers we had and this configuration

192
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,140
for

193
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:48,840
automatically installed on those routers
so every time we added the new user it

194
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,140
either it would be time based or
somewhat click the button and bomb

195
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:57,230
we have reconfigured our network and
we're not the only ones doing that

196
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:02,880
other people were doing that in those
days and well by all the condition is

197
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,550
good because

198
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,890
as the end but we didn't know weekend as
the answer we did in college as the

199
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:10,290
the why did we stop

200
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:14,490
the first thing is that the net first
became mission-critical

201
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:18,780
and we did

202
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,820
so week at no programming skills

203
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:26,780
we were hackers we were packing things
together in an afternoon

204
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:31,710
and if they work great and if they
didn't well we lost the network

205
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:37,240
I'm the guy with disconnected slovenia
from internet for half an hour

206
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:42,710
and the I i think the CDO of the left
was admitted

207
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,500
if I remember correctly that he's the
type who's gonna get Sweden for happen

208
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,930
or

209
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:51,280
we all have stories like that but we
could afford that in those

210
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,839
is because no one was really making
money on the internet

211
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,220
that was before the bank or Amazon

212
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,230
on second we didn't have

213
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,380
any programmatic interfaces when

214
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:11,380
trying to automatically configure your
devices through town that

215
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:15,700
at it sounds scary and it's you

216
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,990
because you have no Eric and drink my
you might get Eric handling when that

217
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,650
then you get into spaghetti code

218
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:25,580
expect script you don't want that and
then this offering these changes

219
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,950
and your spaghetti code stops working

220
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:32,589
I want to be there AFP course the

221
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:35,870
fact that every bender has

222
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,570
different configuration syntax doesn't
help

223
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:43,100
and everyone is complaining about this
and when anyone is complaining about

224
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:43,630
this

225
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:47,630
I just tell them to youth look at
sequels standard

226
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:53,290
which is standard right the only thing
the standardized across

227
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:58,720
different database vendors is a SELECT
statement without joins

228
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,350
and even there they're is stop something
in my sick while

229
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,200
and limit something in sick was there or
the other way around

230
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,260
so don't tell me we are lacking

231
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:14,680
standard configuration syntax it's not
know we're in IP do we have that

232
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,270
its only that other people realize that
they need an abstraction layer

233
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:23,520
so if you look at any decently written
softer does an attraction layer

234
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,780
that isolates the stupidest up
individual database vendors from the

235
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,010
rest of the

236
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:34,680
application and we were what we were
starving thats whats with spaghetti code

237
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,910
because we never learned proper
programming skills

238
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:41,370
because after all we are networking
engineer right

239
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:44,540
so know and trust in us

240
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,339
so we stopped doing that honest

241
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:51,540
okay so how far did we get

242
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,970
we want to cast some centralized control
nurse

243
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:58,260
maybe not control plane but at least
some central intelligence

244
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,339
and to NBC BT would be great but the
magnet program incorporation of network

245
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:04,150
devices would be great

246
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:07,970
not the questions I usually get are

247
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:11,800
how is this different from the single
pane of glass that was promised by the

248
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,350
network management vendors for the last
twenty years

249
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,790
honestly I can't answer this question

250
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:23,110
a what happens when the repetitions well
we all know

251
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,510
what happens if the controller is

252
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:30,709
assisting the individual network devices

253
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:36,750
band that assistance is gone and they
will fall back to business as usual

254
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,970
with for example you know when Amazon
laws the Availability Zone where

255
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,910
orchestration system was the BM's kept
running

256
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:48,630
but you couldn't speak up a new VM

257
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,930
the same thing here if

258
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:57,020
the network devices are still a tunnel
was that work will continue to work

259
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,640
it will even adapt to the policy changes

260
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,810
if the network devices are totally dumb
like the

261
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:07,030
true as the and proponents want us to

262
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:10,130
work then we are back to as the H

263
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:14,130
and Frame Relay

264
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,689
all the backup paths have to be
pre-configured in advance

265
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:22,110
because if we lose the controller

266
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:25,390
the devices are so brain that they can
do a single thing

267
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:31,800
on their up so well come back to the
nineteen

268
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:38,800
and the last one why should we work this
time honestly I don't

269
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:44,000
and then everyone is telling you how you
can do as the N

270
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,570
if you buy the next merchant are their
gear

271
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:51,429
obvious to the higher model with the new
software

272
00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:55,040
and that's blatantly not trip

273
00:17:55,040 --> 00:18:00,570
not do you know that in every network
device look at like three planes

274
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:04,940
you have the management plane when you
configure device and monitor the bicycle

275
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,070
the control plane

276
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:10,450
wanted to buy stocks to other devices
and collect the apology and forwarding

277
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,490
information and data forwarding plane

278
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:16,890
where the actual packet forwarding
happens

279
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:20,750
you can already youth netcom

280
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,530
to configure and monitor your device in
a more controlled way

281
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:27,810
than SSH port and that session

282
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:31,669
you have the problem of having different
configurations syntax

283
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:35,550
four different vendors but at least
there is a standard protocol

284
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:39,630
it will report and error message in a
standard what

285
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,620
which is a major improvement over that

286
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,150
BGP is used by many people for

287
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:53,100
a decade to influence the forwarding
decision in the box

288
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:58,040
every service provider should know about
remote 300 black coal Inc

289
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,419
which is the trick how you use BGP

290
00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:06,870
to tell everyone that this source IP
address or visit the nation IP address

291
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:11,300
should be discarded because we are on
the denial of service attack

292
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:16,860
every major sorry provider has that
feature its even documented in RFC

293
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,159
and it's been around for a decade at
least

294
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,710
that we can as the in for a decade we
didn't know it

295
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:27,950
PCP is and upcoming standard

296
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:32,390
allows you to download traffic
engineering tunnel information into

297
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:36,570
the control plane and finally

298
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:41,260
juniper documented what its and get the
grades in RFC

299
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:45,929
juniper document extensions to BGP that
allow you

300
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:49,220
to effectively do policy based routing

301
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,940
through BGP it's called BGP flows back

302
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:57,820
through BGP which means from a central
controller far away

303
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,830
you could install worry specific entries
into

304
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:05,750
every device in your network like sent
web traffic that way

305
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,220
and send back up traffic that way

306
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:13,120
and CloudFlare is using that in
production

307
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,970
for denial of service cropping

308
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:21,080
so whenever day figure out if someone is
attacking one of their customers

309
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,280
they figure out what the matching and
Apple

310
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,610
is for that attack and they install drop

311
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:32,060
entry into the edge routers of their CD
and network

312
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,419
so that the attack stops at the at on
the network it doesn't even come to the

313
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:40,000
servers so we can do all this

314
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,320
today some of time people are doing it
most of us aren't

315
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,919
and then you have all the bender API's
and all this cryptic

316
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:52,050
so for example on arista I like a
wrister because they

317
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,610
are we open about the fact that they
have Linux

318
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:59,150
on their switches and they give you all
the tools so you can run Perl script

319
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,730
on arista switch or a Python script

320
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:06,450
or a check or Papa age in whatever you
wish

321
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:10,260
it's a Linux box it's great

322
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:15,450
I am but still there are some things
that we konden you

323
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:19,850
for example it would be worry card to
intercept OSPF hello messages and write

324
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:20,860
a different version of

325
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,880
OSPF and this is where

326
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,750
OpenFlow comes in and I would only
mention overblown because it is due

327
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,190
more most popular one of all the

328
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:36,300
upcoming protocols and standards and so
on

329
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,669
and on the more proprietary and

330
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:42,790
cisco has 1pk

331
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,940
which as their efforts to expose their

332
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:49,140
API to

333
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:54,440
external scripts or whatever and they
have something like three hundred

334
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,220
different

335
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,610
API source

336
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:02,970
so they plan to expose everything that
is inside

337
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:07,960
their software to the outside world

338
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,070
so that you could tweak their software

339
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:14,600
in worry tiny little details

340
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,230
of course there's a good reason for that
once you start doing that and once

341
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:18,550
you're

342
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:23,060
scripts the band on that there's no
going back

343
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:27,520
this is the at the Met lock in it's a
great strategy for them

344
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,169
I really admired not what is open flap

345
00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:35,330
it were as simple OpenFlow is

346
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:38,659
to all that you can use to achieve that

347
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:43,159
total separation of control and data

348
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:46,190
so you Catholic Central controller or

349
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:50,040
lack thereof controllers one would hope
and then devices

350
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,340
somehow connect to the controller and
what

351
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,360
no one is telling you as that

352
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,590
usually we use out-of-band control plane
network

353
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:04,179
because it's just too risky to connect
from here

354
00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:07,970
the controller through this two switches
which are also controlled by the

355
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,490
Comptroller the controller goes mad

356
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:14,480
it will cut itself of from the network

357
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:20,790
so everyone sensible uses and out with
Ben control plane network

358
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:24,360
as the H anyone

359
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,070
we were using the same things in as the
age 8 p.m.

360
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:32,120
frame-relay optical networks and so on

361
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:37,450
we also know what the problem is with
this approach there is no shared fate

362
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:42,510
so if the forwarding clings fail the
control plane links will not know that

363
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,760
the poor reading things have

364
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,169
they'll and to you unless you cap some
mechanism

365
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:50,730
that actively measures what's going on
with the following links:

366
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:53,990
anyway the controller bills a model

367
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:57,240
the topology and then let's say you have
be one here

368
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,669
and then you say I want to cap prefix be
or something and be here

369
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:04,810
you don't compete at this on the device
you configure it

370
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:08,679
in the controller because the devices
are now totally stupid

371
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:11,679
you competed in the controllers AB is
here

372
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,399
and then the controller figures out the
part to the network figures out what

373
00:24:15,399 --> 00:24:17,200
needs to be done

374
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,679
what needs to be installed into
individual switches so that anyone could

375
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:21,830
reach be

376
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:26,210
and pushes down the flow entries

377
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:30,060
and now we Kappa entry pointing to be in
every single switch

378
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:36,290
in the network so here you have one here
you have to forty quirk of multipath

379
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:39,470
you could cat a backup entry here
pointing back here

380
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:42,560
and so on to its

381
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,840
traditional IP routing almost only

382
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:51,140
all the decisions are made by the
central box

383
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,860
K now as I said before

384
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:59,370
a few times this idea is nothing new

385
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:02,620
functionally this is identical to frame
relay

386
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:06,679
for ATM BBC's or as the H

387
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:10,700
and there are two protocols like mpls-tp
enforce s

388
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:16,550
that solve the same problem no one uses
force as I don't know why

389
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:20,080
and some people to believe in support
mpls-tp

390
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,860
the problems we're facing our always the
same

391
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:27,220
if we don't get proper abstractions in
the forwarding plane

392
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:32,120
it will not scale so people who are
telling you how they will reroute

393
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,240
individual TCP sessions across your
network airplane

394
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,919
stupid because you can't put

395
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:43,270
that many entries in the switching card
were of your switch

396
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:48,550
area sup when someone tells you how they
will reroute

397
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:52,120
individual sessions across your
datacenter

398
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,120
no that will not work up

399
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,420
them if you cast central control plane
you still need turns to its resilience

400
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,860
for you need backup paths as we've
learned the hard way

401
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:06,740
then you have some fast feedback loops
for example

402
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,740
this is my favorite one how will you do

403
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:15,300
50 millisecond convergence if the
controller has to do everything

404
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:21,320
there's no way so there are all sorts of
things that we

405
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:26,390
have been solving in the past and the
controller vendors will have to

406
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:30,160
solve them a gain to make

407
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,480
their control their word I'm less

408
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,190
they totally separate themselves

409
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:41,850
from the details of the network like

410
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,220
every controller vendor is doing that
works on

411
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:49,750
overlay virtual networks like VMware and
a sex

412
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:53,809
or open daylight in some cases

413
00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:59,010
or a number of other startups what they
do is they say we will transport

414
00:26:59,010 --> 00:26:59,940
something across

415
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,970
IP tunnels we don't want to touch the
network IP is working

416
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:07,190
Leslie be there and we'll solve our
problems

417
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:10,440
across the panels

418
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:17,280
on surprisingly almost every vendor is
shipping something

419
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,740
well if you want to sell gear to
occurred amex

420
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:27,010
in US today everything the RFP's asking
for OpenFlow

421
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:31,320
so you have to cap OpenFlow as a tick in
the box

422
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,630
to sell to the academics

423
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:38,130
that's why you see so many bender
supporting

424
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:42,630
and people are playing with this %uh you
have a number of commercial controllers

425
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,429
to cap a large number of

426
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:48,120
open source control there so whatever
your favorite language there is

427
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:54,530
a controller for you there's even one in
javascript

428
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:59,670
not is this is a security conference

429
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:04,290
what are the security aspect of this
think well I have

430
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:07,429
good and bad news for you

431
00:28:07,429 --> 00:28:10,720
the bad news is snow was is no one is
thinking about that

432
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,309
yet

433
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:19,220
that's good news for you that's not good
news for the rest with the audience

434
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:25,670
ion yep

435
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:29,250
okay thanks for the correction so I
should say no

436
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:33,080
bender is thinking about its the good
news

437
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,370
is that this is no different from on the

438
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:41,230
other controller architecture that we've
seen in the past

439
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:45,400
so this is not the first time that we
have this architecture

440
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,900
our own we know what the attacks are

441
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,000
we know what the potential vectors are

442
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,380
we know where we can get hit

443
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:00,309
so obviously I should attend the control
plane

444
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:03,900
obviously I should do denial of service
attacks

445
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,540
hopefully I get into the control plane
and then I can do not have service

446
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,900
attacks on the controller

447
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,620
or I can do denial of service attack on
the switch

448
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,170
and Kobe that it will month the packet
to the controller

449
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:19,960
its live the control plane protection in
every switch

450
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,200
rock sup obviously this is the first
thing that we can

451
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,059
attack if we can get here

452
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:31,320
we own the network

453
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:37,590
unfortunately this is SSL encrypted

454
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:41,790
okay good so I with stop right there

455
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:48,570
I already see some people having fun

456
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:52,070
yeah but everyone that semi-serious

457
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:57,290
is using encryption

458
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:00,450
yes of course with outside certificates
yes

459
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:03,570
of course to well there this minor
details

460
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:07,410
let's forget I

461
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:11,580
at least we know how this is done and we
know

462
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,809
what the usual implementation failures
are so

463
00:30:14,809 --> 00:30:18,660
you guys know immediately what the test

464
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:22,660
and then of course the controller is
running on a platform in this platform

465
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,890
is usually Linux

466
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:27,630
so feel free

467
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:32,020
you know what to do a and then of course
the controller itself

468
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:36,179
is written in Java or some other
language like that so you know what to

469
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:38,390
do

470
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:42,040
and then because this is OpenFlow

471
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,500
you might get though the way OpenFlow

472
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:51,200
works is if you will receive a packet on
a switch

473
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,450
and you don't know what to do with the
packet you might decide to send the

474
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:59,320
packet what the controller might decide
to program this wish to send the packet

475
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,150
to the controller

476
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:05,920
this is Kyle are is done in most cases

477
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,010
which is great justice tartan are storm

478
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:13,110
and your flood the controller game over

479
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:18,830
well no the the switch with sleepover
first

480
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:21,830
the CPU in this which we are always
joking

481
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:26,030
is the thing that costs ten cents

482
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:29,520
though the switches simply can not

483
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,520
blood the controller because the CPU is
not powerful enough to send

484
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,710
so many packets the controller so

485
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:40,710
smart vendors can realize that and what
they have

486
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:44,030
is they have control plane protection
here

487
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:47,210
for their limiting the amount all back

488
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:52,309
sent to the controller which of course
brings you back to the other

489
00:31:52,309 --> 00:31:55,880
usual attack if icon

490
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:00,059
kill the controller I can always kill
the control plane protection on this

491
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:00,470
which

492
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:04,330
and prevent anyone else connected on
this which from work

493
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:06,929
but this is no different from
traditional switches you can do the same

494
00:32:06,929 --> 00:32:09,929
thing on traditional switch

495
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:12,929
are once week at

496
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:16,780
the I think it will crs-1 Francisco

497
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:20,320
and I and we just started flooding it
with are

498
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:25,620
on a single interface we generated 30
percent CPU load

499
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:29,880
that's how things work i mean let's be
realistic and so of course weisenthal

500
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,450
control and protection there goes away

501
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,770
but it also means that the someone is
flooding this which

502
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:41,660
no one else will get there arts in thats
house which is what

503
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:46,090
%uh and then of course we could do some
other think we could do packets praying

504
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:49,320
and be the controller is stupid enough

505
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,350
the back its brain will result in
numerous

506
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:58,660
request to install additional flows and
then the switch will sleep over

507
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:02,440
because the switch can only install a
few thousand close

508
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,370
or a even if that doesn't happen because

509
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:09,530
switch is smart enough to edge the flows

510
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:14,190
the controller will continue to send new
flows because the Packers will continue

511
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,669
to arrive to the controller

512
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:21,320
so its effectively the same attack that
we had in the good old days when Cisco

513
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:21,730
still

514
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:25,910
had fast switching exhaust the cash

515
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:30,640
bad game or

516
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,169
sup before the first thing you do is you
cast separate data and control plane as

517
00:33:35,169 --> 00:33:35,419
the

518
00:33:35,419 --> 00:33:40,220
most obvious thing that you do and then
you called hope

519
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:44,120
and these guys will prove you wrong then
you cope

520
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:48,740
that the switch separates the management
traffic

521
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:53,299
from there for it track in a proper way

522
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:56,970
so that there is no connection between
the two

523
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:00,250
yep its mining for a good reason

524
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:03,770
but at least that gives you a fighting
chance

525
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:08,919
but it's like any network where you have
some control plane

526
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:14,109
once you get into the control plane it's
more or less game over

527
00:34:14,109 --> 00:34:17,990
and if there is a way to get from the
data plan into the control plane

528
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:21,089
its game or

529
00:34:21,089 --> 00:34:25,120
the other thing that you should look at
when you talk with the controller

530
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:25,710
vendors

531
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:30,200
is how do you set up Fla

532
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,379
do you set up flows based on known
topology

533
00:34:33,379 --> 00:34:38,169
which could be whatever you get from the
orchestration system in OpenStack

534
00:34:38,169 --> 00:34:39,370
environment

535
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:43,480
or whatever you got from the center in
VMware and a section Marmont

536
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,359
or do you actually set up close

537
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:51,230
on the mine which is reacting flow set
up

538
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:54,450
because if you setup flows in at Vons

539
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:57,790
based on known to apology

540
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:01,520
then no one can exhaust the controller

541
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,850
no one can attack it through the

542
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:08,390
date that the control plane interaction
if on the other hand

543
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:12,880
you have to do the namic met learning or
if you're doing fire warning

544
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,560
load balancing with the controller good
luck with that

545
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,690
then of course things have to go to the
controller

546
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:23,000
and the is always the chance

547
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,350
already option of doing tonight night of
service attack

548
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:33,540
by by just spraying the back it's all
over the place

549
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:37,140
I and of course you have to cast some
sort

550
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:40,200
of control plane protection here

551
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,640
so that if the application the
controller

552
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,780
ease using react the flow setup

553
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:51,000
at least the switch itself

554
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,620
will not allow the controller to be
flooded

555
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,620
you know how well control plane
protection works

556
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:01,010
in traditional switches it's usually
just

557
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:04,339
a single token bucket between the data
plan

558
00:36:04,339 --> 00:36:08,460
in the control plane it's never tried to
an individual interface at least not in

559
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,940
most cases

560
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:15,650
which means that one tenant on one
interface can house the whole switch

561
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:22,650
but as I said before that's nothing new
we had that before

562
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:27,150
sup use outta bed control plane

563
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:31,370
me my the control pain involvement use

564
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:34,760
controllers that are not setting

565
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,390
ap individual micro flow was because
that will not scale

566
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:42,530
and go with something that has
distributed

567
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:48,100
intelligence because if you cast cent
rise intelligence and someone gets into

568
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,230
that controller

569
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:52,390
it's game over

570
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:57,880
K and then you have the traditionalists
which card mean guidelines like

571
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,540
strict control database operation make
sure that the switch cannot

572
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:04,680
leak back is from 1 into the other

573
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,549
and control plane policing and finally

574
00:37:08,549 --> 00:37:12,250
the controllers Ron on whatever
operating system

575
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:16,470
and you know how to harden the operating
system

576
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:19,720
or if you don't you will have to learn
it pretty fight because the vendors

577
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,640
won't do it for you

578
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:28,600
now leads be more party

579
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,759
boring up can we use this

580
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,200
in some real-live use cases

581
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:41,170
and yes people are using both as the end
and OpenFlow in lot

582
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:44,470
of different applications and alger I've
just picked up

583
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:49,609
two or three security related ones you
know how well network monitoring works

584
00:37:49,609 --> 00:37:51,350
right

585
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:54,720
you can't interface counters which are
totally useful

586
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,670
you cap NetFlow records which are to
granular

587
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:01,920
and your cat s PLO records which I

588
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,290
statistical my you can s collect to be
precise

589
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:09,810
and on the other hand you only seen Matt
and I

590
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:14,319
be in our tables on the directly
connected switches

591
00:38:14,319 --> 00:38:17,490
you can see this method rest over here
on this which

592
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:21,870
sup it's hard to find information on the
network

593
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:26,240
it's hard to measure what it was
whatever you want to measure

594
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,270
now lacking in and is one of the group

595
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:33,400
things in the controller based networks
the controller should know everything

596
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,819
about the network after all that the
definition

597
00:38:36,819 --> 00:38:40,310
so you should be able to figure out
where individual IP addresses

598
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:43,810
mac Address s are entries and so on and
so on

599
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:49,490
are and there are controllers on the
market that can actually show you that

600
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:53,630
so if you have a data center fabric with
a few tens of switches

601
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:57,339
you can actually see in the controller
where

602
00:38:57,339 --> 00:39:00,830
individual Mac addresses are on which
switch

603
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:04,000
on which border which which because the
controller Kathy for this information

604
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,040
anyway

605
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,210
so of course you should ask yourself how
is that different from a decent network

606
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:12,410
management system

607
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:15,410
and I alway I always ask back

608
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:20,170
can your network management system do
that

609
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:23,530
usually the answer is from

610
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:26,690
next question please

611
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:31,190
though of course there there our
software solutions out there did do that

612
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:35,450
already my I hear so many networking

613
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:39,240
engineers complaining about this that
probably there

614
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:43,120
there aren't that many good solutions
out there

615
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,319
but is just a software problem up

616
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:49,810
second if you have the right hardware

617
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:54,540
and now we are coming back to the hard
work overflow is a great standard

618
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,589
and OpenFlow allows you in theory

619
00:39:57,589 --> 00:40:01,430
to do and enormous amount effects

620
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:05,609
like you can replace an MPLS tack with
veal and back

621
00:40:05,609 --> 00:40:10,859
and you can do destination port rewrite
while doing that

622
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:14,080
we can do anything you wish on any

623
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,960
cather feel in the whole

624
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,640
four layers of headers

625
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,530
unfortunately not a hardware

626
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:28,980
the hard work and do what this which
card work and you just because you

627
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,870
install a new softer and the switch

628
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:36,280
you won't get new park hopper
functionality from the switch

629
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,980
so the switch hard work and do with it
which I reckon do

630
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:43,810
and some Harbor ken

631
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:49,180
crowned packets associated with that the
camp entry

632
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:53,350
so it's basically its access-list per
line

633
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:56,500
counters only now

634
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,470
you can access them through OpenFlow so
what

635
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:04,080
you can do is you can install flow and
FreeSWITCH

636
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:09,490
all point to the same next hop or they
just point to normal processing

637
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:12,750
but the counters on those

638
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:15,900
entries increase and so you can measure

639
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,830
the traffic that matches this flow entry

640
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:23,520
K so it's not like NetFlow which is

641
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,819
every micro flow or s PLO which is
statistics

642
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:31,390
you can actually say I want to measure
this

643
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:35,430
and then you get the counters if your
hard work

644
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:39,109
support otherwise you will get

645
00:41:39,109 --> 00:41:42,240
zeros instead of the congress obvious

646
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,500
and people are using that

647
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:49,460
in and in idea solutions and i'll show
you how

648
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:53,260
before going there there's one other on

649
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,660
how many of you are doing %uh have built
aggregation that

650
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:00,890
aggregation networks in your data
centers

651
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:03,930
so you cap perhaps you can spend ports
now you need

652
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:07,190
do collect all that and bring that to
the central

653
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:11,069
monitoring or whatever tools

654
00:42:11,069 --> 00:42:14,280
and there is the company out there that
does

655
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,940
switches that are specifically designed
for it that allegation networks is

656
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,859
holding on

657
00:42:20,859 --> 00:42:25,880
at that bright orange color so you can
always spot them in the data center

658
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:32,880
and they have an excellent product which
is also a reassuringly expensive

659
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,230
turns out that that product that the
same thing

660
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:42,740
that any top of wrecks which with Martin
silicon could do

661
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:47,040
and this is where some top of rack
switch vendors have seen their

662
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,109
opportunity

663
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:52,880
why would you buy something that is
three times more expensive than my top

664
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,799
of wrecks which we've does the same
thing

665
00:42:56,799 --> 00:43:01,600
and now the the pro always watch how do
you configure this thing

666
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,239
and it was exit control list and
policy-based routing and who knows what

667
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:08,569
else and we are also sick and tired of
that

668
00:43:08,569 --> 00:43:13,310
and now you can use OpenFlow and the
beauty of OpenFlow is that you can

669
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:16,420
actually use the same ok location

670
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:20,489
two programs which is from multiple
vendors

671
00:43:20,489 --> 00:43:23,980
so you solve the problem once and then
if you don't like this we spend that you

672
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:24,529
can just

673
00:43:24,529 --> 00:43:27,779
replacing with someone else who cast

674
00:43:27,779 --> 00:43:31,310
approximately the same functionality

675
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:35,390
and just today someone sent me a link

676
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:39,270
to presentation at the Wireshark shark
best

677
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:42,410
where Microsoft is explaining how they
are doing

678
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:46,580
exactly this in their data center

679
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:49,609
using OpenFlow to program the that

680
00:43:49,609 --> 00:43:53,319
aggregation switches to get the track if
they want to see

681
00:43:53,319 --> 00:43:56,969
at a particular monitoring tool

682
00:43:56,969 --> 00:44:00,839
anti understood that presentation
correctly they even go as far as

683
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:05,450
using s flow to identify an ominous

684
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:09,390
and then the asked local actor with
trigger

685
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:14,279
the OpenFlow controller to install the
forwarding entry so that the start

686
00:44:14,279 --> 00:44:17,830
collecting the information about the
anomaly

687
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:21,850
how cool is that

688
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:25,690
for or instead of using spam ports

689
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:29,500
imagine that you could say is that I
spent ports

690
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,370
let's collect port eighty on this input
port

691
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:36,480
and back up traffic on that the input
port

692
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,450
and

693
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:42,760
and port 443 on that input board goat
but only if you go to a specific store

694
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:46,829
so instead of mirroring whole

695
00:44:46,829 --> 00:44:50,420
input port to an out with Borat we're
doing today with the span ports

696
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:53,599
you could install find you entries

697
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:57,420
granular entries saying I only want to
see this particular traffic

698
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:02,570
please mirror this thing and you can do
that's what with open flow and people

699
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:03,280
are doing

700
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,550
and the other thing that people are
doing

701
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:10,800
is scaling the IDS appliances

702
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,160
so you know if you have a pancake feed

703
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:18,920
I don't have to tell you that and you
have one gig appliances

704
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:23,339
you have a problem so

705
00:45:23,339 --> 00:45:27,280
of course the problem is easily solve
you use a regular switch

706
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,480
and you can't be there people drought
binding two or three appliances

707
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:36,320
and the traffic was somehow miraculously
be load balance across all appliances

708
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:40,650
the only problem is that you we usually
use piped up a load balancing which

709
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:43,300
means that the traffic from the same
source IP address

710
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,740
good and up a different appliances

711
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:50,819
so you don't have a whole picture of
what a single

712
00:45:50,819 --> 00:45:54,190
source IP address is doing and here

713
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:58,500
because you control the traffic
distribution through for example

714
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,619
OpenFlow

715
00:45:59,619 --> 00:46:03,480
you could say all the traffic from this
address range both

716
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,990
this supplier's all the traffic from
that address range both that appliance

717
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:10,720
and if one link becomes over congested
because someone is really doing

718
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,619
something stupid

719
00:46:11,619 --> 00:46:15,750
you figure out what traffic is coming
through that and then displayed that Inc

720
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:16,180
of

721
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:21,390
for example and there are people who
actually doing this

722
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:25,119
the for example I know that University
of Indiana has this in production

723
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:29,829
and the beauty of this is you are
actually doing this

724
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:33,410
after the span port so this which
doesn't have to be in the forwarding

725
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:33,810
path

726
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:37,060
you you've just you the spam for

727
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:40,310
on the forwarding path got all the
traffic and then you answered this week

728
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:41,569
to determine the traffic

729
00:46:41,569 --> 00:46:46,430
so this is totally off the forwarding
path it's not in production

730
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:52,670
sort of so you can you can play with
this and going one step further

731
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:56,869
was this appliances the Dec that
something is wrong

732
00:46:56,869 --> 00:47:00,410
they can isolate the flow information:
and

733
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:05,849
down the OpenFlow controller to drop
that clock and bro I D S

734
00:47:05,849 --> 00:47:12,010
actually as the model for that up for
those of you who don't know bro I D S

735
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:15,349
let me do a blog various a presentation

736
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:20,050
in like two hours in the other track
were one of the bro developers is

737
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:22,140
talking about what they're too is doing

738
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:26,619
honestly I don't use this tool because I
know nothing about security

739
00:47:26,619 --> 00:47:31,619
but security some security people are
we're excited about bro so go there

740
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:34,710
and listen to that stock now

741
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:38,270
the real question for our love you
should you care

742
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:41,720
baby now

743
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:45,640
concepts are interesting regardless of
what they think about the whole thing

744
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,619
and I think a lot of that is hype

745
00:47:47,619 --> 00:47:51,930
the concepts are valid and interesting
and the concepts

746
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:56,770
will change the way we do networking I
mean people disagree on that but they

747
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:57,400
will

748
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,540
maybe they will not change the routing
protocols they will not change the

749
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:02,109
forwarding

750
00:48:02,109 --> 00:48:06,280
paradigm but hopefully they will change
the way we deal with net worth because

751
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,790
the way we deal with them now

752
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:13,270
is stupid centralize computation and
some interaction with the management

753
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:13,910
plane

754
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:17,160
for me makes more sense than

755
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,300
centralized control plane particularly

756
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,780
in when networks you don't want to cast
central control plane in when

757
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:27,200
networks we've been there we've seen how
well that

758
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:31,210
a OpenFlow was because I

759
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:34,970
a few years ago and right now

760
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:40,930
is becoming quiet if people have
realized that is just a low level 2

761
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:46,520
is just this one small Swiss Army knife
that can do anything

762
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:53,300
but sometimes you just need a bigger
hammer know the Swiss Army knife and the

763
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,580
initial use cases

764
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:58,580
large data centers large clout operators

765
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:02,810
are already using all this concept
because otherwise that cannot survive

766
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:07,760
and some love this is not trickling down
to smaller

767
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:13,369
data centers and eventually we'll see
this concept in the enterprise networks

768
00:49:13,369 --> 00:49:16,740
the whole thing is still worry mature
it's only being

769
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:21,339
three-years-old standards are changing
ideas are changing solutions are

770
00:49:21,339 --> 00:49:22,450
changing

771
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:26,270
so this is not something that you can
buy tomorrow of

772
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:29,580
a price list of your favorite vendor
well maybe there with

773
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:32,640
try to sell it to me is a different
story I

774
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,680
and go and installed in your production
network

775
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:40,080
and it with just miraculously work we're
not there yet

776
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:44,460
but it's definitely something worth
considering

777
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:48,210
you have to figure out whether it fits
into your network

778
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:52,050
and you have to say okay it fits and I
will pursue this border

779
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:57,550
and see where it leads or it doesn't fit
and I revisit this decision in three

780
00:49:57,550 --> 00:49:59,380
years

781
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:02,420
but ignoring it

782
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:06,109
would be a good idea and

783
00:50:06,109 --> 00:50:09,580
this is no longer an academic exercise

784
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:13,380
there are commercial products out there
and for example NEC

785
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:17,040
as their program will flow which is the
data center fabric solution

786
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:21,000
and it's been shipping for three years
old

787
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,050
sup there are commercial products out
there that

788
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:28,270
aren't revision 0 got 1 anymore

789
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:31,710
now if you want to know more because its
obviously impossible to squeeze

790
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:36,240
everything in one hour on my website
there are a number of

791
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,960
as the and webinars and the ones that
are circled in red

792
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:44,080
are publicly available so you can just
go

793
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:48,180
and watch them or download them they're
all downloadable

794
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:52,130
and before videos and the best way to
get there

795
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:55,619
IP space but net slash as the N

796
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:59,670
can get easier and and if you have

797
