25
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,899
ahead lol tells you want to go

26
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:30,850

27
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,290
garages glass into the space

28
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:40,119
Yahoo Isles sold

29
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:41,790
okay

30
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,640
he emailed he's I

31
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,240
so sad we Hill yeah

32
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,390
yeah

33
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,180
but this is very important

34
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,250
done says bad leadership by

35
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,490
I have miscalculations I

36
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,730
existence in baths his

37
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,929
schools I place I'm

38
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:12,840
in the lab we all this is this so this
is world

39
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,239
the a.m.

40
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,319
what we have South I

41
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,780
bad

42
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,080
so nah he's intense

43
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,910
is then

44
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,350
more like this yeah always
miscalculations

45
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,950
is settings you there when he says
basses

46
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,730
yes that house there

47
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,010
to more from the buses s I

48
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,410
but will want to when the focus in last
year's stock

49
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,800
worse and actually which are the tracy's

50
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,830
that are any being left on this ABC
stencil

51
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,940
that information you're a have what
we're going to focus on the say

52
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,640
this year are some ways to try to avoid
this

53
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,940
on also the mitigation so

54
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,010
what's really important here I

55
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,530
after the slide is the fact that a sabc
stance are shipped by default with a lot

56
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,000
of

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,880
a tracing a on all the mechanisms some
of them

58
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,940
are not enabled by default I on

59
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,590
if if we know what we want to register
if we want to what they

60
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,880
the kind of logs are the kind of
activities that we want to have

61
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,840
to do to keep track of we need to
understand the company desire for each

62
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,720
one of these

63
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,510
mayes and features I we need to be able
to

64
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,060
a define that and enable them so what
you should happen sees

65
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,430
okay we've we go to SAP customers

66
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,510
and the tell us a you know what are

67
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,840
SAP systems were never hide we r super
secure

68
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,400
everything's fine okay so you have and

69
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,030
security a no you have gateway log you
have Tracy's

70
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,250
you had david says logging you have a
our physician

71
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,510
a user authorization and change document
so you

72
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:04,290
you have all these a in a move on the
sea stance on your reviewing it and you

73
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,329
have the process right

74
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:09,549
and on this is usually the the answer
soap

75
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:13,630
to to stress the fact that many of this
scene

76
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,269
things such as the security though are
not been able by default

77
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:21,479
so we need to no which I think about it
is on this ABC stands and we need to

78
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:22,140
know we'd

79
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,940
which other traces or the activities
that we want to keep track of

80
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,979
so

81
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:32,539
yet this is basically what I just said
described

82
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:36,539
and this is the anatomy of an attack
somehow

83
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:39,710
depending on the attack vector an
attacker's

84
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,120
able to break into any city system if
it's because a fun

85
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,900
is so the a violation it would be with a
buddy you sir

86
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,140
if it's because of a misconfiguration a
or

87
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,860
missing pots have already being
exploited a it's gonna be without

88
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,680
credentials

89
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,710
a sometimes many times and the attacker

90
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,349
East able to perform some some
activities on the system

91
00:05:02,349 --> 00:05:05,870
he was execute transaction access
information on

92
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,979
and maybe create a new user connect to a
different system

93
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:14,020
but if if the attacker is sent a bass
attacker

94
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,140
work the answer is going to try to do is
actually hi he strains

95
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:22,030
right because he doesn't want to be
discover if he wants to be

96
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,650
air be able to execute these over an
hour

97
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,380
so

98
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,270
definition on for Essex for you to have

99
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:37,930
and the so they the to questions that we
need to ask us

100
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,200
has my back from being hacked he said
being attacked right now

101
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,220
okay in order to acid those questions we
need to

102
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,890
understand the the logging couple we
need to solve this ABC since and we need

103
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:50,870
to understand if that

104
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:54,310
probably taking care of it so a

105
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,770
in distilled we're gonna focus on some
specific attacks

106
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:01,909
three of them are based on the security
audit long

107
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:05,140
a witch's if we talk about a.m.

108
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,530
Tracy not and locking mechanisms on SAP
systems

109
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,810
DC's they security a

110
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,130
though he may consider right so if you
want to have

111
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,789
im events being recorded in terms of
security

112
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:22,550
successful and xxx all executions of
transactions

113
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,229
no one attends a modification of you so
must the records

114
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:29,330
there are a bunch of events that can be
registered

115
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,979
DC's like the the the most important one
there are some other technique I was

116
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:37,349
so mad about more business-oriented but
this is the one

117
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:42,120
that this is the starting point okay so
these that the first thing that we need

118
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,659
to hop

119
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:46,130
and you seen by using the security lead
No

120
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:50,490
which is a oil you can see there the
transactions S and 90 minutes and 22 to

121
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,120
use and

122
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,860
to coffee and to display there are a
bunch of

123
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,320
events this are just the most common
ones I

124
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,399
with each new a SAP NetWeaver release

125
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,050
which you with each new bash on you will
have a new events

126
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,190
so the then you are they they

127
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,370
SAP system they better in terms of
security

128
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:16,690
or in terms of they quality of the even
said we want to

129
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:20,469
and register so if you are talking about
the 7.4 for example

130
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:23,630
you will have much more events done and
7.2

131
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,330
for example which is good so we need to
keep that in mind because we would have

132
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:27,690
a

133
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:31,649
a more complete and regular

134
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:35,649
and a in terms of their a constructor

135
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:38,830
am maybe this is also something and

136
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,039
probably very known form many of you

137
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:45,680
its configure through filters there are
some printers that are

138
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,849
a restarted like this study fetus are
the ones are taking place when you

139
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:51,060
restore the system

140
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,339
then you have the namic filters a all
that can be

141
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:58,460
and modified like you can increase the
number of fantastic on

142
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:03,300
interested if it is to use s clients and
this is the kind of information that

143
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,789
you will have and now there the Matt

144
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:10,630
thats interesting information specially
in the end

145
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:16,370
so why did they remind this events
identify Inter Milan because we're gonna

146
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,349
it took about some attacks especially a
affecting those

147
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:24,000
though say fields so

148
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,610
let's go to the to them us so first the
full

149
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,099
delete security audit log messages I
want to

150
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:35,070
it to clarify something in this in this
essense

151
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,279
if there is an attacker who is able to
a.m.

152
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:43,159
compromise the system see if someone has
Supaul aqui una British is

153
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:47,089
then if the logs are store the
navigation sever

154
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:50,110
you don't have any any a.m.

155
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:54,500
trace LED of anything right they that
second will be able to modify

156
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,020
the lead records access database modify
the database

157
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:02,180
so if the if they records are on the
implications are not sent

158
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,560
to an extend the system if an attacker
is able to

159
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,610
gets up oil equivalent then a

160
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,620
you cannot rely on any of the locks

161
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:16,570
so that's that's the the the first the
starting point

162
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:21,940
so a secured another event are shown
through transection SM to any

163
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,990
so what happens is that if someone
sunrise a

164
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,270
their records mean JDR the events he
will

165
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,700
axis transaction SM to any typically

166
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,930
on only a you can reread the A&L the
dough for all the different application

167
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,200
servers and access information

168
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,950
so that's it they use activity or their
incorrect don't dance

169
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,990
any of the events that there is
something which is used

170
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,060
in order to percent this event to the
name

171
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,830
to use a right so this is gave you can
see this as a template

172
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:58,180
right because a actually they
incorrectly on a tent

173
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,410
it's not the same in English done in
German

174
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,560
done in spanish 19 other languages right
so

175
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,860
you have templates to show this this
information in different languages

176
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,839
this template's are store in that table
TSL

177
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,269
1d on the the program

178
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:23,370
less that you so with only authorization
it to the transection anti-coal

179
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:28,420
SAS e92 is able to the lead this message
is

180
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,140
so this out the templates that are being
used in order to press send information

181
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:32,839
to this

182
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:35,920
to you sir these is resulting

183
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,700
on the in the message is not been shown
any more

184
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,860
so the they the events are disappearing
for the

185
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,279
for the use of from the suspect but the
only with

186
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:49,649
transaction authorization no other
authorization is required

187
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:54,130
a like the anything I S and there is no
progress

188
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,660
and this was reported recipe on is it be
reset

189
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,210
security not pair fixing this issue also

190
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,880
air I really question to to take on you
ceased and see if that

191
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,560
ASAP know these actually implemented

192
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,360
so what's the outcome and the impact of
these

193
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:18,060
the outcome is that any nope inish you
sir good delete security love messages

194
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,910
and those messages a I'm not going to be
shown any more to assist

195
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:25,270
so 8 a.m. the attacker maybe

196
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:29,340
is interesting and not being able to and

197
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:33,050
have transection start report starts
successful

198
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,830
are even and successful in buddy Lohan
attends any of those

199
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:40,000
security i kno messages could be deleted
on

200
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,270
a no one would ever notice that just he
won't

201
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:48,470
he won't see their their results yep

202
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,290
said

203
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:55,980
yeah it is still a in the finest in
there but if you up if you try to access

204
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,520
the

205
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:00,530
the record it's not gonna be some yeah
that's a that's a good buy

206
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:05,030
and so that you have from from the USS
bite the hand and the on

207
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:08,070
any attack and we're gonna show

208
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:11,400
and what they say said the so the
entries a

209
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,410
if you go to it they table TSL 1d

210
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:19,300
and you have all the information a.m.
for different messages

211
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,950
depending on the on their language and
everything so that's what you can

212
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:29,950
actually let's see a quick demo

213
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:37,160
in am thing to do with this one

214
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,510
yeah I'm going to move forward this is
not an nine minutes

215
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,370
a them all for sure and I'm I'm going to
move far for

216
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:47,700
to to go ahead but basically

217
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,880
on these them all and the the user

218
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,290
was created with only and decal

219
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:57,870
out they say shown so the you sir

220
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:01,460
then what this is all showing the Delta
stations and everything

221
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:04,900
these are axis is the surrounding to the
system axion

222
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,950
transection s e92 its choose the message

223
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:12,900
actually it was said to be tricky
because the this was the the system used

224
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,270
to actually a this government is the 1i
read so

225
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:19,780
a lot of them is this is where the media
say the study thing to find one that

226
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:23,330
there were still there air so the
eight-day

227
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:27,470
you sir just blew the lead actually to
the the name

228
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:32,340
the missus and the leading on that's
that's all he needs

229
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,700
then ok this is important

230
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:40,410
so if we go to this into any

231
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,450
to see the the events being reduced to

232
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:47,020
we have a

233
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,170
sick what we have though seven events

234
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,470
right you sir a seed block lot

235
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,940
on client on this client then

236
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:03,110
if we move forward actually and there's
a requirement for this to take place is

237
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,650
today application server needs to be
restarted so that I can eat so

238
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:10,070
wait for a for an application server
restart

239
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:14,250
then if you go back well maybe I think
it's

240
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:18,630
close to the end once the application
server West we started

241
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:22,910
if you try to axes the same information

242
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:26,020
the only thing you will see are they

243
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:29,580
all the rest of the events without they
day you sir

244
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,820
the other yourself being locked on the
application server stopped and started

245
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,940
again

246
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:39,290
so and that's the the resulting of the
say

247
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:43,510
attack is that the you sir if air
security on the stator

248
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:50,510
is going to analyze the logs he's not
gonna see them

249
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,190
so countermeasures implements up
security note a

250
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,340
which was released in the summer 2013

251
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,410
on a restrict as develop authorizations

252
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:03,870
so basically in order to they fix when I
CPUs

253
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:08,810
in order to the lead these you need to
have s develop other stations

254
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:12,060
so if the cyst is supple he can do that

255
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:16,340
but we need to understand the that the
starting point for all these

256
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:19,490
is that if a user has high positions on
the system

257
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:23,720
and then ok so they are he candidly
deluxe he can temper deluxe modify

258
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,250
delete whatever he wants

259
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:29,550
so that's that's something we need to
understand if if a user has some poor

260
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:33,760
is the meetup or any other equivalent
keep could still be able to

261
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,279
to execute something and

262
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,310
so attack number two I

263
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,580
this essay kinda far fun attack

264
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,320
and because its related with a
configuration actually

265
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,800
to get there is no defense a have a
unique field for the source

266
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,330
that you will see asset a state asset
tell me no name

267
00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:00,240
that something that East defining the
source of the at that

268
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,750
by the full the the it the application
server makes a best-effort

269
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:08,670
meaning that if the 10 min a name was
provided to the youth to they

270
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,790
application server the terminal name is
going to be used

271
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,910
if byee any means there te mando

272
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:18,970
is not provided our West not retreat by
the application server

273
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:22,760
to begin so is gonna use did a IPS

274
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,930
so it could be that for some immense you
have the terminal name

275
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:31,220
but for some other issue may have IPSS
right

276
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:35,070
so demand name data is provided by the
client

277
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:38,810
so it's something that is going in the
connection packets

278
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:42,190
right so it's something that's minus by
the client

279
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:47,400
actually if you want to read with rail
are SAP tools such as a sub we

280
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,860
and you need to change the name postname
and thats

281
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:55,110
they were what's gonna be bride by if
you can first the packages

282
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:59,790
that set piece of information that can
go through the wire

283
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:04,370
so happen is that we can provide an IP
address instead of a terminal name we

284
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:04,980
can

285
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:09,689
we can actually provide any name right
we can force any cost them or whatever

286
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:13,579
but if we provide a and I the other
thing still fat Eminem name

287
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:17,709
there is no difference between a really
PRS and the one that we have provided

288
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:21,630
right so there is no way to

289
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:24,809
identify if the APRs less takin

290
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:28,750
from the got a source of the connection
are from there

291
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,529
a data provided by EU ser

292
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:35,600
so what what does it means

293
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,860
this means that this source of any

294
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,549
unauthenticated connection to secure
their know cannot be trusted

295
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:45,830
on not only an authenticated but I think
again also so

296
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,070
a I made this dish out here because even

297
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,700
and remote say a connection attempt they
care

298
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,659
if you want to brute force the system
it's something that also can be

299
00:17:56,659 --> 00:18:01,159
can be used to to perform a brute-force
this system

300
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:05,480
it so they can but these complete
underneath me on this source of the

301
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,169
attack

302
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:09,590
so if there is something a with this
which is

303
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:13,110
out indicated and they use s going east

304
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,380
still gonna be there the client is still
going to be there that it is not be the

305
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:16,960
same

306
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,059
the Prime is gonna be this source there
is no

307
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:23,490
way to a buddy date if the IP address

308
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:27,590
EC a deputy serve the initiating
connection or if it's something Friday

309
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,120
by the user

310
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,529
so there is a book by meter which is
called

311
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:36,289
SL slash I piani that before by meter

312
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:39,510
he sexually it by default is this a will

313
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:43,049
so these this behavior is completely
possible

314
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:46,399
but a if you enable these preferred by
meter

315
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:49,490
this always gonna be an IP address

316
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:54,230
on the terminal name are on the timing I
feel

317
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:58,080
so the yeah this is what I what I just

318
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,090
told you about the time your name so you
can see there

319
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:04,330
the the Terminator reviews not sexually

320
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:07,710
the hostname and then all the different
a

321
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:10,779
pieces of information that are paying
also store

322
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:15,870
for each is a cutie Lily went and so
that's that's a.m.

323
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:18,960
and general screenshot

324
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,929
but let's go to C&M of these

325
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:26,929
actually for this demo we used a
Martinez said Larry

326
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:27,480
and

327
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,030
the that peace out there library so
which was very handy

328
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,960
and

329
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:40,960
its yes these

330
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,940
so they they use ur

331
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:50,710
is connecting to assist them and there
is a

332
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:54,280
anybody lone attempt and you will

333
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,309
this is sick on their long to actually
see their their

334
00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:02,270
the locks right so if you go on and see
they'll also K

335
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:07,860
there is a restriction on time you sir
but if you want to see the logs

336
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,980
you will see that

337
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,669
termino de stem one I thats thats

338
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:18,080
the host name of the system because it
was a

339
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,610
lect connection right so it was
something to do with it

340
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:26,450
with its a boy so they said we took the
hostname and use the tin

341
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,460
within the packet and send it to
publications are

342
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,200
but then and using this library

343
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,580
and we can forge a packet which is

344
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:40,630
actually and and no one attempt I think

345
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:46,500
here with a with this same you sir but
instead of providing the terminal name

346
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,820
its priding and and APIs

347
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,860
which is not the same as a pianist and
then they that

348
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,400
of the you so they say cheap executing
the they exploit

349
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,429
so if we hit play

350
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:07,179
the the bug in the West generated it
sent on there should be

351
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:10,340
lol JD here for that

352
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,409
I we will see that

353
00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:16,530
the in in the terminal name this an IP
address

354
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:20,710
that's that's the outcome of all this

355
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:24,020
there there's no way to the term I know
or two

356
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:28,320
actually be 100 percent sure that that
IPOs West actually

357
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:34,780
they won of the initiator of the
connections well

358
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:41,030
so

359
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:45,370
on yep the recommendation this

360
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,230
say in the census to in a way that
prefer barometer

361
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:53,110
to be able to have something which East
not

362
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:58,210
a something that day you sir or someone
come for sure write something that

363
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:02,919
is taken from the a connection itself
which is this source of the connection

364
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:07,510
air for the city said a something out
which is actually detaining

365
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:11,659
for which say can a better chance it's a
applicable on and

366
00:22:11,659 --> 00:22:15,490
I know the details so I request you to
take a look at the not

367
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:18,570
chip

368
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:25,570
yeah

369
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,049
and nope

370
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:35,480
a I'm not okay let we have to see if
it's gonna try an error but for sure

371
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,990
is not gonna take the idea is that you
send is gonna take the APIs

372
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:44,600
of the the source of the connection
sewed

373
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:49,440
world

374
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,720
want II know if I get the your question

375
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,289
up them

376
00:22:56,289 --> 00:22:59,379
cool

377
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:06,379
nope

378
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,590
them

379
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:12,010
up

380
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,300
man

381
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:20,380
school who no

382
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,980
hip mmm most likely no

383
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,750
I haven't tried that but most likely
know that this gonna be a change in the

384
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,690
behavior of this a division server

385
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:32,750
there could be some some improvements

386
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,860
air from the SABC either definitely

387
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:40,360
but at least with this proprietary are
rare restricting the attack so

388
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,490
you're sick it yes secure from these
from that standpoint by then there could

389
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,820
be some improvements like

390
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,840
and rigid rejecting the connection if in
the time you name it this and I'd be

391
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,120
either so thing that

392
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,690
but thats really something very internal
from this a beeper no cause I don't know

393
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:57,210
how

394
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:00,480
how those burgers are expected to to
behave really

395
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,670
any other question

396
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:06,880
so

397
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,050
their third attack is

398
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:13,490
actually something that brawny many of
you are a no

399
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:16,570
and especially those of you who are in
the

400
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:19,580
SAP security community we all know

401
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:23,060
what's what happens we're a with a SAP

402
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:27,140
the security lead know when it's when
their always he said he needs

403
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:31,090
I want what happened actually maybe you
can answer what have been see there's a

404
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:31,960
cute lol

405
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,020
reached they really need of in of seis

406
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:38,380
for the fis okay

407
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,780
thank you and yes air

408
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,100
yeah it stop slugging okay so

409
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,650
it by default its 100 megabytes but

410
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:52,940
you can define a whatever limit you want
the thing is that mean

411
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:56,670
it might sound a.m. strange if you think

412
00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:01,120
about the security lead No reaching the
limit and stop loving right

413
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,070
something going but actually it's not
that bad because

414
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,680
your in the security really something
you need to rely on

415
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:13,150
so if there are only two two options if
you define a lenient

416
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:17,540
there are only two options to behavior
in terms of a

417
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,790
what to do be there stop slonim

418
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:24,620
or starts from the bottom right other
writing the the name

419
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,630
there they need their first event

420
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:31,790
so we need to rely on the style so
that's why I think for

421
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,990
from from my opinion that's not an
option because

422
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:38,040
a Mueller you're gonna be overriding

423
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,330
things if if the need is treated so
that's why

424
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:45,440
it it is really important to understand
and

425
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,560
the the actual number of events are
going to be generated in our system in

426
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,550
order to properly defined this limit

427
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:57,580
I want just to describe the SETAC limits
are the fine for security

428
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,990
no in town and they all rights and

429
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,170
I'm Verde so there's a limit per day
right

430
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:08,160
before the KBR he say it stop snowing

431
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:12,130
okay so no other security events going
to be generated a three-year

432
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:15,630
and and some

433
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:19,010
it some events depending on how the
fetus are configured can be

434
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:22,230
changer remotely on an authenticated it
right so

435
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:26,750
and incorrect on a temp he's definitely
generating an event

436
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:30,430
and coming together with other being
authenticated just with access the

437
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:30,950
system

438
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:34,030
and it's only fun attacker knows

439
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:37,710
or guess he he can guess which are the

440
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:41,540
filters that are in place and try to
reach the limit

441
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:46,390
to avoid being detected afterwards so

442
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:50,670
okay what's the outcome of these

443
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:54,440
if fan I don't think it did you sir can

444
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,100
somehow know we which %uh the fetus

445
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,710
that are in place and even on actually

446
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:05,330
authenticated user can also do things to
feel loved lol

447
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:08,470
and but and authenticated user is like

448
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:13,650
more its it's a actually you set up into
getting the system so you can go on say

449
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:17,280
a what's happening here but they they
must really nothing a

450
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,750
one is the and authenticate the right so
the impact

451
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,480
East that if this attack US is performed
if they

452
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,390
to go the Aledo was not properly
measured then

453
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:33,100
the limit can be reached on no other
event is going to be denied

454
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,390
and and that's the

455
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:40,070
capture of them enemy after the Midwest
reached

456
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:44,940
and and I have a very we'd be there for
you

457
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:51,940
term so

458
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,750
we have a secured only naval

459
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,860
on the system on what's

460
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:03,150
we are gonna do is we're gonna see that
the limit is very close to be reached

461
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:06,170
and they say you know warning in the SM
to any a

462
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:09,750
s in nineteen and thats is telling us

463
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:13,120
hey nuke really need is gonna be reached

464
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,480
a very soon that's a yellow in the
status

465
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,770
a everything is being logged we want to
reach that he needed those who want to

466
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,040
this mr.

467
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,570
but no to that a what within this

468
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:28,740
we while we executed some in buddy Lohan
attends

469
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,560
which are actually I'll but we executed
and discreet

470
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:36,140
that is continuously and trying to
launch a system

471
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:39,910
with in playing buddy contentious so
that we know that and thats

472
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:45,550
generating UN's and so if you go to
listen to any and take a look at the

473
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,580
events

474
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:50,170
you will be able to see and events

475
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:53,429
okay yet anybody Lohan attends
everywhere because thats what we're

476
00:28:53,429 --> 00:28:54,780
doing

477
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:58,610
with it use a hiker on the attacker the
one that we just read it

478
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:03,760
is there so it's loading them so by the
end of this be the law

479
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,700
we have it think the the execution of
this great here

480
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,490
this is great being executed their so

481
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:14,670
if we were to second but not just after

482
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,320
some time off welfare executing this
creep

483
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,080
it's still running cicada though he's
very close to

484
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,780
to finish yeah okay

485
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:31,010
let me see if

486
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:38,010
prolly here

487
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:47,010
but there's something with the media
yeah

488
00:29:48,309 --> 00:29:50,899
okay the limit was reached so

489
00:29:50,899 --> 00:29:54,109
hopefully and for the attacker

490
00:29:54,109 --> 00:29:57,190
there is no a you even mean

491
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:00,749
recording right so no new sick you don't
know

492
00:30:00,749 --> 00:30:04,229
a registered as being saving system so
we three-year

493
00:30:04,229 --> 00:30:08,169
I knew a in by the lone attempt
connected to

494
00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:11,700
deceased them SM to any and a

495
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,609
if we go to listen to any will see that
the snow the last

496
00:30:15,609 --> 00:30:18,700
know an attempt was not actually because
so that's

497
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,830
the outcome of this get the the last

498
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:26,869
and don't let them play with you sir I
think this attacker hiker something that

499
00:30:26,869 --> 00:30:29,999
was not regarded so that's

500
00:30:29,999 --> 00:30:33,849
that's ill on the outcome of this the
less the doc

501
00:30:33,849 --> 00:30:38,499
I recommendation what there is no

502
00:30:38,499 --> 00:30:42,019
this this is how I for from my opinion

503
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:45,259
there are no many things that we can do
here because

504
00:30:45,259 --> 00:30:48,519
either if you they finally meet in there
you

505
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:51,859
start or writing or you stop loving and

506
00:30:51,859 --> 00:30:55,659
you need to rely on the so you need to
the finally meet

507
00:30:55,659 --> 00:30:58,729
that he's suitable for your
implementation that he's

508
00:30:58,729 --> 00:31:03,080
and defined according to the number of
this year XD registering

509
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:07,970
and that the need should never be
reached and on

510
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:11,590
yeah definitely send alerts to an
external system

511
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:14,909
so I avoid and living there they

512
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:19,179
events in the Application Server Oni so

513
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:24,090
and there's another attack that was
going to described so

514
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,419
is up the

515
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:31,669
are today to store the 80 S which is
basically syriza tables at store our

516
00:31:31,669 --> 00:31:32,349
advance

517
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:37,029
I but it turns out there's a gap between
when an event occurs when actually

518
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:40,580
reaches the 80 s and so this is from the
administrator guy basically explaining

519
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,059
about

520
00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:45,330
in the first step in action will be
performed so lets a user logs in

521
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:49,669
that actual that is written to a
temporary file a naughty

522
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:53,799
and they're not a toy is asking all
parties it's going hey do you have any

523
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:54,409
events

524
00:31:54,409 --> 00:31:57,649
the you want to store if the quality
will and send them

525
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:01,499
thought it or say hey I got them and the
temporary file be deleted

526
00:32:01,499 --> 00:32:05,049
that there's this when there where the
the

527
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:08,909
event in 15 the temporary file but it
hasn't been written to the 80 S

528
00:32:08,909 --> 00:32:15,909
so in a show quick them

529
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:30,770
you

530
00:32:32,579 --> 00:32:37,750
ship

531
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:41,510
I up so this is the there's just from
the same say to show it off really

532
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,180
quickly

533
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:45,220
I it's kinda hard to see cuz the Codex
all messed up in our

534
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:48,840
you can see here 180 seconds is the
default now

535
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:53,100
so that's the default timing between
when the audit or SAT so that's three

536
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,040
minute window

537
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:58,070
but it depends on the utilization rates
at the utilization goes up not a

538
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,400
tutorial actually wait

539
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,240
and it can be up to 20 minutes before
the audit or actually gets ass or

540
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:10,240
titties

541
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,570
I'm never gonna show so this is the
guest I D and this is CAD for the guests

542
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:16,970
0

543
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:23,970
this work on a planned second I know
analog ants on a log into the same say

544
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:27,710
an attacker could do this they login as
administrator

545
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:31,320
its gonna show that hey logged in as
administrator

546
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,910
so what happens on RT the CMC side

547
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:39,260
is a race a little temporary file in
temporary files there

548
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:42,890
so hard to read in this but as a syriza
pantries

549
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:47,060
by the most important one is this 1014
which says a log on

550
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:50,410
in the restive it is information about
the actual %ah gonna that

551
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:53,950
for the attacker can do is they can take
the C idea of

552
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:57,450
whomever and actually replace it within
the temporary file

553
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:01,150
so this is a administer the logged in
but we're gonna make it look like the

554
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:01,610
guest

555
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:04,810
logged in so over a temporary file

556
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:11,710
a series a time passes so I'm at the
skipper had the video a little bit

557
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,409
because

558
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:15,700
we're waiting for the auditory ass
authorities have has advance

559
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:22,700
so you'll see that the size the top
files gonna change 20 killed by so that

560
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:25,500
means that

561
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:29,250
the oddity is reported to defense it's
deleted the file

562
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:36,250
and now it's made it onto the actual 80
s side

563
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:55,589
even videos failing us on had area

564
00:34:55,589 --> 00:35:00,660
okay so that's that's the 0 so this is
the 80 s here we're just using a single

565
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,670
studio to

566
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:05,109
you know to actually query it and see
what the last login was

567
00:35:05,109 --> 00:35:09,059
so this query is asking who was the last
person actually log into the system

568
00:35:09,059 --> 00:35:12,190
and it should say administrator but what
it's gonna say is gas

569
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:19,190
self the gas was the last person login
according to the 80 S

570
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:26,289
and the 80 S is like that that this
central information so people are

571
00:35:26,289 --> 00:35:28,420
running reports based on the 80 S

572
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:35,420
so again is just sore summarizing the
attack I do the architecture

573
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:42,529
business objects is built to be
distributed Nats Way built in this order

574
00:35:42,529 --> 00:35:45,920
time delay aspect to it provides the
actor at

575
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,059
the act the attacker the opportunity to
modify the event

576
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:52,369
they could delete the event thing do
whatever they want and there's really no

577
00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:54,700
integrity check on a temporary files
themselves

578
00:35:54,700 --> 00:36:00,819
so I the impact is any user a filesystem
actors access to an oddity could delete

579
00:36:00,819 --> 00:36:02,029
the temporary logs

580
00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:05,969
terms of countermeasures

581
00:36:05,969 --> 00:36:09,729
protecting temporary file so we can mean
obviously you don't want somebody

582
00:36:09,729 --> 00:36:14,049
compromising naughty at that the file
system level so I'll be important one

583
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:18,809
the other one is correlating events so
the attackers to do that really quickly

584
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:21,519
right so there may actually be gaps in
what they're trying to do

585
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:25,339
for instance they may change the login
but Ferguson forget to change the

586
00:36:25,339 --> 00:36:26,069
lockout

587
00:36:26,069 --> 00:36:30,079
or forget to change when a report is
generated so by correlating the events

588
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,369
together into a time line

589
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:38,369
in actually highlight something that may
have happened

590
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,559
okay

591
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:45,999
with the presentation some other a
information that

592
00:36:45,999 --> 00:36:50,179
I think it's very hand the any in order
to

593
00:36:50,179 --> 00:36:54,819
having all summer ice in the same place
is the location of the locks and traces

594
00:36:54,819 --> 00:36:59,329
it so there are some there and in love
and Tracy in

595
00:36:59,329 --> 00:37:02,709
features or company dis in this ABC
stands there are many

596
00:37:02,709 --> 00:37:05,829
some technique are some
business-oriented some

597
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:09,029
are part of the day though a so I such
essay

598
00:37:09,029 --> 00:37:12,669
tables in the database and many other
surf ice on the five system

599
00:37:12,669 --> 00:37:15,799
so all the say look some traces

600
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:19,029
should be secured in order to avoid a

601
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:22,169
anyone being able to tamper with the so
on that

602
00:37:22,169 --> 00:37:25,949
access to these files axis tables should
be secure arrested

603
00:37:25,949 --> 00:37:30,589
so some recommendations on concussions

604
00:37:30,589 --> 00:37:33,769
in April lonely and Tracy mechanisms
according to

605
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:37,929
to your requirement enable

606
00:37:37,929 --> 00:37:41,929
technical Oaks to not on E change
documents not

607
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:46,079
only the business oriented but also the
technical ones a gateway laurin

608
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,659
all the traces system low so that there
are different the

609
00:37:49,659 --> 00:37:53,640
their facilities said the Los to a
central I say

610
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:58,549
facility in order to avoid anyone
compromise in the system and the leading

611
00:37:58,549 --> 00:38:00,970
locally the leading the they

612
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:04,460
name events periodically review all logs

613
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:10,260
makes no sense to have a a buncha and
big amount of logs and

614
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:14,210
and activity and traces if no one's
actually looking at those

615
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:18,320
it implement and Isis

616
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,070
very important a where we have been and

617
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:25,599
looking at or listening to a lot of
different talks

618
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,820
and seize the day starting off the
morning

619
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:32,720
I love different SAP security notes were
described

620
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,849
a we need to catch up with but she's 22

621
00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:39,260
update résistance we need to and be

622
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:42,330
aware of the difference up security no
sir are being named

623
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:45,900
it fixed ASAP released and we need to
implement them

624
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:51,650
on time and secure their preferred by me
just on the configurations the SIS

625
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:55,849
mainly related to to the IP hairstyle I
P only but not not

626
00:38:55,849 --> 00:38:59,890
focus only on that all the
configurations on this ABC stands

627
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:03,220
can be very complex II should be taken
care of properly

628
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:06,810
I F I know you perform a promise I seen

629
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:10,190
above the law and tracing mechanisms
because a

630
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:14,070
we need to these otherwise we're gonna
reach really need for some of the

631
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,200
company de San

632
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,030
we're gonna miss a lot of events so some

633
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:23,230
some concussions at it is important to
understand the needs

634
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:27,210
I think I i said the say a couple of
times I'm not gonna get tired of playing

635
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:27,770
these

636
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:31,970
you need to understand that this eat a
feature it's a

637
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:36,030
logging and tracing capabilities a house
its own limitations

638
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:39,390
locations and we need to understand what
we are

639
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:42,410
enabling and what we are relying on

640
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:45,790
and if there is some ball a requirement

641
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,980
there we cannot rely anymore on the
local

642
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:52,369
and also or traces I

643
00:39:52,369 --> 00:39:55,400
yeah definitely we we can never be sure

644
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,250
if a system was actually comprised I'm
not if we don't have the proper

645
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:03,430
a track of the activities a I think
aidid and

646
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:06,859
on authenticate some references

647
00:40:06,859 --> 00:40:10,310
and for the security are they %uh they
do know the

648
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:13,780
some name lay a reference to their
previous dark

649
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:17,690
some some SAP security notes on some
special things to

650
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:22,190
there so they autopsy say team that was
helping us with a

651
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:26,800
and Satio our home was the first they
want to discover one of the

652
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,839
the subjugate denounce now whether some
recording on Alex or on the the probe

653
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:32,720
Asha actually

654
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,260
came out with with one of these attacks
so it's a

655
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:39,280
and its actually a teamwork so

656
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:46,280
any questions yep

657
00:40:55,939 --> 00:40:56,380
min

658
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:00,249
min

659
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,749
good

660
00:41:01,749 --> 00:41:05,000
I yen

661
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,630
know it in the CSS I had to

662
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:11,790
a point you to the subsequent denote you
will have a all the information they are

663
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:15,020
a what I know of of this is that SAP

664
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:18,300
restricted the execution of these and
they didn't

665
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,910
deletion of their messages through its
develop I know

666
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:24,910
how how the the restriction was such a
pair from

667
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:29,540
in terms of fields a but I really in
question to take a look at the note

668
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:33,869
for this information any other question

669
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:40,630
okay

670
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:44,070
