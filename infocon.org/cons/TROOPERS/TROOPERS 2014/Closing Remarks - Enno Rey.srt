14
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:39,690
lot of time

15
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:46,690
the

16
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,040

say logistics organization other

23
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:35,410
things fossa please collect your
certificate the one

24
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:38,570

00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,410
arm plus Picasa please approach

28
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,959
played here in case you are up a
transfer saga rearranged

29
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,660
not yet arranged marking your calendar

30
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,760
everybody this is the date of two of us
the planned date of two of us

31
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,870
2015 same week like this just shifted by
one day

32
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:11,510
evidently I mean does I could do the
prime factorization of free

33
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:15,739
65 now but term II was kept that

34
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:20,620
a let me be might have somewhat I have
the idea of

35
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,660
a for next year's tour bus to include
something like a challenge on prime

36
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,630
factorization on on powers of two

37
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,490
are we'll have to figure that mark this
date

38
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,840
some stats two-plus 14

39
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,930
GSM thats ideas and they walk

40
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:42,710
consisting of %uh to base station said
those were mainly idling

41
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,330
I everybody a could connect to you make

42
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,690
didn't bowl well now on that won't heal
them a dawat

43
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,380
I'll made aware that

44
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,060
traffic was on a trip that which could
happen in real GSM networks

45
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,380
as well in certain parts of the world
and you you're not made about the app

46
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,080
22.6 subscribers connected to it

47
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,240
adjuster because it had the best signal
in some parts of the building

48
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,810
a number of us the text message it was
sent

49
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:17,470
just by replying you could have got into
open and there was a metallic and show I

50
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:23,830
where you kid could get additional
tokens interestingly

51
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,620
that there was a nombre are look at this
this gives an idea how into

52
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,890
actually I'm very happy to see this how
international to a process

53
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:36,310
I i mean okay they are so you'd show up
offering of the subscribers from Germany

54
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,890
ourselves from all parts of the Walt on

55
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:44,110
I mean there were some maybe not
represented here but

56
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,849
%ah most part of the what a including

57
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:50,909
I even Africa I'll

58
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:54,599
well on there is a special relationship

59
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:59,200
of my family and to of troopers with
Africa obviously given we

60
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,229
we on a this money is for South Sudan

61
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:07,820
put you in a cheer camp a cell phone
when does this was a bit surprising for

62
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,919
us submit interesting that the

63
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,950
the highest numbers I'll some song and
devices which

64
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:19,190
reflect see it a kind of thats you can
find everywhere still we had expect that

65
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:23,740
i in particular I i mean in the ipv6
network we saw a lot of

66
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,180
a on and DNS staff

67
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,150
on Google crap as I call it um

68
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,950
saliva from that angle I wouldn't expect
that

69
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:39,490
to the highest number on on the

70
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,919
Knepper delight us which is not a case
some

71
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:46,300
you can get this info if you want term
for

72
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,560
any type of way such officer 26 next

73
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,659
packet loss from what I hear

74
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:58,200
I went to bed early I'm I am are have a

75
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,490
reach a certain age but some are

76
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:07,130
for packing why was a blast from what I
hot and this is an integral part of a

77
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:13,349
this must be a troop us us theoretical
and practical and to pack it was provide

78
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:13,830
some

79
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:17,620
practical element I had it all off for
second

80
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,839
to you brian yes a second more I know
between us and the rest the day so

81
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,380
yes we had great battles last night um
the

82
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,089
the yarn double team there and the games
did great and I'm

83
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:32,839
our scenario this year was a really this
nefarious

84
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:36,779
organization called the GSA who's been
spying on the peoples of the world

85
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:39,880
arms or pack or urs united to

86
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,460
to take back the privacy section 11

87
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,490
but absolutely um

88
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,969
this was out this marked a couple
different the things we

89
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,110
we finished on time we start on time to
finish on time

90
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:58,050
you know first and we had six teams
they're here with their team captains

91
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:03,060
I team we own you up square roots who
have played many years

92
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,159
DMSO ER W Rookie Team a green power

93
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:12,810
a and the rookies a who will be from a
company unnamed

94
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,380
so it this year we owe so dance the
slide

95
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,580
a two-way tie for third place

96
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,909
could see these guys appear so they did
very good everybody did very

97
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:27,930
very well the battles were 30 minutes
apiece these are very fast tax

98
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:32,240
with lots of intricacies so it's it is a
challenge regardless of your

99
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,210
level of skill a we had a three way tie
for second place

100
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,440
and you know I expect square roots be
back next year

101
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,470
I'm sure they don't like displacing but
everybody did really well and I think it

102
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,790
also shows the level of competition

103
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,890
so you don't have to be a hacker a
mathematician or be able to

104
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:55,890
to prime numbers in your head to figure
out to

105
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:00,670
who actually won and by God it's good
that they did with a name like her we

106
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,200
own you

107
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,450
so if i if i could get him to come down
here see you guys can all give around

108
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,430
applause

109
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:13,430
this is the actual scoring

110
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:21,139
course they're apparently top

111
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,760
and notice battle 3 was underscored in
this was really where we beat the GSA at

112
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,530
their own game so

113
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:34,270
it's a stalemate but we need to do
better maybe next year but they did

114
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,340
great this year so

115
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,590
just congratulations and now we've got
some swag for you

116
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:43,640
and of course we expect you back next
two to fend era

117
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,920
and we'll see you in Dayton on that are
you

118
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,160
seen congratulations great job

119
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,980
and I hope everybody who played had a
good time in and possibly learn

120
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,910
something cuz that's really what it's
all about

121
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,100
up to make the world a safer place so
again

122
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:07,100
when I had what these guys

123
