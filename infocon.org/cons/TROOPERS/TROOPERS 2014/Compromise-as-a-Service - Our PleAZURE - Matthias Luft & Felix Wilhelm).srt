1
00:00:02,449 --> 00:00:05,660
I come everybody management his North
arm

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,719
this is Felix with them both work for
young W

3
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:12,629
and we got constantly teased about how
we have to be sent like the high but I

4
00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:14,120
the breakout a true bus

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:19,250
on let's say we were percent by this is
not easily possible using this

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,380
vulnerability

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,820
are just as a shot this claim at the
beginning over there will be a practical

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,890
demonstration

9
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,250
often exploit against hyperbole okay

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,359
um the title of presentation is

11
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,039
compromise as a service were are slight
emphasis

12
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:40,420
on as well arm s the whole research on
the topic started with the

13
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,360
research topic on as a security and
we'll have

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,520
three main parts in our presentation
first we'll cover

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,340
as on Hyper be and how they are related
to each other up

16
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,899
tell you a little bit about the research
project wanted it covered in the project

17
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:55,160
and

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,390
not men who have a look at clout and
hypervisors

19
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:03,269
and general provide a little bit of a
taxonomy on a technique to ask on

20
00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:07,729
if you want to get engaged in hypervisor
a cloud security research

21
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:11,570
on what areas you should particularly
focus on

22
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,869
and then the but the main part will be
hyper

23
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:17,960
I could be it's like a texture potential
attack vector of

24
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,329
and of course our research results are
together in the cause of that research

25
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:24,909
project arm

26
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:28,549
across the free to ask questions at
anytime

27
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:32,399
um it was all the really nice that
Rodrigo also covered a lot of

28
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:36,659
on the really really low level topics on
that we all the looking into adult if

29
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:37,630
you had to deal with

30
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,350
are so at least we can make some
references to his talk arm

31
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:45,490
that's appropriate alright will stop
with the

32
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:50,079
short introduction to research project
and the Mike to the as a environment

33
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,140
we've engaged in a government research
project

34
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:57,240
arm focus on the overall security posts
of the entire cloud environment

35
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,750
with this together where think picture I
promise to include them in the talks so

36
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,380
are I don't think Christian are domini
could make it here but if you watch the

37
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,200
recordings

38
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,770
I guys arm and its

39
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,090
Heather scope on the overall security
post-show Angela

40
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,130
so not explicitly focused and hypervisor
security

41
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,800
but although network security and the
cloud environment and of course

42
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,760
The Smashing isolation and all the
management interface is a security

43
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,970
of those interfaces on the FinTech to
die guys

44
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,500
other to look at all the like identity
services offered by as well

45
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,460
but this is not hard of our research arm

46
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:41,010
when here following someone in
structured approach of security research

47
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,060
we r cause have to for of

48
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,150
think about the security objectives for
a particular

49
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:51,320
as that and for a cloud environment of
processes availability

50
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,320
not only for the cloud service provider
about all the custom are

51
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,890
you have to think about availability of
its officers arm

52
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:02,260
clout on times all meticulous officers
have been a regular occurrence in the

53
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:02,810
past

54
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,640
they need to think about that are
especially after seeing this talk

55
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,370
because there will be some availability
impact available

56
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,570
and of course one of the major security
objectives and cloud environments

57
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:17,020
at least the main one everybody's
talking about isolation

58
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,780
home if you wanna put in our montana way

59
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:25,150
safeguarding confidentiality and
integrity of clients against each other

60
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,370
so again the classical

61
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,840
3 old security objectives CIA

62
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,590
that home the only thing that this may
be relevant a lot of people

63
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,730
tend to confuse security of the hosted
guest systems and how to secure those

64
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,310
with the security of the overall about
infrastructure home

65
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,410
this is something I like to on Strictly

66
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,410
handled differently arm

67
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,590
some people always mix it up but will
focus on the

68
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:58,880
infrastructure of the clout environment
exclusively via and

69
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,140
looking at Club environments um

70
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,970
we developed our four main areas:

71
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,240
are of a technique to us that can lead
to

72
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,500
isolation failures in cloud environments
that we like to use

73
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,840
been be performing club security
assessments all

74
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,600
a consulting of workshops on Cloud
Security first one of course

75
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,230
as a rump and breakout or what we call a
run Tom runtime: breakout

76
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,840
this is like the most in famous attack
always discussed think I'll

77
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,500
environments one earth I can execute
some code

78
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,570
in our gas system that results in court
execution in the host system

79
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:38,000
most impressed the interesting part of
causing this is also but we will mainly

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,730
come up

81
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,120
in our presentation on

82
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,600
that's why I want tell you too much im
then across

83
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,490
Star Trek other isolation failure also
very are important it's nice if you

84
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,980
about the machines that long time I
completely isolated

85
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,760
but if some X's controls and the storage
bag and

86
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,240
are not completely I implement that are
you can to some

87
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,870
kind of basic directory to both protect
and other results

88
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,290
in a lack of isolation on the host the
beta then of course you want to have a

89
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,420
isolated network arm which means the

90
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:15,600
other clients I'm not should not be able
to eavesdrop on your traffic

91
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,530
on at least in the network network
segment that is hosted at the cloud

92
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,670
service provider

93
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:26,280
them from our quite a few very very
important part management interfaces

94
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:31,430
all clout management the faces are
typically that the cases of its officers

95
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,570
and I think I don't need to tell you too
much about the security of web

96
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,440
applications in the world out there

97
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,580
that this is a very important aspect on
the part of this

98
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,940
our presentation so having does the
Technic doesn't mind I will give you a

99
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,330
short introduction to the environment

100
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:51,480
on other in order to show you show you
what all those a technique does met up

101
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:57,140
and why hypervisor security medicine
particular

102
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,820
don't as a data center as always
consisting

103
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:05,580
of a so-called fabric the fabric has
some big data center out was in the

104
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,330
middle

105
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,690
then we have several clusters in the
separate those classed us

106
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:13,880
are managed by separate control us those
are like to the actual management

107
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,780
instances and the environment

108
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:20,260
carrying out tasks like a deployment of
applications installation of new sauce

109
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,330
on the light the utility that the
controller

110
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,700
is like to thank the control of of every
control us deploying

111
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,330
other control which is often not very
important here

112
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,950
man if you look at the cluster with
leaders them additional ever

113
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,960
on of my isolation of

114
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,060
up network for wanting implemented and
Mia

115
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,370
20 Rex that makeup class to both when
the Rec Center on

116
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:49,970
consists of 50 commute knows and that
the power distribution unit

117
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:53,400
all them into in interesting at the
moment so

118
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,560
as well focus on hype us we have to look
at that different notes

119
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,060
and this is how to compute node are
looks like

120
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,300
with us on the date some other piece of
hardware

121
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,430
running up on top of that this as a
hypervisor

122
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,690
and several so-called petitions
partitions is the effort on

123
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,800
for virtual machines arm

124
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,139
there was one room partition other
rootless

125
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,320
a in the environment and civil trial
partition

126
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,590
all including some management
functionality in order to deploy

127
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:30,010
all applications and the like and as I'm

128
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:33,690
will get a more detailed look on that
later

129
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:37,370
some if you look at this basic
architecture

130
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,460
we also need to see that clout is

131
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,470
of the magical Tom that many people
think it is

132
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:47,720
it's a bunch of hot we are connected by
some all

133
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,830
network elements and there is the some
management functionality some people I'm

134
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,730
in functionality in this is like the May

135
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:58,310
Pablo provide us the to do everything
together with a lot of management

136
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:58,850
scripts

137
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,970
and SEO deployment Ruth and warm

138
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,930
you name it I'm at such as topic do
together

139
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:09,360
and that the very call there is still
the hypervisor

140
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,520
on without that it would be on the way

141
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,669
me with us more like classical host a
but

142
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:19,840
run them bring out are still very
relevant threatened lower environments

143
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,230
and as a very interesting one that's why
we looked at it

144
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:27,130
arm looking at hype other I don't think
you can give a talk

145
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:30,660
on hype other without mentioning the
difference between want to have a buy

146
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,590
those

147
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:35,450
arm up the mall

148
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,529
part of the pictures missing you but I

149
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:42,740
think you get the idea on have a hyper
either running

150
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,020
directly on the hardware and on top of
that I have either there are several

151
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,820
operating systems and type 2 hypervisor

152
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:53,160
on is running on top of an operating
system but leading into on

153
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,270
I'm several other operating systems

154
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:00,230
it was thinking he is most people would
think when they just install hyper-v for

155
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,240
the first time

156
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,560
that the type to have a visor because
you install just a plain Windows

157
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,490
operating system for us

158
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:11,170
menu at the hyper-v role on which songs
like installing software

159
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,720
operating system but I could be just get
install

160
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,120
directly on the hardware arm but
realizing the

161
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,560
original alright operating system as the
so-called

162
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,610
root partition so just like the dynamic

163
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,960
virtualization star over blue pill on
the like

164
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,120
I was other perform on the research area

165
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,600
then of course we have different modes
of much less Asian arm

166
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,839
known as much less asians for much less
Asian a bit binary translation

167
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:44,050
are basically translating all the
privilege

168
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:49,300
instructions that cannot be executed by
written by guests system on the CPU

169
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,470
anymore because its virtualized into a
set of non privileged

170
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,080
instructions this is necessary because
if you would loll you guessed system to

171
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,040
run those privileged I'll

172
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,640
instructions on the scene you directly
you could not ensure

173
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,640
that the I have eyes of a virtual
machine don't get compromise from within

174
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,910
the guest system

175
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:13,330
arm this is basically implemented in
software

176
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:16,420
and half bath a some performance impact

177
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,730
on the next step loss to develop a half
a block from

178
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:24,080
into BTX for example other b2b didn't
will be key platform

179
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,570
on to perform all those intercepting

180
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:31,720
are religions Buddhism instruction and
hardly a

181
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,110
tripping on those instructions ban have
any control over the fucking machine

182
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,440
monitor

183
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,960
arm it's too bad there are a lot of
talking in there

184
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,380
to that they already closed the talker

185
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:48,100
um and then we have something called
apollo virtualization which is a concept

186
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,960
that can be used in addition to both of
those mods

187
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,600
on there is no academic definition
Parliament solicitation basically just

188
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,410
means that the guest system is

189
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,440
way out it running in a hypervisor

190
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,140
and being able to communicate with the
hypervisor in certain way

191
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,740
there are different definitions on that
but like most impressed the infant

192
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,529
important part that you need to know
about

193
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:12,770
high-power no matter which type of
virtualization

194
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:16,160
I have other users there are different
parts of it

195
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,300
on that all can be attacked and there's
a lot of complexity

196
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,460
to each of those parts i'm for example
the hypervisor

197
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,910
is responsible for the device much less
Asian

198
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:31,899
um just as he has to do the memory
management and the CPU scheduling

199
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:35,470
all the different devices have to be
isolated on the device needs to be about

200
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,410
slice

201
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:40,570
and be made available to different
guests mmm

202
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:44,890
that can then use that arm according to
resource allocation and the usage

203
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,920
of those in the physician also be
isolated against each other

204
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,830
on a guest same was true for many memory
management in isolation

205
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:55,070
which is a particularly difficult part
arm

206
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:58,870
we'll also have a are some slides on
that later

207
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,980
explaining some parts of the memory
management of the hyper-v

208
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:06,670
are this is one of the more low-level
processor style

209
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,430
that all the into guys know so much
about one year those talks like ago this

210
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,180
scheme

211
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:16,120
all that would leave work early on as
well as the you scheduling isolation

212
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,320
then all of the modern hypervisors

213
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,730
also offer management interface those
are often caught high because because

214
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:24,440
those

215
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,740
is the interface to provide some
possibility but I guess system to

216
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,290
communicate directly with the hypervisor

217
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:34,520
and if it's a privilege petition other
performed certain management

218
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,580
functionality with other describe that
later

219
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,630
in detail and then there are additional
APIs

220
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:44,270
that might not are really need a

221
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:47,920
at least not for management of a lack of
functionality butter

222
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,080
might of additional functionality like
on

223
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,660
for example you know the copy and paste
functionality between a guest system and

224
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,570
the whole system

225
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:59,220
using arm commercialization on your
desktop

226
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,660
these are like this you know if your
eyes that offer I puzzle

227
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:08,830
okay having does different parts of the
hypervisor in mind and a

228
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,260
taxonomy of technicals in cloud
environments

229
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,750
we'll have a look at I elisa breakdowns

230
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,290
and the history of those arm one of the

231
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,800
for us a was a breakout I mean up

232
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,839
except for one X mentioned in his
keynote up

233
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,410
with that other thing only he can
remember that 'em

234
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:34,990
well as the nfte up I just referring to
this like that more on

235
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,410
more about the virtualization I was
basically a flaw

236
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:42,240
and the copy and paste fun and the ship
photos: functionality of

237
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,010
we end up their mother simple directory
traversal vulnerability is only

238
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,269
available to download

239
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:51,480
arbitrary files from your I have either
from within the guest

240
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,880
anymore interesting break up to attack
was 2009

241
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,720
this and it like that because the
questions the which was basically this

242
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,830
thing everybody was waiting for execute
some code in a virtual machine

243
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:06,640
and this results and code execution on
the hypervisor

244
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,250
US exploiting on this is an interesting
fact

245
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:14,610
he was exploiting are 3d API of the bus
a graphic of

246
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:18,680
which allowed him to address I'll or
read and write arbitrary memory in the

247
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,990
host system

248
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,290
though really nice think keep that in
mind among

249
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,920
than in 2011 there was a KVM breakout

250
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,459
I'm %um going to pronounce that well um

251
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:34,510
resulting from the dangling pointer
vulnerability because apparently

252
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:38,100
along the bus left hot rhea you can hot
black and hot

253
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,170
unblock yourself bridge by Ron I don't
think this is like an actual

254
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,709
take back to our in life operating
system or life computer

255
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:49,910
but apparently in about insist that much
less than you can do that

256
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:53,860
so are something closely related to the
by simulation

257
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:57,510
then 2012 was a bad year for B&B and a

258
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:01,820
you send only in the case has left the
building at Tech home

259
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,100
more on are interesting my ability

260
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,830
which could result in sup love
environments

261
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:12,240
in court execution on the hypervisor am
and

262
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,440
I'm 5 on advisories in this

263
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,089
be and advisories referencing

264
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:23,940
memory corruption vulnerability from
Google on glances into the host system

265
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,330
other 2012 most sense is that Boehner
ability in

266
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,690
really interesting one um based on

267
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:35,130
II wanna say a processor out on but it
was based on the way

268
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:39,029
England eighty handled the so-called
threaten structure because into

269
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:42,450
arm at a different way of performing

270
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:46,470
this instruction internally children are
a creeper stalker in 100 plays into

271
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,560
micro

272
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,750
coats and so on I bennett AMD

273
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:55,690
and this different behavior about other
great architect from the guest system

274
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:59,630
to the hypervisor then 2013

275
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:03,579
and his thirteen 0922 survivability you
will discuss your

276
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:07,399
so it won't tell you anything about that
and then all the very interestingly

277
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,420
2014 to really bad but abilities

278
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:15,880
inbox box about this one beginning of
February this one beginning of May

279
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,010
this one was just very very classical
buffer overflow

280
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:22,920
in the host guess Communication Manager
this is basically a softness

281
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,540
that provides an interface ought to
implement your own services

282
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,850
for guess to host communication and
surprisingly d'amato

283
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:33,550
a hole in it nothing magical just a
plain Buffalo

284
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:37,089
like and software then as well

285
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:40,230
the bus both chromium breakout chromium
is

286
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:43,600
a library on to carry out

287
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,450
3d hi I'm graphics acceleration over
network point of

288
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,540
and interestingly does not work want us

289
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,380
be able to point to arbitrary location
memory does that somehow

290
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:59,010
some familiar like five years in between
and we still have the same problem in

291
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,279
the software

292
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:03,740
we definitely should keep that in mind
especially when we are thinking about

293
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,409
the budget

294
00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:07,639
ago this month lag it might not provide
as much

295
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:11,039
isolation as the classical ACA between
system

296
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,489
systems and thus cost-efficient the put
it nicely you thought me and as an

297
00:17:15,489 --> 00:17:17,209
additional security layup

298
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:20,279
it's just in the another layer to find
box Anna

299
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:24,309
on it's not in the end they talk while I
could not resist

300
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:27,519
um the sutures illustrate that a little
bit

301
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:32,850
and we will go on when I were talking so
based on those one or abilities we saw

302
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,919
own brother wanted to provide a soft
economy

303
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,369
gonna take back to us hypervisors and

304
00:17:39,369 --> 00:17:42,470
the first and biggest the is the
instructions that

305
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,749
if you have to fully emulates at least
on

306
00:17:45,749 --> 00:17:49,190
provide a full instructions that to a
guest system without

307
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:52,379
long to get system to execute privilege
execution

308
00:17:52,379 --> 00:17:57,179
least not by compromising hypervisor
this is a really difficult task

309
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:01,139
when you think um men to communicate
with an as is a cell

310
00:18:01,139 --> 00:18:04,590
and you wanna performing of indicator
are

311
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:09,690
remote exploit as a very very tiny base
of code is executed by the communicate

312
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,259
with their

313
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:13,960
but Narnia basically to follow
instructions that you have to secure

314
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,989
so there's a huge tech base um

315
00:18:16,989 --> 00:18:22,460
and dissimulation there almost certainly
a lot of boxing

316
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,539
but of course the management and
addition as a challenge

317
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:28,879
channels with a lot of those in the exam
both the VM

318
00:18:28,879 --> 00:18:32,259
the key thing um on the like

319
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:36,859
along arm be in the case that the
building and take

320
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:40,070
someone related to management are
features

321
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:44,289
and then does monitoring and caches
there was this or virtually impossible

322
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:44,799
by

323
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,249
go this game and is that he won't go
even

324
00:18:48,249 --> 00:18:51,830
do no slight detail on cash because they
were always

325
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:55,980
the hiding inside chillin text those
others get those

326
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,779
that his memory management and devices
as in the Technic 20

327
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:03,399
this is a really really complex be if
you look at all our

328
00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:07,440
those extended page tables algorithms
that we had to look into a little bit

329
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,259
for hyper-v

330
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:12,059
research and then we will provide some
insight on

331
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:15,899
me by stimulation this is a really
complicated stuff

332
00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:19,309
if you have a look at the qa/qc history
I'll

333
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:24,499
you will see this really difficult to
implement it in safely

334
00:19:24,499 --> 00:19:28,070
alright than we'll have a look at the
hyper-v

335
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:33,179
and see all those technique does I'll
transfer hyper-v and look at me so happy

336
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:36,649
arm but if we focus on hyper-v

337
00:19:36,649 --> 00:19:40,299
across the aisle better the results so
far there was one denial of service

338
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:41,070
attack

339
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:45,669
up listen to go I'm that was not based
on any actual research about

340
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:50,690
on the reverse engineering on or a patch
from Microsoft

341
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:55,009
so very little research coverage in the
we have been that this should not be the

342
00:19:55,009 --> 00:19:56,200
case for

343
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,200
any software as expose I'm

344
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,289
but it is used in a bar Barack variety
of proper the environment in the

345
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:04,220
meantime

346
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,960
on including as a if you read about at
home

347
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,679
you were you can read the um just as a
hypervisor

348
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,019
Michael not using hyper-v if you re

349
00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:18,369
read a little bit more you will see that
as I hope others just the main line of

350
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:19,909
development nowadays

351
00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:24,649
for mike is a hypervisor and the all
like to feature from as a hypervisor

352
00:20:24,649 --> 00:20:27,739
low Bay into hyper be so they are still

353
00:20:27,739 --> 00:20:32,710
closely related Andrea some free agency
other interesting to see

354
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:36,549
this is creature from as well Butlins
them

355
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:40,460
and as you can see all the hyper-v
integration services are running so

356
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,609
there has to be some relation between as
a hypervisor

357
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:46,700
and hyper-v and then this is a

358
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,369
see you as the DUI the as a blast
watching

359
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:53,859
and if you look at those they are almost
the same

360
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:58,109
well as I 11 hyper-v we see that we have
a difference of crunchy on different

361
00:20:58,109 --> 00:20:58,519
sides

362
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:02,129
pay but they are not that far away from
each other

363
00:21:02,129 --> 00:21:05,570
you often see that when we look at our
results so

364
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:09,889
are if you want to perform a research
project on ASM

365
00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:13,100
it's all the really interesting to look
at high be because

366
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:17,049
what's the defining I mean my friends
and the rebel as of Corsicana

367
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:20,940
Hester never veteran transfer really
well

368
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,289
with that arm

369
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:27,979
than we already mentioned that might as
well have a visa type 1 hypervisor

370
00:21:27,979 --> 00:21:31,600
even though it looks the other way the
answer call petitions

371
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,389
this the root partition was just like
the one privilege petition that perform

372
00:21:35,389 --> 00:21:39,499
although management functionality on the
whole either of electrocution creation

373
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:40,559
configuration

374
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,070
and other stuff you the hottest
virtualization

375
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:48,340
into me to. the in the variation of that
and this type of law

376
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,899
enlightened unenlightened systems
petition

377
00:21:51,899 --> 00:21:55,320
arm this described

378
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,859
basically the content of power
virtualization whether

379
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:02,600
aficionado or as running in the
partition us

380
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:08,289
avail the hypervisor its communicating
with that using authority and bus

381
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:11,539
this author more details i can text a

382
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:14,889
all hi be on we're

383
00:22:14,889 --> 00:22:18,210
to interesting things that we want to
focus on

384
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:21,779
and those are high put/call offering in
the face strong

385
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:25,359
partisan or at least like competition
directly to the hypervisor

386
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:28,720
so you can do like a a regular API

387
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,409
call just as the with missus saw just
not to the car but I really do that to

388
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:34,330
the hypervisor

389
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:38,320
not communicate with the hypervisor and
then you have to be an bus

390
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,779
offering an interface between much
machine

391
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:45,529
for example for high-speed communication
which is not supposed to go

392
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:48,679
the hypervisor all across

393
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:53,279
fallen through that this is the I hope
the architecture that we need for the

394
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:54,799
remainder of the talk

395
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,679
and you will hand over to Felix 2
percent is on the home all the time

396
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:04,830
results so s 20th already mentioned when
we started researching the hyper-v

397
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,970
hypervisor we wanted first to try to map

398
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,090
to take surface which is pretty
important to understand which

399
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:15,759
attacks might be possible and when we
first started researching be identified

400
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:17,460
three interesting it expects

401
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,019
bien exits and general hyper call
switcher

402
00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:24,179
a subset of the exit switch to a pretty
interesting

403
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:27,749
sq describe later and to be an bus and
serve

404
00:23:27,749 --> 00:23:32,149
we're just a message both for the
communication between devotes machines I

405
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:33,159
will describe

406
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:36,789
egypt is sweeeeet expect us in more
detail

407
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:41,399
so as mentioned before ha hyperbole you
lose heart assisted virtualization

408
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:45,489
this basically means that so put into
our sins means that they are using to

409
00:23:45,489 --> 00:23:47,989
interview next so the bottom echelons

410
00:23:47,989 --> 00:23:52,769
extensions instructions that which
basically adds an additional

411
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:56,090
a privilege for me so now you have not
only will we

412
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:59,639
ruling world and from 301 lol year

413
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:03,479
additionally havin Yandex ru operation
mode and an

414
00:24:03,479 --> 00:24:07,399
diem X no mood operational so hyper
while it's running

415
00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:10,570
in Vmax route operation mode and

416
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:14,289
and devote a machine and an old
operation world

417
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:18,059
and transitions between the hypervisor
and the guest system

418
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:22,919
implemented using the and excellent and
exits and we and entries

419
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,479
and of course we are more interested in
the Annex it so how can the

420
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:32,340
a virtual machine transfer execution
back to the hype us

421
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:36,249
so me and excess Festival de Cannes
which we got on profits which is done

422
00:24:36,249 --> 00:24:37,970
when you're executing hyper call

423
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:41,590
so intellectual instruction which is 2
p.m. call instruction

424
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:45,039
which basically just jumps back into the
hypervisor

425
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:51,479
and other than that it can be a and BMX
it can happen when you execute approved

426
00:24:51,479 --> 00:24:52,279
construction

427
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:55,789
so privileged instruction isn't actually
the correct way

428
00:24:55,789 --> 00:24:59,570
a.m. so the code to a formal description
of those but basically

429
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:04,349
a.m. the hypervisor can decide for
certain subset of instruction

430
00:25:04,349 --> 00:25:09,239
if they would trigger and the and Mexico
if they do be executed normally

431
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:13,609
so of course if you tried to access the
system register or something like that

432
00:25:13,609 --> 00:25:17,450
or if you even try to execute arm

433
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:22,700
vote solution management instructions
inside too much from chin itself

434
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,999
it will trigger an Emma nvm exit and

435
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:29,229
also stuff like we're just something
real to you mentioned before they are

436
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:30,019
due out

437
00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:34,320
instruction sisters when im musician
function for hardware

438
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,779
a.m. can also be configured to trigger
on the exit

439
00:25:37,779 --> 00:25:41,169
which is especially interesting if you
think about hypervisor some clout a

440
00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:42,129
moment

441
00:25:42,129 --> 00:25:46,340
because basically FitFlop clout
environment decides to back to you

442
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,580
out the once instruction you won't
notice that

443
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,799
because bien exit a totally transparent

444
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:57,299
a.m. to be and guest so you're basically
business to do stuff

445
00:25:57,299 --> 00:26:00,960
the the the group in a research was
based on that too

446
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,320
operating system running inside to
voting machine

447
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,859
environment can't decide to a contract
it now stands watch Lost

448
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:10,909
and of course their stuff like
interrupts

449
00:26:10,909 --> 00:26:13,950
and APIC rides and stuff like that which
were

450
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:17,580
also trigger on BMX so

451
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,720
as mentioned before %um excess need to
be transparent

452
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:27,549
to the guest so dude really wants to be
able to run guests which don't know

453
00:26:27,549 --> 00:26:29,369
they're about to ask

454
00:26:29,369 --> 00:26:32,429
so if you execute privileged instruction
it's

455
00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:36,309
request complete emulation of his
instructions inside the hypervisor

456
00:26:36,309 --> 00:26:40,019
and have cost a few heaven little
overview about

457
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:43,700
into internals and into architecture
this does not really true

458
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:48,559
so you have a lot of special cases and
side effects and stuff you have to

459
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:49,220
relearn

460
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:52,879
implement correctly but of course

461
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:56,720
if you want to support enlightened about
solutions which means

462
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,259
the most a machine also it's running
inside and over solution won it all

463
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:02,509
inside the hypervisor

464
00:27:02,509 --> 00:27:05,779
and you have to provide some kind of
future so does

465
00:27:05,779 --> 00:27:08,830
div operating system can detect it

466
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:13,139
a classical way which is also the way
and hyper-v implemented

467
00:27:13,139 --> 00:27:17,509
is that there are any additional
function to think a new ID instruction

468
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:21,649
which triggers to be an excellent and
high burden to reach her on

469
00:27:21,649 --> 00:27:26,499
the its was new and additional lead the
guest permission to quite interesting

470
00:27:26,499 --> 00:27:27,899
because they be fine

471
00:27:27,899 --> 00:27:32,190
which operations which hyper calls TV
and actually can perform

472
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:35,309
inside to return value so inside the
registers

473
00:27:35,309 --> 00:27:39,799
which run from the CPU ID instruction
and inscribed croon

474
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:43,749
because now and in contrast to other
book solutions

475
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:47,580
that's mites tried to hide stem cell
from the user

476
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:52,519
and if you are much less on the hyper-v
and unproven its guests

477
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:55,609
assisting user can actually contrary

478
00:27:55,609 --> 00:27:58,789
to accept Russian of hyper visions
running under

479
00:27:58,789 --> 00:28:02,549
which might be pretty interesting if you
try to exploit the stuff

480
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:05,629
so and cause us you can see your

481
00:28:05,629 --> 00:28:09,039
don't only see two major version you can
see the

482
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,279
depute number ourselves

483
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,369
a.m. so this is the topic for BMX

484
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:20,009
no hyper cause a more or less a special
runoff

485
00:28:20,009 --> 00:28:24,179
in BMX it that I use for direct
communication

486
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:27,519
written the OS kernel dude the bustle I
stronger

487
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:32,159
and the hyper visor there's something
like system cause but used for

488
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,409
communication between the con

489
00:28:34,409 --> 00:28:38,769
and to have us instead of two guests
mode and to come

490
00:28:38,769 --> 00:28:42,239
and interesting thing about a hyper
cause us to actually in document

491
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:43,169
interface

492
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:46,369
so Microsoft a published a functional

493
00:28:46,369 --> 00:28:51,059
functional specification for high-power
which actually describes every

494
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:54,719
implemented hyper call in crate detail

495
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:58,889
to describe the copy and include
something like see head of highlights

496
00:28:58,889 --> 00:29:02,969
so we can actually use this high but
call up the end it's it's designed to be

497
00:29:02,969 --> 00:29:05,679
used both to a party so you can for
example

498
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,690
extend your anti-virus solution to

499
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:13,969
support some kind of inside in to go to
last systems and stuff like that

500
00:29:13,969 --> 00:29:18,690
and of course they are known security
boundaries so if you have any idea about

501
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,559
implementing a hypervisor you know too
high because

502
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:25,570
gonna be attacked by potential attacker
because they're one of the main

503
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:26,379
interface is

504
00:29:26,379 --> 00:29:30,840
I'm for Hyper being practiced as yours

505
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,409
foot by enlightened petitions to improve
performance so basically

506
00:29:34,409 --> 00:29:39,499
you don't have to wait for on %um exit
to trigger by itself so for example to

507
00:29:39,499 --> 00:29:43,489
too much the machine can syndrich we
getting hyper

508
00:29:43,489 --> 00:29:48,399
call on the month and a.m. especially
interesting is that for hyper-v

509
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:52,710
the the hyper call interface is also
used by the root partition

510
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:57,659
for management of the other petitions so
actually the creation as you can see in

511
00:29:57,659 --> 00:29:58,679
this example

512
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:02,950
the creation of additional petitions of
additional virtual machine

513
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:05,999
is community implemented in

514
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:09,029
in a single hyper core and in stuff like

515
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:12,139
reads register us from a different
version process aw

516
00:30:12,139 --> 00:30:16,409
such register will use a different
virtual process or can be reached using

517
00:30:16,409 --> 00:30:17,899
high pickles

518
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:21,369
there's actually oh yes single check

519
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:24,509
insight into he's hyper call handlers to
ensure

520
00:30:24,509 --> 00:30:29,229
and the distaff even called from a
normal petition but only from Rupert is

521
00:30:29,229 --> 00:30:34,769
so a.m. we won't go into that in too
much detail but one thing we find

522
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:38,279
interesting is if you have a memory
corruption inside to hype up by the

523
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:42,099
so you can write up to memory that's
basically one bite

524
00:30:42,099 --> 00:30:45,539
you can just over white or widened and
iTunes

525
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:49,489
and then your virtual guest machine can
used just hype a call option

526
00:30:49,489 --> 00:30:53,440
to Alberto in get and sets registers of
different partitions

527
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,849
which section flight crew because that
might make your

528
00:30:56,849 --> 00:31:01,629
how to exploit my own corruption inside
hyper call to perfect exploit because of

529
00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:02,639
that you have a stable

530
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:07,210
up the API to use

531
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:11,759
so I because with a second to text her
face the VM us asylum

532
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:14,879
and do p.m. bus is actually the most

533
00:31:14,879 --> 00:31:18,119
interesting want at least in my opinion

534
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:21,889
base in the AM what was the message both
used for communication between

535
00:31:21,889 --> 00:31:25,259
petitions and the default configuration
only do

536
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:28,349
root partition can community

537
00:31:28,349 --> 00:31:32,369
cage with each guest petition so the
guest partitions com communicate between

538
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:33,509
each other

539
00:31:33,509 --> 00:31:36,519
because that would open something like
side channel attacks

540
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:39,580
and you could bypass the hype up

541
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,759
and and i actually implemented a.m.

542
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:47,609
losing memory pages that I met inside
multiple partitions at the same time

543
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:51,200
this is of course used for performance
critical a task

544
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,289
if you mention you want and virtualized
network interface that performs

545
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:58,570
a.m. quite fast you don't want to send

546
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:01,460
every network packets using the
hypervisor because then you have to

547
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:01,899
match

548
00:32:01,899 --> 00:32:05,279
context switches so instead to just met

549
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:09,879
two men were in the room petition and in
love to get petitions and and you

550
00:32:09,879 --> 00:32:14,109
push the pickets inside this memo
respect didn't listing things that

551
00:32:14,109 --> 00:32:18,029
dissolves a lot to text her face because
basically if you whites

552
00:32:18,029 --> 00:32:21,049
daughter into this mood from from the
guest petition

553
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:24,940
it's gonna be passed inside one petition
sort of potent

554
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:28,109
potentially doesn't compromise to hyper
was its health

555
00:32:28,109 --> 00:32:32,859
but if you have richer or on excess a
code execution on the

556
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:36,759
on would petition the hypervisor isn't
that interesting and no

557
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:39,799
so there's a lot to text service but

558
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:46,029
I am when we actually considered
Research Park for this as environment

559
00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:50,200
VM us isn't crew tired but it's not to
prep most practical

560
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:55,649
because basically reworking hyper-v and
try to tune

561
00:32:55,649 --> 00:32:59,219
to use our research results for as I
clout and

562
00:32:59,219 --> 00:33:04,210
the in possibility that as a large
implementation difference

563
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:07,399
between as a and normal windows for
other implementations

564
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:11,669
on the BM us implementation so we are
not sure what kind of services are

565
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:14,389
running into root partition and as
environment

566
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:17,549
so this makes potential inability to
find a hyper-v

567
00:33:17,549 --> 00:33:21,169
its its rights possible into

568
00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:26,269
simply not usable for as up so did the
end exit handling which are described

569
00:33:26,269 --> 00:33:27,639
before

570
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:31,330
a.m. might be really interesting
especially considering some special

571
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:32,269
cases

572
00:33:32,269 --> 00:33:36,539
and our conditions but Julie almost a.m.
we are not that

573
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:40,950
a good at processor internal stuff so we
are not go Diskin

574
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:44,419
earn so this seem to be pretty hot

575
00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:48,429
research for us at least we didn't tried

576
00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:52,190
post so what's left other high pickles

577
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:55,269
how to cause a basically as I said
before a document

578
00:33:55,269 --> 00:34:00,739
option a the day a is related functions
so for each hyper call you have hyper

579
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:01,519
call handler

580
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:06,659
its whether to fit review to identify
this hyper call handler inside the

581
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:07,320
binary

582
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,800
and basically then you are working with
enormous influence

583
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,919
so even if you are not really to
virtualization grew or

584
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:18,950
low-level export just working with a
Senior High Park on headline

585
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:23,399
auditing dis hendler for security
vulnerabilities as possible

586
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:27,340
so we decided to stop looking at too
high because

587
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,980
and hopes to find some low-hanging
fruits so as to frost

588
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:34,679
so it be could get us some results

589
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:38,940
have crossed website expectations when
we started as we search

590
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:42,140
so the hypervisor turf has improved
minutes

591
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:46,030
futures Microsoft is actually cried
throughout

592
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:49,190
they also lost lot of implementation it
s

593
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:53,060
to do with petitions those big cushion
to hype it was a pretty small

594
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:57,100
it's actually relatively small copay so
it's like a true megabyte

595
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:01,410
execute a lil which if you ever we were
similar to make about

596
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:06,340
executed with still pretty large 22 just
analyzed attempting to about

597
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:11,170
its more less like 69th of C and
assembly code so dense

598
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:15,020
at least official statistic be found on
the internet

599
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:19,250
an and if you compare that to like 15
million lines of code

600
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,290
you probably have when you're looking at
terminal server kernel:

601
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:26,840
produce more code base and in addition
as mature as already mentioned

602
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,960
until we started our research there was
only one serious public lublu ti

603
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:36,850
in hyper-v incomplete and disaffected 2
p.m. boats which mean

604
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:40,590
would not be looking at him to
mosquitoes so we concentrated on the

605
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,500
hyper cause

606
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:46,450
which onto then look pretty stable a
pretty safe

607
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:49,770
and in addition you have stuff like this
so Microsoft

608
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:52,800
actually performs research to formally

609
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,320
or to perform formal verification of the
hypervisor

610
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,540
so academic research on

611
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:03,370
to prove that a no memory corruption
abilities or stuff like this

612
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:08,430
inside too much to type

613
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:12,930
and of crossing we have so if you have
something like to Microsoft Security

614
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,530
development life cycle

615
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:19,090
and Microsoft as well after to few
windows were actually have two balls to

616
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:20,050
go to collect

617
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:23,130
and published a tad

618
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:26,490
put security architecture of dirt road
and

619
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:30,060
a saying like I'm

620
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,510
yeah all products since you're so he
just the presentation

621
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:37,250
and so we had britain no expectations to
find

622
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:41,630
any serious wound abilities

623
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:48,290
I'm yeah I'm just not as a bit too fast
so I have to slow down

624
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:51,910
third fashion and

625
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:55,800
I'm happy third the

626
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,460
fox nude pacts then lost that just two
days later

627
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,940
so and most up to two day sry actually
spend upsetting to LEP

628
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:09,070
and installing high permiso was more
like one then hop

629
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:13,600
and then we got to first mystery so this
is a hyper by the blue screen so we

630
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,310
actually fine do not have service inside
the hypervisor

631
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:20,190
at from a virtual machine from
unprivileged virtual machine

632
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:24,710
I'm you can see the picture quality is
really bad because we perform testing

633
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,700
ourselves extreme physical hard

634
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:31,910
so I had to crap my smartphone a and
said it was just a picture so he could

635
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:36,270
see that we crested successfully a.m.

636
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:39,390
of cross question is always user

637
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:45,100
what was the real the difficult part was
actually understanding dubach

638
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:49,080
so the root cause analysis started after
these two days

639
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:54,230
and on so we basically had to dig up the
binary and

640
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,870
look at the a over up idea and start
looking

641
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:02,130
so hyperbole is mainly implemented in to
execute a bruise depending if its

642
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:03,130
foreign to offer a

643
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:06,270
do so because isn't rated on in to
execute

644
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:09,930
a.m. if you ever worked with my cuz of
binary issue

645
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:14,890
I'm used to getting a public got some so
at least you can detect the pension ames

646
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:20,640
unfortunately they aren't available for
hypervisor itself

647
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,090
however some of the same would also love
to functionality

648
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:28,890
included in the hyper was executed will
is actually identical to the functions

649
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,500
use in the Minotaur X the other HB load

650
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,140
XO and main stuff like networking told
us:

651
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:40,130
mistake all the basic debug
implementations for the support for the

652
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:42,340
wind energy debugger

653
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:45,820
earn we have actually so it wasn't our
day

654
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:50,330
ideal so full credit for decided to go
to get out which is then also from

655
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:54,040
security locked onto which published
some of its research on Hyperion

656
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:58,330
so we're stone Desiree from you

657
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:01,340
earn right after that we at least had
some

658
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:06,080
Basant public debugging symbols which
you could you Rockwood

659
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:11,810
so do morning hypervisor no is sometimes
quite hot in the case of hyper-v its

660
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:12,780
action

661
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:16,870
it has been the region interface so you
can used in all living wills debugger

662
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:21,120
a.m. to connect and to debug hyper so
for

663
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:25,140
namaha few issue redirect physical harm
which would

664
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,390
restarted I am

665
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:32,150
you can use it so it's the report
highlights on that one lol

666
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:36,080
unfortunately this is is a slow or
doesn't work reliably

667
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:40,480
so we have some kind of problems getting
to set up reusable

668
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:46,150
fortunately in nor since we don't
dedicated hardware anymore because

669
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,430
current version of

670
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:50,720
of me and workstation infusing for
example

671
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,570
actually support nested virtualization
so they used a binary translation

672
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:58,610
a mission isn't to actually and you made

673
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:01,850
to intervention instructions so you can

674
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:07,010
execute as you can install hyper-v
inside VMware Workstation those

675
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:11,570
all the little bit confusing for people
in our exploding i buy those books

676
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:15,500
say really had a hard time understanding
which system is running well known but

677
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,860
I'm I exploding at the moment because
wariness that

678
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:22,200
so we gotta and

679
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,980
we got two minutes if louise is that up
inside are watching she

680
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,310
but one of the key things about doing
hyperbole is

681
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:33,240
ted danson extension yelled at for wind
energy which

682
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:39,470
is required to really have hyper-v
specific debugging functionality

683
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,710
does too hyper-v extensions deal and I
guess

684
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:47,190
and using publicly available so if any
of you guys have a copy of to use I

685
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,660
would be happy to talk to you later

686
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:53,950
and because this implement a lot of you
just you could really use if you try to

687
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:58,330
debug hyperbole or if you try to analyze
the hostage

688
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,970
sir after we got the initial setup

689
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:05,540
and we started looking at a bike what's
the reason for tobacco

690
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:08,570
and as we said before it was in the
hyper call interface

691
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:12,240
and basically if you look at it lowest
level of hyper call interface

692
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,520
it works by executing in the AM Coll
instruction

693
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,580
on and all the arguments to all the hype
a call argument

694
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:22,720
at least they have different calling
russians so like

695
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,660
a.m. you have a normal user space in
moments too

696
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:31,450
and but to have some flicks low-cost
fast 'cause on for slow cause

697
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:34,680
the hyper call numbers in the Aussie X
register

698
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,240
and guest physical address of input and
output are to I'm

699
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,550
RDX and aid so if you're talking about

700
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:44,830
hyper we always have three kinds of
different addresses

701
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:48,360
so we have to guess to russell addresses
to guest physical addresses

702
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:52,660
which didn't get which didn't get
translated into

703
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:56,150
system physical s at West so and the

704
00:41:56,150 --> 00:42:00,360
for Hyper courts a we have to work to
get physically truth

705
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:05,510
interestingly in we documented in
rituals basically 21 crossed by we found

706
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:08,030
a spot because we tried to use Russia
Latrice

707
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:11,300
for us sir I'm

708
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,420
when you actually performs hyper call
yes some

709
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:17,770
so before reaching to call him plus for
dis

710
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:21,030
the Civic type-r call to my home in
couple of checks

711
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:24,140
so something like that hypercar number
has to be valid

712
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:27,900
a.m. the alignment of two addresses you
enter should be right

713
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:31,580
and detect data hyper collection comes
from review

714
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:35,730
the so that should be the enormous check
every hypervisor implements

715
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:38,850
but actually I think 10 hotter had to
bike

716
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:42,460
last year something with it didn't
checked it so actually could

717
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,560
execute hyper calls from your myspace

718
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,750
so in this case to exploit request that
you up

719
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:52,450
insight the condo of two books from
sheen so

720
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:55,500
you have to have root permissions or
something like that

721
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:59,010
and after their performed these checks
to actually

722
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:02,580
a check to upper boundary of then check
for

723
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:06,940
a boundary concerning the input guest
for the at first

724
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:10,010
so this is handy snippet you can see
that

725
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:13,680
the I S you register contains I'm

726
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,420
input guess physical address so that
guests physical address

727
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:20,850
that's pointing to the actual hyper call
import

728
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:25,150
and its compounds to some kind %uh
parliament

729
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:29,640
and if this limits so if too high if the
input GPA's just to hype

730
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,650
an error conditions waste and our
condition were eventually

731
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:36,850
reside and executing all execution of
impunity

732
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:39,950
telehandler we just extended page tables

733
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:43,460
ever had so extended page tables are
basically

734
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:47,790
missiles introduced into to improve the
performance of popular

735
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:51,780
assisted virtualization so you don't
have to

736
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:56,830
the keep something like shadow page
tables and doctor anymore

737
00:43:56,830 --> 00:44:00,590
but instead you have an extended page
tables which performs the translation

738
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:02,790
between the guest physical addresses

739
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:05,910
and a system physical address so is

740
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:09,570
own team is actually on trigger a man
and one

741
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:13,680
virtualized system excesses invalid
guest physical address

742
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,170
which shouldn't be happen that often but
of course it can happen

743
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:23,150
I am now the differences it shakes the
route to read all white arrow in all

744
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:24,060
cases read

745
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:27,220
over because it's only input data and

746
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:30,380
then the function I named pretty rude or
ever

747
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:34,980
Street /url and now the input address

748
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:39,120
is to use as a in Duke's into the
extended page tables for this virtual

749
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:39,780
machine

750
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,960
of all this russians you and

751
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,510
of course weed control it rx wettest on

752
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:50,380
which is used as an index and isn't
really check for

753
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:54,250
a polymer so re triggers our condition
by

754
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:58,900
inserting a really large value inside
input at worst as in a check for

755
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,960
absolute so basically we have a classic

756
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,180
a.m. out of bound excess

757
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:09,090
did reveal which were used for the
denial of service vulnerability

758
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:16,090
is basically the classical form on from
one for one

759
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:25,670
yeah up yeah of course are moving it
into your most was inspired by F XO

760
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:28,720
full credit for us we wouldn't go to him
I guess

761
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,510
I'm yet so we would put the stock

762
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:35,840
hands so if you can see it's basically

763
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:40,030
first half alone read violation so we
don't have a dog major trigger a memory

764
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:41,200
light

765
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,120
and we started looking into it but I am
business got in the way

766
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:49,590
and we reported it to Microsoft and
reconsidered at that time a

767
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:50,610
denial-of-service

768
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:53,880
so we could excess invalid memory but we
didn't get

769
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,790
Kreider the bullets escalation or
something is going on

770
00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:01,550
interesting leader and my cuz of guys
actually consider

771
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:05,430
potential prunes escalation know if you
actually read

772
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:09,760
Microsoft advisories you know that in
the loft I yesterday started to consider

773
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,210
every wound blunted potentially

774
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:16,180
exploitable so that hasn't tell you too
much

775
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:19,480
but the interesting thing is that effort
ever almost actually affected

776
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:24,010
so does want to lose you could have been
used to Crescent as a hypervisor

777
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:28,600
and and but he just gave a quick
introduction into as architecture

778
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,780
on and one thing that's if

779
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:35,440
especially true when you consider denial
of service vulnerability in this

780
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,640
environment

781
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:42,380
is that menu when you have a virtual
machine and its hypervisor cref's

782
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:46,420
the virtual machine automatically
restarts on a different hypervisor

783
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:50,430
so now imagine you have to swim ability
and puts

784
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:54,840
put to exploit code basically I'll to
start or to start

785
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,370
and then you just walk away and went on
to everything goes room

786
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:02,330
so yeah he didn't do it but you could
have I'm

787
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:06,830
yeah across interesting thing is the
potential problems escalation

788
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:10,260
so s said before we got

789
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:13,730
packed the last few months to present

790
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:17,000
in potential breakout our doctors with
ability

791
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,670
unfortunately so weak dim but cannot be
used to getting meta

792
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:25,290
memory white corruption so we can simply
ride somewhere and i win

793
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:29,560
earn however really happened we are
working with the extended page tables

794
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,420
into the connection

795
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:35,320
some exploit some kind of logic when
abilities because

796
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:40,920
because we can a.m. supply and arbitrary
page table 2 dysfunction so we can

797
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:46,470
control which member in locations retina
which will be media

798
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:50,330
and we have some kind overall ideas how
to exploit at

799
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:53,490
but basically before I started rambling
about potential

800
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:57,600
exploitation rectal so we don't have and
prudes

801
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,670
escalation explored demonstrated will
yet

802
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:04,230
so we hope we can presented a couple of

803
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:07,510
next month order I'm

804
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:11,820
so now comes to life table for denial of
service vulnerability

805
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:16,080
a.m. I so and was treated you have to
clap and thus help pops up now in this

806
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:23,080
case you have to clap in a few screen
pops up said

807
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:32,150
so you can see this is a really cool to
have to go into a bit after this

808
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:36,300
so this is basically a Microsoft Server
2012 which is to run petition

809
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:40,950
running inside in the amber fusion on my
Mac and inside of this repetition so

810
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:42,440
much light snow

811
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:45,470
is running and you

812
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:50,630
in my most isn't X 12 system which used
to exploit religion

813
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:54,120
because basically you have to come from
Carlos pace a.m.

814
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:58,160
and it's easier to write looks kinda
more routes and Renault Scala models

815
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,930
so basically we decided on Linux I'm

816
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:08,930
there is a Shell but that's not the
point yeah but the congress

817
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:14,610
sir /url the extra exploit code is
basically implemented in the

818
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:18,180
call Morden renamed hyper hyper

819
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:23,080
in

820
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:27,620
yeah and it's really not directly but
instead we were too short comment line

821
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:29,610
two

822
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:34,930
which stands for just a denial of
Sorrows and yet it's a blue screen print

823
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:41,930
here

824
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:47,040
Yahoo

825
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:53,020
so no I think I head back for to
materials for colluding

826
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:57,540
yes the first conclusion that we Hafiz
that

827
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:01,880
hypervisor security and research it's
not hard

828
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:05,170
as you could see you just have to
implement something to be able to the

829
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:05,910
hype because

830
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:09,050
and you can start messing around are
really

831
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:12,070
Intel functionality of the hypervisor

832
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:16,510
this is something even I can do I'm not
us be explored right or anything like

833
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:17,350
that

834
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:20,900
but even I can implement I'll some cum
what you'll the tree goes

835
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:24,310
the denial of service vulnerability in
Sanaa hyper-v

836
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:29,250
up however further attempts to code
execution that have turned over to Felix

837
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:30,670
because I'm

838
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:34,170
how to put it wants to start wearing
suit checkers this just not enough time

839
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:35,260
for that

840
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:38,490
arm but is this basic stuff even I can
do

841
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:42,420
so you should definitely look into that
than

842
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:47,200
the other conclusion is that I present
my both hypervisor security research

843
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,540
is really hot want to dig deeper into
this real

844
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:54,090
the memory management and scheduling in
context with

845
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:57,770
switching stuff you really need to spend
a lot of time in there

846
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:01,130
and you really wish you would have debug
symbols on

847
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:06,230
as can get really difficult one to look
for a few hours number

848
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:11,120
and even verified code contains box
which can easily be exploited which goes

849
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,550
very well with the next

850
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:16,430
arm conclusion that there's still a lot
of fun to be explored

851
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:20,090
and much less Asian Games a lot of
features

852
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:23,250
I every new iPad was a virgin has
additional features

853
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:26,900
arm but the Securities not continuously
improved

854
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:30,280
um during I like putting a puzzle
actually

855
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:33,660
accidentally found in additional denial
of service back in the MBR

856
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:37,930
so this is really plenty of stuff for to
be explored yet

857
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:41,410
on and one important message about
talkers on

858
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:44,630
that may have more researchers should do
that the bus the box

859
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:48,570
a box that were discovered this year is
all the more like traditional software

860
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:49,620
vulnerabilities

861
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:54,110
but it we think that a lot of research
just don't look into hypervisors

862
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:59,620
because they think it's too complicated
but he should definitely start doing up

863
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:02,600
in order to make the theoretical
practical and provide at least some

864
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,490
denial of service

865
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:11,490
exploit code thanks for your time

866
00:52:17,589 --> 00:52:19,059
good

867
00:52:19,059 --> 00:52:22,710
West I'm

868
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:29,710
yes

869
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:38,900
otherwise on yeah

870
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:42,790
yes it was passed in MS ms-13 a
ninety-two

871
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:49,790
and also in Asia

872
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,830
so it's actually quite interesting
because

873
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:58,980
I have a theory why nobody find a spot
so

874
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:02,470
actually microsoft provides API you can
use to you too

875
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:05,870
too hyper cause and a new files the
actual email you

876
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:09,100
you pass to the hype hype accord but you
never of ice

877
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:12,330
fast exclude guest physical address so
if the

878
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:16,580
if the researchers so hyper real
researchers are probably microsoft-based

879
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:18,520
so they're probably working on my

880
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:22,640
with using the nose and and you just use
the API and

881
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:26,460
we try to do it on my notes and then we
got to lay a deeper & and Boch

882
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:30,950
popped up this is my series the contents
of the

883
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:34,920
the hype a call handlers probably rather
test that but the way how they are

884
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,580
called

885
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:42,580
this execution path it's probably not
that wild

886
00:53:49,779 --> 00:53:51,729
in

887
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:55,859
yes would

888
00:53:55,859 --> 00:54:00,380
good

889
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:05,319
well if they if they offer the hype a
call functionality that will

890
00:54:05,319 --> 00:54:09,309
still be a certain kind of interface all
that you can take

891
00:54:09,309 --> 00:54:13,979
in

892
00:54:13,979 --> 00:54:19,049
in

893
00:54:19,049 --> 00:54:22,170
that through the me know that text
surface reduces

894
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:29,170
of course on and we haven't tried that
yet

895
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:40,380
and all Appiah

896
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:45,480
a up

897
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:49,490
need is

898
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:56,180
yet survey 2 p.m. buses

899
00:54:56,180 --> 00:55:00,440
something we want to spend some
dedicated research time on

900
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,800
because basically the hyper cause or
something

901
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,970
you could probably since you're a pretty
good

902
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:10,200
but extreme securing the Amboseli

903
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:14,160
especially if the new BM generation used
to be a

904
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:19,400
realize in long-term %um both so two
more functionality you put inside a VM

905
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,730
costume or text surface you get and and

906
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:25,860
for the and well since pretty hard to
actually

907
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:30,410
the so you have to build your own to
change to to to attack to be and also de

908
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:31,030
Fermin

909
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:34,520
we're pretty sure there isn't that much
which research

910
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:38,730
have home yet Blanton maybe next year

911
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:44,880
troopers him

912
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,430
no I

913
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:55,430
up thank here

914
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:03,759
sorry comparable up

915
00:56:03,759 --> 00:56:04,009
me
