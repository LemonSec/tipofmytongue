1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,880
writer star from hello everybody

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,200
can you hear me up now okay so first

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,910
um I'm sorry for the delay but that was
in our team going on

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,949
so i thought id would be good too up

5
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,400
delayed the start of professional a few
minutes okay um

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,179
my name is Daniel and today I'm gonna
talk about then

7
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:29,579
USB host drive a puzzle which are
developed in the last couple of months

8
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:30,819
um

9
00:00:30,819 --> 00:00:34,329
actually little distraught disclaimer

10
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:38,100
so businessman implementation talk this
time um

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,850
we r deal finishing the test on the
software as well as the test

12
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,110
in fighting against the both stacks and
both drivers

13
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,930
so no exploit for giving to a given
today

14
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:55,810
I'm sorry but still it can be a %uh
interesting to see

15
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:59,760
first song I'll use people think it's
done

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,780
what you can do with it okay let's have
a look at the agenda

17
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,890
from I'm gonna talk a bit about to use P
basics

18
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,300
for basic stuff you need to know through
understand why

19
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,399
one would do host ronna pausing what you
need to do post-trial

20
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,420
then I'm gonna talk a little bit about
the hardware amusing

21
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,610
it's called based on support are

22
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,930
produced by our very neighborly neighbor

23
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:31,600
I'll also I'm gonna talk about the busy
putting toolkit I'm using for

24
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,030
Papa the input than I had to make some
conditions through the

25
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:40,400
pausing framework to get it song capable
of using

26
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,510
use be as I'm as an output and in the
and I will show some

27
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,690
examples for actually running use be
pausing

28
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:53,159
and none will discuss a few results we
already have

29
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,450
rate okay so

30
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,090
let's start with the basics who've you
have ever cared about USB

31
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,439
K

32
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,580
so I am yep

33
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,180
actually it's or so I guess I could hear

34
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,330
no is not here he would tell you use be

35
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,400
stands for Universal Serial Bus but
actually it's not about the network

36
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,709
and you will see why when you see a

37
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:26,319
what what goes over to USB cable okay a
few

38
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,620
basic so long let's start with his three
the

39
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,560
development abuse be started in 1994 I
was 20

40
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,700
first working started to be specified

41
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,310
band and was released in ninety 96

42
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:45,349
this was to use based on up 1.0 then
shortly after 1998

43
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:49,489
they updated the standard arm what's the
release 1.1

44
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:53,270
in 2001 they really from even faster

45
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,870
the super high-speed USB which issues be

46
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,770
release 220 and a few years ago they
were

47
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,420
release version 3.0 um

48
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,780
Moss finished armed is not widely spread
in

49
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,010
your hardware okay

50
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,200
um this is based on %uh is

51
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,690
developed by or was developed and still
is developed by a group of companies

52
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:22,830
on just listed the companies who started

53
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:27,180
arm defining though 1.0 specification

54
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,200
and so the standard is

55
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,980
on written by hand forum the

56
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:40,780
use be implementers forum or use P if on
with the operation you will find in all

57
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,290
your documents covering

58
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:49,290
anything refuse peace than about the
issue okay there are

59
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,209
mainly three different versions abuse be
still use today

60
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:56,860
which is burdened 1.1 with I'll 1.5

61
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,510
megabits per second version 2 with for
innovating megabit per second

62
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,569
and the new awesome

63
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:07,849
a fast use be free with for a

64
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:11,120
gigabit per second transfer rate

65
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,390
so this talk will only cover USB version
1.0

66
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:18,430
1.1 and 1.2 2.0 peco's the

67
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,500
hardware I'm using is only capable of
those two persons

68
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,949
so um all loop

69
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:28,590
for two wickets all the hardware is not
able to

70
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,130
a fast specific use be free elements

71
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:36,610
are but maybe if the neighbor releases a
new board

72
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:41,840
it will have to use be free support we
will see okay

73
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,350
so to understand the process abuse
before thing you need to know a little

74
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,199
bit about the USB descriptors

75
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:51,520
um Gareth burr

76
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,630
main descriptor the USB device
descriptor or

77
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:59,090
which itself identified through USB
device better stop in like

78
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,260
I'll this device this from

79
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:08,530
a given vendor id: and it has a given
product id:

80
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,699
on go through values are youth

81
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:16,229
arm by a host operating system to
identify the device

82
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:20,110
and also in the device descriptor order

83
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:24,259
wrong is a number all additional
configurations

84
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:27,979
you can request from the device so you
also

85
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:32,620
have a country ERATION descriptor one or
more configuration descriptor

86
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,419
so your device can run in different
configurations

87
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,380
arm then inside of the configuration
descriptor you haven't interface

88
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,550
descriptor:

89
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,590
which describes arm the interface to
using

90
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,940
on if you're devices in

91
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:53,090
I don't know external keyboard for
example you will use a

92
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:57,790
human interface device class a in the
interface descriptor:

93
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,860
and the operating system will
automatically know or care

94
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,270
I know HID You Me Too Faced device I can
do that

95
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:11,270
I don't need any proprietary driver
let's just load the USB keyboard driver

96
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,470
okay and there are also some other
descriptors like the young man point

97
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,310
descriptor

98
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,949
which describes the direction of the
data flow on you know it used to be and

99
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:21,910
point

100
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:27,370
and from also some capabilities of the
endpoint

101
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,830
to also you can request some strings
where is for example the vendor name

102
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:36,979
about it order to buy some mean what a
serial number

103
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:40,500
okay this is a short overview how the
descriptors are

104
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,090
I'll encapsulated in each other so you
first have to device descriptor

105
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:49,199
are in there is that number of
configurations

106
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,130
and you got that number of configuration
descriptor you can

107
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:57,759
address and they again have a number of
interfaces

108
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,199
and the interfaces we can happen number
of people

109
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,539
been okay

110
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:08,250
so from

111
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,880
on use P enumeration so if you plug in
the device through your notebook

112
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,600
what happened if first the operating
system will request the

113
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,330
device descriptor are read from the bike
to

114
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:24,770
device descriptor to number of possible
configurations

115
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:29,650
and also appealed which is called
default configuration

116
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,690
then it will request the

117
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:37,550
default all the selected configuration
descriptor

118
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,030
and inside of the country ERATION
descriptor are all the

119
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:45,069
other soccer sup descriptors and better
tho business the huge

120
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:50,699
arm or can be huge a bunch of data

121
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,080
um and once this configuration
descriptor

122
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,400
is parsed all the strings are the up

123
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,440
so inside after descriptor that's just
the reference

124
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,830
which says like okay on this point um
there should be a string but instead of

125
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,370
a string

126
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:09,620
I give you an index like 5 and if you

127
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,259
request on string descriptor with the
argument five people get

128
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:17,949
the string I'm referring to

129
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:21,250
okay this can be I thought that for
example that many factor in the name of

130
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,740
the product name

131
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,930
or a serial number

132
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,050
so if you from sniff on you use period

133
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,430
on you Universal Serial Bus than

134
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,899
you would get you will see something
like this saw you can see the

135
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:41,539
post booth requesting device descriptor

136
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:45,579
and the device on sis with the device
descriptor

137
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:49,329
and then the whole three quests a
configuration descriptor

138
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:53,489
again 35 on to sweep the configuration
descriptor

139
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:57,749
about not you see the same step again

140
00:08:57,749 --> 00:09:01,029
the only difference on both to

141
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:05,040
descriptor request just 11 of request

142
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,410
because and USB protocol

143
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:12,110
the holst from

144
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:16,079
if the whole three quests and a script
or to host has to define how long the on

145
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:17,749
thrus

146
00:09:17,749 --> 00:09:21,100
if the descriptor anyways is too big to
fit

147
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,860
into the size the device will just on so
with the

148
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,809
had of descriptor and

149
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:32,559
will also give back the full length of
the descriptor sold that the whole snows

150
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,350
okay I'll the last month was incomplete
I need to ask again

151
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:40,110
the big Europe a lot size:

152
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,670
and after what you can see all the
string reconfirm

153
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,649
descriptors are requested from the size
to concede goals are

154
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:54,230
different answers so both are all
different strength

155
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:57,679
okay from another point of use be

156
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:01,889
especially in this context appalling and
you guys

157
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:05,600
how does it stand with security what do
you think it's

158
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,420
news be all lost you spew and a secure
in the past

159
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,759
no you're right after

160
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:17,319
search for somewhere abilities from the
last year

161
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:21,809
and I'm we go there are some Windows
Phone abilities

162
00:10:21,809 --> 00:10:24,970
on positing USB device descriptor

163
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:30,049
are bare walls I'm Linux kernel driver
with a bottle overflow

164
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:33,519
and among use be handling

165
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,910
cold also found

166
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:41,279
nice arm Stack Overflow on Salon Iris

167
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,939
and there also you the space tools that
are

168
00:10:44,939 --> 00:10:48,170
vulnerable to attacks from the

169
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:51,239
you spin doctors

170
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:56,670
target but this isn't surprising that

171
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,819
it okay so much for the basics

172
00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:02,970
arm you know it's all about the
descriptors

173
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,999
and the first way and after wats when
the driver is loaded

174
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,179
there are some communication channels
established arm

175
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:15,639
we can also addressed up okay let's talk
about the hardware

176
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:20,459
I'm using some external hard work to do
the use be filing

177
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:24,100
this allows me to send wrought use P

178
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,049
pp to use so I'm not bound to any

179
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:31,459
a AP I am i operating system whose a.m.

180
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:36,369
exposing to me but I can just give raw
data to the hardware and hardware sense

181
00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:36,869
at all

182
00:11:36,869 --> 00:11:42,399
on you speak on the harbour I'm using
the face dancer

183
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,019
consists all first and use be too

184
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:49,600
what ship which is the whole connect so

185
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,660
my notebook running to father is
connecting wireless news be in the face

186
00:11:54,660 --> 00:12:00,269
then the UART interface is connected to
an MSP microcontroller

187
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:04,319
and the MSP microcontroller again is
connected 2 a.m.

188
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:07,889
Maxime use be controller and Beth

189
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:11,499
USB controller if the target connect so
this is where r

190
00:12:11,499 --> 00:12:14,709
connector post are one of us

191
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:18,519
and your about it it's not a lot of

192
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:23,459
stop on it looks like this so you can
see this is the host connect

193
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:26,589
you got to on Muse busy route to

194
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:30,459
you out connector and trip then you got
the microcontroller

195
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:37,459
and this is the maxine USB controller
which connects to the target ago

196
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,949
Arctic if you on talk to Travis he

197
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:46,899
on signs all about the PCB's

198
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:51,879
so if you're interested you you can get
them for a very low cost just for two

199
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:57,339
shipping cost I guess um and if you sold
for it it will look like this

200
00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:00,399
so I just got to mini USB and

201
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,499
to stop on the PCB

202
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:08,209
ok it it tho the face the answer is
controlled

203
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:12,579
from PC host and the PC users

204
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:15,600
a Python library to excess the hardware

205
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,920
and to deliver content to be

206
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,720
on to the target USB chip so all told

207
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,009
you gonna ride is in Python which is
really nice

208
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:30,290
because I'm developing and debugging on
an embedded system

209
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:33,459
both always painful and costs a lot of
tight

210
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:36,799
so its way faster and easier for me to
ride

211
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:39,859
the parting coat in Python and run it on
a

212
00:13:39,859 --> 00:13:43,429
arm on a notebook on

213
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:48,149
instead of putting all those cold
microcontroller

214
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:53,639
I also the you spiel I really the Python
library that comes with a stance or

215
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:58,279
implements on some basic layout of the
USB protocol

216
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:01,779
so you don't even have to go all the way
down

217
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:06,160
to arm to be a exchange and all that
stuff

218
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,889
this is here you can just do that you
have to implement

219
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:14,389
some a little bit of code you have to
implement new USB device and the

220
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:15,429
interface but that

221
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:18,699
it all the other stuff is already there
you just run it

222
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:22,529
and arm the nomination can happen

223
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:26,079
okay you will find peer a Saltcoats

224
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,089
and hardware arm stop

225
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:32,989
on sauce pot

226
00:14:32,989 --> 00:14:36,029
um take a look at it its

227
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:39,569
really nice project

228
00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:42,919
so this is just a screenshot of

229
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:46,399
the use P protocol layer so you see down
here is

230
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,589
the arm the

231
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:52,999
be a though layer one which is

232
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:56,480
link layer and BO link layer

233
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,089
up to here where the green border is a
is implemented in the

234
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:05,819
Maxim Hot which ship so this is way out
of focus we don't have to care about

235
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:09,889
getting bait on the cable we just cedar
rock pick up

236
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:13,040
paper you its then this up alia

237
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,049
which is orange I guess arm

238
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:19,759
is implemented in the faced anther use P

239
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,249
library so all you have to do is

240
00:15:23,249 --> 00:15:27,919
to implement your device called and all
the functions you want to run

241
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:33,699
on top of you speak

242
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:37,709
ok so the next point

243
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:42,019
is the parting tool kit um

244
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:45,169
this is the father I'm using to generate

245
00:15:45,169 --> 00:15:48,429
although for the payloads

246
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:51,959
and up going to stop the condition of
having here I'm sure

247
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:55,249
most of you will know it because it's
the first mention

248
00:15:55,249 --> 00:15:59,419
all a positing and academia

249
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:04,249
so I just skip this we're already
shopping time you can read later

250
00:16:04,249 --> 00:16:08,459
um so busy is a piping base-closing
toolkit

251
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:12,259
press release was in 2011

252
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:15,799
it got a quite simple packet the
Commission syntex

253
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:19,509
which is also piping and it boss

254
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:22,729
stateless filing as well as state for
putting

255
00:16:22,729 --> 00:16:25,739
obvious link to the latest release

256
00:16:25,739 --> 00:16:30,489
up just downloaded play around with

257
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:34,559
up so you're there you are I'll adjuster

258
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,989
yeah I quoted you before alright if

259
00:16:37,989 --> 00:16:41,160
I said when second would be here he
would say use P it's not a

260
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,720
past its network indeed

261
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,929
actor so I am

262
00:16:47,929 --> 00:16:51,519
this is the smallest packet definition
you coulda

263
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,609
think of so it contains just a variable
called name

264
00:16:55,609 --> 00:17:00,379
and after what you have to lists one is
called object and one is called

265
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:05,049
functions in this example it's
completely empty this is just a

266
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:08,880
bare skeleton you need I'll the

267
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,059
object a rare contains the single few

268
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:15,179
of the packet so if you look at your

269
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:18,699
Wireshark pick up this sector you will
see packets

270
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:22,360
I'll are split into different feel

271
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,199
let's say oh aversion peel the type you
to Glenfield

272
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:29,610
and once you know your packet a
structured like this

273
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:34,730
you can also put both free fields in the
object array

274
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:39,039
from now I said okay there is the length
field so someone in the generation of

275
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:39,720
the packet

276
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,049
11 has to be calculated and put in the
right place

277
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:47,179
so these stuff goes into the function a
raceway say

278
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:52,190
on after generating the packet you need
to call from functions on it

279
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:56,710
run some calculations

280
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:59,880
market away double objects are I we go

281
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,679
into a little deep on the next flight
but this I just

282
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,919
objects you're able to put in there and
also there are

283
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,409
some functions dickens they're all
described in the

284
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:15,779
read me file in them more detailed way
up

285
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:19,809
but I will give you shop introduction
you know so

286
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:23,110
let's take with packet description file
this is my

287
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:28,500
typical example up that's why it's
called example

288
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,860
and then you see again the Object List
and the functions list

289
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,169
this is the packet I just mentioned
before with a Type field

290
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:39,299
a bell length field and a value field

291
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:42,929
and that's exactly what process okay we
got free feel to you

292
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:46,679
one is called type I could have called
it whatever I want

293
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:49,929
than this field have a static land of

294
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:53,309
8 its also it has

295
00:18:53,309 --> 00:18:57,019
defaultValue of 0

296
00:18:57,019 --> 00:19:01,110
and when I stop putting process I want
to

297
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:04,259
I want this field to be mutated

298
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:09,779
in every possible among every possible
state so from 002

299
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:14,799
at and this is what wire put fall in
here so this field should be

300
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,909
fully fast after

301
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:22,080
so its almost the same for the next
field but this is called lengthen got

302
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,580
the default value of

303
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:28,059
on 6 and the last field now

304
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:32,299
is a value field it hath no static land

305
00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:37,210
so it can but the length of the field
can barry

306
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,250
the default value is the thrilling
father

307
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:44,190
so it has in default lentil 4-byte

308
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:47,820
but a while iterating over the field

309
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:53,750
its not but just called up wats from 0
to 0 FF like the other fields but

310
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,130
in on in this place in the packet there
is

311
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,580
from for each iteration a given
fostering

312
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:04,980
putting like used to kill injection 3 or
some code execution strings

313
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,179
or just yeah I'll pounds or

314
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:13,389
something like that arm both rings are
defined in

315
00:20:13,389 --> 00:20:17,889
you know text file and just red line but
I

316
00:20:17,889 --> 00:20:21,059
so and then in the end there is also
Island

317
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:25,990
function which is called after a packet
this generated in beta

318
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:30,730
and what this earth is please put
contribute Len

319
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,870
the land of all

320
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:37,379
fields from type to value

321
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:41,350
so the length all both three fields
miscalculated

322
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:48,350
and put into this destination feet

323
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,470
okay this really easy the just contains
field a plan

324
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:56,440
um this is what you will see in most of
your packet descriptions

325
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:01,210
smoth I could just carry a land
somewhere

326
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,549
um this knows the real world example
this is just another

327
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:07,820
a and up reply

328
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,730
so you see all the field up your up
package

329
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:15,029
in this case there is no function
because of have only state

330
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:18,059
static long fields and I got some

331
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:21,950
default values in here so this is up

332
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:28,950
absolutely functional stripped on you
can do up posing with pets

333
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,879
up just to show you a real world example

334
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:38,570
then there are even more object you can
use

335
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:43,019
for example the random object this one
just has a

336
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:46,590
name and the lawn and in each iteration

337
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:51,200
the whole length will be filled with
rhyming data

338
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,789
are then there is a list object

339
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:58,480
which again takes the name takes a
default value

340
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,809
and take the path to profile your

341
00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:05,289
on your system and and each iteration

342
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:11,200
one of the lines of the file will be put
in

343
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,710
band um this is just nom appeared again

344
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:19,190
as we saw amber first example and on the
and

345
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:22,429
Harrison link object which just

346
00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:25,990
got a name and a sauce and the content

347
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:29,539
all this object the content and the lamb

348
00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:33,730
will be the same as the content and the
land of the salt object

349
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:38,399
so in this case I'm just copying the
random generated data up here

350
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:41,980
on their aka

351
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,149
okay ban there is also a petting

352
00:22:45,149 --> 00:22:48,980
I don't want go through this in detail
up but you can also

353
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:53,409
pet beta aka so far

354
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:58,549
Baldor pick up prescriptions are with
picket descriptions you can only do

355
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:03,340
stateless father so you just go through
one packet and send it all out

356
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:09,590
on millions of times with different with
with small iterations in the packet data

357
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:12,779
but um what if you think about stateful
father

358
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:16,440
if you have to log in somewhere before
you can

359
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,549
on address the target the one of us

360
00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:23,360
than you need well some kind of
multi-step

361
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,480
function you first need to authorizes
I'll

362
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,929
go through the login procedure with
validate of course

363
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:33,019
you too doesn't make sense to start
causing you because you want to be

364
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:34,750
locked in and father something

365
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:38,379
of the works so arm

366
00:23:38,379 --> 00:23:43,059
I figured alt kind of an interaction
concept

367
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:46,499
arm this earth

368
00:23:46,499 --> 00:23:49,740
represented just by a serious of packets

369
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,100
or in this case packet description files

370
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,210
both pickups on both both pickups

371
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:00,740
I'll send out and or so I say

372
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,350
my first pick up this like the first
visit of the page

373
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:07,799
this one a set outdone on the on side
803

374
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:13,299
back the second packet this like my
authentication data with username and

375
00:24:13,299 --> 00:24:14,909
password and stuff like that

376
00:24:14,909 --> 00:24:20,269
and beyond sore is let their not
indication top

377
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:23,809
from I sent out this packet and read the
answer back

378
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:27,679
and and i need to put this up indication
talking an

379
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,399
my next packet which is the actual
causing pain or because no one of the

380
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:33,960
right some other stuff I can begin

381
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,860
holding I'm but I still need to copy the
authentication

382
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:41,070
beta and this can also be done

383
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:45,230
and the interactions so I can copy parts
of an answer

384
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:49,740
and use it in proper transmissions

385
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:54,519
arm to describe an interaction I use a

386
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:58,970
stimuli up a in

387
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:01,980
description file so you gotta

388
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,679
name again and you got some object and
you got functions

389
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,249
objects in this place are this object so

390
00:25:09,249 --> 00:25:15,059
do you get them name and you just
reference a packet prescription fight

391
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:18,350
so in this example from but who would
just

392
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,980
send out the first packet will read in
between

393
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:28,230
discard the right they took and signed
out the second pick up

394
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:32,980
okay this is just some made up example
let's go to more real-world example this

395
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,879
is beyond

396
00:25:33,879 --> 00:25:37,059
authentication and just talked about saw

397
00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:40,590
you happy or first visit of the page
which is

398
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:45,730
a pic description let's say HTTP GET

399
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:50,629
you can just were describe the nature to
be get in your packet description file

400
00:25:50,629 --> 00:25:53,870
on and turned it up so

401
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:57,490
up to what status right back but nothing
happens

402
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:03,429
at this step then the authentication
data is sent out

403
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:06,799
a so this contains to you the name and
password

404
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:12,289
after what date 03 back and in this case
because I got a copy function

405
00:26:12,289 --> 00:26:15,860
referencing for second repeat Step

406
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:19,519
um data is copied to be

407
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:22,700
more precise the date or from the on
ther

408
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:27,389
from offset on direct turned 20 X 20

409
00:26:27,389 --> 00:26:30,830
is extracted from the on for office hour

410
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,980
and is transfer into the field name

411
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,879
all in the next this so we need

412
00:26:37,879 --> 00:26:41,809
a field named all and Beth pick up
prescription pile

413
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:45,690
and this field is automatically filled
each time

414
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:50,029
um you read back you up indication coach

415
00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:53,210
and done the last one the Kaman is

416
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:56,230
arm where I want to put my housing
payloads

417
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:59,559
so a this file will be

418
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:04,179
iterator with each %uh step through the
interaction

419
00:27:04,179 --> 00:27:07,999
so arm beef

420
00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:12,480
free packets us and our each time I'm
going through one iteration so

421
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,159
I'm visiting first I'm authenticating
ban and sending

422
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,559
that the fault packed than on

423
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:24,970
are mutating this packet soul a I
somewhere to change a value of Meyer

424
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:29,159
off the field I'm currently farthing
that I'm going through the whole process

425
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:32,019
again and sent into perspective I'm up
indicating

426
00:27:32,019 --> 00:27:35,730
and I sent the mutated come on packet

427
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:39,340
and so on and so on so I'm only mutating
the last pick up

428
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:43,809
in this case because um I just wanna
party

429
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:50,809
the arm the authenticated come

430
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:56,379
okay so far for busy

431
00:27:56,379 --> 00:27:59,779
and disease packet descriptions

432
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:02,840
from now I had to at some

433
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,200
use be additions to do the to get it
work against

434
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,429
use be and

435
00:28:10,429 --> 00:28:13,639
I had to modified the main program and

436
00:28:13,639 --> 00:28:17,389
at to new output types so you can now
instead of

437
00:28:17,389 --> 00:28:21,129
just raw Ethan at the CPU the P&S ATP

438
00:28:21,129 --> 00:28:26,409
you can also select on the USB
descriptor ought to use P and point

439
00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:31,429
as an alt

440
00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:36,649
so also I at some busy to face than to
glue

441
00:28:36,649 --> 00:28:40,519
which is implemented in the you speed up
I and

442
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:45,429
this mainly implement the from but the
Bison USB interface

443
00:28:45,429 --> 00:28:49,769
required by the paste and so Python
library

444
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:54,259
um to emulate the USB device

445
00:28:54,259 --> 00:28:59,809
and also there is the class implemented
to which is used by busy to

446
00:28:59,809 --> 00:29:03,029
start/stop control to use the threat

447
00:29:03,029 --> 00:29:10,029
delivering you pay lots

448
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:14,149
okay arm there were

449
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:17,200
the coding part up

450
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,679
anyway if if you if you're interested in
the cold just have a look at it

451
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:23,879
at some on the website is: showed you
before

452
00:29:23,879 --> 00:29:27,950
if you have any questions 22 your in
place of the code just

453
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:32,809
drop in the mail I'm always happy to
answer questions about cold

454
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:37,570
um market but not less see how this
would work

455
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:40,970
from in the whole process salt

456
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:44,519
okay I know all this you implemented a
lot of new stuff you can do use be no

457
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:44,889
but

458
00:29:44,889 --> 00:29:48,769
how do I do it our kids so

459
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:52,429
first you have to choose your target so
they're on

460
00:29:52,429 --> 00:29:55,700
many targets on use P so you could

461
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,779
address the device descriptor you could
address for example configuration

462
00:29:59,779 --> 00:30:01,460
descriptor of some string descriptor

463
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:05,259
or on something in the extended
descriptors

464
00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:09,200
or you could just target one and point

465
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,419
so and points are the connection to
actually data is transmitted

466
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:17,860
arm in the example

467
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:21,059
i jus just a are one of two descriptors

468
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:26,360
for these topics

469
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,970
but um the script of causing

470
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:34,639
targets the use peace take up your host
operating system

471
00:30:34,639 --> 00:30:37,980
where the endpoint farthing targets the

472
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:41,029
use P drive attached to your

473
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:44,840
USB device so this driver might a puppy

474
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:50,440
from the operating system vendor all
from pop pop

475
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,539
at yep this is the interesting part

476
00:30:53,539 --> 00:30:56,840
old all scrappy USB Drive us delivered
by

477
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:01,639
thought parties running inside a few
karnal

478
00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:07,899
on does I'll be interesting us

479
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:11,529
okay but well now I want to Foss

480
00:31:11,529 --> 00:31:14,909
some USB device or the driver for

481
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:18,559
some USB device but actually I don't own
the device how to get

482
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:22,210
the descriptor sunny I need to see a
religious

483
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:25,460
descriptor before I can from start

484
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:29,480
splitting it up into fields and put it
into a pickup description and stop

485
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,610
putting up with the script

486
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:34,320
a purse need to know how it looks
originally so

487
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,470
this earth while we are currently um

488
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:40,519
setting up and online collection

489
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:44,909
all use the device descriptor and
configuration descriptor

490
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:50,470
um arm register the main use be
descriptive third Kong

491
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:54,179
their is no content yet but there will
be

492
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:57,340
a paper base with use be tooth a.m.

493
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:01,210
use the descriptors you can contribute

494
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:05,350
to the collection a pic by submitting
just the output album

495
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:09,820
LSU's be which almost every Linux user

496
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:13,210
could do um but you can also

497
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:16,649
in a in the case of a more complicated
descriptor just

498
00:32:16,649 --> 00:32:20,239
delivered to the script a raw Justin X

499
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:26,889
arm but this would require additional
tools

500
00:32:26,889 --> 00:32:29,970
okay so wants you

501
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:33,080
230 bias are you driver you want to
address

502
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:36,869
and you somehow manage to get to an
original

503
00:32:36,869 --> 00:32:40,549
on get your hands on an original
descriptor

504
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:44,080
saw you know got the descriptor the next
step is

505
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,629
you need some hardware you need are and
host PC to run

506
00:32:48,629 --> 00:32:53,190
opposing tool unit B famous faced and
support

507
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:56,559
you need to use P cables to connect both
and of cause you need

508
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,600
some target then

509
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,840
you need a bit of software I which means
for new Python interpreter and

510
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:08,730
but the the framework on the host unita

511
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:12,999
use be device file which in this case if
the

512
00:33:12,999 --> 00:33:16,379
from values be descriptor

513
00:33:16,379 --> 00:33:19,909
you 84 did get got from real device

514
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:23,269
art from the database online and then

515
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:30,269
you need your actual hopping payload
which is the packet description file

516
00:33:31,149 --> 00:33:34,539
after Sol let's go through it step by
step

517
00:33:34,539 --> 00:33:39,009
you choose to take to descriptor from a
really hot

518
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:43,730
from from from real hardware so you need
to attach the hardware to your system

519
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:47,739
you need to find on which part to
disconnect that and then get

520
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:51,090
the output of the other issues be then

521
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:55,720
I got them my own kind of idly
postscript who tries to possibly

522
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:00,629
LSU's be output and got it into
something

523
00:34:00,629 --> 00:34:03,769
aren't busy can use with

524
00:34:03,769 --> 00:34:07,980
which is then your use be descriptor 5

525
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,059
are the script is not perfect

526
00:34:11,059 --> 00:34:15,960
it's not working for a very complex
descriptors

527
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,659
so does you should some take

528
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:23,530
raw from the device

529
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:26,720
techa the second step would be to

530
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,119
create a modified to paleo you're
putting payload

531
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:33,179
in this case I to stir

532
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:37,000
configuration descriptor um

533
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,239
packet description this file already
comes with busy so I wrote this to

534
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,440
script once

535
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,730
you can just use it on modify it to you

536
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:49,730
two units arm

537
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:52,760
for example if you set every

538
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,339
fields to full funding departing will
never end

539
00:34:56,339 --> 00:35:02,700
it moon both the way too much iterations
on too much mutations to go through

540
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,020
so you have to decide okay I'm gonna

541
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:10,839
I'm I'm going to target this field on
this run and maybe the other two feel

542
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:17,510
for the next run

543
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:21,780
okay saw once you got their payload
ready

544
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:26,319
you just need to attach the hardware so
put the paste and support in between

545
00:35:26,319 --> 00:35:29,380
you host and target

546
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:33,339
and than just run the but the public

547
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:36,700
in this case the surfer to the command
for starting

548
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:40,290
use P descriptor fathering and

549
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:44,549
you using this 'em use be

550
00:35:44,549 --> 00:35:48,790
descriptor file to emulate the device

551
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:52,549
also you gonna target the configuration
descriptor not the device the script

552
00:35:52,549 --> 00:35:53,040
about

553
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,540
the configuration descriptor and he goes
to pay told

554
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,760
so want to launch this command

555
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,829
it will take a while because um

556
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:08,920
use P take some time to I'll

557
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:13,200
connect itself to be recognized by the
host that there is a new device attached

558
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,240
to be enumerated from the host

559
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,130
um some systems to it a couple of times

560
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:23,359
other operating systems just do it once
so

561
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:27,710
it also depends on your target how long
this process will take

562
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:32,290
up and then again bizarre in my tests I
came about from there

563
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,549
for 25 seconds parts right

564
00:36:35,549 --> 00:36:38,690
which is really really law

565
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:42,510
normally I'm fathering something like
but there are no

566
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:45,950
at the layoff tenths of a second between
the packets

567
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:49,280
no one talking about 425 seconds

568
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:56,280
per iteration so the funding process
would be will be slow

569
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,809
got and the last and final step would be

570
00:37:00,809 --> 00:37:05,150
you have just two attach why a shock to
you you spin 180

571
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:08,480
and watch the process happening

572
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,369
you don't have to watch it a while it's
running but you should recall

573
00:37:12,369 --> 00:37:15,819
it in the case something crashed

574
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:19,390
but you can see what happened act or
what pic it actually got some out and

575
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:21,099
how to host responded and

576
00:37:21,099 --> 00:37:24,200
on which step of your arm

577
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,790
maybe more click multi-step I'm set up

578
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:30,829
the host crashed okay

579
00:37:30,829 --> 00:37:35,440
I'm to sniff use be in windows: use be
packed in a pick-up is needed

580
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:42,440
on you will find it here

581
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,680
okay so this was a

582
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,619
real-world example that's exactly the

583
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:54,630
methodology which currently using to run
abuse befuddling

584
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:59,450
but as i sat it's really really slow
it's running for a long long time

585
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:04,890
and so we don't have any spectacular
results by now

586
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:08,059
but we got some results those are mainly
from the

587
00:38:08,059 --> 00:38:12,540
development face when I was writing the
cold and testing at the code is working

588
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:17,490
arm some stuff happened

589
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:21,520
so yes i sat with didn't perform all
white skin following

590
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,960
or white scale of I'll when ability
analysis on USB devices

591
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,390
um still I triggered some

592
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:34,299
unexpected behavior for example

593
00:38:34,299 --> 00:38:37,829
host or use piece that crashed

594
00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:40,920
this happens on Windows seven and

595
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,270
Linux on both systems in are

596
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:48,930
a recent version so ten-point her
3-point and it's not too late too strong

597
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:52,059
but it's not an old one

598
00:38:52,059 --> 00:38:55,200
also I think the windows 7 was nearly
fully patched

599
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,380
I'm not sure for if there was

600
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,270
the update published on there are not
that was why did why do you develop

601
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:05,589
but both where recent systems

602
00:39:05,589 --> 00:39:09,079
and get be crushed also I saw

603
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:12,319
software crushing running on the target
so

604
00:39:12,319 --> 00:39:16,579
Skype for example whatever Skype us
listening to

605
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:20,970
your USB interface then I also tried to

606
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:24,809
attack about July system so in this case

607
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:28,970
our youth the Ember to brought to life
the host

608
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:33,319
and then just attached taste answer to
this

609
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:36,940
virtual machine so I got two cables from

610
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:41,319
Meyer both connecting to the face that
and

611
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:44,900
on mi amor for example after a few
iterations

612
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,030
I got this little arrow

613
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:52,530
Sol but true be amber wasn't able to
connect the device

614
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:56,079
Nole to virtual machine

615
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,920
and after what I couldn't attach any USB
device at all

616
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,990
to the virtual machine so I somehow
crash

617
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:09,990
be at work should use be spec I guess

618
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:14,760
put it we nor we are I been investigated
those precious

619
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:20,240
in creeping into because it was just
while I'm testing the implementation

620
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,640
and implementation in this case what's
the main preview

621
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,640
but no worries we will investigate

622
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,170
both crashes in the future we're
currently

623
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:33,539
on running a Sat of 'em

624
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:37,140
news be fathering instant us against

625
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,319
a series of targets but as I thought
they were

626
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:45,210
run for a long time

627
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:49,130
okay now I'm have to conclusions

628
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:53,740
um first from

629
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:58,200
you have to see in the past um use be
fussing

630
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,430
was really expensive to do because you
need

631
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:04,890
specialized hardware you need a a big

632
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:08,109
use BBD bag in box or whatever but

633
00:41:08,109 --> 00:41:12,819
from by now there is low-cost hardware

634
00:41:12,819 --> 00:41:16,460
really cheap artwork um

635
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:20,930
with which you can actually do use be
father

636
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:25,280
and test you use be implementations or
the implementation of your

637
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,200
operating system so up

638
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,770
I'm from my perspective would say expect
the pontiff

639
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:37,849
new use beautiful new bilities to show
up in the future

640
00:41:37,849 --> 00:41:42,430
because as more people start looking at
this topic

641
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:48,849
there will be more fight mix

642
00:41:48,849 --> 00:41:52,770
