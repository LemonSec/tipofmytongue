1
00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:07,080
so thanks everyone for joining things
set to perform

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,320
hiding place here an earlier

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,670
again threatening great conference a
great atmosphere

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:18,109
especially having the the ACP specific
SAP track

5
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:21,599
he's awesome to see so many thoughts on
to be able to

6
00:00:21,599 --> 00:00:24,730
talk to to so many speakers have

7
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,019
the six period so this there was about

8
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,380
SAP BusinessObjects am it's a

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,550
how many of you and is familiar with

10
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,640
Business Objects are is running this is
not good okay

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,519
and are many be there an assessment to
the business of implementation

12
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:46,600
my thats also violent here and so

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,309
lebanon talked about and befriend
attacks and or

14
00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:55,160
techniques that can be used and by
someone who hath

15
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,570
break broke into an SAP BusinessObjects
system

16
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:03,199
and then the on to understand the actual
critique idea these kind of

17
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,470
attacks sonya them

18
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,530
a disclaimer 32 relator looking at the

19
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,220
like so for those of you who are not
familiar with an absence with the

20
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,680
company that we work for

21
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,550
a the company specializes on SAP
security with disability but

22
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:24,920
wholly focused on SEP we are heartened
trainings

23
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,180
presentations am we want to reduce

24
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,290
also to SEP am so we will seek ways for
90,000

25
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,370
subsidy to know we develop software on

26
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,380
perform contests to SAP implementation
so

27
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,690
those are being the sources of
information that we good

28
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,130
and blast the research in order to and

29
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:50,310
but from this kind of presentations and
two holes presentations on security

30
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,100
conferences

31
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:56,290
and myself I'm and one of my mind any
suspension so

32
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:00,180
maybe day peace so much easier to to
remember so

33
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,820
JP am and were

34
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,990
you into into this assault a movie and
even there are

35
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:12,200
researcher at an ass research labs on
presentation is part of a larger project

36
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,950
we did on

37
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,070
Business Objects me up smeeting around
35

38
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:20,970
advisories doesn't sound that good I and
the statistics comparison but

39
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:25,670
we can talk about any of them as for the
presentation but we still working post

40
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,540
exploitation

41
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,060
faces other thanks to with

42
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,410
and is basically the on-axis have been
performing a research

43
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:38,170
brushing I'm is working with SAP in
order to fix this when I read is

44
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,650
and we are going to be focusing mainly
on the PawSox plantation

45
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,800
to understand the release can to see
that kind of information that the come

46
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,440
together

47
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,930
by an attacker from been subject to
error as a starting point

48
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:55,130
an attacker will be able to break
initial break into SAP system

49
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:59,340
the day and this this is such a tease
them by any of these when a religious

50
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,510
okay so this is the antenna

51
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,959
and we're gonna do an international and
talk about

52
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,230
SAP BusinessObjects you'll introduce are

53
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,080
you are not familiar with the with the
power out too to the technology

54
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,680
then we're gonna talk about being in
attack a life-cycle

55
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,620
what's a what it broke my heart but then
shattered into our

56
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,910
ACP's a shitty them on other

57
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,310
details and then we're gonna draw some
conclusions are

58
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,959
that you should be aware of asa SAP
customers

59
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:37,209
you know to secure the SAP Business
Checking station so

60
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:41,580
where you're probably aware of this
right hearing your sleepy track

61
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,709
all a PR familiar with the SEC fans you
know all these because

62
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:49,280
you sign in previous presentations as
well I'm you know that

63
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,849
and business partners are being my
handle on it through the third see them

64
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:58,739
but we're here not to discuss about this
ABC stance but

65
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,950
about SAP BusinessObjects system and
what's this opinion such

66
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,930
YouTube a lot that was acquired by SEP
in 2007

67
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,860
that most may need to perform recent
editions

68
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,069
to produce reports to be used pay

69
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:17,720
keep a at KIPP ice keeper syndicators

70
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,799
bash words information that is usually

71
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,999
not consumed buying unusually the

72
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:27,930
other exceptions but you should not
consumed by and

73
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:32,219
mayor like regular people or you are in
place but

74
00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:35,319
you shouldn't for the upper management
right so it's

75
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:38,479
and information that issues to base

76
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,499
and to take decisions and to act upon
that

77
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:44,719
so that's where I'll least we could go
because you can

78
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:48,999
if an attempt is able to brake in turn
be has a pretty thin among friends

79
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:50,939
information he will be able to

80
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:54,580
potentially modified including your crap

81
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,389
of someone who said this is to make
soulless

82
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:02,949
am some other and some other detainees

83
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:06,339
we should eat receiving information it's
connected to

84
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:10,080
there is a suite for example like ERP
CRM

85
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,749
I'm all the rest of the broke from the
business Wheaton and

86
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:18,379
it's receiving permission from their so
it's not specifically processing

87
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:22,180
basis im functions it's not witnessing a
purchase order

88
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,289
without creating a new vendor but it's
receiving

89
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:28,749
all that we are information and the
production information in order to

90
00:05:28,749 --> 00:05:29,800
concern with these

91
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,120
processes information and denied these
their reports and is that even a

92
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,680
done we have been talking about

93
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,779
so this is and something that you

94
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:45,339
so I'm you will see many times but

95
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:49,069
maggie has a point to be here okay so
let me go to that point

96
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:53,529
so as ABC's best we all know that its
processing with information on

97
00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:56,699
we all understand the impact of a
security breach

98
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:01,419
we can group that in baton to a smash
attacks like when it got in from a stone

99
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:05,409
celebration trackside stopping to see
them stopping business processes

100
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:08,909
baking interfaces or even pro attacks
like

101
00:06:08,909 --> 00:06:13,330
having financial information and bank
account numbers great conformation more

102
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,189
refined

103
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:18,119
and the salary ass wysong in our example

104
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:23,830
so thats pretty clear for everyone right
but then went one gust tube is a suction

105
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:27,949
you through me will be more complex to
understand the they're letting back from

106
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:28,930
beach into them

107
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,309
kind of East systems right because
percent not processing missus

108
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:36,360
but it's not a actually executing
business processes

109
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,129
its only holding information coming from
bill

110
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:45,580
but nothing but I'm so that the Greek
god I'm gonna show you some examples

111
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,809
for example fine ash a statement a
company

112
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:52,039
and who's in the stock market good and

113
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:55,499
every like every quarter are leaving
yearly could generate

114
00:06:55,499 --> 00:07:00,619
a national statement report or how they
finance is doing how they say so doing

115
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:03,930
I'm a consultant information that

116
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,360
could be really useful for someone who
wants to in best

117
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,629
or even say the he stocks right so

118
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:14,490
that's a we r II like baby shower

119
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:19,110
example but then you have decisions such
as budgeting us to think that our

120
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,569
they can up Braun having this report CAD
in Business Objects

121
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:27,099
sales forecasting group banging all this
kind of

122
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:30,669
information is being actually generated
they are on

123
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:35,399
group potentially be modified I'm be the
in back to the business could be really

124
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:39,369
hi so it's not like a they written but
they're

125
00:07:39,369 --> 00:07:42,680
such as the one we usually a talk about
you

126
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,300
sabc stance but this is and I the type
of thing but because we can

127
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,960
even and get information from this is 10
information that's coming from protect

128
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,960
the environment

129
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,929
on and another option is to modify the
beholder

130
00:07:56,929 --> 00:08:00,199
of the decision-makers why I should be
their

131
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:03,580
reading this reports so

132
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,279
it's all about business intentions right
so it's all about reports it's all about

133
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,639
indicators

134
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,219
on it how hostess actually happening

135
00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:16,909
this happen because it but I some
connections to the

136
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:20,830
in the subject I'm we will happen to the
slide

137
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:24,020
with some acronyms that are a little
actually

138
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,449
Bobi I'm BW you you know that

139
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:31,319
SAP has a lot of acronyms that are
changing in time

140
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:35,070
problems new new releases new bastions
but with

141
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:39,389
conceptually real this is actually
blends the process of presentations I'm

142
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:40,839
being warehoused

143
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:44,259
in the consolidation of or the business
information so

144
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:48,430
well what's the well unless there is
something I didn't hear it because

145
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:52,470
you should be that's the most common
scenario or be inserted East

146
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,970
not directly connected to a business
suit but

147
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,810
to live in his seat through a be
business warehouse

148
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:03,380
system the extraction from the

149
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,709
me this week to Evans warehouse month
through Google

150
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:10,009
that's a very technical concept a in the
background

151
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:13,050
FC calls so somehow

152
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:17,000
forward to keep their acid information
somehow the information is

153
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,740
prone to abuse be there are you and then
blowing

154
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:25,589
it's actually consuming the information

155
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:29,560
so now we're just going to describe a in
the tense the

156
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,920
the ACA detour on some of their more
technical pop

157
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,139
so this is an architecture diagram from
or diversion from PO XI are three

158
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:42,690
and we want to go over it take for ever
take too long but it's really out there

159
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,420
that can make a couple points

160
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,839
one is business objects isn't one
application one process the default

161
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,190
installation may have

162
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:53,690
20 processor excusable running at once
and most of them are actually exposed to

163
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:54,690
the users so

164
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,329
boast the blue boxes in the middle there
actually just process communicating with

165
00:09:58,329 --> 00:09:59,470
each other

166
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:03,240
there's a pipe through the middle and
that's gonna be in Corpus service bust

167
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,970
bus which will talk about the second so
that's awful diagram other

168
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,949
I think there's a little bit easier way
to break it down into four tiers

169
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:16,660
the top tiers a client ear and see other
top left there that's a browser point

170
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,040
nice

171
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,389
typically wear user used to using
Business Objects they log into the app

172
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:25,690
the maybe the CMC or one of the other
business objects applications

173
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,730
top right is gonna be packaged
applications so this is something

174
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:29,149
somebody

175
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:33,970
downloads installed just up and
communicates Business Objects

176
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:37,579
that these in the application tier so
this is basically you where the

177
00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:41,519
clienti restrains lead to something that
business objects can understand

178
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,370
I see their job for dotnet and it would
be the STK also so

179
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:50,250
if the developer was developing out soon
probably be within the application tier

180
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,399
in the gray the bottom there in the
middle I should say

181
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:57,069
is infrastructure tears I was the
majority of that map before

182
00:10:57,069 --> 00:11:00,870
its infrastructure tearin each one of
these cards has their own job in a

183
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,430
typically have a listening network

184
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,269
Porter listening port on the network

185
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:09,220
and they each have their own processor
thing that they do and they communicate

186
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,620
with each other

187
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,279
at the bottom is the data tier and so
this is where that user names passwords

188
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:17,990
stores the deer that you're actually
reporting on or your connections to

189
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:23,250
like the ERP systems it can be
relational databases XML

190
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,730
text files business objects actually
supports a lotta I'll

191
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:31,079
background data tier

192
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:34,399
the Services will come up a bit so we
put a mine kinda one slide

193
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,060
the first one is the central management
server which is like to bring a Business

194
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,220
Objects

195
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:43,319
it knows all the IP's and knows all the
poor it's it's it's a very important

196
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:47,779
so person in Business Objects are the
second one is the father passed or

197
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:49,009
service so

198
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:53,569
as GP mention one other big points a
Business Objects is creating reports

199
00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:56,860
and so this would be where reports are
outputted or actually the templates

200
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,199
where they come from

201
00:11:58,199 --> 00:12:02,509
so it's a big part up through the
contact the presentation really

202
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:05,939
server intelligence agent start a South
processes

203
00:12:05,939 --> 00:12:09,410
it's a small job but it tends to have a
really high privilege so it's an easy

204
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:09,970
target

205
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,829
a cousin has the privilege Eastern Star
process

206
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:17,810
at the bottom you as a client endpoint
again this would be like the web app so

207
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:21,079
central management console is how you
administer Business Objects

208
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:24,870
you compromise I didn't create users you
can do anything you want to the

209
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:29,279
to PO very bottom its Web Services

210
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,290
will be less important but there were
some good attacks few years ago

211
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:36,699
for web services

212
00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:39,980
I'm terms a communication there's really
two major

213
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:44,620
communication protocols besides it
seizes are one is a sheepy services

214
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,129
most using be familiar with that through
the browser so

215
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:51,740
want obviously P for web services rest
is

216
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,079
is available now it's probably gonna be
more in the mobile space

217
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:58,490
but at the bottom here we have poor not
sell majority those Prosser

218
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,879
communicating with each other's

219
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:06,420
through korva so it is very important to
this object itself

220
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,149
soak or wasn't paid by SAP it was
created by a group called the OMG which

221
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:12,019
was like a group of our

222
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:15,139
a big companies they got together to
define a standard that they needed at

223
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:16,129
the time

224
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,899
it's really similar job are my so if you
look at it P cap it looks

225
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:24,110
very similar and it's because it falls
under distributed object paradigm that

226
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,180
both mister v- object paradigm so long

227
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,040
SAP p4 and what that basically means is
that you can invoke

228
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,350
objects and another process or another
system which is in

229
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,689
kinda cool concept rate is before web
services

230
00:13:36,689 --> 00:13:39,720
this is a long time ago and so you'd be
able to

231
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,910
create objects another process so like
let's say I hello world server

232
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:47,870
and I like you to be able to create a
hello world are you to build invoke lol

233
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,240
client

234
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,839
basically you'd be allowed to do that
through Corp

235
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:58,170
use I O P network protocol so korva can
be actually local or it can be over TCP

236
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:03,439
which Wendys IRT I use it. else to
define interfaces expose

237
00:14:03,439 --> 00:14:06,949
so this is like the description out the
actual object itself

238
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:11,089
so use a hello world example if I have
my server and I like for you to be able

239
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:12,279
to invoke it

240
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:15,889
I would give all my idea I'll and you
compile it with whatever

241
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:20,360
language you like so Java Python you'd
actually get a version that could invoke

242
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,240
that hello world object

243
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,079
it's designed to facilitate with
communication systems on different

244
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:28,209
platforms so

245
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:31,410
I could be Linex you can be when does
and we can work together

246
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:37,259
so it's it's it's pretty cool its just
it's that much order protocol

247
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:42,050
the second component so besides the
ideology I idea in Iowa are so and I O R

248
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:45,089
as a reference to remote object so

249
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:48,319
using hello world again if I give out my
I O R

250
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:52,499
you actually know the IP the port and a
reference to my specific object

251
00:14:52,499 --> 00:14:57,180
so is really the two things that you
need to be able to involved objects

252
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:01,139
the example components would be like if
I've given and I are insisting

253
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:02,810
hexadecimal characters

254
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,959
if you would actually take it apart you
would see the object

255
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:10,129
so like hello hello world the host and
the poor

256
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:13,230
and not a token but that is a token

257
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:17,800
bottom there him

258
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:24,800
well no chance second chance

259
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:28,560
okay so that that's the theory other a

260
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,660
in terms of how Business Objects
actually use it he's be a server has a

261
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,589
number of CORBA listeners so

262
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:38,160
probably in the neighborhood of 15 to 17
they can all speak

263
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,069
korva that you can ever involve objects
on so it's pretty important

264
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:46,559
again there's two components I O R so I
would give away the Iowa are so that you

265
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:47,069
can invoke

266
00:15:47,069 --> 00:15:51,370
object and in the idea I'll and the
ideal is a little more difficult because

267
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,089
you either have to know the idea I'll

268
00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:59,019
or you can reverse engineer the idea
I'll actually invoke the object

269
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:03,120
here's a quick example so let's see if a
client in if you have Business Objects

270
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,670
installation you can use it are you can
try this out

271
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:10,170
connect to see massive defaults and put
6400

272
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,689
have taken the string APS and it'll kick
back the IR

273
00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:18,949
the IRS just not look like I O R colon
strength hexadecimal characters

274
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:22,079
and if you actually parts and their
online parts as you can use you can

275
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,329
download tool

276
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:26,459
are you get the IP the poor and you
actually see the reference to the object

277
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:28,620
called object key

278
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,240
on the clients are you going to take
that you can create objects from it

279
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,180
and you'll actually be able to control
objects on the same us

280
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,459
thanks to our that basically those
letter

281
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:45,240
are introduction to understand the
upcoming

282
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,339
attacks on texting that President Obama

283
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:51,399
so will not affect us the

284
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:55,029
we said that this is not an ordinary
sabc them

285
00:16:55,029 --> 00:16:59,540
this is a assist in the race actually
and creating reports on consumer

286
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,759
information

287
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:04,020
so lisbeth will do you have the two
because now you're

288
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:09,220
we in 10 arson attackers about the
attackers a quick scrutinise

289
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,680
going out I stations but the

290
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:17,290
primary attacker these kind of a
solution or this kind of both

291
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:20,540
I'm gonna be either the entire tucker

292
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:25,070
or potential competitor who wants to
modify the behavior or global

293
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:25,900
information

294
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:31,560
I there is no it like action our
financial information both say such as

295
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,480
bank account numbers and mid grade class
information

296
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,620
that can be easily X Factor like been
lost it direct

297
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:44,580
profile for the attack there would be be
there in timeout after all the

298
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:49,650
competitor whose trying to global
information or modify the behavior

299
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:54,220
so no matter what identifiable need to
define monitoring processes

300
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,110
understanding these the saying attack
lands bill

301
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,300
on the final configuration and security
standards

302
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,629
over there we were about to mutilations

303
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:08,170
I will talk about the guides that i
prided basically also

304
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:12,250
so and its it's important to have that
in mind you know to the fine proceed

305
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,580
your sense again this time those

306
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:18,330
know to have the the beans assist system
secure

307
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:22,040
so yet we're gonna scheme to

308
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,670
and like then described reports that are

309
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:30,100
listening by the pool so but will
probably have the CMS

310
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,280
with 64 0.00% the CSA

311
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,370
I'm appalled that is listening also call
reputable

312
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:40,450
I needs the one that will tell you which
I will dynamically

313
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,910
ports as well so this is the local
primary poor and

314
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:47,780
for the consumption been patient than
you have with our intention station

315
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,380
that will take that would be the obvious
this

316
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,680
in patient or the service can be used to
start and stop

317
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,220
the services with him as the race which
could be

318
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,890
SQL Server mcsweeney sybase depending on
the best on depending on the

319
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,020
implementation

320
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,350
good good

321
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,630
him change mecham management these

322
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:11,890
and interesting because and business
options also

323
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:15,870
sheep with something there are sOooo to
do colder and Bethany

324
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:20,200
so it's also interesting to understand
that

325
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,470
the sport should not be exposed for
example find users

326
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:28,500
I've been the web application framework
this is that most common part or the

327
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,650
most well known for the ATM

328
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:35,100
because it's the they won recent don't
got and don't get is being used

329
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:40,010
to expose business Africa obligations
and so we were

330
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:44,090
hello there presentation about this I am
some time ago

331
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:47,900
new mainly based on business up said and

332
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:52,910
web interface so that's a just set for
you as a reference if you want to chat

333
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:56,350
but be safe presentations is more
focused on the

334
00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:00,040
in in town mouse on the progress on the
services of claim

335
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,190
business up so

336
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:08,180
be South those based on their boards
which I

337
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,340
more or less five or six there are other
parts

338
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:15,930
each one per service those services at
that and we'll describe

339
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:19,970
and very detailed so they are close to
fifteen

340
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:24,070
and the survey now XO all Nebraska dunno
which East Airport

341
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:27,920
assigned to each service but there is a
way to get beneath

342
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,010
because going through the 6400

343
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:34,340
you can basically query the ports for
its service

344
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:38,660
and global permission without good been
enough performing a scan

345
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,190
ticket this time so

346
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:47,960
for this we have a there are so this is
this comes from

347
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,440
the crowd this us

348
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,800
mister the anti-matter

349
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,830
this office Siena worth

350
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:03,520
on I here yes I

351
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,280
after iraq sewn together I was like

352
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,000
through here cement a bad outcome

353
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,510
him I also

354
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:18,700
I'll give you %uh and so I'm magazine
asked how

355
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,100
say give me all the IRS so this is a

356
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,930
all services run fire or

357
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,990
him or so the way it is

358
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:32,580
for takeaways here his ass

359
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,650
in a hotel everything us

360
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:39,840
not know if I'll he's a reason too long

361
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,230
I'll are I on your here

362
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:46,430
which is hi I'm fish core bizarre

363
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:53,050
partner okay

364
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:57,170
Wes source a swimmer the described on
them all

365
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:01,650
with will have their program are sweeter
pre-recorded we want to avoid the

366
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:05,040
there the mall probably we r

367
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,420
like name all program that usually
happens so

368
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:12,690
even though you can have grown it will
be just as well that it happen to other

369
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:16,500
also about and we tried to review the
lease that before

370
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,720
so what's the best the recommendation
the sense

371
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,730
with agreeing to SAP systems services
censorship with

372
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:28,550
lol test on their boards in the up stock

373
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:32,850
about mainly in the abstract all
standard honestok sorry also

374
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,880
there are and I have different parts

375
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,910
include on each application server so
put for

376
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,930
each one of the positions are a
sweetheart the Newport

377
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:46,180
different port that should not be
exposed to end-users

378
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:50,610
so with this in mind or rules official
also be restricted

379
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:54,400
if there is no obligation connecting
through karach those parts should never

380
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,320
be exposed

381
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,630
only their reputations I'm restricting
router reputations that should work

382
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:00,410
closely and you

383
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:07,410
so again this following reconnaissance
tackle I cycle

384
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:11,690
the next thing attacker may want to do
is identify account so is a few

385
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,010
different types of accounts & Business
Objects

386
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:18,310
is a private for most common the first
is required typeof a cow

387
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:21,920
which is enterprise cow so this is
default business these are business

388
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,500
objects only accounts

389
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:28,800
are the next next one is SAP ERP so
again if it's hard to do another SAP

390
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,520
system

391
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,920
and the counter alienist in SAP Council
be in there

392
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,020
know the reasons were put the site on is
if there are any lease accounts

393
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,760
then you take on any default accounts of
their default

394
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,470
SAP ERP accounts these may expose the
Business Objects implementations are

395
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:50,010
so important point to make same things
that all that happened when does a day

396
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:54,020
where Penn testing sure any protesters
in room even clue is part of it there's

397
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:58,330
almost always fall cow these are the

398
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:01,930
account to come baked into the product
so the administrator account is

399
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:05,970
again is an enterprise account it's the
highest privileged account Business

400
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:06,860
Objects

401
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:11,410
I it's in its in there by the fall but
it can be changed actually kinda cool

402
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,050
feature

403
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:15,400
you can actually change the name the
administrator account to take that risk

404
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:15,850
away

405
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:19,240
SM administer sable by the fall

406
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,010
cue AW a servant was actually enable the
iPhone therefore

407
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:26,250
and in the gas accounts for the gas
canister sable

408
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:30,900
but it seems pretty common actually
enable it which can be dangerous because

409
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,900
others some higher-level privileges to
the guest count on

410
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:40,000
should probably be given to a guest
count be only user in SA are specific to

411
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,460
are specific database counts sabio users
is suggested a cow

412
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,420
and an essay is gonna be hardcoded
account this would be in the fall

413
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,480
installation for

414
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,190
Business Objects for finally the bottom
LCM users so I

415
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:57,180
JP mention this in SVN server all seem
clear case it comes as part of the

416
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,070
installation

417
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:03,650
LCM users the hardcoded username that's
in there and actually there's a support

418
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:04,300
no for

419
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:08,430
but I the passwords stored nuclear tests
in the filesystem in the web app so it's

420
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:12,400
important to apply that no

421
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,270
CNN in the these are obvious and they're
in the minister guy with it they're just

422
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:20,530
so so important applying the most
up-to-date security notes

423
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:23,640
there's actually a vulnerability
previously in Web services where you

424
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,140
could enumerate accounts

425
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,470
are so again there's no for that now
also

426
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:32,640
cool features you can disable a news web
app sir web services in Afghanistan the

427
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,940
Ministry to guide it walks you through
how to

428
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:40,990
actually disable counts and lower the
risk

429
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:44,740
so keeping up their connaissance version
information is actually it's a little

430
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,900
hard to get

431
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,440
we can get major version information
pretty easily sold through the web

432
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,750
applications like this is a screenshot
from the I launch pad

433
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:57,560
before be 0 for it was called in for a
few attacker can do pretty basic attack

434
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,810
to figure out

435
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:03,510
what the major versions is also a
webservice set/sets call get version

436
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:06,890
annual return the version in its major
in first miner

437
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:11,170
so it's not pass level but I can get a
little more granular them say I

438
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:15,710
looking at the weather maps but still
useful

439
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:19,130
finally a warning about time in the
military axo all communication is an

440
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:20,270
accredited by the fall

441
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:23,790
Business Objects outta the box and so

442
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:27,470
the the first inclination might be
locked on a sheepy which is important

443
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:30,820
because the username the password is
pastor say over at

444
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,970
tom cat are but session can also we hide

445
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:37,680
hijacked korva San attacker who can view
any of those processes communicating

446
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,940
with each other

447
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:43,990
or any user coming in over the network
korva can still hijacked the cow

448
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:47,780
I'm we actually show that a little bit
later

449
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:52,490
in the Minister guide also it's a how to
install a South Korea says HTT

450
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:58,180
and then also korva

451
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:01,790
ok I'm and again and

452
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:05,440
so with us led the first part
reconnaissance

453
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,980
being able to identify there been such a
system being able to

454
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:12,400
understand what's there to do to what we
tell the protocols

455
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,420
it with other versions available the
producers

456
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,800
and so this is or the national
reconnaissance but then

457
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,890
you play an attacker's able to exploit
wanna be when I meet Easter

458
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:26,310
it's affecting the result consistent
system

459
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:30,180
any of their when I'm DC already
identified or anything where they

460
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:33,340
and like or even a week and

461
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,650
you something with bass were something
like that

462
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,670
then let's say that the attacker will be
able to

463
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:42,680
compromise the business object system
right

464
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,110
so what we need to focus by now East on

465
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:49,120
on understanding the actual release on
these

466
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,470
type of compliments for that too may
sure

467
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:56,010
I am like potential issues with this

468
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:59,090
which are intercepting I'm posting

469
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:02,500
get some basically you have the
information they are

470
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,700
you cannot modify the business
information because

471
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,720
business information about his brother's
are under

472
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,770
somewhere else but we do have correct
information there

473
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:17,200
so you know you can morning fire do it
we saw its all the reports

474
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,980
or Ruby within the Gatos or intercept
information

475
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:24,260
if it's also use I'm

476
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:28,190
well if you want to your keeping up with
the tokens also

477
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:31,700
chance for you too to take a picture

478
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,970
so as I said before which are the
options that

479
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:37,980
the an attacker will face I will have

480
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,620
if he has access to the BusinessObjects
ether

481
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:46,060
it information dispersal any permission
with that data sources

482
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,570
remember some the reports and the these
are the single dose

483
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:53,260
Business Objects are connected to other
systems go see

484
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:57,620
there's been such a proud could be
connected as I said before to be W

485
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,740
or indirectly to or near PSU arraignment

486
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:04,980
in this week system whether not seen
lower an example

487
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:10,100
of our an attacker will try to abuse of
the space terrorist connections

488
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,140
but just for you to know be looser

489
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,420
a configure for these connections needs
to have access to

490
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:20,720
that information right so at least boom
formation that is being used

491
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,150
to a persist and to analyze and to jail
the report

492
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:29,930
he said they love for that attacker and
then of course the generating reports

493
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:33,210
we'll see some examples also on how to

494
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:37,980
axes the report and put information on
been modified

495
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,670
an information campaign or these kind of
attacks

496
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:45,330
good action change some of these

497
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:50,350
could be more difficult than others a
changing their both the sewer system

498
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:53,550
might seem saying SM with me

499
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:57,820
simple concept but there are things that
need to work to just interfaces

500
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:01,300
researchers FC from functions so

501
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,740
there are things that or current make it
more difficult but

502
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:09,150
conceptual let up a good just change the
system

503
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:13,800
and burn to his on system I'm just in a
completely different report

504
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,290
and change the reason for that is
received in

505
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:20,310
through the route through Etsy functions
and changes

506
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:24,620
both definitely on the jaded reports

507
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,840
so or in terms of information dispersal

508
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,570
while we will sell some examples like
Business Report

509
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:35,400
financial statements I'm all this is
possible because of who's

510
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,310
connections with them with the system's
clever and yet be

511
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:43,240
a timeout your STM or all these are
examples of

512
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,510
information and then one comes
information pampering

513
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,850
while me I think they went through all
the examples already

514
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:55,030
so tension provider in four sets
changing their domestic product on the

515
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:55,850
user's

516
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:59,990
the system or restart changes or
preferably FA

517
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:03,420
on the resulting report so

518
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:10,420
Nazir them up

519
00:31:17,929 --> 00:31:22,120
okay so this kind of Columbia Mo they
were

520
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,409
trying to show here is the fact that a
from

521
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:29,110
a compromise to a business of shit the
attacker

522
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:32,520
will be able to John to a different
Ethan

523
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:36,010
so the attacker discover

524
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:39,289
been such a system am in town that

525
00:31:39,289 --> 00:31:43,240
IDRs he knows that and that URL

526
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,059
and he discovered evidence okay executed
an expert

527
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:50,309
any explodes here they a with you sir

528
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:53,460
a.m. I know anyone every the

529
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,580
you can figure out the executors

530
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:01,059
on the researcher past high positions on
the system so once though

531
00:32:01,059 --> 00:32:06,070
let their where access the system he up
indicating to the

532
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:09,210
CMC with international council

533
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:13,549
this is and like its entire
administration obligation that

534
00:32:13,549 --> 00:32:17,539
a are used by administrators to create
users

535
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:20,740
grant permissions and do also I mean
certain

536
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:25,140
attendees so the attackers may find that
he has heightened shift

537
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,860
he's probably I mean to I'm so to screw
so that

538
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:32,460
and that's good for him he starts
looking on the

539
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,240
befriend it type of information that is
available in with all this

540
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,080
he goes to the report actually that's
their a default folder

541
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,809
reports on both am that's one like

542
00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:48,710
demo reported that comes by before so we
which is very nice

543
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:53,169
you with the other financial the the
financial information on the results of

544
00:32:53,169 --> 00:32:54,070
the company

545
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:57,460
so that's that's an example of our
potentially

546
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:01,320
and by report that can be accessed the
Bible

547
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,980
by the attacker but then he also the
base another

548
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,200
for your witty therapy connection report
BC's

549
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,309
actually and a soda reports generated

550
00:33:11,309 --> 00:33:16,039
through a bad connection to an ERP
system I'm you will be able to

551
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:19,130
tell the difference between the ones
provided by the park and the ones that

552
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,200
we created

553
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,730
which are and very simple on

554
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:27,799
not nice at all about bats our room
permission summarized

555
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:30,980
process the runner-up some function that
gore a

556
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,980
configure through writing process on
Betty

557
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:37,230
its information is wherever the Republic
they are he could grab

558
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:41,120
good that I'm go home by Brit actor
knows that

559
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,010
includes we should rest generated
through a bottle connection

560
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:48,899
then the information to connect to it so
system where

561
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:55,710
so has to be somewhat so who's going to
the

562
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:59,399
connections on or he think that

563
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:04,280
there is no information the connections
but ok

564
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,379
so he go through I he cared somewhere

565
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,690
that there is an application core sorry

566
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:16,629
that there is an obligation core

567
00:34:16,629 --> 00:34:20,490
and Query Builder that actually

568
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:24,580
in used to create queries into the
business options

569
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:27,659
in a seem language very thing that too

570
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:30,869
a SQL error by both specific provisions
of it

571
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:33,990
so that's were key factors in right now

572
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:38,510
accepting the Query Builder on

573
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,889
within their attention he will try to

574
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:45,109
execute some there is no to get some
interesting information

575
00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:48,520
so ruled that a perennial got those

576
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,970
quite that because in the in the

577
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:54,780
and takes far so I'm guessing the

578
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:58,410
that everything to provide any grown
through that page

579
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:01,560
so for example select as i think im it's
like I'm

580
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:05,770
with a name from new projects boesak
impressions are

581
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,940
reports and information are like a

582
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,150
for rare-earth all this kind with JT
documents

583
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:15,500
there that information can be query and
on the

584
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,480
activities can be redeemed remarkably by
them

585
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,510
a I think I think finance our I

586
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:25,990
consolidated income statements are all
those are report

587
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:29,560
but then not only being procured source
can be

588
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:34,440
query also they see them options source
and that's a different information

589
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,090
that's Martin information you service
and

590
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:42,310
or be safe a group or don't say
technical commission as you can see by

591
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,320
the Midwest group

592
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,690
rather one-plus across 200 but now

593
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:50,330
went to a looming the a thousand because
there's arrest information

594
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:53,470
should Bible broke and on are

595
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:56,619
upon after implementation right you have
all this information

596
00:35:56,619 --> 00:36:01,359
on every be consulting division but then
both another source which is

597
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:05,420
well ABB objects and the attackers

598
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:09,260
actually accessing then the any
bloodshed

599
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:12,400
where because I'm missed connection I'm

600
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,770
there are nine resort or without
connections

601
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:19,810
that are are going from babies and
subject to other systems

602
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:23,060
good would be bad for you on your penis
Iran wherever

603
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:26,670
for these places an ERP them

604
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:30,089
and then means our a wants to see

605
00:36:30,089 --> 00:36:33,230
details on the connection that he
certainly wasn't

606
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:37,050
through the C&C right he said or will
begin a charm but

607
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:40,180
through it seems you no information
senator

608
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:43,980
all the information statement got on and
can be quite

609
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:47,660
through these interface so 14

610
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,770
the attacker submits the query he will
get

611
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:54,550
and technical details about these
connection

612
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:58,910
and the first bar actually niece and XM
our

613
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:03,740
agrarian solar its its information they
stood me up for the connection but

614
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:07,150
there's no I P username/password cryin'

615
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:10,460
there's nothing there because all the
information is here

616
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,859
the connection but I'm streams wheaties
in group 2

617
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:17,130
but these gummy also the grouper and

618
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:21,010
on he the attack another so mmm

619
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:25,440
copies the the contents of the s I
connection perhaps bring

620
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,580
which believes can be the greater

621
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:32,619
I'm I'm he has a already a screw

622
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:36,730
to the lap 30 staff

623
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:41,030
and copy the contents go to it

624
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:44,410
terminal he says rocking

625
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:48,750
to see behind something up and then go
to determine our

626
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:52,380
beneath the screw then gorby cry

627
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,570
the group a safe a say yes properties

628
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:58,920
you will provide any text will

629
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,869
return like random text but if you
provide to it

630
00:38:03,869 --> 00:38:06,890
previously included text there

631
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:10,369
and the attacker would be me

632
00:38:10,369 --> 00:38:14,339
able to get all the connection
parameters right so using that

633
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:15,260
information

634
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:18,690
the type that would be able to connect
to the sewer systems

635
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:23,780
wheaties Aksum couldn't have been the
one that pushes up with you sir

636
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:27,580
so this is probably where the USART

637
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,650
a the user credentials on death row so
since

638
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:35,099
and everything that is complete with
here to be restricted to only

639
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:38,700
axis the specific information that is
required and nothing more

640
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:43,290
so and assembled you so there should be
room we were in critical

641
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:47,690
because a should imply a a program by
myself the sewer system

642
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:51,859
well on this example then stole third s
country where

643
00:38:51,859 --> 00:38:55,570
a who who had I last-minute requirement

644
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:58,680
he will to set up the connection and
group the report

645
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:02,130
so can configure their had to do said
mister

646
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:06,550
I'm which is the what get up is going to
try on

647
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:09,790
he's going to group the new connection
in the

648
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:13,180
and some room cabinet eleventh-hour who

649
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:17,089
conflict with the IPRs the system number

650
00:39:17,089 --> 00:39:20,550
on he's going to try to connect through
the subgroup

651
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:23,910
to the sewer system am

652
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:27,060
or to all the information that he's
providing they are

653
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:30,460
westward through from the group shown of
cool

654
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:34,730
s I in connect but on stream he's gonna

655
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:38,250
somewhere well when the user name and
password

656
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:41,320
on he's going to be able to lower rights
are

657
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,980
name this example this user Haas

658
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:49,650
a I propitious it could be worse 3 p.m.
depending on how this is the most

659
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,450
popular because it is not something

660
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:55,240
that miss outta the blue copy with me
something that made me to set up

661
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:59,580
you need to grow by the already about
the solutions are on the role in

662
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,480
everything so

663
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,520
now being so someone's going to sewer
system depending on

664
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:08,280
on the system's if you'd said bob Unruh
on your us-iran

665
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,400
because that is going to be befriend
sorry

666
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,589
need them all bop

667
00:40:14,589 --> 00:40:18,330
it's still possible because information
is that which is apparently solution

668
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:19,300
moderation

669
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:23,490
that their connections outgoing
connections to it to our retarded

670
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:24,210
systems

671
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:27,470
well if they are outgoing connections
with was an imposter

672
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:31,450
and there's no user interaction they are
through the process I we are on the

673
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:32,720
connections possible

674
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:37,040
so

675
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,050
is so

676
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:44,790
this keeping with the compromise idea so
you can imagine how somebody is a

677
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:48,520
attacks a client at this point so they
pass the hash

678
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,940
I anyways attackers actually going after
somebody who has access to business

679
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,320
objects

680
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:57,380
on and so commonly like when we win we
would depend s

681
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:00,900
you'll look for a couple things right I
mean israeli officer checked the file

682
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,560
system looking for file extensions who
are poor

683
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:07,410
port of I'm you check the browser
browser cookies

684
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:11,140
but so the house going on about doing
that

685
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:15,210
one is know or something so the tower
tacked on our staff again

686
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:19,000
active traffic is gonna be best they can
see session maybe they can hijack

687
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,619
session but turns out it's also possible
with passing traffic

688
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:26,570
in Business Objects the client washy
auto ping the server on a set schedule

689
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:30,119
in the corpus sessions are a lot longer
than HTTP session

690
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:33,330
so smashing the user is logged in using
one other

691
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:36,560
the client's how they walk away from
their system in a little leave it

692
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,600
overnight

693
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,600
right it's not being used and so it's

694
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,350
auto paying the server a set schedule
and the session ID is actually

695
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:51,350
given in the paying

696
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:56,380
hoops

697
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,369
ago

698
00:41:58,369 --> 00:42:02,229
okay so tags taken a pick-up other
actually looking at your Wireshark

699
00:42:02,229 --> 00:42:07,009
so hard to tell here but the Wireshark
to the sector for core was really good

700
00:42:07,009 --> 00:42:11,589
by the filter are sorry for filter on
GOP GOP traffic right now

701
00:42:11,589 --> 00:42:15,229
I in the bottom right there you can see
that paying

702
00:42:15,229 --> 00:42:18,679
requesting is actual korva session ID
given within the ping request

703
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:21,959
so tired and copy it taken over

704
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:26,019
I and so this point is core only rate is
a corporal in session by

705
00:42:26,019 --> 00:42:29,630
one other core features and services you
can actually asked what's called a lot

706
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,029
I'm talking which can then be used the
web application

707
00:42:32,029 --> 00:42:36,650
so we have a script here it's going to
take back or possession actually turn

708
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:38,319
that into a log on talking to

709
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:43,249
access the web app walkin talkin
generated

710
00:42:43,249 --> 00:42:46,769
I and this is going to see a master ask
for the lot I'm talking right

711
00:42:46,769 --> 00:42:50,089
it so it's taking that korva session
gonna see him as saying

712
00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:53,239
let me have a web app session from that
session I just talk

713
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:56,609
and so I copy the logon session or the

714
00:42:56,609 --> 00:43:00,799
long token into the browser and actually
save your report

715
00:43:00,799 --> 00:43:07,799
or login site user so now the reports up
there and depending on which app is you

716
00:43:09,189 --> 00:43:11,559
could actually modify the report from
here so we could be actually

717
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:18,559
still the report or two a poison the
data

718
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:31,780
so how's can't activate I one with the
possible ways to PowerShell

719
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:34,800
so if I this artist's assault kleiner
server

720
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,020
I've been car shows made available to
the user

721
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:42,710
so you get STK like functionality is
pretty cool actually get reporting

722
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:44,130
access info queries

723
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:47,270
session handling and they can automate
the entire process so

724
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:51,080
you imagine attackers to also try using
powershell to just army

725
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,840
this artist tax and if you're interested
if you google PowerShell

726
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,930
Business Objects there's an interesting
scripts to check out

727
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:01,930
next act so

728
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:05,550
the the tabular say they decide to go
after the server again using pass the

729
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:08,040
hash they won't have a car price the
server

730
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,850
all they know is Business Objects
assault on their so

731
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:15,430
the follower Posterous er actually turns
out it's just a it's a part of

732
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:16,380
filesystem

733
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:19,770
so he actually going to the file system
for the server you'll see the

734
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:23,570
input/output far past or service to all
the reports are going into their in the

735
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:25,530
temblor ports also start out in their

736
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:29,310
I to Business Objects the report is a
file in the file system

737
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:33,910
that's also entry in the info store so
by overwriting file file system that

738
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:35,470
they could actually poisoned the

739
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:42,470
that the reporting process

740
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:52,060
so quick to mothers up

741
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:57,140
well there so this is the report we
start our

742
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:04,140
up it's really obviously happy report

743
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:10,860
now everything's good green smiley faces
I'm so the attackers now

744
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:14,470
they nor the files in the file system or
are they looked it up

745
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:17,900
and this can be done only if you go
through the filesystem in if you look

746
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:18,460
through the

747
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:22,060
FRS you can actually see all over the
reports now is is very obvious

748
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:26,630
attacker deleted on the filesystem
replaces it with their modified one

749
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:29,930
Iran and when something goes the view
through the web app it'll actually be

750
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:31,300
poisoned at this point

751
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:35,300
because again Business Objects is just
thinking about file on the filesystem

752
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:39,060
go up

753
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:44,310
I and so many logs and actually view the
report well see the report is no I'm

754
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:45,570
happy it's actually

755
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:49,530
doom and gloom so very sad report I'm
somebody's getting fired

756
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:56,530
over the report us

757
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:04,959
I'm do

758
00:46:04,959 --> 00:46:08,769
okay so some congressional something we
can go to

759
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:12,489
questions and regarding right they say

760
00:46:12,489 --> 00:46:16,029
on the station right by the by SEP that
covers

761
00:46:16,029 --> 00:46:19,180
many of the same issues especially

762
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:23,559
our network printing about the
management of the system's island group

763
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:23,950
in

764
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:27,079
so obese the are really known concepts

765
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:30,579
are also applying to the been such a
system so

766
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:35,049
should be implemented am so when
definitely many of these that that's

767
00:46:35,049 --> 00:46:36,119
coming to enter

768
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:39,859
a but especially keep the system's a
billion

769
00:46:39,859 --> 00:46:43,130
and bear are continues her

770
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:46,469
it's a piece continues to be releasing
succumb to the every month

771
00:46:46,469 --> 00:46:50,469
that's absolutely not that when
administered the signals for

772
00:46:50,469 --> 00:46:54,019
business options in the following months
prior also

773
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:57,950
I request you to keep up with the
Pakistan a big assistance

774
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:01,559
never all routine air there are in

775
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:06,089
in the problem talk in the last hour of
the day for is it be to get the truck

776
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:09,729
we're gonna talk about anti-foreign 6 so
we're gonna

777
00:47:09,729 --> 00:47:14,519
provide some examples on are working on
business objects on

778
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:17,699
some of its a pray like

779
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:21,959
weak points but school and regardless of
peace with ponds

780
00:47:21,959 --> 00:47:25,069
you still need to any room because I Y
see them now

781
00:47:25,069 --> 00:47:29,420
a who reaching the server is doing a
it's probably would certainly

782
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:32,609
there until it's gone a month to see
them separately

783
00:47:32,609 --> 00:47:36,029
on security systems and the combined
data no don't forget that

784
00:47:36,029 --> 00:47:39,779
even though BC said Lacey them that
mister

785
00:47:39,779 --> 00:47:43,759
we are not covered by buyer stand by our
own

786
00:47:43,759 --> 00:47:46,949
socks or compliance or missing brain

787
00:47:46,949 --> 00:47:50,729
you still need to secure the system
because otherwise there are different

788
00:47:50,729 --> 00:47:51,299
attacks

789
00:47:51,299 --> 00:47:55,519
that can be performed right got
information tampering with information

790
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:56,309
on even

791
00:47:56,309 --> 00:48:00,119
jump into the sewer systems as well so

792
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:03,729
if you have any questions mean now is
the time

793
00:48:03,729 --> 00:48:07,789
we've done also go back to the slights
if you want to

794
00:48:07,789 --> 00:48:14,789
to get the two of them tokens

795
00:48:14,789 --> 00:48:21,589
there

796
00:48:21,589 --> 00:48:26,260
yet or

797
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:29,440
its or I think it's just sore and

798
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,620
with a hardcore okie the the

799
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:36,460
inclusion a reason I will clinton's
really not secure

800
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:40,050
but there are other encryptions on top
of that

801
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:43,260
like you want to access it directly
through the lens

802
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:46,790
betaseron inclusion in the balance and
then

803
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:50,090
you have this other lebanon group in so
where

804
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:53,950
me the user's able to access these
through a through Paris

805
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:57,960
he needs to have high bruises but with
if the attackers

806
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,150
a thanks accidents throughout the los
tres I

807
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:04,830
a different level of encryption so the
warm SAP Business Objects

808
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:08,240
especially in the latest specials miss
including

809
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:12,140
group comply and group shown on in
connection with Clint Barmes

810
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:16,620
which is very good but these kind of
attacks are still possible because the

811
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,610
information

812
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:21,210
needs to be available for the system so
that's that's a bar

813
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:25,480
if there is no user interaction been to
see them he's going to

814
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:29,640
recruits a higher information on in that
sense an attacker will

815
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,689
try to access and aside

816
00:49:31,689 --> 00:49:36,789
as the system to access information
another question

817
00:49:36,789 --> 00:49:43,089
okay

818
00:49:43,089 --> 00:49:47,229
if you have any other questions there
are you can reach us we're gonna be

819
00:49:47,229 --> 00:49:51,569
and the whole conference here so thanks
a lot for joining the sitar

820
00:49:51,569 --> 00:49:58,569
hope to see you later here
