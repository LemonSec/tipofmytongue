1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,500
okay and I my name is leading a I'm
working for Russian company called

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,040
ElcomSoft about we care about 20 people

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,769
in our team and working for 20 s

4
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:20,100
and I left fifteen years so where do Inc
is developing this software for better

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:20,640
cracking

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,560
and now disappear recover and for the
last three or four yes we're also doing

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,270
some

8
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,470
common bile forensics concentrating
mainly on the

9
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:34,629
Apple iPhones and and now we also can
this sumptuous them and then some

10
00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:35,650
software for

11
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,110
leg braces from with you know then that
place from Missy

12
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:43,420
is dying and also something for

13
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,199
now yes on I'll tell you are

14
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:52,229
about their mmm now he knows i phone
forensics and and also some stuff about

15
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:53,150
waivers

16
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,220
I don't think any

17
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,280
to to tell too much more than the
importance of their

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,420
well device forensics because there but
I'll

19
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,939
devices and smartphones and tablets

20
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:10,359
so widely used and they contain a lot of

21
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:14,979
all critical and and business
information your emails contacts

22
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:18,500
a credit card number San Tan 202 and

23
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,990
for Ford for different platforms im and
missing picture

24
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,409
envoy that there are a lot of people

25
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:29,179
asking ask about why would you want to
do anything for for Android

26
00:01:29,179 --> 00:01:33,030
to play because we don't like it too
much we prefer to do

27
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,659
wat what we actually have a lot to do
and

28
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,950
mmm that a different methods to

29
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,060
esquire information from there from the
smartphones

30
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,549
that the symbols this simplest ways

31
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:50,100
to to get the logical exposition its
usually

32
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,579
their by cop or I just using some
protocol to

33
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:59,139
communicate between the cosby CEO Mark &
smartphone

34
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:02,159
and some comments to to get information
out of

35
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,799
all there there is also occupies his
so-called advance a political

36
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,209
I'll explain it further and me in my
presentation in peace

37
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:16,110
currently available only for for Windows
iPhones

38
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,909
written sorry for for Apple iPhones

39
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:23,349
and and iPad as well and it can get

40
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:26,840
more information then with a logical
there is also physical

41
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,870
when you create an image show or their
device it is

42
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,019
a not available for Windows Form and
sand for blackberry

43
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:38,720
and ET's very hard to do for you know
say form

44
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,040
about it is also possible that you both
methods its

45
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,980
it is destructive met at and to you have
to order a sample the

46
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,040
forget them I'm a cheapo out there and

47
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,090
greater completes I mean image

48
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,689
for it I are currently it is available
only for all the

49
00:02:56,689 --> 00:03:00,590
blackberry models and also for some
smart forms

50
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,840
made by Chinese manufactures

51
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,909
from in many cases this is the only way
to go to get information out of there

52
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:13,180
smartphones and that the probably the
most interesting

53
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,439
parties is getting information from from
the clout

54
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:20,579
quote is more and more widely used 2004

55
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:23,829
smartphone so mostly for where Pope

56
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:27,180
that is also something for Windows
Phones & and for Android

57
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,349
ants for for Apple devices

58
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:33,920
I clarke is being used for backups

59
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,209
if of course you set them an option to
you

60
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:40,290
to use it and you can also store the
documents

61
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,659
and in the clout and there is also their
location service

62
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:47,719
when their clout keeps their position of
your

63
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:52,879
spot for anti you can also Senate put a
request to your smartphone

64
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,829
to detect your current position saw the

65
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:00,959
mind a lil concentrate on their I was
forensics

66
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,239
the out to make the portugal's position
all their

67
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,629
information from the iPhone you just
can't you ask for a device to produce

68
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:09,439
them back up

69
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,000
Bacup is being Kim produced note for
note by iTunes

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,130
bout actually by the iPhone itself there
is a special service

71
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:22,880
running on the iPhone which using their
special Commons

72
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,550
us being sent by years being now

73
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,760
produce their their a cup and just
stands there

74
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,840
block so information to the court much
and

75
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,940
et-cetera an option to increase their
pickup their

76
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,680
or moving fusion is being done on the
device itself not on there

77
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,280
what computer and so you getting update
but not

78
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,260
and I'm thats pick up contains only

79
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,370
limited amount of information there are
some things that

80
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,640
that don't go to their pickup music

81
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,800
media some some settings some of the

82
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,060
application data are logs and

83
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,210
cell I with the physical his position to

84
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:10,020
to create a competing Mitchell the
iPhone it is much harder to do

85
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,720
for iPhone 4& all the devices there was
there

86
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,350
Woodrum vulnerability and then so

87
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:21,260
jailbreak and so have been able to

88
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,540
create a complete immature the eye for
me %um you now

89
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,480
though the morning show that this cooler
than it doesn't matter how long and

90
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,440
complex that this Kunis

91
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,520
we can still get them you mucho their I
form and

92
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,540
some of the information they mean the
same age still remains untreated because

93
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,340
the inclusion

94
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,940
he said I rely on their up a school but
most of the information is available in

95
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,560
there

96
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,870
plane tix for iPhone 4s and related
devices

97
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:52,060
it's it's much harder to do there is no
word from home and ability there is on

98
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,430
the user-level jailbreak

99
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:58,880
anti the jailbreak is installed we can
still create a full physical initial the

100
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,810
eiffel

101
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:04,600
on someone asking here's why do have to
to perform if your position or they

102
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,150
jailbroken it for me

103
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,560
if with a jailbreak you can get almost
everything from

104
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,400
iPhone but not everything exact image is
a

105
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,290
all the iPhone is is much better than
what happened again with that

106
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:22,210
now article for that once a Portugal

107
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:27,750
his position its on it's it's not so
widely popular my pet

108
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,870
but the peace you mean used by their

109
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:36,060
some forensic people I it's better to
have a jailbreak installed as well but

110
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,590
Evan without it you can connect to their
some services

111
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,940
running on the iPhone and send the
comments to

112
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,730
to get transformation art out of there I
will also

113
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,050
party-line details what what's going on
now

114
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:55,360
and for all on doctors I called and get
information out I'll

115
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,430
there of course in need to get them

116
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:02,710
Apple ID and their password talk says
the iPod

117
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:06,310
and so are the main profit over this
method is the

118
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,480
you don't need to have access to the
device itself

119
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,440
you only need to know that Apple ID and
best

120
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,560
and so I public up became an option set
to create becomes a

121
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,090
is a contains almost the same
information as a local pickup

122
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:26,140
created by iTunes and also that is a

123
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,980
extensive storage that that is being
used for the commands and

124
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:33,490
not only their away to

125
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,990
to keep I work document pages okay
Keynote and numbers

126
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,040
but also call it is being viewed by many
many

127
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,350
applications and now more and more being
was 2-for-4

128
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:48,290
passports for some subspecies
complications data

129
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:54,220
game cents and and whatever some
negation systems

130
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,440
I what is inside Baba Cup I'll

131
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,710
go briefly after that this cause

132
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,940
all your messages contacts I'm both

133
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,680
SMS and I message peaches

134
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,110
all the media San and so on went to
create a local pickup you just after

135
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:12,440
their

136
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,710
I am i tunes and censoring the device
and aunts

137
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,820
say pain backup for I club cops

138
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,400
you can say the iPhone to to make I

139
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,020
well because after my degree and they're
being dumb

140
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:31,060
area 24 hours when the device is
connected to wifi netbook

141
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,620
and to the power source and and locked

142
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,990
and you can also on force

143
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:42,180
creating a by just pressing a button and
you only need to

144
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,060
to be connected to way have no idea why
they're

145
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,769
I called the cops cannot be incredible
there are white

146
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:53,970
connection

147
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,180
and so on out the route information in
there

148
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,240
iTunes backup for you have to use a
third-party software here's one of them

149
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,910
it is

150
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,370
quite cheap and dance made by some

151
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,990
Chinese developer but I like it and to
use it person it from time to time and

152
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,029
to you

153
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:14,209
everything convenient for if you

154
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:18,439
had a look at the iTunes backup folder

155
00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:21,439
you also nothing but just a single for
their

156
00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:25,230
with thousand so benso silence while so
with

157
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,250
on the table means I in fact there and
name

158
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:32,459
files just that and defied an md5 checks
on all their

159
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:35,610
I'm actual file name is it that piercing

160
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,910
iPhone file system and you'll be able to

161
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:43,379
to read it and to see their contents but
using

162
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:47,389
that software or probably more and
websites software you can

163
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:50,600
but there is more actually in the

164
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,759
I come back up with anything that is of
course at the 2004

165
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:59,149
applications for example by social
network applications

166
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:04,040
out to eat at a feasible what's up and
and so on

167
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,860
and there is so a lot of other
interesting stuff for example almost

168
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,920
everything Q&A on the iPhone keyboard is
being stored it in a special database

169
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:18,050
and four different languages for example
am obviously using both Russian and

170
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,110
using my conversations and I

171
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:25,339
from two separate databases for for
English and for us in which most of the

172
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:26,089
war so

173
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:29,699
I have typed in SMS messages and halts
and

174
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:33,069
Rams whatever I'll

175
00:10:33,069 --> 00:10:36,420
you have the data all they're passable
so we are boarding process

176
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:40,410
discount cards and and so on hey there
where smile

177
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:45,160
and you have the mandate to vacations so
of your searches and the Google Maps and

178
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,490

179
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:50,279
now you know Apple maps and and so on

180
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:53,439
there are also or special folder with a
message

181
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:56,550
attachments when they're sending or
receiving

182
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:00,820
pictures by I message and a fine I think
is that

183
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,180
if you believe that conversation from
the iPhone there that

184
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,350
basements the features asked you being
store and I for

185
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,390
have deleted all of our organization
from my for my head about

186
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:14,570
70,000 messages for foster yes

187
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:18,580
and then when analyzing my copper found
the messages

188
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:22,760
now the peaches sorry that what action
to them messages

189
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,730
about two years ago and I was really
surprised

190
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,770
from the people I I don't talk to
anymore

191
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:34,420
and also I peaches from there McKay
speeches from that with the ports

192
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:39,150
to from for you phone 410 and so on
there is a lot of other data last

193
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:43,400
alike the last pick up date and time and
informational

194
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,600
alway 56 points you have a connected to

195
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,870
and also by the way you cannot believe
the information about

196
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,910
those way five points from your iPhone
easily

197
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:56,450
you can and you you you are connected to

198
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,970
wifi access point can press a button to
forget these

199
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:03,470
network that simple but if you cannot
connect

200
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,800
to it now the information now on these
access point is

201
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,810
you store it in their is now with i
seven minutes

202
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:17,140
source information I'll call to Africa
implications

203
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,240
it is an option to enable it

204
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,990
and it is an able body for PC skin very
very deep inside him

205
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:28,560
most of the people I talk to I didn't
know that's

206
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,940
such auction is available it is on there

207
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,600
privacy location services system
services and

208
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,610
that africans location youths

209
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:43,770
them now collect information about the
annual occasions for the last forty days

210
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:48,190
exactly when the year then they're all
the information is is being deleted

211
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:52,050
ants there are records with almost exact
time

212
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,150
when have been there and it is quite a
large

213
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:59,250
database you can see it and and somehow
there

214
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,990
device detects where is my home and I
didn't set out there

215
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,280
home and respected still knows when I
was there

216
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,120
and also some of these information is
being sent to all terrible

217
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:16,940
as you can see with the improvements
option and so I have no idea how it is

218
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,839
being Houston

219
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,050
actually probably 44 trafico

220
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,660
my bf or something else so just just be
careful

221
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,850
here is the database with

222
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,550
a allocation services data now there are
different tables

223
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:36,500
for now WiFi access points for

224
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,600
she is Sam for Lt and

225
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,600
for for yeah yeah

226
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:50,530
yet the yeah it contains in the file
name it is awarding

227
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,890
treated I think it is a yet it is as you
can see

228
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:58,950
cash and created a and the west side but
nothing is included the eighties mm

229
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,910
plain text form and there are
allegations of

230
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,920
of all those all that access points

231
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,180
or their I share same answer

232
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,930
Ltd sales and also the time when the

233

area I wear this point is available and

234
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,520
to any left it

235
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,350
you know about the charges you probably
hear the

236
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:28,390
about the presentation made about a year
ago on their

237
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:32,080
black cat proof-of-concept a very small

238
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,570
why computer based on

239
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:37,850
BeagleBoard and it looks like a charger

240
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:42,740
but when I connect your iPhone to rate
for example and the airport on the

241
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,610
somewhere else

242
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:48,070
probably inside someone else office it
is sexual and not to charge him not just

243
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,769
two years be but there is a computer
inside

244
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:54,709
and titties kept silently created by cop
of you are

245
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:58,019
I for now fortunately with 07

246
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:01,019
has been fix it well

247
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:04,190
not fix it but at least you get a

248
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:08,610
warning that you're connecting not to a
charger but the computer and you

249
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,029
have to or the Seder trusted on out

250
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:17,029
and sell last time when I connected my
phone to their use be connected in the

251
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:20,290
in the plane on their transatlantic
flights am

252
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:24,740
can also go this morning so that wasn't
just a charger

253
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:29,860
and and just in case I said don't I

254
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,220
what is it what is there a story behind
their charger mmm

255
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:40,050
up when the computer is

256
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:43,810
connected to now to their house device

257
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,920
and if you Press trust but as a

258
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,160
apparent records are being created from

259
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,500
more that I for now I was device and a
computer

260
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,639
and their store attack you know their
locations

261
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,779
I love down on they can PC want

262
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:05,639
on a mock and using that record even if
you don't know that this cooled

263
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:08,870
and the issue or 10

264
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,980
house device is protected with a strict
Pascual

265
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,600
and but if you can then access to all
their parents check it

266
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,199
than the computer can get almost the
full access to their contents of your

267
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:21,029
device

268
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:25,690
that as a as I said there is a special
service call for down D

269
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:30,440
and I'm running on the iPhone and by
connecting to it you can force a device

270
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,779
to create a backup

271
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:35,310
you that is an option to increasing the
cops and

272
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:39,449
the couple when clicked it but you can
also install the software

273
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:42,500
with all the more natural than I for one
yr you can get

274
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,279
their device id: ends other information
and you can see mediated between the

275
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,189
computer which is

276
00:16:48,189 --> 00:16:51,399
hidden behind him there device you can

277
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:55,180
pretty this green short though they do I
set CNN even moments

278
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,970
get their diagnostic information and
Steven Paul they do a simple

279
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:02,000
recovery mode and also can install their
Persian

280
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,169
profile on the iPhone and all that will
be here

281
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:09,620
from you so take care when be careful
when connecting

282
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:14,699
allows devices someone source so here is
a

283
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:18,850
more information or their advance a
political creation using their

284
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:21,980
now now a USB device sleep it is

285
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,470
publicly available with the sources and
the internet just

286
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,679
take it in to use it and and get
everything you want and you get

287
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,720
a little bit more them with their backup

288
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,280
you can also get there some temporary
files

289
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,290
case files logs and and and so on

290
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:43,600
and yeah please also know that mistyping
from

291
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:49,360
aisles for you can its recover the
deleted files like believed in me

292
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,910
peaches from the iPhone but you can
restore

293
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:57,330
delete it messages and contacts because
they're all store at them

294
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:01,880
Escalade database and it is not being
compacted on a regular basis

295
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,710
and most of their diluted data can be a
extract

296
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,920
other funny think about their logical
the adventure Portugal and their

297
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,210
paperwork Inc is that

298
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:17,990
now once there you have that bearing
bank records

299
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:22,280
you can why information or WiFi not only

300
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,429
years be or have to need to have is
their

301
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:32,429
out there in fact self that's it now
it's good to talk about

302
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:36,890
control panel if you if you started on
the Venus or Mike doesn't matter

303
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,910
you will see water information is the
sink ants

304
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:44,670
now being uploaded to I thought and in
their book up section

305
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:49,190
you see the least of all because the
least of your device is connected to a

306
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:49,830
particular

307
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:54,160
%um there already accounts with their
dates when the cops

308
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,530
have been created them and their size
but basically that's all we can do there

309
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:05,510
you can only delete backups but you can
add on for them or browse am and so on

310
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,820
soporific howie made the

311
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:13,590
reverse engineering call for I called
the cops because they're being done only

312
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,970
over wifi

313
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,290
had to to sneak their way fight rittick

314
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:22,490
and to be able to read it these group
that of course in

315
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:26,840
we need to change their certificates on
the iPhone and so we go there

316
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,100
jailbroken 1 and get their key channel

317
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,380
from there and Shipley said they said in
the

318
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,000
fortunately they said I'm not been up to
lately by senso

319
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,630
that what Italy too easy and then they
set up their very tight to mention

320
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,429
procter

321
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:45,059
and so we're able to read all the
traffic that

322
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:50,500
downs from there I for I called on

323
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,510
also briefly how the files are stored
and I clout

324
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:59,890
thats not only about the cops but also
about the document store there

325
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:04,350
they split it into a chance which have a
table size from way too small to large

326
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:07,730
and the chance a group C and grouped

327
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:11,070
into continues and there is also a map
of their

328
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:14,570
relationship between the file and a
chance 8 contains two

329
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:18,429
I what is being done for it so just to
see the space

330
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:22,030
because there are a lot of files with
some duplicated data

331
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,080
and also I clout and gone through with
the local pickup

332
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,370
I'm its or sound as many as three last

333
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:31,470
becomes and then commando

334
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:34,830
so only the last changes are being
uploaded to

335
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:38,530
I called and and so I don't see the cops

336
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:42,540
them not so the former cop just or have
their

337
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,900
only the first pick up a school and for
second pick up

338
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,970
are made to which is made years earlier
than next the only their

339
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:53,300
changes south or attend for the Lubbock
up

340
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,669
which is as made to the only their

341
00:20:56,669 --> 00:21:00,580
very last changes so typically for
example leave their

342
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:04,520
now but kappes them 15 gigabytes of the

343
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:10,419
second backup is only con the tall 200
megabytes and

344
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:13,450
last loss back office on it am

345
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:19,010
than 20 megabytes but you can paid the
full

346
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:23,380
free by cops are using that information
in

347
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,429
so here are some information while the

348
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:30,460
protocol can't just do Castelo
authenticate using

349
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,780
Apple ID and password and then send a
calm want to

350
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,570
again called get account settings 2 p.m.

351
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:41,040
now provided their house indication
talkin which is

352
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,760
received on their peers there and get
the you new authentication token

353
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,590
I don't know our way there are there are
there are two about that said the way

354
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,770
how it is being done them

355
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:56,730
a center comment using their last house
indication talking to

356
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:00,350
to get the least of for pick up ID's and

357
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:05,540
of course you can have more them more
than one device connected to

358
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:09,590
your Apple account and forever does all
those

359
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:13,510
or devices you can outdoor team the cops

360
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:18,159
if you interrupt their ya backup process

361
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,130
now you won't be able to all to retrieve

362
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:25,870
information about the latest pickup
which is still being applauded

363
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:29,060
to Syria Chesterville it on and about

364
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,669
all appears the cops are be extracted

365
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:36,340
and then we have to at the Santa comment
to

366
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:41,010
get keys to get what is that backups

367
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:44,440
nature of a chance store it in the eye
well they're all untreated

368
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,880
and every Chang World of Tanks

369
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,400
here its home on a conclusion keys

370
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,310
but akiza Store apps along with the data
and

371
00:22:56,310 --> 00:23:01,120
there is a comment to to get the
encryption keys and there are also

372
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,220
common stew

373
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,610
in Emirates snapshots mature

374
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:09,020
Saab proper tell because there

375
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,169
and self-awareness not show up here
there is a comment to get health

376
00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:13,590
education talkin

377
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:17,350
and then we send a comment to to get
there

378
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:20,200
an exact address all their all that
every now

379
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,519
while China and it on sale occasion
where this

380
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:26,720
chuck is stored and from time to time

381
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,269
unit on you get there linked to the
minosos or

382
00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:35,299
the Microsoft go out and some other
chance to store it in

383
00:23:35,299 --> 00:23:39,879
on the mazone and that part of their

384
00:23:39,879 --> 00:23:43,529
up we don't know yet exactly whether
they're

385
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:47,799
awful their your book of historical
numbers on server and the

386
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:52,369
of -ism on Microsoft so or maybe their
backups are stored at

387
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:55,669
both occasions sense so it's redundant
ant

388
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:58,740
you can get a complete backup from for
way

389
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,009
out be sure to order have their cost way

390
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:07,049
so for example Microsoft along with all
the help from his own we'll be able to

391
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:11,129
to get my complete backup I hear is here
are

392
00:24:11,129 --> 00:24:14,149
how the day teasing greeting the in
their quote

393
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:17,570
now Rs there was some changes

394
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:20,820
from there no service on

395
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,940
visions 5&6 and this from 7

396
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,720
has been slightly change it and invasion
7.1

397
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,950
he's just a few days ago there were even
more changes

398
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:34,320
ants for most of the file

399
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,990
other to to settle for inclusion he said
being

400
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:42,009
don't and there is also a flake we which
of them is being

401
00:24:42,009 --> 00:24:46,850
you stand and I do now also the purpose
of all that and and how the second keys

402
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:47,190
being

403
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:52,649
used and so you to some some civil court
how their

404
00:24:52,649 --> 00:24:55,789
I S in a sterilization victor is being

405
00:24:55,789 --> 00:25:01,080
generated there is also a way to

406
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,240
get access to all I called the cops and
and I called

407
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,960
files without the Apple ID and and best

408
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,919
if you catch to assess about where I
call control panel on your computer mark

409
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:13,249
or

410
00:25:13,249 --> 00:25:16,409
see of course that

411
00:25:16,409 --> 00:25:19,679
avoid the best sort is not being stored
up on the computer

412
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,710
are about the house indication talking
to us and there is a way

413
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:28,360
this store attack you know that at the
talk that is all occasion

414
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,840
where it is stored it in in the nose it
easy and

415
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,830
release form easily browsable and so on
mock

416
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:39,059
it is also store moon

417
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:44,090
and you can from the spill East you get
the authentication token and skip the

418
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,340
coast two steps

419
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:50,100
I described about the in the

420
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,720
pick up pretty or protocol and just send
a comment using their

421
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,389
house indication talkin which is stored
there

422
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:02,029
on modding fusion is and it'll be better
than on the nose

423
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:06,019
and we have to get the key from their
local

424
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:09,139
keychain to create it with way 64

425
00:26:09,139 --> 00:26:13,720
and and M make that died just using
their

426
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,889
specific exit key which is dorton

427
00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:20,369
one of their web address and then became
the file using yes

428
00:26:20,369 --> 00:26:25,320
128 on

429
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,840
and here's the code out all the ppl
syndication talkin

430
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,029
and it is only needed for mock and he
knows it easy

431
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:36,940
you are you get it right now and using
just victory prepping the

432
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:41,340
from their file mentioned on the pay a
slight and

433
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,659
after decryption using the entropy

434
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:48,539
we just said and they righted use also
our Quality Inn

435
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:52,409
10 libraries and doctored the chain get
the employed either

436
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:55,500
for me and I'll syndication talkin

437
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,279
it is and the more time the same as for
Windows ants

438
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:03,460
abouts for on our on a Mac

439
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:07,320
when I trying to to get the key from the
keychain you're getting warning

440
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,639
met her some Picatinny strike to get
there

441
00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:15,109
the key from there that's that's not a
real protection of course but

442
00:27:15,109 --> 00:27:18,600
but still so

443
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,869
on a brief summary about for apply
called the cops

444
00:27:21,869 --> 00:27:25,159
as I said all the data store it in their

445
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:29,359
a bipartisan group that I about the key
so also store

446
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:34,139
along with the tent and so ample and and
also Microsoft and also

447
00:27:34,139 --> 00:27:37,509
Amazone have have access to all young
people to date

448
00:27:37,509 --> 00:27:41,179
let us still some files and pickups we
show up for their

449
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:44,710
included using their and other key back

450
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:50,190
in services are we see that in the
latest versions of Wales

451
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:53,990
or and Batticaloa 7.1 more and more

452
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:57,240
information is being completed
additionally such as

453
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,909
what's up conversations whether
conversations

454
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:06,340
and so on turnabout as explained that we
can also get the encryption keys for for

455
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,730
the state and

456
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:12,159
get all of them now that seems the only
thing

457
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,289
which is protected most in there apelike
about is

458
00:28:15,289 --> 00:28:20,500
keychain their key chain is amazing
people using their specific key

459
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,750
which is on EQ for every device and it
is not store

460
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:28,119
and a cop at least maybe the steel
stored somewhere

461
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:31,389
and in your Apple account Apple has
access to it but

462
00:28:31,389 --> 00:28:35,639
we cannot give from miss of course

463
00:28:35,639 --> 00:28:40,289
now what if Apple does them it also has
access to

464
00:28:40,289 --> 00:28:43,740
onto your to your keychain unclear
including

465
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:47,250
your wifi passwords office Forster my
own

466
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:51,950
so ants that the bed think about I call
the cops aid

467
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:55,570
the is that you cannot said that the
channel protection for their

468
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:59,470
because store their with their local
pickup once he is said to have a cup

469
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,429
with or

470
00:29:00,429 --> 00:29:03,429
it is not being mmm

471
00:29:03,429 --> 00:29:06,639
it is somehow the nips and store it in
me

472
00:29:06,639 --> 00:29:10,519
inside a device and if you can make
their

473
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:14,389
device which is set to create better
protected because to

474
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:18,379
on a computer you won't be able to
creative up with are the best

475
00:29:18,379 --> 00:29:21,629
and then you know they're regional this
just

476
00:29:21,629 --> 00:29:25,690
Press bottom to paid back up and pick up
will be

477
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:29,379
created with the same pace or there's
originally said

478
00:29:29,379 --> 00:29:33,179
and it is so hard to break it is icing

479
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:37,740
20,000 citations in there BB active to

480
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,789
and even on the foster's use a speed of

481
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:46,000
recovered only about comets thousand
essence second which is not much and

482
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,980
am you can break on me up to six or
seven chair

483
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:56,309
best

484
00:29:56,309 --> 00:30:00,460
song and I'll go to their clothes
commence

485
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:04,849
December 2002 I called home you'll see
that the plans from the I wore

486
00:30:04,849 --> 00:30:09,259
store their 9 cents were coming into use
and the

487
00:30:09,259 --> 00:30:12,609
is being accessible down by all of your
devices and by

488
00:30:12,609 --> 00:30:15,899
bank max my iPad and iPhone

489
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:19,149
as well

490
00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:23,210
about I it is it is possible to get all
these files

491
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:26,490
not only with I felt when talking about
the

492
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:30,700
by also reversing protocol %um

493
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,769
has been beat easier to

494
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:37,250
does this protocol because we were able
to sneak in there traffic between the

495
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,049
market and

496
00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:42,679
our clout answers to your so have to do
that I'll syndication requests

497
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:46,669
yeah with the FIDM Sr about the same
honors for Apple

498
00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:52,049
becomes then to get account settings as
well as with

499
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:55,779
pickups also and then we'll send a post
request

500
00:30:55,779 --> 00:30:59,899
and turn it on for ever if I will get
its name they ID

501
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:04,379
the folder I D because files became
agonized into the folder

502
00:31:04,379 --> 00:31:08,399
last change time it checks almond access
rights

503
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:13,599
and two don't mort any given file from
the least we got on there

504
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:19,049
your step yes there were here too said
america's together for outdoor

505
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:22,200
the file talkin using their file id: in
checked excitement

506
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,740
I miss my and this map is there call the
file is being stored there

507
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:31,480
and then send their authorization
request that's so

508
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,889
does information on the file chance and
containers

509
00:31:34,889 --> 00:31:38,559
and the files are stored about the same
way as former Cubs

510
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:43,200
split it into a chance to state-space

511
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,769
on for you flip away what files

512
00:31:48,769 --> 00:31:52,589
you although they taste or at most as a
single I walk while

513
00:31:52,589 --> 00:31:56,279
about as a package

514
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:59,710
you look into I called cormier you will
be able to

515
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:02,970
da morte any of those files and one of
the

516
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:06,799
file formats in their original cannot
format in in PDF

517
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,820
Orleans Microsoft compatible are marked

518
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:13,859
and the convention is being done on this
internet site

519
00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:17,159
and its effect there every file restore
it is a

520
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:20,730
as ate the least and plus a database of
for all

521
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,149
information there and all the files like
peaches and

522
00:32:24,149 --> 00:32:28,440
leaders asked for it separately as a
separate files and

523
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,799
you can if you wish Download All This
file so

524
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:36,190
one by one you of course you know their
protocol

525
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:40,079
are or you can send coleman's to

526
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:43,599
more to come where the file that some
expert calment

527
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:46,629
and days %um there and then

528
00:32:46,629 --> 00:32:50,919
and you can still send a call Monday
check experts that a San

529
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:54,399
to see where file has been convicted I'm
not him want

530
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:59,679
it is committed to send the article 12
dome or they're converted while

531
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,339
with I walk on now 2002 13

532
00:33:03,339 --> 00:33:09,099
which has been really is just a couple
of months ago

533
00:33:09,099 --> 00:33:12,159
the files I'll can be protected

534
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,869
with passports and you can it down for
their protected be

535
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:19,339
from the I about and to to get all those
files

536
00:33:19,339 --> 00:33:24,250
have to supply press or right on their
health education

537
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:27,299
missed a champ with him to reverse a bit
file yet

538
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:30,440
and so for their local files for the
local

539
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,539
I work 2013 file store upon their

540
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:37,240
computer and then

541
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,399
there is a special small file %um every
package which contains the hair show

542
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:41,960
their

543
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,409
passport ants the cash is just

544
00:33:45,409 --> 00:33:50,490
100000 iterations of sha1

545
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:54,359
now probably about the most interesting
bother I thought kitchen

546
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:58,220
has been introduced him yeah 07

547
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:03,029
and it is quite convenient to sing all
of your passwords and credit card number

548
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:04,029
across your

549
00:34:04,029 --> 00:34:07,220
those devices and 6 devices

550
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:10,690
its has been implemented the right way
using to Proctor

551
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:14,089
authentication my life about to

552
00:34:14,089 --> 00:34:17,279
month to mention that two-factor
authentication

553
00:34:17,279 --> 00:34:22,889
introduced by Apple about 1 year ago
only protects you access to

554
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:27,230
hard information and ability but it
doesn't protect

555
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:31,950
from there Bacup domoling and once
you're a store over there

556
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:35,779
our backup file on the you device

557
00:34:35,779 --> 00:34:40,909
when they're our store policies
completed Dorney roles there

558
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:44,190
or the same quality get some message

559
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:47,409
by email that some particular device has
been restored

560
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:51,500
from this book up using yep lady each
your downloads

561
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:56,079
pick up using their protocol described

562
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,339
has been implemented now software about
two years ago

563
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:02,920
then that is known it station at all and
then go on a roll their pickup

564
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,359
doesn't them nice thats the car has been

565
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:10,369
download so two-factor authentication
them

566
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:13,630
doesn't protect it from that so that's
your chest

567
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:16,660
or select between

568
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:21,049
Camino San rights for the I clout to
janet is

569
00:35:21,049 --> 00:35:24,380
so much better you have to or select
their

570
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:27,579
trusted device we show

571
00:35:27,579 --> 00:35:32,490
receive their are the special code by
SMS when

572
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:36,130
I called back up is being you stand and
connected by

573
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:41,690
other device you also can also must
select their security code

574
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:45,210
now by default it is also for the Jets
and

575
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:49,970
and by default Apple of issue to create
the same security code

576
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:53,119
as your place called on the device had
on all that

577
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,420
the reason for that and once you set up
the spirits court

578
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:01,730
you'll be able to to connect to you I
call teachin

579
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:04,819
even if you don't have at this moment

580
00:36:04,819 --> 00:36:08,980
access to your are trusted device

581
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:12,170
and this is good otherwise issue for for
example get

582
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,470
get here for lost or forgotten all
broken and

583
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:18,920
your you lose access to or two o'clock
each and although

584
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,660
on your iPad on the Mayans

585
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:28,230
socket and there is a warning that you
there is no other devices

586
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:31,440
available you can use your call security
code to

587
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,520
connect tackled kitchen thats how it
works on my

588
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,599
it seems that take louts key chain
contains some more information than the

589
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:41,890
local kitchen I A

590
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:45,279
has been surprised by that one sec
active connected

591
00:36:45,279 --> 00:36:48,410
but probably that's because they're

592
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:52,210
and once I set up like low key chain it
have been collected

593
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,839
it has collected all the information
from all four miles devices

594
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:59,109
and take care I think 546 some of them
are being

595
00:36:59,109 --> 00:37:02,490
used for testing Google software some of
them I'll walk

596
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:06,119
and also from mock and also be before
that

597
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:10,450
before their and enabling their clout
each and I can see my Apple ID passport

598
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:12,310
and anywhere there

599
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:16,890
but now it is it is available and say I
can see it in their

600
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:21,270
jackal teach it

601
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:24,779
plants 'em you once you set up the
trusted device

602
00:37:24,779 --> 00:37:28,279
and when connecting the new device to it

603
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:32,720
it problems for their security code or

604
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,690
you don't have access to trusted device
or you do

605
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:41,299
you'll have to now to enter their
dedication called widgets and by

606
00:37:41,299 --> 00:37:44,430
a SMS message two of the other

607
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:49,150
device and also on the other devices
you'll see the warnings that

608
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:53,220
whether to allow you device to connect
to the so-called

609
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:57,750
chant even you know all there
verification code and security code but

610
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,779
say don't know all then they recall
kitchen will be

611
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:05,190
connected

612
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:08,440
his she has a the warning

613
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:12,329
the bottom showing on there iPad when I
when I try to connect

614
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:15,970
a you i knew i four now to their clout

615
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:20,180
each my here are the components

616
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:23,470
of how hark low key chain is working

617
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:27,569
now excesses their key keychain database
which historical

618
00:38:27,569 --> 00:38:33,079
and there are some so some some serious
here they're working on their

619
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:37,440
on the mic mmm

620
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,940
and marketers they're just your
description of the

621
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:44,250
components there is a process remote
service

622
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:47,890
which director with a call control panel

623
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:51,599
than there is a is BD dime on which is
patient and

624
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,490
restoring keychain and also it to see
you there

625
00:38:55,490 --> 00:39:00,220
mitigation on the I call teach and
updates one that beats

626
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:03,220
now happening on the other devices there

627
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:06,390
able services is sending stations to

628
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:10,720
all their devices these key chain has
set up on

629
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,339
are there is also there are lucky to
them on me

630
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:17,890
which communicates with the I clout gets

631
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:21,880
requests my name make way to send and
Celtic leave their

632
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,630
responses and as as well as their

633
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:30,430
savior safety security them cation
contest doing their key chain and

634
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:33,630
also getting notification and then the

635
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:37,400
low-level Apple 06 driver

636
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,529
and security from work is just being

637
00:39:40,529 --> 00:39:45,880
used to for the encryption and
decryption functions

638
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,099
mmm to get the keychain just yeah I

639
00:39:49,099 --> 00:39:52,290
now we have to send a get account
settings

640
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:56,349
are using the employees and and best
start and is always the

641
00:39:56,349 --> 00:40:00,520
begin their health education talkin it
on its quite see more rain

642
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:04,049
all their able components from the cops
to

643
00:40:04,049 --> 00:40:07,790
apply call files and also find my phone
service and

644
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:11,890
about the same for tackled kitchen

645
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:15,099
I miss have to same the sink amount

646
00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:18,170
to indicate each in itself and

647
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:21,440
came back at this step well we don't
need their

648
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,690
isokinetic old or the Colts and two
trusted device or oils

649
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:30,910
am we always can get a keychain and
their key back

650
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:34,980
and but but of course all all that these

651
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:39,750
created a keychain itself is included
using the keystore attended by key back

652
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:40,910
and the keymaker

653
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:46,440
KK make itself was also created

654
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,630
here is the response see into yes incall
months

655
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:53,049
to get the key chain and get back and
and have their

656
00:40:53,049 --> 00:40:56,270
detained base64

657
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:59,849
hard to get all this data but damn

658
00:40:59,849 --> 00:41:03,390
with have to check whether this account
needs

659
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:08,690
SMS challenge to be sent that is another
comment for that

660
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:12,200
and I it's cool to gets SMS targets

661
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,080
ands is that SMS chance to test and see

662
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,150
is required then we received and roll
requires

663
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:22,680
one of the key and M on

664
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,049
we will have to sent another comment

665
00:41:26,049 --> 00:41:29,299
now call to generate SMS challenge and
at the end

666
00:41:29,299 --> 00:41:33,230
the stop step that trust device I will
get there

667
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:39,960
station and 2a unit on to the square
receive their links all their

668
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,349
up there I response which have to be a

669
00:41:43,349 --> 00:41:46,630
and tourists and support on the next
step here is that get

670
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:50,690
Kb key whiskeys be in Houston Cherie
Blair

671
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:55,049
ought to be creamed a key back and the
key back is being used to

672
00:41:55,049 --> 00:41:58,239
leave their kitchen and

673
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:01,759
and this step Eve this message in its
response

674
00:42:01,759 --> 00:42:05,739
is required to shift to supplied

675
00:42:05,739 --> 00:42:09,259
obvious in Canton the tone

676
00:42:09,259 --> 00:42:16,040
sector are we receive their way 64
imputed data

677
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,589
on he is also the that gets

678
00:42:19,589 --> 00:42:22,839
okay becky and so in fact this is

679
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:26,730
Kb recovery as well on interestingly

680
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:31,220
thats as for wilcox when we using the
same protocol as

681
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:35,619
powerscene seems to use also don't
receive the prompt on their other

682
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:36,630
iDevices

683
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:37,890
where

684
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:42,110
to allow the you device to to connect to
the ski channel

685
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:46,050
on I don't know why happen sold time
when you're

686
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:50,460
connect to their key chain my nearly as
described by

687
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:55,370
about if you way using those comments
now than there is no need

688
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:59,060
station on the other devices and so you
can also sign

689
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:03,470
connect and each you there is a security
code and

690
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:08,000
you don't know it now than the air you
only need to

691
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,220
all the employees and space for 10 the
Securities Co

692
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:17,560
extracted day teacher I hit as hell they
key chain date is activated

693
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,480
there are two types of keychain data one
is there

694
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,700
on Jen Jen P like genetic loss

695
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:29,680
which is used to wifi passwords how to
access points and dole

696
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,440
for credit card data and the second
class is

697
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,970
iiNet internet cause I used for
sephardic by sorts and

698
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:41,070
after complete field which also being
used for vessels

699
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:46,740
now structure is quite simple there is a
key class a vision data size and date

700
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:47,340
itself

701
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:51,090
and their now algorithm to

702
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:54,100
or to be a to generate a key to intent

703
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:57,340
to dictate the state is also noted

704
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:01,200
not really hard Mar

705
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,290
fortunately the saying that has been
going into tried that there is no way to

706
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:09,510
with force the security court you know
the airport ID and password

707
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:12,690
dance after issue on success or dams

708
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:16,120
access to like about the chair our
blocked in

709
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,780
for Apple ID passport base station is

710
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:23,220
a little bit strange if you go to I call
that common and her

711
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:26,300
incorrect passports a few times

712
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,690
your account will be blocked so the
defrost about

713
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:32,880
after 52 same arm

714
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,510
mmm incorrect and so they're

715
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:40,170
escort but ECU's also there are steps

716
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:43,830
protocol talks as their their clout at
least we tried that

717
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:47,250
about 50 times and account has been
blocked

718
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:50,390
and so probably and that is their wait
till was there

719
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:53,440
by the best because and that is not me

720
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,740
my still not win a reliable and

721
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:01,270
I'm sure that after some mom there
access will be still blocked him

722
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:04,460
also that mutations not so fast

723
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:07,660
but probably can use their reporting for
their

724
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:12,500
now to retrieve some sounds some short
short and simple questions

725
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:18,700
and also you do is possible to implement
Gaza attack using their one single

726
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:19,260
password

727
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:23,380
and different Apple ID's so in that case

728
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:26,770
10 of course access we'll be blocked but
once you

729
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:30,480
have collected many a party switcher
just to

730
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,360
ninety-mile sell probably a day the
passwords

731
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:37,380
well work with at least some of that

732
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:41,250
10 song their conclusion on the

733
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:45,600
reply quote security I'll there is
always a balance between the

734
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,780
security price and convenience and man
you have to

735
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:54,280
selected cell which is now this to you
and I have lost my phone and forget it

736
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,070
and then some places and it

737
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:59,580
has been stored a few times and I and
then I saw

738
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:04,000
anti-foreigner I don't remember and once
it happens there

739
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,890
for the first time two years ago I
immediately decided

740
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:11,810
to to use I clout and then it's Eric
help me

741
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:15,540
because I just more than you do I send
to our side

742
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:20,490
all their information come back on my
form including call that polls messages

743
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:21,210
and

744
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:25,150
everything by there is a securities
because you know they're

745
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:28,780
now you know that beat the store apps on
their

746
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:32,290
sort by the service not and

747
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:36,760
avalon's and a Apple has almost complete
access to all of your data

748
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,890
and probably also need the better two
factor authentication

749
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:44,070
hands probably an ability to to increase
day

750
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:49,500
your call the cops ok you recall
documents using your own best sort or

751
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,040
your mom

752
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:55,440
group B mmm are there is a lot of a walk
a hit

753
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,500
we don't know how the access to for the
streams

754
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,640
me now I being done and what

755
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,750
rantoul for authentication is is

756
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:09,160
to be used their that is quite a lot of
work with sort by

757
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,540
application data most of them are
included

758
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:15,930
as I said the using their or their all
came back

759
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:19,570
and and now to keep them bout are some
pic asians

760
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:22,860
storing their they data some

761
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:26,990
some other way that their or and hiv-2

762
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:30,150
take care about back to my mock to

763
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:33,330
the protocol used maybe use down and

764
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:37,170
and probably the most interesting
parties to understand what is going on

765
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:37,880
with their

766
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:41,300
tragedy and what kind of information
stored

767
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:45,300
on now very briefly about

768
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:48,900
BlackBerry by cops it is completely
different from

769
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:53,170
apply call the cops printable local
pickups

770
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:56,420
with alt some of for legless

771
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:59,810
from pickups were similar to local
iTunes pickups

772
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:03,570
the about their was just have one single
files

773
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:08,420
and you have to all now to supply miners
at best

774
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:12,660
to rate aunt with over some $4 I that
pesto chicken

775
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:17,620
function was quite simple that's only
jet want a nation and that BB

776
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:20,880
function and soul that good force

777
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,020
and dictionary attacks war extremely
fast

778
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:28,440
million so vessels second but shortly
after we discover their

779
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,020
am truly is a software to break their
like me to pick ups

780
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:37,670
on Irene at that time it was remembered
today

781
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:41,510
release date you for some all their
BlackBerry Desktop Software

782
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:45,730
hands edits as many as 20,000

783
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:49,670
say creation so sha1 way with I form

784
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:56,000
backups but still there is a way to or
use a GB used to hard to make it foster

785
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,170
and alt files heads very simple

786
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:03,610
or what and with a so

787
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:09,430
yah yet yet you up to

788
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:13,109
yeah this for to all

789
00:49:13,109 --> 00:49:19,459
or you know other about his

790
00:49:19,459 --> 00:49:26,049
to enter up a

791
00:49:26,049 --> 00:49:33,049
him

792
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:38,960
hooked

793
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:45,110
okay and and possibly be released their

794
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:48,350
have that tablet I'll our playbook

795
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:51,680
its shares introduced day you pick up
our mock

796
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,750
and operating system out like me a
tennis

797
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:58,140
also compete in you and their pickup is
based on their

798
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:02,260
QNX their operating system or for

799
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:05,420
way and now they're are

800
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:09,470
tar files have been created to end this
software is also knew it is

801
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:16,470
it is bring greater who

802
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:19,770
here and

803
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:23,210
so once that we're grilling with the
support the BlackBerry 10 operating

804
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:25,290
system and devices has been

805
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:29,210
made available aka found that there is
no way to said the best part

806
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:33,950
do away with a pickup absolutely there
is no such auction and the software

807
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:37,010
about the a cup itself is always in
created

808
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:40,040
and all you can't do with this

809
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:43,210
the cop is like with a public up you can
only

810
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:46,470
store then you device 28 and also

811
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:50,130
before restoring you have to set up the
new device

812
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:54,330
with this same way Brady and and
obviously the passport

813
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:57,430
ands hands here's why serious

814
00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:00,610
how we can fix poor they tend to what
are their companions

815
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:03,810
now there are

816
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:07,380
as a blackberry 10 operating system is
based on

817
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:12,390
tnx just get this information

818
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:17,880
aunts and mom today QNX partition on the
other UNIX system

819
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,990
and you have found it encryption is
based on

820
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:25,630
I S 266 and education is based on

821
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:29,580
which Mike sha1 and the main components

822
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:32,890
can now to create backups is pick up are

823
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:36,810
in inside a pickup ICJ I program

824
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:40,040
running on their BlackBerry and select
with

825
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:43,220
EPL BIOS this time working

826
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:46,890
right on their device is giving the

827
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:51,010
blackberry laying there already is a
group that campaigns and so all the

828
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:53,500
encryption and decryption is being done
right or wrong

829
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,930
device and

830
00:51:56,930 --> 00:52:00,510
there the encryption keys they're
probably the most interesting

831
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:04,870
part that they the key store it in their
special or special parties from

832
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:08,770
on their on the device itself it is
generated

833
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:11,900
at the time when you all set up a new
device

834
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:15,640
to said BlackBerry ID and you also
indicate

835
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:19,060
with way grady passport and so

836
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:23,160
unit on the blacklist era society
joining the sink champion which is

837
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,490
probably the most

838
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:28,680
on like that actually i do. that like
many ways

839
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:32,010
and the says ID's being sent to a device
itself

840
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:35,280
store up there and then pick up pickup
services using

841
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,540
it to oughtn't the data when

842
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:43,260
when the OK to pick up and also to keep
the data if you restore their device

843
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:43,710
from

844
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:47,480
lookup on it is cool

845
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:51,010
the the first comprehensive which is
being used as a blackberry talkin

846
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:51,600
serious

847
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:56,090
now the sand the request using that way
Brady

848
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:59,610
the press Alt the eighteen the pain is
there

849
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:02,780
I meet you ID you also have a device
using for

850
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:06,520
blackberry messenger sound and and so on
and this pm

851
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:11,730
in I it seems that it doesn't take part
in the encryption and in there

852
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:12,890
generational thing

853
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:16,210
you can t about you can provide any pain

854
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:19,460
anywhere it be in to to the server to

855
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:22,940
and get back thank you he ended doesn't
rely on it

856
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:26,480
but if you supply the incorrectly in
which has me which is not

857
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,140
register some well-known aggressiveness
and you will fail

858
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:37,140
so here is there the Catholic Way which
is being sent using their

859
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:41,280
by Grady which is email password and
some other information

860
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:46,090
and and then to get their key a cubic
cubic is

861
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:49,470
think you can t here is their sequential

862
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:55,100
steps to be performed just to get the
one authentication token based on their

863
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:58,800
queer district on the last step then we

864
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:04,710
get the talking using information later
on by their peers grand

865
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:09,910
miss and they request to desirable
aggressiveness and and we

866
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:13,110
registered device on the aggressive so
surtax

867
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:17,570
say that was a an real night might have
to order us all these protocols because

868
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:20,980
about 2607 difference cirrus and

869
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:24,550
services using by now regular not

870
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:28,800
finally get this 9020 ants

871
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,820
as a no thats about that the

872
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:37,080
Kiki Becca seems to repair only on
blackberry

873
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:40,340
BlackBerry ID on the email and now

874
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:43,870
cause a few change their press for
people that like already there

875
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:48,270
you can is not being change and also you
correct or supplier

876
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:52,040
Philippine to to get me

877
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,920
so he here's how is how it works

878
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,750
I don't know why it is called believe
it's not and official name in TA

879
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:01,740
probably won't get any information

880
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:05,350
our way grooming for it work rarely

881
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:09,550
about that sand internal name which is
being hit on by some of the greatest

882
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:13,130
and the key hour once once received

883
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:17,730
is in is being stored on a special

884
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:20,970
especially on the BlackBerry device and
then use by scrambler

885
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:24,270
and scrambler company disease use in
treating

886
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:28,550
indicating the dance and it's still
there without service

887
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:31,640
and and so blackmailing like that iTunes
is

888
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:35,330
only collects their group that
information and then try it is

889
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:38,910
writes it the file

890
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:41,940
obviously what is inside a blackberry

891
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:45,150
backup were great and pick up once you
have it

892
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:48,260
dictated of course there are

893
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:51,510
now karen there's contacts all the
messengers

894
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:54,760
messenger seen their plane group that
form

895
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:58,880
was SMS messages and and blackberry
messenger

896
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:03,380
now there is also Facebook databases
with all their commits asians

897
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:06,840
and an awful for Facebook Messenger and
there is a

898
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:11,130
other database which collects all the
indications about the comments on your

899
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:12,210
posts and

900
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:17,030
and so on it is a different database for
blackberry messenger

901
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:20,950
and myself messengers

902
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:24,090
messages themselves and also the group
and and

903
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:29,090
contacts and so what's up database is
also in airplane text form

904
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:33,110
in their peers mission C-twenty it and
it proved it really good

905
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:37,200
now based on their Hardwicke which which
can be extracted

906
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,490
from the device for only using their
triple method

907
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:45,410
and and now now you can get there all
their

908
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:48,510
what's up which is most for

909
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:51,830
popular messengers being used

910
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:55,160
between different platforms are the
second aircraft media

911
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:58,380
media dokhtar it contains all that the
chess and

912
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:02,180
me to send voicemail as well and so did
cry

913
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:06,160
for settings doctor contains

914
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,580
all the settings so they device and also

915
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:12,600
all the passwords or WiFi access points
and to

916
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:15,800
VPN networks in a plain text form

917
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:19,560
and you also get all your

918
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:22,750
but bookmarks use them broza browsers

919
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:26,890
my data and and so on so almost
everything can store it in that way

920
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:29,220
because in police files

921
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:32,630
and both on yes school I databases like
this

922
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:37,780
Windows Phone and or Apple iPhone and
bold

923
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:41,420
yep yeah that sexually that's it

924
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:44,730
only wanted to the city thanks to

925
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:49,180
not my cortex which have been working
carpenter that for for blackberry for

926
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:51,240
example it took more than

927
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:55,570
more than six months to or to go inside
blackberry

928
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:58,700
mmm row protocols and to

929
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:01,790
