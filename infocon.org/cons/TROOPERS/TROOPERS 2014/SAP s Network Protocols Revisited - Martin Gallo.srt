1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:06,730
her very good for from form anyone that
works on

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,900
saeb security and but

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,740
it specifically talking about air
network protocols

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,510
some banks a sabc do these

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,090
not very well for not especially if
people

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,880
a most of the research air was perform

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,890
on the application layer a

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,499
the learning curve this is still a steep
I mean you need to

9
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:34,870
invest a lot of time to start doing

10
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,300
a CB security and sometimes is no

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,740
well for and penetration distance add

12
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,480
are not targeted and 22 is ABC's
themself

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,160
if you are performing a never bring
addition this you know I'm

14
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,680
large and company like large network
sometimes difficult to focus on

15
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,950
sabc stems and also in recent years

16
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,710
eat it's got as lot of media attention
on sometimes

17
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,860
thats not not the myth listing

18
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,480
a soap the idea of

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,100
these walk and this talk is to apply our

20
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,170
never bring duration: this the middle
door she

21
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,360
to saeb environment so

22
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,720
they do. fun and we'll bring version
destinies a

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,590
that a US a profession out seed on a
bona fide

24
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,350
network on is start a sissy in

25
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,330
the different components from a security
point of view trying to

26
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,870
fares this caller all the different
systems the different services to

27
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,470
are running got there as much
information as you can

28
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,430
it in you continue why assessed in the
different components

29
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,479
I'm if you sexy long find the morning I
believe this

30
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,690
you can go on the exploitation faces and
bought explanation

31
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:59,880
a therefore keeping access to the
system's

32
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,530
or or for people teen on accessing
another once

33
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,750
soap they do have some bodies to applied
this approach

34
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,470
a on SAP environments soap

35
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,700
the focus about all attacks and song

36
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,810
recent a new attacks a on

37
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,430
all protocols a new protocols I just
good I'm worth

38
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,319
all the when related a services so

39
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:29,659
that is not korea also not only brother
goes on

40
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:33,129
not all there previous attacks arc over
a

41
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:36,480
in this talk and I also want to mention
that it's not happening tuition this

42
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:36,999
thing i'd

43
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:40,329
but not a review of different attacks so

44
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:46,329
the approach that I duke both mostly
black box by a black box

45
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:49,599
I mean that I tried to yarn

46
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,650
a smartass Baltimore a from each serious

47
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,709
mad not by reverse engineering the
binaries

48
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:00,310
the but mostly looking at the network
trace East

49
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:05,249
new be not the obligation to racist and
trying to understand how which brought

50
00:03:05,249 --> 00:03:07,459
the ball on how each service works

51
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:10,760
and I never mean

52
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,069
ass muscles as a gun I have to rely on

53
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:19,309
a note of all the world's there are a
lot of references seeing the materiel

54
00:03:19,309 --> 00:03:22,349
a I Colby me seemed some

55
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:26,309
something but a there's a lot of playing
some referees

56
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:29,409
to to the friend research and

57
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:33,489
publications on also because of the
black box approach

58
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:37,879
a it go in a completely agreed I mean BB
components that

59
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:41,689
I miss on their son are the stud I'll
call be wrong

60
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:45,189
in is kinda disclaimer and

61
00:03:45,189 --> 00:03:49,329
I also use are a lot of tools for a for
doing this work

62
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,790
air the most important wants are

63
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,469
Rd Sault Ste tall stud I developed in a
previous research

64
00:03:56,469 --> 00:04:00,389
a bicep Lisa by Don I'm ready for
crafting

65
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:04,279
packets a Indy for NSA be protocols

66
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:08,489
its base on this copy would use a very
good bye to lie ready for

67
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:12,449
for doing that on wanna they best things

68
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:17,109
Ystad a you define the different packets
you know the clarity way

69
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:20,629
so we'd also good for documenting

70
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:24,960
all the different pockets on all coach
baghdad

71
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,789
air looks like on another tool that I
develop on

72
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:32,139
are you seeing an improvement honored
for for his work he saw

73
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,210
planning for a while scheck that I loves
you too

74
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:40,009
they sent the different is the broader
goals I look in more detail

75
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:44,169
I each part of or of any packet

76
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:47,180
so beef

77
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,699
diagram shows song team

78
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:54,199
like act classy guy is a B&M environment

79
00:04:54,199 --> 00:05:00,090
air in this case disco beast their
NetWeaver application server

80
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,460
a in both buchholz the application
server

81
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,780
about the the Java version on

82
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,319
this hour most the most of day in

83
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:13,710
common services to address on on each
application server

84
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,720
on the idea of the dog we

85
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,720
East a at some point to review some of
the services

86
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,389
I'm trying to understand in a broader
goal behind each one

87
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:28,129
a II gives some DDS so

88
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:32,250
I will go true ad's five different
services and protocols

89
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,819
is starting with a sub router 10

90
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:39,539
talking about the gateway service that
is by germ is a server

91
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,710
an inducer so let's start with the first
one

92
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,060
there somewhere out there is an
obligation living gateway its

93
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,830
commonly use a reverse proxy

94
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,669
so you can Randy service as a
stand-alone obligation

95
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:59,580
somewhere you're DMC and configure a
disservice to allow

96
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,259
or the night access to the for internal
components

97
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:07,360
so it's presenting almost all the is CB
Salesians

98
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,379
on its ed

99
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:14,569
kind of expose on the Internet i mean
they did the main character recently

100
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:15,439
stayed

101
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:19,180
a allows you to to expose internal
services

102
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,400
the to two lanes are out to remote net
worth

103
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,560
I wanna the country city east and also
is

104
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,750
angry did buy a full so it makes our

105
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,159
really interesting target for for
attacks soap

106
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:35,930
deserve a diagram shows at typically
stylish on where the

107
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,229
some road to resist all in the DNC and

108
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:43,289
Italian also denied access to the friend
nedra ranges

109
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:47,300
soap dow lot of 10 attacks

110
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,919
against the service on these political a
on

111
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:53,969
one of the most interesting long are
they the West add

112
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:57,020
Mike D'Antoni is from nap sees show week

113
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,080
Okies dog attack in the box but I'll
send them

114
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,870
and on they've probably also on my guy I
would reveal told some of them or more

115
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,830
recently

116
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,960
but what my your show is that you can
for example

117
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,090
a use this tab router a proxy for
existing internal

118
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:20,349
services or you can even if Kong
internal net worth

119
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:24,069
using this %uh broder East is not the
world configure

120
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:27,569
so more looking

121
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:30,939
more details I about the broader goal
uses

122
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:34,349
5 different packet types a

123
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:37,360
day administration back its that I use
for

124
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,530
performing a remote administration tax

125
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:44,099
and when you for example we disarm
brother

126
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:48,710
program air request last stop or a star
teen

127
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,279
a or any calm and and remote common on
their

128
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:55,669
Feb router is a the packets rrrr

129
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:59,680
the this type I've been looking updated

130
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,810
brought to life on song Comments tab are
not be included in data going daschle

131
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,279
like dad you can said ok clear

132
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,439
tracy's all for a specific IP address

133
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:16,110
or you can said a tracy's for for a
specific connection

134
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:20,080
and that's just not included in the home
invasion II

135
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,520
not sure why there if I know they're
back in time

136
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,810
would use use for a controversial issue
so

137
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:32,599
his pocket if you see id in by the sub
router

138
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:35,800
when he'd forks its own process I

139
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,910
if you said for control and internal
communication between different several

140
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,260
trees fences

141
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,430
I also found some operation gold stud
are not included

142
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:49,660
in the documentation lad you can request
their

143
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,210
Derick whether a diversion of this %uh
brother and you got

144
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,570
said hang both and there are some
abrasion gold's

145
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:01,180
a that are used for when the efficiency
the encryption layer

146
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,360
easing able for for the service at the
last

147
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,700
a bucket type area is a road trip with

148
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,820
when you need to access 2010 now

149
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:17,760
sees them by true there's some router
you be let back in

150
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,320
when you boot I least of all they do you
think old

151
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,180
a you need to reach to to to get to to
your targets

152
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,520
a service and Eagle be ok for

153
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,870
password-protected so

154
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,980
some reason attacks against these
broader go

155
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,090
farewell did the most interesting one
are the one stud

156
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,110
phone song some researchers from

157
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:46,080
your be scanned a some

158
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,360
piece of like to give we which is
britain here

159
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,750
a we keep on our he bother pro on their

160
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:57,480
road to stream when the server Parsis
their wildest thing so

161
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,500
these are really dressy in malleability
beagle's

162
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,200
the services expose on the Internet on
these baghdad

163
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,720
a Heath by said before any access
control is so any remote

164
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,930
attacker can can exploit this
vulnerability a

165
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,930
obviously it was a really botched a in

166
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:20,440
in the last year the doesn't know much
information I will call displayed by

167
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,550
here ass ask awsome right if you're
running is ABC's and you must be sure

168
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,320
that

169
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:31,360
these pudgie's is is installed so some
security measures to do Grande apply

170
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,220
a to enforce the security of the service
well obviously to

171
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,420
keep up to date on on the Latino latest
patch the diversion

172
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,990
in for the use of often green Cheung by
means of SNC

173
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:48,520
crowding your your own tables be sure
that day only injury stab

174
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,950
I include add the required ones

175
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:55,000
who dis abroad to behind a farewell is
is not there

176
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,380
it disavowed any snow they made out add
I

177
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,380
I a you seen with Delphi will

178
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,280
a

179
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,380
so you must be sure that you Buddha of
my world

180
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,060
in front of of that obviously don't use
password because

181
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,610
if you don't have encryption enable but
would rather us

182
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,900
and created on also the

183
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:21,300
the bus worth our store in Blaine in the
server side so it's

184
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,680
know that a good idea so

185
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,730
continue with the neck services

186
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,050
a this %uh gateway a

187
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,820
use this service injure shove handling
all the RFC

188
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:39,270
connections so artsy

189
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:43,120
a sacked broader gore bias AB

190
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,060
that you can use for execute our remote
fun shown in a remote

191
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,770
system so we seem we have seen a lot of

192
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:54,970
different attacks on different
references to to RFC goal seemed

193
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:58,200
today and yesterday in in the washer

194
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,410
and the series is commonly used for
integration between

195
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,540
external service on obviously between
all the different components

196
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:12,200
a now is the bee's deletion it's also an
angry that by default

197
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,610
I need general expose more than the AC
been at war

198
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,730
because a its use for interfaces with

199
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:22,570
the friend AC stance on for example
legacy systems

200
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:26,180
and things like that so deeper the La
Crosse

201
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:30,140
also lot of 10 attacks a

202
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:34,050
I don't want to enter into more the
death about

203
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:40,040
specific attacks a one of the most
interesting one on the fierce one stud

204
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,260
the get publish what they want from
miami is also

205
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:48,930
the waged he showed you can gather
information on the server side

206
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:53,490
a disservice can be configured your
morning to mall

207
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:57,480
so you can perform remote and use for
the basque

208
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,780
on the service the also among them your
taxes neoprene

209
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,960
is some old remote code execution

210
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,560
issues where you can perform login for
brute force attacks

211
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,610
I lot of different attacks on the head

212
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:15,350
more deals on the program's receive mean
they are

213
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:20,050
RFC connections so there's a lot of
information available

214
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:24,620
I am unsure about that it will continue
to to to grow

215
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:29,990
I he would continue to burn you new
attacks on on RFC and even if the Bruins

216
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,730
so you going inside at the broader going
to help a

217
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,750
down beneath iPhone released to the
friends main

218
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,209
can packets and the main watched with we

219
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:44,770
which are the ones youth air when you
request

220
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:48,050
a an era si call and

221
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:52,940
on the morning to baggage which are used
for the administration of of the service

222
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:57,600
so what have they been treating the
youth that almost all the data

223
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,970
throb both with ARC printable a

224
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,690
its bill upon a rough the tables its
billion

225
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,940
he had table format so

226
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:12,670
if you look inside out they had each
packet a you will find all day

227
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:18,360
data a story in The in that format so
its own security measures

228
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,950
the were obviously again to patch both
sides

229
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:25,060
the client media RFC a

230
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:29,020
initiation communications but also their
service I

231
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,459
and make use of access control East

232
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:36,390
the Gateway can be configured to to use
the friend

233
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:41,360
a access control least a obviously to
disable money to know the

234
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,160
he's not require enforce the use of
encryption

235
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,280
on enable our review yields on all the
different components

236
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,280
there's a interesting guy guide from
this Abe

237
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,459
weeds some apps almost or the security
measures

238
00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:00,770
so going to

239
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:05,150
the next service the Assad dispatcher on
the diet protocol

240
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:09,480
this summit butter is the service that
handles all the communication between

241
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,339
their

242
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:14,910
gay clients and application servers the
broader goal they did you see school

243
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:15,500
Diane

244
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,449
a it's a very powerful political
beagle's

245
00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:22,790
it can carry in Bandera siegel's

246
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:26,990
so for example you gone from the year
request

247
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,480
the execution of un-arab segal a

248
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,890
on the server side but also from the
server side you can executed

249
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:39,699
a model some programs on the GUI client
so it's very powerful

250
00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:43,110
air it's also angry that by default a

251
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:48,610
on easily compress so there are also 10
attacks

252
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:53,280
against this protocol a mostly related
to

253
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,970
to this neoprene login credentials and
then agreed in nature of of the bread to

254
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:58,520
go

255
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,930
but also some interesting why like like
the one stud

256
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,940
and the ass a show in

257
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,250
2011 natural birth area

258
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,449
where he found that you can for example
modify

259
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:15,170
their program that handles levine's I

260
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:18,390
on request execution on air of

261
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:23,140
of functions on the new clients so when
the client connects to to the server

262
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,880
Rotem

263
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,510
modified version of this of this server
a

264
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,640
executes unexpected comments suits

265
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:35,570
I really interesting attack also I'm
some reason attacks while I spent some

266
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:38,709
time in 2012 working on these political

267
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:42,930
a roberta need and trying to to to
obtain

268
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:47,630
more details and I found that you can
gather information on the server side

269
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:52,320
you can also perform on a green lobbying
brute force by Mimi keen

270
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,500
all the interaction data that the

271
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,610
client it performs when when you log me

272
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,980
into an obligation summer Darrell for

273
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,520
some interesting a baghdad like that you
can

274
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,760
say da bar Road server on the network

275
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,880
and sandy shore get if you want I so
user to

276
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,429
to to open the gate sure got a you can

277
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:18,980
a Indies users to access to your own row
center

278
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,530
charmer i'm for example gather
credentials or all sober for

279
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:26,540
some of the docs the I recently
mentioned

280
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,450
on the declines so it's a a really
interesting attack vector

281
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,190
I also found some buffer overflow
vulnerability stud

282
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:37,200
I really bytch am

283
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,200
on I included the the reference
information is included on their course

284
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,919
i buy Tory

285
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:46,320
so some security measures watch both
versions

286
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,080
on a enforce the use of angry John

287
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,700
dishes out really really important thing
and and

288
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:59,440
as a consultant II of thing see clients
that are still around

289
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,070
day day this service widow encryption

290
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,220
so I its adidas it's an

291
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,669
an important point so

292
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:13,790
to continue with their next service

293
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:19,260
a the mess a server's server if another
service studies precedent

294
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:23,820
in all the Seabees deletions there's
only one with a server

295
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,330
per system and he can thus

296
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,550
all the Lord Byron seen information for

297
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:35,300
gay users on RFC users so when I V

298
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,330
client want to connect to an SAP system

299
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,800
heeds ask which application server

300
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,320
East their best one for for connecting
to so

301
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,830
that information is handled by by Demis
a server

302
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:52,570
on he'd also use for internal
communications between all the different

303
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,120
obligation service

304
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,429
so the service expose in the recent
versions

305
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,880
to this report one for external users

306
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,890
accessing the Service and the other for
internal ones

307
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:08,419
the application servers and manage the
DB Surrey's

308
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:11,820
also for for all their load by unseen

309
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:16,510
information so it it's also an
interesting target

310
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:21,270
the goth all the application servers
connect to to to the service

311
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:26,390
so 10 attacks were it this service
coming on Fri girl saw

312
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:30,390
a in money Tomo a so you gonna

313
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:34,780
perform some remote I Minister the dusk
you deserve a response theory

314
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:39,669
in that way and there for 10 that you
can gather

315
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:42,720
information on on their miss a server

316
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,929
be on you can't you person it's an
application server

317
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:51,100
but ideal for any good reference all
good implementation of these attacks

318
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,030
so one of my goals was to trying to

319
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:58,350
to get more details I'll see if I can

320
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:02,340
implement these this attack and there
are also some offer on the PLO's

321
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,810
on the HDD be a interface by

322
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:09,850
I think that most of day current
installations

323
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:15,090
I really patch so you can use %uh that
the broader go it's a bad

324
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:18,429
gonna complex never protocol he

325
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:22,310
cast at least two different packet types
the main ones

326
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:26,050
and they once use for administration but

327
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:29,300
inc.'s a lot of different abrasion
gold's a

328
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,320
e93 shown by gates you have around

329
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,860
16 different operation goes are most of
them

330
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:41,250
uses the friend packet formats so you
need to understand

331
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:45,390
hole which one a Eastview and under also

332
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,440
around seventy-five ray we r abrasion
goats

333
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,620
so some of their dressing things that
you can do

334
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:56,290
if you know how to craft markets

335
00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:00,850
if for example you can damn data from
the missile server

336
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:04,330
they die like the configuration on their
release pressure on

337
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:08,010
lot of different information about the
clients and a different application

338
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,460
servers

339
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:14,050
you can also monitor big clients
accessing the servers

340
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:17,050
the Michelle server so you can for
example

341
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,990
connect to the master server and send an
abrasion gone

342
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:24,649
to get notified about a when

343
00:21:24,649 --> 00:21:28,190
an application server connects to
admissions service so

344
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:31,460
that's also be useful doing a
penetration test

345
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,770
by because you can discover new
application servers

346
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:38,600
by connected to to the mission server
and

347
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,860
the service also works ass ass and
missus sure

348
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,310
I mean you can send or receive mister
she's

349
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:48,419
21 from any of the clients connected to

350
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:52,300
to the service and it's also interesting
that

351
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,470
you can change some configuration
parameters

352
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:59,200
the by connected to the miss a server so

353
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,560
some recent attacks against the
thirtieth

354
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,909
a where there were some buffer overflow
vulnerabilities

355
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:09,610
in releasing her two years ago by

356
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:12,850
decir the initiative they wear a
rebadged

357
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:16,640
and dad berry good explodes be a good

358
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,490
by abilities air when the server Bartz's

359
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:24,260
their change but I'm readers a abrasion
goat

360
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,690
so it's really drifting into to look
from from outside from up in addition

361
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,260
this decide but also

362
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:34,169
to to be sure that their budgets RRR
install

363
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:38,080
and some reason attacks would these
wanna have fun

364
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,350
i long we'd Francisco prime far gone
decide on expert right there

365
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:45,390
from from poor security the

366
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:49,210
with on a memory corruption
vulnerability a on the official server

367
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,480
or on some of the operation go through
needed to

368
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,580
to the shower version I'm Francisco did
a

369
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:00,320
very good job at

370
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,850
implementing a real attack a weed a
memory corruption issue because

371
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:09,530
their memory corruption issue only
allows you to modify

372
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:12,790
with a lot of restrictions song memory

373
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:16,010
locations summary Boynton's so

374
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:19,390
he managed to by sending request

375
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:23,590
a fears enable the morning turmoil

376
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:27,030
and your administration religious to the
connection

377
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,610
so that's that differs a step then you
can

378
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:35,090
override they'd change but I'm leader
function pointer

379
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:38,530
so the next step is to send

380
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:42,580
add change but I'm either request air
with a brother paleo

381
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:46,940
on you would too eager the function
pointer did you on the road on the

382
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,230
previous a step

383
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:52,500
and that way you can a exploiting have a

384
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,120
the Baylor running on the server so it
was %ah

385
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,950
can have very difficult to explain but
have really bad for the common touch

386
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:03,810
22 made some teen air relief a simple

387
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:07,390
I and that also a available

388
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:11,340
on Korean parts all the information
about who do exploited a vulnerability

389
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,510
seen the

390
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:16,590
advisory with a very good thing the car
analyses from

391
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:20,000
from France's truck from fifty so

392
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,860
it some new 10 attacks well i i fund I'm
understood to

393
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:28,950
to find a way to to perform the bursa
nation attack

394
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:32,300
and there's only one a step dad I me
scene

395
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,520
with youth managing all the lands

396
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,550
information in order to when

397
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:42,070
decline I and access the miss a
thoroughfare

398
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:45,280
there will be pointed to your server and
not another one

399
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:50,169
but it's a really interesting a dog a
well but also yesterday shows some

400
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:53,630
details about the the same my dad being
implemented

401
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:58,530
so it's a it's a very good one and I i
will show a demo

402
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,760
of their previous one ability

403
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,120
but Perth I want to show song

404
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,320
how this up I don't also I

405
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,340
I don't know if you know I bite on PD
second half

406
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,610
interactive a either phrase

407
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:20,300
a for by Don so you can't add here

408
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,440
and by 10 comments and he will rerun in

409
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,610
on on on another boy but it's very good
for for showing these kind of things

410
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:33,310
there and for example I i want to show

411
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:36,669
a Co you seen the bicep a

412
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:40,940
library you can craft packets of the
different

413
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,490
a bridal brother both so

414
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:48,960
I want to show for example

415
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,230
the memory corruption issue on how to
exploit

416
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:56,550
air welfare's we need to perform a song

417
00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:00,340
said up and i cant 14 they differ
neighbor is

418
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,760
and different things a 10 we need to
connect to the server create a

419
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,070
connection

420
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:11,590
and they persist everywhere differ
system when you connect to the

421
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:15,179
today miss a server is to

422
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:19,510
there for my login so you need to say
that you are logging in

423
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:22,700
to to the service

424
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,830
ups he

425
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:29,290
keep so what'd so good good

426
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:34,840
disconnect okay

427
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:39,470
a when you can add to and do perform the
lobbying the separate or somehow stream

428
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,889
that identified the server

429
00:26:41,889 --> 00:26:45,870
in these cases amis you server

430
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:50,950
a this is the back it that you need to
send for

431
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:54,429
obtaining configuration parameter value

432
00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:58,270
so I wanted to show how you can build
these

433
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:01,740
in bite on with with the bicep library

434
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:06,409
a you specified a a in this case the
administration abrasion gold

435
00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:10,560
and the parliament by amateur value the
name of the parameter

436
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,710
and use and day a

437
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:18,120
missus ever packet a including your own
name

438
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,490
and the tagname December stream a target

439
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:26,159
so you send a message directly to them
it's a server

440
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,919
an including the administration abrasion
growth in this

441
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,010
case is to obtain the value of are

442
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:36,530
configuration parameter and they respawn

443
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:40,530
includes their currents by you of

444
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:44,440
dad any corporation barometer

445
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,750
so for a simple

446
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:51,610
you can request the change of the
bombing here or you seen

447
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:55,440
another different administration baggett
a

448
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,620
in this case the abrasion go the East
name

449
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:03,440
a tee shot Parmenter and you can request
the gym for example in this case to

450
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,220
enable the twitch

451
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,629
from an apprentice ponder for you ducks
make any sense but

452
00:28:08,629 --> 00:28:14,480
you can do they the other way around and

453
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,980
and in this case there's an error number
a

454
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:23,460
telling you that you don't have
religious to change for meters

455
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,800
so what I we do you do in in

456
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:31,100
did step he still a get the bailout that

457
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:35,330
II so Francisco a

458
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:38,369
build and sent a request to

459
00:28:38,369 --> 00:28:42,010
thereby robbing a fun show on on
explored a

460
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:45,560
memory corruption issue in this case
only

461
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,810
for enabling the money to more so

462
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:52,389
after that if you'd gone into going to
the miss a server

463
00:28:52,389 --> 00:28:55,540
you will get a connection that house
religious

464
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,980
and you can for example request the
change

465
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,669
of their image that mean parameter in
this case you would see that

466
00:29:02,669 --> 00:29:07,590
there's no I remember so they change of
the parameter

467
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:11,060
sexy and if you read request

468
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:14,169
they actual by you a in this case is

469
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:17,300
is one so I wanted to show

470
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,550
this a like be creepy

471
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:24,210
biggest there's a lot of information by
the DA's dad

472
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:27,570
a you can grab the packets after at this
level

473
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:30,639
and send the furry different request

474
00:29:30,639 --> 00:29:33,879
and perform some different ominous
threat to you das

475
00:29:33,879 --> 00:29:37,429
a on the service so it's it's very
powerful

476
00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:40,450
after you no ho to

477
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:44,760
to build each packet so

478
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,200
leads continue the

479
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,649
two thumb up some of the attacks that we
still on the missile server

480
00:29:52,649 --> 00:29:55,869
daddy for Knox's level required to
perform some

481
00:29:55,869 --> 00:29:59,530
some of these attacks for example if you
want to ollie

482
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:03,810
a more need to her different clients
accessing the Service you only

483
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:07,260
need to reach to the external port of
the service

484
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:11,950
bud for example if you want to
impersonate an application server or

485
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:12,909
damn data

486
00:30:12,909 --> 00:30:16,090
you need to access danger now port

487
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:20,429
and our way I as a showy indeed change
for meter

488
00:30:20,429 --> 00:30:23,490
administration and ask you need a
monitor mode to

489
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:27,780
to being able so this is just good to
wrap up i'm for the records

490
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:31,530
but they are the phone axis labels
according to what you

491
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:34,770
do you want to to to do on day on the
service

492
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,869
which and mister the function you want
to perform

493
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:41,510
so also to some mom son

494
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:45,419
security measures you can apply we're
obviously going to

495
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:49,200
keep up to date on the latest version to
budge all deceased and

496
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,010
a use ACLs access control lease

497
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:57,109
in all the different enables in December
the morning to mall

498
00:30:57,109 --> 00:31:00,980
an you previous version of Bergeron's

499
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,730
love they is he being admiral big Asian
summer air

500
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:08,540
the internal on the external poor where
they

501
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:12,389
the same so there's no distinction and
there were only

502
00:31:12,389 --> 00:31:16,250
a there was only one a DC be pardoned
for

503
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:19,359
for both connections the internal ones
and text are not

504
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:22,869
a you were shows he's enabled by default

505
00:31:22,869 --> 00:31:26,200
this separation but you you need

506
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,119
ask customers you need to be sure that a
you are

507
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:33,330
a configure and your services in that
way

508
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:37,159
on also enable and review all the
different looks

509
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:41,359
so there are also some references there
for for computer the day

510
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:45,740
80th and Sabre 18 the internal and
external ports

511
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:49,129
soap the last they're released that I
want to show

512
00:31:49,129 --> 00:31:52,960
he staying queue server they do server

513
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,480
here he says service that handles all
the Lok make anything

514
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,109
a wk chalet air so it can those

515
00:32:02,109 --> 00:32:05,800
all the locks of the different tables
but not I

516
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,419
some regular database a when you can

517
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:13,000
no ok are you ok I table when you

518
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,070
you need to ride for example but a

519
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:19,480
East I was the same but on the
application layer so

520
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,070
there's only one persistent because of
the nature of

521
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:28,379
of the service and on also in recent
years versions

522
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,790
you can run the service as a stand-alone
obligations sewed

523
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:35,520
the the previous versions and

524
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,540
in the British version thank you sir
amor it works us

525
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:42,090
a one of their work processes a

526
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:46,200
in this centrally stance and not inures

527
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,320
versions you can run the thank you sir
processed on our obligation

528
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,599
and and also you can come for your for
high-availability

529
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:58,099
with a replication server so it also
makes

530
00:32:58,099 --> 00:33:02,109
this series and dressing target because
there's traffic going on

531
00:33:02,109 --> 00:33:05,379
him from onto the friend obligation
service

532
00:33:05,379 --> 00:33:08,510
so did that DB ga

533
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:12,240
a conflagration of or there and do
server

534
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,530
when different application servers
connect so one with a server

535
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:20,629
and 21 Inc you sever as a stand-alone
application

536
00:33:20,629 --> 00:33:24,149
and idk also a half a replication server

537
00:33:24,149 --> 00:33:28,099
for providing high availability soap

538
00:33:28,099 --> 00:33:32,510
so well now I that's why I DM far many
good reference on our tax

539
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,820
against these Prada on the service

540
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:39,540
air I also false on security notes

541
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:43,500
like dad two were song crashes if you
sense on

542
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,970
a is specially crafted back its a

543
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:51,200
and that you can also transfers transfer
fights between the for navigation

544
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,149
service

545
00:33:52,149 --> 00:33:57,649
you seen think you sever but a down from
any any additional information

546
00:33:57,649 --> 00:34:01,280
so looking at the broader goal it's our

547
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,470
also I kinda complex network protocol

548
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:08,590
in cath at least four different bag and
tied

549
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:13,450
day connection administration when you
can't change by meters

550
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:17,909
about your own connection to thank you
sir more this server administration

551
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:21,639
a when you can perform some
administrative task

552
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:25,599
on the server side air all the packets
that carries

553
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,830
their replication air another from

554
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:33,290
special packets use it for study cigar
and application servers

555
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:37,109
and no wean the stages of often include
a

556
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:40,869
heading to server lock table and things
like that

557
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:44,669
soap some security measures air

558
00:34:44,669 --> 00:34:48,109
for Dez brought to go on the service
also do

559
00:34:48,109 --> 00:34:51,609
give up today on on their under budget
from the features

560
00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:55,419
in in recent versions you can also
enable

561
00:34:55,419 --> 00:34:59,099
access control East a so are you must be
sure that

562
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:02,690
you are restricting access to the
Service only two

563
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:06,310
to the application servers and not
external clients

564
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:09,680
a enable a review notes and

565
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,640
also restrict us my just you can access
to the servers

566
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,099
because here I don't find a reference

567
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:20,840
on hold you can configure the Swede S&C
and you

568
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:24,590
it's possible to configure had to run

569
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:28,780
day in and using encryption so

570
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,900
there's a lot of critical information
troubling

571
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:36,470
here with this broader law in the Lok
tables equity got from our own operation

572
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,119
system abrasion point of view

573
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:41,680
so its owner or also really

574
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,150
important to 233 doctors by means of I
was or

575
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,820
any any other additional

576
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:53,580
measure so to rub up on their classic

577
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:58,390
SAP environment a we review some attacks
on the sub router

578
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:01,940
on the Gateway on the dispatcher the
missions around the December

579
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:05,790
which are they most common on the most
important services

580
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:09,720
that are present in they need we are up

581
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,990
a installations so

582
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:16,910
let's see a little more about David more
they are

583
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:20,790
a sybian by a month teeth cannot feature

584
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:27,090
dad I had in my mind about what Hall of
moderate to be environment looks like

585
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:27,760
when you have

586
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,060
no different trains connecting to the
cloud or something else

587
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:36,630
air the class a-1 this Abdi browsers for
it to be serviced

588
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:40,510
but also a lot of new maybe a glance on
mobile devices

589
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:44,420
I'm thing like that at the knees is dead
direction that is the bee's

590
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,650
heeds it's a game but if you look inside

591
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:50,790
add they Ned war I

592
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:55,540
on at the infrastructure layer must have
the congress are still the same

593
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:59,700
I mean you will need and we were
application server running

594
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,650
there so most of the doc said we sell

595
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:07,780
will be steal by Liam in modern it'd be
environment but

596
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:10,890
there are also known as new solutions a
new products

597
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:17,890
hair to that will be continued to to be
integrated with woody if modern

598
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:22,270
different is a bi environment so I want
to focus only on

599
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:25,700
they want that I for money dressed in

600
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:29,670
for my security a network protocols
perspective

601
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:32,830
which had the NetWeaver gateway I

602
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:35,960
subhana so need NetWeaver gateway

603
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,400
he's therapy is dad a

604
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,470
East a he stole us I am Not long

605
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:45,970
for their a version of the NetWeaver
application servers

606
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:50,070
a aid a mere dad integration between

607
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:53,230
the friends a clients different

608
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:56,650
a services it offers

609
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:01,109
I race they be I base on all that on how
to brothels

610
00:38:01,109 --> 00:38:05,410
so the most interesting thing the iPhone
Ystad

611
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,760
a his brother was are stunned ice

612
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,200
a there's a lot of information available
about the brother goes

613
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,619
there are also some tools to perform
penetration test

614
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:20,230
I i mean these brother both
implementations

615
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:23,400
so I'd indeed is studied at a

616
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,700
a good move on you seen is stunned are
protocols

617
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:31,930
a in this case the deal that so I expect
to see a lot of

618
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:37,140
new attacks comin a in India in the
following years

619
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:43,310
agrees these the service is on also
subhana

620
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:47,130
weeds ID new becoming the kind of
production brother

621
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:51,950
of with AB and dabble in a lot of
different service in solution

622
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:55,290
around Savannah it's Annie memory that
the race

623
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:58,900
very whether from on and Kong race on
edge

624
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,710
outside of features not not fun on

625
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:05,940
on the classic RDBMS

626
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:09,350
so from the broader perspective

627
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:13,100
did think that iPhone also really
interesting is that they publish

628
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,450
all the specific asians abroad ago so

629
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:19,930
thats a very good mood from from Missy
be also

630
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:23,220
a in da referencing that mean you

631
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:27,010
you can see all day hold W

632
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:31,170
all the difference network packets so I
a suspected to

633
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:35,390
to see a lot of different attacks like
the one side

634
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:38,400
I showing in this presentation

635
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,830
and targeting the this up gonna in the
following years

636
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:46,330
so just a little starting to wrap up

637
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:51,810
a some information about what we sow

638
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:56,080
and the different faces and of I know
we're British version test

639
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:00,660
air regarding discovery and
information-gathering

640
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:04,820
the you camp discover services by
different means

641
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:09,820
an big DD News to identify all the
different components

642
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:13,330
enough aberration a we saw some attacks

643
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:17,390
to gather information on on did
different services

644
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:22,150
on a start to to gaining as much
information as you can

645
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:26,460
a also some of their services are at 10
to get so you can perform

646
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:31,210
with Orthodox or most interesting to to
look at the full potential of

647
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:36,150
a I'm going to the benevolent DSS manned
exploration

648
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:40,170
here with us on my tax related to sniff
in on Mon Ami attacks

649
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:44,320
almost all of the broader goals are
earning created by default

650
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:50,480
an we also saw that its buried recede to
involve clients and trying to end the

651
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,470
scions

652
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:55,270
I amber from my jacks a taking clients

653
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:58,390
into account a also song fung

654
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:02,920
functions that could be abuse like their
money to mall on the different services

655
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,710
and on some of their remote
administrative

656
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:10,210
in the operation go study different
services provide

657
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:15,820
a with author from several in remote
code execution vulnerability stars are

658
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,570
really interesting to look at

659
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:21,230
and I think that they point of fact sees

660
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:26,000
internet were printed version this is to
reach some connection when you have Bri

661
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,870
religious

662
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:30,850
to access to the different components
I'm bypass the different

663
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:34,040
access Congolese and I the need we'd

664
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,380
all the different objects that we so if
you reach that point

665
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:42,670
you were broadly succeed and own they
the complete is a beast our nation

666
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:46,160
so it is also just for the record

667
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,710
but can a preview of the different
attacks that

668
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:53,609
that we so on the different services an

669
00:41:53,609 --> 00:41:57,070
I scratcher the one-third are air

670
00:41:57,070 --> 00:42:02,730
I really patch an hour mark more close
to a specific vulnerabilities

671
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:06,940
so some conclusions on the defense side
were obviously to

672
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:09,940
test all the different services to

673
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:13,070
all Bluetooth it to dude

674
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:16,500
peace in in a continuous way to always

675
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:20,280
bytch all the different services it's
something like

676
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:25,060
is something that we re so it's its
complex is difficult but he is

677
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:29,050
one of the main bones of performing a
penetration test

678
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:32,420
a.m. also use encryption John house

679
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:36,700
in all the services that you can im on
either the different logs

680
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:41,400
and also restrict the ACS on on all the
services

681
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:46,390
hope to finishing had to wrap up some
conclusions were

682
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:51,260
we saw some new on recent attacks
affecting the different services

683
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:54,780
some of the older adults can be now
practically

684
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:59,880
implemented a because we had some
information about the broader course

685
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,710
a we discuss also some defense on
gardening ideas

686
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:06,839
and the most interesting one for me is
that

687
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:10,870
they are there's more brother goes the
death available for

688
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:16,560
for this age research community so our
speed also to see lot of new attacks on

689
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,480
you will 10 abilities

690
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,640
a bean been exploring against the DC

691
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,290
these even protocols so

692
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:29,440
I don't have anymore also

693
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,630
if you want has a question his

694
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:35,640
re you para meterse

695
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:40,490
really message server yet not to
diminish the server are also the ones

696
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:41,839
that are a dynamic

697
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:45,230
they are so once that you can change bad

698
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:48,230
you there is that were not related math

699
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:51,650
over be Malaysian

700
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:55,070
nah not this one you you can't you can
change

701
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:59,630
and you can only change they want stud
are related to the missile server

702
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:02,850
and there was a dar dynamic Dr orders

703
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:06,450
dozen me to change from from a removable

704
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:10,540
you but it's interesting you can for
example enable

705
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:14,950
a HDD be interface in different ports

706
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:20,350
you can I O War I'll in neighbor or
disable different

707
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:24,030
services of the mission server you can
disable

708
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:28,800
how the team you can do a lot of
interesting things

709
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:35,720
but a constrain 22 to the mitchell
server

710
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:42,720
going

711
00:44:42,859 --> 00:44:49,859
rape well i i

712
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:55,349
if I have five min of War II 12 to Kyle

713
00:44:55,349 --> 00:44:59,099
a new mall but only one may note air

714
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:02,190
death also yeah

715
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:08,640
great a the way I I receive a lot of
feedback from the from be blonde

716
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,680
I receive a lot of contribution from
from different

717
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,000
a recert truth the so I

718
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,750
the new versions of the two will bring
the new Prada lost add

719
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:23,619
that I reviewing in this talk and also a
lot of your examples

720
00:45:23,619 --> 00:45:26,920
and improve man's big sis on different
things I did add

721
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,109
there's a lot of room for improvement
bad

722
00:45:30,109 --> 00:45:35,040
a growing I mean the two sides are
growing

723
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,750
I still need some work on facing more
things

724
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:42,240
and improve mean they are FC and the
dialogue protocols

725
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,820
I also wanted to add some new printables

726
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:49,390
and I before or the network protocol use
for

727
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:53,280
for an hour some mark them both and

728
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,310
I'll only sober for different versions I
mean a different brother goes

729
00:45:57,310 --> 00:46:00,380
and the network packets changes across

730
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:03,650
a different version so it's really had
to keep up on

731
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:07,160
on on on all those on I'll saw

732
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:12,050
did some work on trying to improve their
service discovery

733
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:15,599
you seen em up so if anyone want to

734
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:21,630
an you start and dishonest are improving
the the probes then my probes

735
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:24,810
age very useful for BER form a

736
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:28,170
penetration testing i'm for the
discovery face

737
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:31,700
to to have a lot of more proves a new
group and

738
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:35,859
tested against different versions and
different services so anyone that

739
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:40,060
can join me in that and I will really
appreciate

740
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:44,310
so that'll you thank you
