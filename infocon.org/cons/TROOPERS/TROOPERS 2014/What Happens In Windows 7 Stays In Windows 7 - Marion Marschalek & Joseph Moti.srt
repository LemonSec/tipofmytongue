1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,379
welcome and good morning welcome to talk
about what happens when the Sun stays in

2
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:07,910
the summer

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,430
we gonna talk about their abilities
today a

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,139
and how to find them identify them as

5
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:20,770
are whether it already introduced us my
name is very much like

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,950
and my friend who is not the Joseph I

7
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:29,770
work as a mofo analysts and in my spare
time I like to the reverse engineering

8
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,170
expression before the challenge was
particularly hard us we all know that

9
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,569
there are so many females

10
00:00:34,569 --> 00:00:38,030
in that business that to chance was like

11
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,030
howie overran by

12
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,909
participants on know this project that
we present today

13
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:50,920
and tits can you feel it for me but they
think

14
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,389
Maltese more specialist Center

15
00:00:56,389 --> 00:01:00,319
bio focus Inc a my spare time a day to
day there

16
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:04,920
and that's it basically right and today

17
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,110
we have a long list of the 10 tell you
which the gun

18
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:13,020
tried to speak up because not everyone
sorry on we don't talk about

19
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,090
vulnerabilities

20
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,159
most particularly well how to find
vulnerabilities

21
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,859
in passed on that offer and gonna
percent

22
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:24,140
approach to came up with to ultimately

23
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,909
spot vulnerabilities in binaries my
particular

24
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:31,619
be focused on Windows binaries
especially when the seven

25
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,880
am gonna show you a solution for
approach

26
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,159
how you can fine for her abilities 17
leveraged by

27
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:43,969
dipping them with whens it like this is
all concept

28
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:48,640
is not that new somewhere no what's new
with our project that we tried to

29
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,119
automated and make it fast and easy to
use are we can show you them lie about

30
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:55,520
how to use our 20

31
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,149
and financials our results potential

32
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:06,149
police that we found without tool and to
the church

33
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,310
why would we want to find

34
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,760
vulnerabilities in software some might
have heard that there's a

35
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,880
can shady business a being serviced on

36
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,430
a little Billy's just people who find
them as people who want to

37
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,820
by the hospital want to so and those
people who want to exploit them

38
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:29,580
so we have a virus people being
interested in 10 billion the big group

39
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,370
of people

40
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,810
actually working on that business and

41
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,100
well we have that right to percent
solution

42
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,490
for these people to make their work
faster weather so this is what on their

43
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,000
abilities

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,190
home I put water on that flight from

45
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,330
very famous security researcher muslim
chick North

46
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,030
more have to kill his names first layer

47
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,690
who wrote place definition of Billy's
and how they

48
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,650
are being created basically i the brady
misconception

49
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,690
or about programming but some problems

50
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,220
and that they can actually be used to at
TEKsystems

51
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:12,840
I'm pretty sure everyone in his family
with the term exploit Mayo

52
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,840
posts how to use exploits to actually

53
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,190
split that its systems and her systems

54
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:22,680
and should not worth and eventually
maybe effect systems are still

55
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,340
information

56
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,250
and as we all know there's another box
up 34 the news

57
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,120
there's more and more vulnerabilities
been discovered and exploited and

58
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,710
detected

59
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:37,350
and maybe even patched but in fact
there's love them

60
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,830
%uh still on pitch other um

61
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,960
particularly no pets available for
specific abilities

62
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,350
or systems with their abilities which
what

63
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,740
actually already have available purchase
but I'm not patched

64
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:57,230
in the end and so stable level on the
Internet now for people to know

65
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,300
Chuck Norris's we found a very good

66
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:05,770
PULTURE him under in trucks a particular
like this one

67
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,880
ripped it from a website where you can
actually by T-shirts

68
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,040
with printables not make marketing

69
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,440
thought that's a pretty cool idea don't
let him decide those shirts and self

70
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,870
pretty awesome alright how to find
vulnerabilities

71
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,100
home this is actually

72
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,660
abrasion some racing like almost

73
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,180
not everything that you can do to find
vulnerabilities just the most important

74
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:33,530
fact

75
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:37,610
all feasible way will be a vacation
penetration testing

76
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,450
are balls including fussing which is try
to morph

77
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:44,480
input for specific interfaces

78
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,600
of an application an ounce tried to get

79
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,870
ok we're behavior try to find crashes
actually

80
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,830
so if an application crashes it's always
a good hint that there might be

81
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,030
are fuck in there that could eventually

82
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:02,700
maybe exploit another approach would be
reverse engineering

83
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,050
which is kinda to this issue ever tried
to reverse engineer binary

84
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,790
on takes long time and it's hard to find
in

85
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:13,450
animali in there as usual your physician
you're trying to find

86
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,310
functionality not arm functional
shouldn't happen

87
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,460
in a binary other physical approach
source code review

88
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,760
are very frequently than by a dedicated
companies I think this

89
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,030
as a security service to review the
source code

90
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,370
of standard application to find bucks in
there

91
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:37,040
and to allow the vendor to fix them

92
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,340
incapable source of threat to Salisbury
possibly

93
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,120
being used by hackers to find
vulnerabilities in open source software

94
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,290
and eventually heck that's

95
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:51,150
or wheels listed some ideas I could be
more advanced

96
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:55,000
on lyrically search which I thought
pretty creative ideas

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,990
to simply track softer box being
reported

98
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,790
the might get patched at some point or
stay on past for a long time because

99
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,900
then it just doesn't care

100
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,090
but still people publish information
about books

101
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:13,090
so if his invention exploit being
written for

102
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,240
nonce of a book but I than ever

103
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,850
gets patch or is not passion again
system

104
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:25,220
the state's know people who believe it
could eventually be exploited

105
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,400
arm also might approach will be to
introduced boxes software

106
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,440
as you might know that there's a some
money you could eventually make with a

107
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,620
little Billy

108
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,510
it might be useful to just simply

109
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,900
bright the programmer to enter this box

110
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,900
and software that it could eventually
exploit later

111
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:50,560
and getting more money than you actually
paid the program intentions the book

112
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,010
and d approach that we concentrated on
for

113
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,350
our research was overseeing security
purchase

114
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:01,500
as you know if there's a will reduce
sound touch written for a

115
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,690
sometimes he's purchased themselves are
vulnerable

116
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,690
or even worse not being applied

117
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:12,380
to every system that is out there which
happens very frequently

118
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,430
so for our research we concentrated on
missing security patches

119
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:19,680
on when the Sun systems too good maybe a
plate

120
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,389
to winds late already but didn't reach
you in some platform

121
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:27,520
we didn't %uh directly reverse engineer
security patches

122
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,830
themselves the concentrated on the
library to def

123
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,180
for missing patches that were present

124
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:40,960
in the end by the entrance another 17

125
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,100
and get back to the box who's interested
in finding bucks

126
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,270
well as a mission for those brought
range people actually want to find

127
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:53,580
softbox all most fallen initially it
were

128
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,580
Packers just want to play with binary

129
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,680
and try to break stuff

130
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,430
brake systems for are not so much

131
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,470
financial motivations but just for fun

132
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,900
than their software companies who
actually want to find vulnerabilities

133
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,580
mostly in their own

134
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:16,970
products to be able to catch them and
not have the end user being

135
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:20,760
vulnerable to attacks by hackers for
example

136
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,370
home we have a third group on that
flight that I'm not totally sure if the

137
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,440
term actually

138
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,080
is to crack want to apply which will be
criminals we use

139
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,159
billy's or build exploits to

140
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,569
at Tech businesses or governments to
excellent read

141
00:08:35,569 --> 00:08:38,669
data or arm spy

142
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:41,849
on the dedicated victim

143
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:45,139
which as we all might have hers on the
media today

144
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:49,110
yes not necessarily on the criminals
buying businesses but

145
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:53,240
something's this is a spy and
governments government spying

146
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,850
criminals or this is a spying private
persons

147
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,309
bro persons governments

148
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:03,949
some fifty much for the media might have
noticed that there's like a broad

149
00:09:03,949 --> 00:09:04,660
spectrum of

150
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:09,740
interests in hacking motivations

151
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,110
redness and talking about it the with
group witnesses on there will be

152
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,540
governments

153
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,680
who well we don't actually officially
really know what they're doing with it

154
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,699
but there's got out there I believe his
name that would slow the ninos

155
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:26,769
up did more than we do about government
action to the

156
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:30,119
police arm

157
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:33,119
I'm not sure if this is openly

158
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:37,139
available information and lost when on
the move the media

159
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:42,319
I at them because I really like the
media very much into it.

160
00:09:42,319 --> 00:09:45,769
actually very creatively right about
security issues that are out there in

161
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:48,240
the field

162
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,129
arm beyond the Rosary interested in
their abilities and belief

163
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:56,050
cuz every time once discovered their
civic report about the

164
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:01,360
from several different sites

165
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,509
on finally why was interested in it

166
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:07,790
although no doing it for fun maybe sets
to Hector

167
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:12,189
with Moses on ranches in some sort of a
venue

168
00:10:12,189 --> 00:10:16,670
because as you heard everyone got to
stick a disinterested

169
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,800
police and there's actually market
involving were

170
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,100
pretty huge sums of money actually
change owner every once in a while

171
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,220
followed by a vulnerability

172
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,230
because usually with these on their
abilities you can make

173
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,829
even more money so

174
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:39,079
this is Mark Price most probably the
most trying power plant

175
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:45,450
ability research much

176
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:49,530
so let's say you found a Zillow they
invulnerability

177
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:53,650
the onto said it in and this lady is so
that basically

178
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,670
missus devices you can get

179
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:01,220
you can get the spices an even more but
it's oh so simple

180
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,290
is local eight if you adjust to develop
a

181
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,980
in don't have connection with no one and
you would think the Google Instant

182
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,060
Fiat with to sell its you going in that

183
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:16,260
with website like this CDI day went back
to zero there from you

184
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,690
even if it's a with with one they're
gonna pay you much money

185
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,860
you may get 10k mocks

186
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,300
and so what you wanna do

187
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,960
if you want to get much more money the
problem is that

188
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,030
the people that we link to pay the big
money want to stay

189
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:40,250
an onerous then don't want to know the
bite and usually the developer

190
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,530
don't want to know that he said the
black market so must be a

191
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,540
situation to put it within

192
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,700
between each other each other so this is
where Boca

193
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:56,210
come to the business the book a a is
actually have a good relationship

194
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:59,530
with the clients plan to use any big
eyes

195
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:03,190
governments organization at work with
the government's

196
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,520
so that does this guy developer

197
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,200
doesn't have so much deep information
with a balky a

198
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,920
but these bitch chance to be the big
money so he trusts

199
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,150
to give the book it touched so basically

200
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,350
the book here get this deal a day

201
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,590
from the developer the developer give
with us

202
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:29,790
the developer didn't get paid anything
give everything you have

203
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:34,110
to the Booker the Boca has fed
information

204
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:37,480
to their client day if I that everything
as requested

205
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,430
and then the payment is touted there's
one issue

206
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:46,940
left the money issue the clients want to
pay two hundred thousand five hundred

207
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,940
thousand dollars

208
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,140
give the money to bait mighty want to
make sure

209
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,270
it's not going to be patched after a
deal to

210
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:57,840
both least its exclusive see usually

211
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,260
a pain chunks they said let's say

212
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,260
every month you get 50 K if it's not
patched

213
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,300
so basically that day basically says

214
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,390
okay if it's we want it for six months

215
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:16,080
if it's a touchy with all the money
every month you with a little

216
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:21,470
so developer is happy the book is happy
because they get percent from the said

217
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:25,640
usually 10-15 percent and the client is
happy because he got

218
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,520
what they wanted deal with these usually
the place

219
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,240
use it immediately it don't waste time
because basically the by

220
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,550
on-demand so

221
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,580
what actually happened when d0 they

222
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,890
go to the black market basically

223
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,810
is being used and every time usually
ninety percent of the time

224
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:53,610
when you see this kind of thing is it's
because one of the black market

225
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:57,950
both eat in use it to have the system
and eventually

226
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:01,330
day period of time indicate discover

227
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:05,020
this is a perfect case of an office that
was used

228
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:10,170
a year sometimes two years to exploit
web sites

229
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,660
and eventually get out so

230
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,570
can you can be sure that is do it is
though their that actually four years

231
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:20,700
riding day public but not get

232
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,450
discovered so this is basically a little

233
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:29,200
how this system walk rights now I
understand

234
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,420
why people interested in with their
abilities arm

235
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:36,590
where she tried to optimize the

236
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:40,280
these interests and automating

237
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,940
are approached find vulnerabilities
faster I we want to be faster

238
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,790
arm as records we couldn't

239
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:53,280
break Morris were in the grayscale we
could make more money as

240
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,880
we might be in local governments began
well

241
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,960
can tell you arm and

242
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,240
just in case we would work with the
media which we don't we could

243
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,640
right about more cell

244
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,110
became up with an approach that we
believe it's pretty

245
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,589
also pretty simple really scary simple

246
00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:18,150
and faster that actually searching for
their abilities by hand

247
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,550
so what makes it did worse

248
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:24,589
different different versions of when the
sled race

249
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:29,370
to spot missing patches he only slight
you can see a simple example that we

250
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:29,910
found

251
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,640
all by hand fan searching the court
still

252
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:39,020
which is involved with some processing
going arm

253
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,600
which for sure as it is involved with
processing is gonna except they did at

254
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,350
some point

255
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:47,870
and through some up with some point and
this is X actually

256
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:52,760
a actually exactly the library type that
we want to find something that accepts

257
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,459
input from somewhere

258
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:59,540
and processes some point so well we can
spot in those functions that process

259
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,630
user input so we could maybe

260
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:07,940
all tweak the input values that specific
political functions would handle

261
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:13,100
to eventually cause I'll for example in
touch or floor buffer overflow

262
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,250
or in touch on the full on the flow or

263
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,020
whatever modification the couple hours
to corrupt memory

264
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,330
in service function so here we have the
question lol

265
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,339
were we spotted by searching it

266
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:29,410
with I have pro all missing

267
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,970
safe function we face a function ass

268
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:37,089
functions that allow to check input
values

269
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:41,170
if they actually fit a given size that
the shouldn't

270
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:45,950
bigger or smaller than this concise so
in the first example you see the win7

271
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:46,940
Britian

272
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,800
where memories okay that's and its last
call on their

273
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,780
and decisive moment it's gonna be okay
that is received

274
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,050
by the function through the CL

275
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,470
through dcx basically so if you follow
this

276
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,750
some the cold there you can see that

277
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:09,270
EX not modifiable never but eventually
if you could manage to modify

278
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,709
dcx he could maybe get TX to have

279
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:15,860
a seis or to indicate a size that could
be too big for the

280
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,089
of its gonna be located on the Second
Sight

281
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:22,170
you see it when the situation were you
long Mott

282
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:26,610
used to actually checked size of buffer
size

283
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:30,440
that is gonna be okay that which insures
that

284
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,670
this size is not going to be bigger them
a specific value

285
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:38,760
shouldn't overrun so how did we find
this

286
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,350
very simple idea opening up by the pro
am

287
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,830
doing string search for the skin
function that we once

288
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,400
spot so we saw her I the pros

289
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,990
am count simply the functions

290
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:57,130
though we fund leverage: also there's a
difference so we come to the Windows 8

291
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,830
we have 46 appearances want

292
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,220
only one always equal say function

293
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,820
and when the when the sun's light we
found forty-four examples of this

294
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:12,640
which told us that the right to missing
the when the southern side

295
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,200
I have to say just because we're only
say functions missing several these are

296
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,840
missing

297
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,240
doesn't indicated there passive even
their ability

298
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,650
other this definitely a good hint the
there's some security missing

299
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,830
on the side where the counts lower

300
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:32,260
so with a simple idea we went all and

301
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,480
spotting to function in the library
where

302
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,510
on the ones eight sites thus a function
was planning on the 17 site the function

303
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,640
was not present

304
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,330
we managed to find the specific function
that will actually

305
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:50,940
eventually provide the vulnerability

306
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,730
so for an idea automation we
concentrated on the safe functions

307
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:58,020
was actually praise simple

308
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,280
and fun easy some up in

309
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,100
to help files like to live with that
provides us a function so when the

310
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,880
switch is influenced wrinkly

311
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,190
these definitions are provided us with
130

312
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,480
signatures with indicates a function
binaries

313
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,659
which occurred about type conversions
home

314
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:21,360
secure mathematical functions like
modifications or divisions

315
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,440
and of robotics on strings for

316
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,130
my location for example so concentrating
on this

317
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:32,960
so signatures we collected 130 progress
on examples here

318
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,320
of mathematical functions for example
who

319
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,560
provide secure safe functions four
editions

320
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,800
or modifications provide

321
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,860
functions to check buffer sizes for
string location

322
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,900
so do these functions we had

323
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,900
the text representation from the hell
fast

324
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:59,190
and will do nothing else than try to get
extra presentation after leverage that

325
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,030
we're searching

326
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:04,990
actually search for to getting
signatures in these libraries

327
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:08,000
then simple I'll just def

328
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,540
number of constant found of getting sick
functions

329
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,770
so this is our approach %uh away from
the windows library

330
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:20,760
to the dipping in checking for the
vulnerabilities

331
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,560
is pretty much up the middle in our
system so we take the library

332
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,530
and to compile it with up Rhonda X-rays
plugin

333
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:31,679
and parse the compiled version of the
library

334
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,350
into the database so we have all the

335
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:40,290
own signature hits of the safe functions
and leverage in the database

336
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:43,760
enough to us just simply defer to with

337
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,380
well simple SELECT statement database
was like the most

338
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,780
is to push ever soft or else we have def
Inc

339
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:54,270
of the library's and just see where arm

340
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:58,140
the constant for so we're we have more
appearances say function

341
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,720
and were eventually in which function we
could

342
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:08,030
find missing say function

343
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,480
so here's the solution the finally
implement notice

344
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,500
graphic is very beautiful because I

345
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:19,640
he signed it myself arm this particular
shows the whole process

346
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,970
of the thing that we produce me have

347
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:26,740
the library's on the left top corner
induce the pro

348
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:31,060
actually to tolstoy we produce ourselves

349
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:36,310
to decomposing Cy Falls physically for
some very short time I heard

350
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,830
all the source code when the Sun Winslet
leverage by

351
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,980
computer speakers feeling

352
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:47,290
done we nothing simpler than

353
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:52,159
parsing these files like going through
the files in searching for the safe

354
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,450
functions so we find for

355
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:57,659
and put them into the database just
simply the

356
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:01,220
names to function weren't found that's
the name to face a function

357
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,550
and eventually the council two hits to
the with her one specific

358
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:07,880
when this label function

359
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,669
it was really just that simple richest
conduct and put everything

360
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:15,040
into the database that uses signed on
here

361
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,800
don't I'm gonna talk about low that more
children

362
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,980
arm in there we collected all the hits

363
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,429
of say functions which we find the
signatures and when the slavery

364
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:30,550
and little to nothing else than just
saying but the application mention up

365
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,300
there

366
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:35,909
for producing diff things yep that is
actually in CSV formats so

367
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:39,640
we could very well just put it back into
database

368
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,700
amply their own future approach at more
when those russians to loading approach

369
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,120
to did

370
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,120
I'll between more version still

371
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,200
to so

372
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,900
was mentioned we would get the see your
presentation at the completion

373
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,250
using using I'm a pro and eventually up

374
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:02,810
with all the source code other ones
levers

375
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:05,870
which within put into our parsing

376
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:09,730
application which is an open-source
pipeline project

377
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:14,450
released on my get a profile that can
take all the superstitions

378
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,950
put them in a database and eventually
produce a diff and the civil

379
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:21,330
see later we now you can have Greek

380
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:25,830
for user justification specially

381
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:29,530
more about this in so this would manage
a lower labor reason functions and the

382
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,020
signature its

383
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:34,030
close to the things this against

384
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:37,720
little bitty sign so we focused clearly
on the its

385
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,780
is really simple it could very easily
extend the but this is actually only

386
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,159
need

387
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:44,480
for following the post we have arm

388
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,830
we have a presentation of leverage and
all their functions

389
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:53,740
and eventually all the hits of say fuck
system we find these functions

390
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,210
family where the differing this %uh

391
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:00,300
an example how are the things look like

392
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,650
sorry just very simply counting the safe
functions

393
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:10,650
into the kids functions %uh low-risk and
check we find a difference in their

394
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,150
very much text this would be how you
could compare our total

395
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:18,700
this is actually the most experts
documentation that's there is so far

396
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,200
summer as well these are the

397
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,340
come on plane statements that could need
if you want to use it on the command

398
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,100
line

399
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,880
there's a more Mullen statements back
here but whatever she wants she was

400
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,330
the gory

401
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:37,860
I'm very very proud of her color scheme

402
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:41,100
love her I'll this actually polls

403
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,640
follows growth arm

404
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,200
I admit I was too lazy to implement
multi-threading and that application

405
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,050
tomorrow that so I just

406
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:54,300
put everything into one going want to
face this is all the functionality of

407
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,380
the is

408
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,290
justify that by five books that we have
on their and I used to color so you can

409
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,149
actually say

410
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:03,820
all right now and the other books there
is all the configuration you have to put

411
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:07,050
yet to collectors and database Jeff to

412
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:11,399
arm configure the interfaces to
databases if you want to connect to mike

413
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:12,950
is a skill for example

414
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:16,659
need to put extensions right for this
can do this you can do in the

415
00:25:16,659 --> 00:25:19,690
configuration dialog

416
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:23,040
alright that's a function are the most
importantly the blue box

417
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,300
there you can do a generation

418
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:31,399
of safe of she changed

419
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:34,750
when it goes straight either the Glee
prison

420
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,780
like huh works the Pink Party can do

421
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:41,880
the parsing of c-fos you can switch
between 7 and Windows 8

422
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,649
and in the form originally had St still
implement for people

423
00:25:45,649 --> 00:25:48,929
don't have the X-rays plugin

424
00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:52,419
like me for example can parcells the
first

425
00:25:52,419 --> 00:25:56,360
but if as you might know like to for the
compulsion to see file

426
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,050
is like sicko and does tea stuff is like
assembly

427
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:04,800
which by definition is like four to five
times bigger than sick old

428
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,149
so as a tool which is the fastest yet

429
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:12,710
arm this country slow in Seaforth it
will take forever to use and I'll see

430
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,429
files for

431
00:26:13,429 --> 00:26:18,050
all the ones leverage that's why we
cancel the traction

432
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:21,300
and furthermore most important pars to
defend

433
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:25,080
where can produce says we file format
the things for the

434
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,320
when these levers alright source if it

435
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,890
re: into the future and I'm gonna show
you

436
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,580
hold toll actually works

437
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:42,130
I hope

438
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:45,550
alright small okay so this is the most
beautiful

439
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:49,800
we ever since

440
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,890
call cell actually wanna say in the
beginning with tweaked a little bit

441
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:58,429
because person takes really long with
that already and

442
00:26:58,429 --> 00:27:03,159
field are database before they know any
we now show you

443
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:07,100
over exam week I'll generate an ID in
the CFL

444
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,310
because this is actually pretty the
fullest to see other witnesses in the

445
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,260
probe popping up

446
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:15,290
closing down again so in the first place
you have to be fine

447
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:18,360
director if I the pro count

448
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:23,179
which DLL versus France you actually
wanna parse

449
00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:26,610
yeppers here

450
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:30,200
I'm gonna go on parcel in the same
system house

451
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:37,200
should be colorful ones popping up now
if this works

452
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:44,970
alright soundly credit no yeah it'd be

453
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:48,929
generated of or when the Sun system
process and I can generate

454
00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:54,149
seafront up region we have to the
protector

455
00:27:54,149 --> 00:27:57,470
and now

456
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:04,470
should in their daily basis to win 7

457
00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:09,049
sis faster we propose for them and now
we see how

458
00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:12,299
art instruments and a pro to

459
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:15,909
decompile ATP

460
00:28:15,909 --> 00:28:20,499
faster we produced before saw this
process

461
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:25,629
we should have running mates arm windows
7 source code

462
00:28:25,629 --> 00:28:30,169
in I'll that they will directory and

463
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:33,220
the dot C four months it's should
devotes it cope

464
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:37,360
more or less as x-rays those numbers
were great

465
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,799
arm wish I could use later on for

466
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:45,619
parsing will start parsing engine and
check for the 130 signatures

467
00:28:45,619 --> 00:28:50,309
there will be fine in our database as I
can maybe show you know in the meanwhile

468
00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:55,789
I can't because the mistress actually it
would be the configuration dialog

469
00:28:55,789 --> 00:28:58,840
where you can like

470
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,889
break and see the signatures do we have
the database and actually modify them

471
00:29:02,889 --> 00:29:07,950
so if you find any other function you
would find interesting

472
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:11,970
for security research for under the
research

473
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:16,820
you consider here and have to to a
search for the slow or even find more

474
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,960
intelligent signatures

475
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,580
ventures the strings for having more

476
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,610
a profit alright

477
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:28,289
nose to toes finished we should have see
fast

478
00:29:28,289 --> 00:29:31,779
in Arthur Terry can chick

479
00:29:31,779 --> 00:29:38,779
in there

480
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:46,980
ISO here's all the stuff that the toll
produced

481
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:50,270
we see in their is C source code found
in the Caesars

482
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:54,210
so use to leverage for the demo actually

483
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:58,169
this is how it would look if we clean up
to 30 Torino

484
00:29:58,169 --> 00:30:03,410
we'll have the celebrities in their
secret presentation as tax raise output

485
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:07,200
all right now oh do it starts the person
so

486
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,559
I within certain type of of my c-fos in
here

487
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,549
start arm yet the cation in the
background

488
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:18,120
to the parsing for Windows 7 and Windows
8 30 the pace

489
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,179
output which going to be a because it
takes

490
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:26,850
hours not I seeking something else just
takes like 20 minutes which is

491
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:29,890
too much for now but

492
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:33,440
if we finally did this we have a
database with another hits right

493
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,630
so we could start searching the database
for

494
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:41,940
are compiled library which in our case
was

495
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,830
once K-sixty and mr. x& Beats

496
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:50,760
10 which are not in the database a
concession stand look and see

497
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,940
we have these two levers with I these 13

498
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,049
slacker dorm

499
00:30:57,049 --> 00:31:02,790
and start addition on the sled race
which means I insert celebrities here

500
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:07,140
first if it and this is your part this
is like ship it bring up cuz I admit

501
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:11,830
because it is just an one result in
there but actually pretty clear reset

502
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:16,520
that muddies not gonna show you how you
could use this to spot a potential

503
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,690
their ability that

504
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:22,980
physically me ask you a question why
there's a different

505
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:27,470
if michael says edit this if function
Windows 8 why so that this new window 7

506
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:31,330
there on the Edit that dialysis for this
one is saying that

507
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:34,919
money the americans love don't want to
waste

508
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:38,290
development I'm on undo oppression
system

509
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:41,740
and no one know about this issues just
then

510
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:46,010
and they want people to move to I'll
operation system

511
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:49,630
so does that isn't that still exists in
your 7

512
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:54,630
imitate and I this budget what was the
goal is for that anyway

513
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:59,000
how you can be fine if it's useless or
not if we get

514
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,309
10 they from this project sort it now
one assist some example

515
00:32:04,309 --> 00:32:09,820
about the resort's just

516
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:15,309
likened keep talking okay

517
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:18,980
so basically is this is possibility we
find one good Zealand is

518
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,149
MOT now when you def

519
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:25,700
you have to choose what they wanna def
use a lawn mower

520
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:30,730
mothers ok nm others we started with New
Zealand motherless

521
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:34,669
bytes we know that there is no big
chance we found something there

522
00:32:34,669 --> 00:32:38,549
in the can and there was much more
possibilities because if you get

523
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:40,039
something you can get this cation

524
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:44,100
the village so this situation is just an
example

525
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:50,100
in the Canada the thing in the userland
add

526
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:57,100
by the way I did not design ago said

527
00:33:07,129 --> 00:33:10,259
yeah religious discussion about the
color seems agreed

528
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:17,070
didn't see any is not making string

529
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:20,770
sign

530
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:22,910
to run on just generating the I

531
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:26,910
be false for Windows 8 driver says it
didn't do this before

532
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:31,670
for being able to opening them up and I
the Pro and show you the actual

533
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:36,270
missing security functions which

534
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:42,410
huge crews nothing was gonna show you
some results that we

535
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:46,610
fun without dipping of

536
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:52,840
missing security

537
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:59,740
works so now I should have I DB files

538
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:03,210
the def English before Ash again

539
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:07,830
this was a K-sixty dessous

540
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:11,700
driver and there should be a potential
vulnerability in this

541
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:16,320
get a copy of identity function which is
indicated thing missing

542
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,639
you long at functions and

543
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:27,010
him right we have he pees in there

544
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:34,010
now

545
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:41,119
good thing

546
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:47,679
attempt

547
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:53,159
yes the basically the resort as you can
see we took on the mother's

548
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:58,220
of Windows and it gave us slow the
finest

549
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:01,680
you can see I love them specs wise

550
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,570
inch dick sweat and there you just open
a wonderful example

551
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:09,870
each one would tell you okay this
function appeal

552
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:15,190
one time in Windows 7 developed I mean
it's so one two three four five six

553
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:19,620
and again here in again is so basically
now your job is basically

554
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:24,250
to go 111 and check which one is a
relative in which one is not exploited

555
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:24,530
in

556
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:28,340
so the stick a few clues most of the
results

557
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,700
snake here is in pain CNG

558
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:35,510
you can see here in this function

559
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:38,700
convert Alice a 58 in Windows 8's

560
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,370
this function appear 8/9 in Reno 7

561
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:45,440
four times so first you want to verify

562
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,980
that this is the case so you take this
fight this

563
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,840
actually in this case to Divya CEng

564
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,950
so first thing you want to know it is
either is not in the system

565
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:59,190
just can use simple

566
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:04,280
the interview and CNG

567
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:09,020
can see it's here to see something about
the people there feel free Windows

568
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:12,140
so this night is loaded now you just
gonna go

569
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:15,770
and open FS versions of Windows seven n8

570
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:21,520
go this function and see if there is a
difference sorry so that's

571
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,620
in in

572
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:31,620
well

573
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:45,180
so this is seven vision Singh

574
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:50,950
you know I'm the Windows version of the
Windows 8 version of this Inc

575
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:57,950
love the same time to open

576
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,590
no limiting the function space into a
just to SF 6

577
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:08,590
happen

578
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,490
so this is in Windows 8 can see one

579
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:23,960
to the for by seeks

580
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,470
7 89 dysfunction was a day and if you
open the same thing

581
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:35,470
in Windows 7

582
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:48,330
you can see it's only 12 34 in
downstairs

583
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:51,650
there is no anymore continue of this a
function

584
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:56,170
so something is passively Wong if it's
exploitive in our notes

585
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:59,230
now it's another issue basically what
you do

586
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:02,230
basically tied to figure out who could
this function

587
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:05,270
in these cases export for Alice eighty

588
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:08,520
see go up in go again so this is

589
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,420
BK export key you go up again again

590
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,420
until you get okay BK

591
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:19,170
export K especially in export function
so we're here

592
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:22,740
so now your job is to figure out how
this is Tim

593
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:26,280
call this function and if you can go get
to it for me use an end

594
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,930
then can you get escalation the village
this case

595
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:33,220
and only if text but they were not I
know that is either case actually

596
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,040
exploited

597
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,730
even remotely in our gonna show some
other example

598
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:44,730
musician

599
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:53,670
so example here this is it the ANN
models

600
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:56,800
you can see this be caped nested
function name

601
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,130
here you can see in Windows 7s was edit
few

602
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:04,000
chicks in Windows 8 didn't again

603
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,079
this is a big day ahead net Logan though
the alleged

604
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,109
in Windows 8 you can see a lot of

605
00:39:11,109 --> 00:39:14,180
career out at the end unknown ed

606
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:17,839
sets a function with aidid to this add
to this article

607
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:22,390
to something for and 107 no sense
function exists

608
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:25,559
exploitable not we don't know yet

609
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:28,859
but at this point it's not again

610
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:32,490
now this another the alleged DW
extension

611
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:35,690
you can see unsentimental is unknown
after

612
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:39,900
este s down and check and in Windows 7

613
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,290
you can see that basically not check has
been done

614
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:47,990
and again after this year than any movie
little about

615
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:52,369
shit taking what's happening divas and
you can see this

616
00:39:52,369 --> 00:39:56,930
CNG the cryptography did I fail you can
say that there is few checked in with

617
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:57,430
eight

618
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:03,210
but none in Windows 7 and the one is
this

619
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:06,480
copy identify in Windows 8

620
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,900
Microsoft actually at the security check
well in Windows 7

621
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,790
they didn't so the entire idea is
basically to figure out

622
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:19,230
how to trigger from use an end to these
diverse

623
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:22,700
in the discussion P village in again

624
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,299
so there is a lot of a result that
actually

625
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:29,530
give us this stuff but

626
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:33,280
I can tell you that not ninety-nine
percent of them

627
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,660
popular sport event but one person it's
worth it for sure

628
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:43,299
you know the one this is the usual and
you can see this function

629
00:40:43,299 --> 00:40:47,510
K because object stin main corporate
directly or indirectly

630
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:50,640
in here yes make sure that the thing

631
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,809
is not too big or expand a little about

632
00:40:53,809 --> 00:40:57,740
how you figure out effect how delegates
this case

633
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:01,319
is keep DNG so basically some diana
books

634
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:04,760
that do some kinky option show you some
kitchen stuff

635
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,589
if any the function is the code what is
the coding

636
00:41:08,589 --> 00:41:14,170
some so the fifth attributes so he does
go been here and there

637
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:18,010
and tell you about what it is came to an
end function if you do with that for

638
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,220
every month or something

639
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:23,290
so it's basically it's show you some
stuff about the

640
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:26,569
certificates this is the function name

641
00:41:26,569 --> 00:41:31,230
him because object FBI so basically you
just need to Isis

642
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:34,280
the entire function to figure out if you
can dish it or not

643
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,589
and this is example the certificado

644
00:41:37,589 --> 00:41:40,880
actually grow to this function so each
owe you

645
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,710
if that is the case certificate
information see if you put a very long

646
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,410
stink

647
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:48,640
miss a thing to get it's possible you
would trigger

648
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,079
people the flow or something like that
that's the idea that

649
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,540
you feel you have to figure out what is
it a good point

650
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:58,559
so the entire research was basically
just

651
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:02,210
to find the issues how to trigger them

652
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:06,490
is another issue so

653
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:09,760
next writer closing out talk

654
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,059
I want to tell you some think so we
plant

655
00:42:13,059 --> 00:42:16,990
to implement the pitcher actually to
extend their tool

656
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:21,329
to did more than just when the 70 when
the same arm

657
00:42:21,329 --> 00:42:25,569
we know there's no windows 8.1 other and
we could

658
00:42:25,569 --> 00:42:28,640
very simply at this to our datasets and

659
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:33,260
create something that's living up picked
it up but medium-size

660
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:37,030
data and shit characters for their
abilities

661
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:42,650
in Windows 8 we could targets we could
very easily extend their signatures

662
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:46,119
to have more intelligence anxious than
just strings say functions

663
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:49,140
to maybe in that some intelligence to

664
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,500
evaluates the potential vulnerability
that

665
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,500
were spalding by searching

666
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,960
for a possibility to

667
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,200
traced in pavilions function that with
and first potentially vulnerability

668
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,280
or ideas like that

669
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:10,810
arm I also heard symbolic execution will
be an interesting thing to add to our

670
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:11,829
application

671
00:43:11,829 --> 00:43:16,119
I'm not sure yet if this is actually
implement a law

672
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:20,010
and the phone we have it now but
definitely put some research on that

673
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:23,780
and were actually want to myself

674
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:27,299
is provided transplant database leverage
because right now we depend on

675
00:43:27,299 --> 00:43:28,630
Microsoft's SQL

676
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:34,079
and as his life michael says the skills
not available for everyone in this July

677
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,670
is really really slow we try to find a
way

678
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:42,750
somewhere in the middle which might be
pastas and we have a love known issues

679
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:45,920
us we mention her a lot of us for this
like really

680
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,960
a lot of holes for this and love to pick
eight hits

681
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,740
that week tweak with signatures

682
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:59,020
you're really really slowing the thing
butter out made it so it's not really us

683
00:43:59,020 --> 00:43:59,869
were slow

684
00:43:59,869 --> 00:44:03,170
but tool which can work on its own

685
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:07,410
clip and the output this in CSV format

686
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:11,049
its not that hand yet to handle like

687
00:44:11,049 --> 00:44:14,940
I would love to put more information for
the reaction generate

688
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:18,260
to be able to evaluate the potential

689
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:23,220
other alright well that's basically it
with our talk

690
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:26,240
I hope fun and interesting and if
there's any questions
