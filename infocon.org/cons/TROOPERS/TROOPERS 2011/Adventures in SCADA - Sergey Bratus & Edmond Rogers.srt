1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,460
again I can into use to

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,819
really veteran trooper us sergei and Big
Easy

3
00:00:06,819 --> 00:00:11,230
I am that would give us a talk about
adventures in Scott a system I think

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,750
Scott assistance got a lot of attention

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,850
and the last year think Stuxnet

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,140
um so I think they have

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,230
some very interesting stuff to tell and
I had some

8
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,500
world the top also something to do with
cheese

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,789
we have cheese yeah

10
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:35,000
I i deny it I tonight she's not another

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,640
now now rate so

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,120
answer key practice I'm a research
assistant professor at Dartmouth College

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,320
and before we plunge into SCADA I would
like to

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,579
what about me well that yeah here too

15
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,010
SRK lately absolutely I was going to
talk about that

16
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,359
sake then introduce you oh why Arabia I

17
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:02,050
absolutely the UK efficiently achieve
that at

18
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:06,270
a at the easy I'll who is the reason I

19
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,130
admin directors who is the reason why we
were actually

20
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,520
I was actually able to get this
wonderful adventure in SCADA

21
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,310
the easy worked for a fortune 500
utility company

22
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,259
up protecting a control network up
keeping the lights on

23
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:24,320
in and states where

24
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,240
and as greater than 0 and less than 50

25
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,790
Eric say you can imagine

26
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,939
before we start in the scathing I would
like

27
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:38,310
as a public announcement and chill at

28
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,340
in I'll show some value in Accademia

29
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,790
said to say I would like to talk about
to project

30
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,119
that we have a doc wait we didn't
discuss this when we were going over the

31
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:51,560
slides an hour and a half ago

32
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,799
indeed but it had nothing to do with
cheese West

33
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,040
so one is

34
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,360
call dad this is our report at 3 a
wireless

35
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,360
date if you want to be immortalized or
your brother your dataset

36
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,800
to be mortal eyes give it to us out we

37
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,099
are proud to host the next hope New York
acker conference

38
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:18,230
at the edge data and many other
interesting pieces a day

39
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:22,980
that's one project the other is the
project that n/a

40
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:28,200
mentioned during the keynote we're
looking to talk to see I S l's

41
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,220
to determine how the bridge the gap
between the technological

42
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,390
underpinnings that systems can enforce

43
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,989
in terms for TCS station trusted
computing

44
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:44,290
anything that Intel and other then
there's a

45
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:49,379
throwing at the security wall and a how
will this is meeting or not meeting your

46
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:50,379
needs as a sex

47
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:54,050
and with that we're coming back to

48
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:59,940
and dangers in skid so we are

49
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,300
the Reid said interests which is what
found

50
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,970
me going to SCADA place in los que to
talks

51
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:12,099
you actually she images like that a

52
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:17,349
and they're there for the show we
actually I actually got to see that

53
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:23,360
kinda bored so a

54
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,840
to you in in now I have to totally
disappointed

55
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,420
the stalk is not going to use any 0 days

56
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:35,319
we're not going to name any vendors in
tech this day is going to

57
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:39,610
I'm here to ensure that yeah basically
jumped on me if I do

58
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:44,069
I and I there is going to be

59
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:48,640
no holes stocks he held the Stuxnet
whatsoever

60
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,780
I means text X net is a a lotta fun

61
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,610
you know and made this guy very unhappy
he probably doesn't approve that we're

62
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,650
not talking about that

63
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,840
but I you know we're not playing we're
not

64
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,760
and there is that there should be a
Stuxnet bingo but

65
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,080
if you're interested in Stuxnet

66
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,090
there are two great talks Ian the CCC

67
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:16,440
27 c3 this December chase them down

68
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,030
there very informative it was a relation

69
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:23,180
to me so we're not going to talk about

70
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,470
to talk about sex but we are going to
talk about

71
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,860
SCADA in the wide a and

72
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,100
most that great talks in SCADA
vulnerabilities

73
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,169
which actually released 0 days unlike

74
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:40,210
I'm not going to do today %uh

75
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,690
where researchers taking

76
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,970
open source key setting up

77
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:51,070
some sort of an artificial testbed in
which they could talk to it

78
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,240
in exploiting what we ate

79
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,810
got to do is was completely different
first of all who wanted to see the

80
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,259
really expensive pieces of equipment

81
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,699
that all working at an actual utility

82
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:08,850
second still secondly wanted to go there

83
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:13,220
and she with the control network looked
like on the inside

84
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,180
in what thats the

85
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,440
environment looked operation look like
operationally

86
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,470
and decide it's cruel to take something
from

87
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,620
a ski skate a piece of software from the
wild and bring it to the lab

88
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,940
and they don't breed as well and it's
just

89
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,430
well in cell its

90
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,550
it's better to go to the jungle than
Villiers

91
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,630
possibly maybe

92
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:45,169
we did do something organ we're going to
talk about that

93
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:49,840
the interesting point about fussing with
really expensive and we're talking

94
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,870
a 100 K a to

95
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,850
possibly a million dollars is that you
can constrict

96
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:01,030
sticks no way and the vendors are not
going to give

97
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:04,060
spec I

98
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,750
and the bonuses included a

99
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,889
going through this kind in the man
trapped

100
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:16,350
anal probe the

101
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:20,039
detail Circuit held to talk about how

102
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:25,080
freaky way I anyhow at no no you're
getting to the airport

103
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,610
at no peeing in the cup either
absolutely

104
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,229
cell as you know for many jobs

105
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:36,580
and access to facilities

106
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,100
people to drug test now was not one

107
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,750
I and in the biggest thing was sergei
had to get out

108
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,970
and be ready to go by God 7

109
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,949
a.m. got scheme that people rate their
up at six

110
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:54,000
at work at seven if you want to play
ball with them

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,990
you have to be up at six and in at seven
this is horrible

112
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:02,419
up flooding across the state lines we're
going to talk about that

113
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:06,169
one piece of equipment is installed in
the next town over and possibly in a

114
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:07,270
different state

115
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:11,280
and what do you do into you know work
that

116
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,970
so this is what we what to do thing
still

117
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:19,250
on the trust built with this particular
skill

118
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,710
cell just a little bit of an
introduction

119
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:28,090
since I'd I did not quite understand

120
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:32,340
what control networks looks like so

121
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,470
the way it goes is approximately like
this

122
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:39,400
first will a power companies the company

123
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,599
in so it needs to have a corporate
network moreover power companies in the

124
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:44,180
US

125
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,599
II deregulated they trade electricity

126
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,840
so their sales people sitting there and

127
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,910
well at in there are all sorts

128
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:58,090
interesting things that go on in that
nap which you want to keep

129
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,669
the hell away from lolcats

130
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:07,389
zombies fishing you want to keep that
the hell away from the controlled

131
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:12,919
I secondly there is a control network
proper

132
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:15,990
me which a you don't

133
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:19,530
chain yep which a

134
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:23,819
includes things like energy management
servers

135
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:27,919
up do control boards date historians

136
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,590
where the data is collected all sorts of
State estimators

137
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:35,360
that process the days a at car and

138
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,830
voltage data that comes in from the
field

139
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:42,360
now this looks a pretty close right

140
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,290
but those a substations those sensors

141
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:49,910
can be placed I hundreds of miles away

142
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:55,769
and this line maybe basically a more
than line

143
00:08:55,769 --> 00:09:00,470
so skate looks like this can you she

144
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:06,010
disposed to be a dinosaur us

145
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:10,870
I'm I told you sure you skim sheesh

146
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:14,260
well imagine if you will that there is

147
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:18,760
indeed dinosaur rate under the

148
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,769
okay let's move on let's move on cell

149
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:26,709
very often people talk about substations
in the cornfield

150
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:30,940
and as I googled for such a picture I
actually found this

151
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,810
substation building you can see the
electric

152
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,990
our must hear and its actually look it
in

153
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,269
cornfield Illinois so

154
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:44,640
you bet on inside that

155
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,580
I substation you would find old more
them

156
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:52,089
9600 is actually fast

157
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:55,250
high-speed modem yes yes and

158
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:59,149
their goes over East line back to your

159
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:02,420
nice a cloud a control network

160
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,560
and these are really all modems but

161
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,910
reliable you know the dependable
dependable

162
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,370
this is what you wanted to depend on

163
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:15,690
if you care about keeping the lights on

164
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:21,060
so all these up lines coming into more
than they

165
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,170
the screen is really dark to that

166
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:28,570
you would be able to see the little ones
there's a buncha modems where that works

167
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,829
black

168
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:35,649
on and up all those modems are driven by

169
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:39,940
are can specialized computer which is
basically not so their specialized

170
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,240
it x86 a running Windows

171
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,480
or Linux a nowadays

172
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,190
that machine is called the front and
processor or FBI

173
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,640
anyway thing said want the world to
really get freaked out about when I

174
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,110
first started the utility was modem

175
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,750
they're always thrown his way around we
have all these modem connections

176
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,850
and for my mind from you know growing up
in the eighties in being a hacker back

177
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:04,519
then

178
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:08,800
modem was like woody time and I'm like
what we do all these motors but then

179
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,149
that actually modems are you still

180
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:14,240
what from my telecom back that I would
use that

181
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,430
chud issue these are these are nailed up
for wire circuits

182
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:23,180
there there closer kiss not modem
circuit it's not like

183
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:27,240
all these substations have telephone
line to you can dial to access the front

184
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,000
and

185
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,360
from the other side or or the actual
substation these are all nailed up

186
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,510
pop lives on just plain old telephone
network but

187
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:39,070
imagine my surprise when darkness to my
great regret

188
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:44,200
accretive its modern-day X and here I
come to this utility and nine counter

189
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,760
guy who is running a weirdo

190
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,180
to reach major were dialing up she

191
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,880
okay so I am from here on it gets to
look more

192
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,079
up more and more C&C more in the water a
front-end processor

193
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:03,589
or several of them might talk to a at
will talk to in energy management server

194
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:08,120
this sorting machine agia I would be
your community machine

195
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,570
recommend tubal running states to me
software

196
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,639
and other specialized stay

197
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,459
up the hill the power grid software

198
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:22,110
that tries to solve a whole bunch a
differential equations

199
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,190
that a in turn

200
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:28,540
talks to the up large words

201
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,600
where the actual operators Archaean

202
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,709
controlled the electric grid in

203
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:37,950
you see that these communications are
all switches

204
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:42,160
but in fact they are very likely to be
over routers

205
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,279
in the control room maybe in a
completely different physical location

206
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,579
so the

207
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:54,910
system like that is extremely expensive
to build

208
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,470
for individual units we're talking

209
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:02,670
a 100 K and that's an understatement for
an entire

210
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:07,180
system even for a small one and then you
know before adventure started when

211
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,339
anything said

212
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:12,399
was that when I came in utility business
in

213
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,430
and I got involved in a lot of
compliance work they were all the store

214
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,329
around trust but verify

215
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:21,519
so I came up with a really cool idea
I've got no into dollars worth skated

216
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,389
year

217
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:25,990
I'm gonna do some trust but verify I'm
gonna bring researchers to have them

218
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,320
look at this Kieran tell me

219
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,560
you know it what's going on under the
hood here because

220
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,889
and then people X are you in like world
that's going to be awesome

221
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:40,250
and he he's told me getting into she's

222
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,490
he thinks he's in heaven it was
Christmas for sure sergei

223
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:49,490
so and why the things I really want to
get involved in doing about this was

224
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,110
because

225
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,639
I'm paranoid person and

226
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:57,120
I wanted to and wanted to at

227
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,079
validates in the making controls that
were using on the control network

228
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,440
because weekday a lot of freaky things
that

229
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,839
may seem a little draconian to normal

230
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,089
users about Windows network system on
the control network

231
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:17,350
in fact this was one of the most
paranoid networks

232
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,570
she in although I hear that

233
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:24,000
not all utilities are that way
unfortunately but this is the kind of

234
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,040
the paranoia that

235
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,540
on on your the cap that you get to
really appreciate

236
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,889
but anyhow what really surprise me

237
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:37,240
is that was that utilities may stand

238
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,769
a whole one mitigation

239
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:45,070
0 issues with that equipment is in the
original equipment see can imagine

240
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:48,779
the original sings quest upward in the
million dollars

241
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:52,040
then what are the knee since

242
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,800
costs so

243
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,529
we could not of course ness with the
network that keeps the lights

244
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:05,699
in thats that's not a good idea
recommended it home

245
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:09,910
you probably should never bus in actual
life production network

246
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,070
cell instead on

247
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,579
what happened was a a number of

248
00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:19,579
devices were taken into this

249
00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:24,410
a test environment that connected them
into in isolated

250
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:29,209
network topology isolated from the cut
off from the production network

251
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:32,759
but what we can't right was the
geographic distance

252
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:36,959
so when i'm talking about. fighting
across state lines

253
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,480
I'm not joking the father

254
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,060
was in this is a sample this is not the
actual cities involved

255
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:49,699
in the end experiment sergei wanted to
put a little map up so

256
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:53,110
I'm going to be gone and champagne so
this is kinda like the idea whole idea

257
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:53,720
behind with

258
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,120
we have an insider hmm knows a lot of
shit

259
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,240
and that my psych sergei's job and I'm
like

260
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,820
or what we're gonna do is give sergei an
Ethernet port

261
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,350
inside this network we build for days
that is

262
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:12,380
to represent network exactly like what
you've seen a control system environment

263
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,839
and and we did some funky stuff with the
land and things like that so that he

264
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:16,550
could

265
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:21,370
do his research across a wide area
network

266
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,699
so these are actually a.m. these are
actually

267
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:29,529
up affiliated excuse me affiliated
organizations such as the inner city

268
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:33,560
prevention pay II and there is a Power
Corp in Springfield

269
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,600
but your not the actual suckage sorry

270
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,850
disc I'm cell

271
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:44,139
what you want to do to test the
brittleness so the system

272
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:47,449
ES of course a whole bunch of other
things

273
00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:51,220
but easiest thing to do anything we did

274
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:55,790
was of course fussing self-rising is

275
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:59,050
not in the Jeep explaining but

276
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,589
I thought just

277
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:06,839
yeah illustrate the general principle

278
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:10,370
you craft inputs and and

279
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:13,449
yeah funding SCADA is a

280
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:18,319
just about as hard as toppling intricate
structures like that

281
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:23,130
once you yet to the actual equipment to
the actual network port

282
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:26,789
and moreover people have been doing that

283
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:30,059
but again so for example Ganesh coverage
on

284
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:33,570
game talk that made a quite a bit of a
splash

285
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,820
a.m. in at black cat 7

286
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,590
the media ran with that media rounds
with everything

287
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:46,190
on he wrote cd/mp3 a popular control
protocol

288
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,549
what you for Sally the father a digital
blonde

289
00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:52,919
did a ICC PE test

290
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:56,500
fighting test suite this is what you
would have

291
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,140
utility is communicate between
themselves and Amy said

292
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,400
to that estate owners that is to say ski
operators

293
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,020
on there were some tree releases that
targeted

294
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,320
parsers for the D mp3 political inside
Wireshark

295
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,520
as you can imagine the same protocol
would

296
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,210
need to be parsed by an actual target
device

297
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:23,150
at me security makes a great

298
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:26,340
business selling the hardware appliance
you know

299
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,960
your fight your skated device up

300
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,679
internet goes here and

301
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,230
it talks to it and you pay on the basis

302
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:41,150
protocol modules that you want to test

303
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:45,100
so all those things hell

304
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,340
operate for specific protocols D mp3

305
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,010
on moored bus

306
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,080
61 850 family of protocols

307
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,080
what we needed gurus a would

308
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,860
week at to deal with is proprietary
protocols

309
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:07,200
so we're not going to be told %uh which
protocols were running on that scale

310
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,240
network

311
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,770
and even though I you a sort of a meal

312
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:17,950
existed and I was shown it from the
distance

313
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,580
with with ahead having to hold on to it

314
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,730
I could not see that so we could not
bring

315
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:28,559
the best up possible approach enforcing
that is to say

316
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,590
fuzzing basin the protocol mortal

317
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,650
with more deals as a

318
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,820
the kind spike moreover the thing about
forcing

319
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,880
is funding for exploitation is that

320
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,900
you get instrument the target and
actually have to spend quite a bit to

321
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,799
work

322
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,500
making sure the target restarts enters
the right kinda communication

323
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,299
so that you can feed you crafted input
in it

324
00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:00,380
show who's going to let this instrument

325
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,970
a and equipment piece of equipment that

326
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,980
posts a whole lot and that

327
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,840
can up waste if you can't wait the
warranty or

328
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,340
and who is going to restart it for us in
the next town

329
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,669
over across the state line when it
crashed

330
00:20:18,669 --> 00:20:21,830
and sell apparently we have a problem

331
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:25,620
but effect don't have a problem and I i
can.

332
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,620
do a convincing Kinley Knight this
impression but

333
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,059
SCADA right this is different

334
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:35,549
this is a different world as we found
out so

335
00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:39,390
first novel you can learn what the
protocol

336
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:44,350
data structures look like because their
transmitted continually

337
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:48,860
that say in the substation that's
talking to the energy management server

338
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,070
the energy management server talking to

339
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:55,990
I E control station out with the board

340
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,909
they are sending the same thing over and
over and over again

341
00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:03,260
and that date is very similar moreover

342
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:07,570
if you managed to crash at a watchdog
will automatically restart

343
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:10,880
the control process or reboot the system

344
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,919
if you managed to crash the system so
this is great has taken care of

345
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:19,600
moreover those things I keep I sending
messages

346
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,700
keep alive their status so you can
actually she when he succeeded in

347
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,440
crushing one

348
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,390
because these things stop in there are
TCP reset

349
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:33,220
or syntax or other indications an
attempt to restart

350
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,799
the connection by the which cell

351
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:42,110
it gets better because quite a little
those put quite a few of those particles

352
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:45,909
have this distinct handshake that
establishes the data session

353
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:50,070
and then lets the dataflow in the
connection

354
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:54,370
so you can't wait until that happens

355
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:57,669
if you can get Ian the communication
which

356
00:21:57,669 --> 00:22:01,650
you do by the way I L any given and then
in the middle attack

357
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,750
then you find the day then you're
getting

358
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,760
at the insides the business logic

359
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,830
those things and a it

360
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,010
actually pretty much similar day

361
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:17,789
so if you're doing you tation of Isaac

362
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:22,240
you have pretty good coverage because
the same piece of data will be crossing

363
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,870
the network pretty of

364
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:27,020
in you can you take a different so

365
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:31,730
for mutational I think this really
really helps

366
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:35,220
in so up the standard approach

367
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:39,770
that people take imitation saying is
probably exemplified by GP at the jail

368
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:40,880
purpose farther

369
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,610
the DA leads I'll open

370
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:49,610
what it does is it seems network
protocol sessions

371
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:52,870
save the PDF file nice packet capture

372
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:56,159
in you replay it using heuristics

373
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,230
up for inserting large Iran's

374
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:05,610
ASCII characters or lied runs a
unbalanced the

375
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:08,940
with you all those things parenthesis
people in the matters

376
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:13,710
yes and then EU observe the target and
see if it crashes

377
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:16,740
that wasn't quite what we needed to do
we could know what

378
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,980
actually we did not actually want to
save those sessions infect probably

379
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,390
would not be able to

380
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:26,340
and I'm people to work out there with
a.m.

381
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,340
packet captures my pocket

382
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,450
so what we needed

383
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,539
what we needed to do additionally ways

384
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:39,580
bring back some the spiky miss the
approach the dealer

385
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:43,179
I tell first discovered

386
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:47,900
spike is his is just about the first a
blog days

387
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,279
father you start with the model in the
protocol and

388
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,669
you January block by block she by field
in

389
00:23:54,669 --> 00:24:00,370
you up mutate those heels you find those
fields

390
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:03,820
heuristically based on what is likely to
crash the recipient

391
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:09,250
so you do that to get past the first
indigenisation stage

392
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:13,230
up past the first CDT check have

393
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:17,890
your target to get to the business logic
show what we wanted to do

394
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:23,029
was first flies data in transit

395
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:26,230
with something like GPS but guess blocks

396
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:29,360
of the unknown protocol

397
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,929
just just enough to

398
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:36,250
do better in um the was a little

399
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:39,299
scientific idea or a dirty

400
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:42,350
depending on how you look at it that

401
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:47,150
that occurred to us it was there is
anything

402
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:50,940
that counts repeat it if tokens repeated

403
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,150
substrings and communications any does
so

404
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:57,539
in order to compress files and

405
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:02,440
landfill and Zieve came up with that

406
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,210
quite long time ago the fathers what
impact

407
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:11,390
compression might say show we run a
variant over this algorithm compress

408
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,020
anything

409
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:15,159
but we can link the same string T cell

410
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:18,779
in which she did with up an initial set

411
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:22,779
that captures in to those repeated
strings

412
00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:25,850
we assume their tokens we apply

413
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:31,210
the heuristics show

414
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:35,140
architecturally it looks a pretty simple
here is your

415
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:38,320
I P Q here is your

416
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,669
men in the middle attack up

417
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:47,500
we found that are poisoning generally
worked

418
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:52,059
which was a bit of a surprise of course
in order for us to get there

419
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:55,150
%uh a whole other earlier securities
that

420
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:58,480
include AP sec had to be rolled back

421
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,450
but an interesting observation was lear
to security

422
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:05,970
is too expensive so the things that you
do

423
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:10,220
they would get in the way week quickly
recovering the network

424
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:14,500
under the circumstances would want to

425
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,070
recovery under if the lights are out

426
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:21,240
so but there are other mittens

427
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:26,580
of course once we have the packets
flowing through us

428
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:30,350
and of course one of those mittens a was
against the Gateway

429
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:36,500
so that we could see that I get the next
town or their into I pick you

430
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,299
through I pick you they were given to
index user land

431
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:43,909
per packet tokenizer that I just
described

432
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:47,299
through that they were fed to a modified
GPF

433
00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:51,940
so that it could deal with packets on
the packet level rather than with

434
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:55,240
sessions and

435
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,659
so it worked cell as a

436
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:02,370
here all the technical issues in

437
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:05,480
what was really needed was

438
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,220
looking for signs the target crashing

439
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:13,299
in backing off so that the connection

440
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:16,779
good become three-step list by the
Eversole which will

441
00:27:16,779 --> 00:27:21,100
watchdogs and by the ever so helpful
would use that we started those

442
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,880
connections

443
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:26,100
on the servers and front

444
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,549
so weekend a whole bunch rules

445
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:33,409
the simplest in wall looking for recess

446
00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:36,840
obviously you press the process so your
further TCP

447
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,130
traffic to that port is going to be
rejected

448
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:43,860
repeated since special of handshakes

449
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:47,039
and those regex were not allowed to
release

450
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,140
obviously because the

451
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:55,760
vendor insisted on the product will be
coming as close as possible

452
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,820
anti-mouse so with it

453
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:05,200
you can actually get pretty good
coverage almost standard protocols

454
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,770
because if you assure you crashed target

455
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:12,960
you just move the window of Ising you
proceed

456
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,610
so you now it's not the a smarter

457
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:20,049
ways that people fires for the abilities

458
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:24,480
but it gets pretty good coverage a what
problem is that you must find the chip

459
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,049
sums

460
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:28,230
and we compute them in you can do that
with

461
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:31,870
a bunch of other chicks so in the end
the

462
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:35,100
more developed version of the father
that we're working on now

463
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:39,370
and have almost done includes things
like fixing

464
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:44,799
TCP sequences when you

465
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:49,750
in Surin gypped extra TCP packets to
accommodate the longer fight

466
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,820
payloads then their custom rules

467
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:56,120
that identify replies

468
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:00,159
and identify the authentication sessions

469
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,929
and then there is that organized

470
00:29:04,929 --> 00:29:07,990
okay so how does that do

471
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:12,000
it's a bunch a heuristic well we could
obviously not instrument

472
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,909
SCADA a gear but weak stream into the
couple of things

473
00:29:16,909 --> 00:29:21,929
a streaming protocol and I am protocol
thinking that they might be roughly

474
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:25,070
about the same things so idea

475
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:28,679
used by iTunes and whisker used by

476
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:31,870
game in instant messaging

477
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:36,840
she this is what you get this is the
cover recalled coverage

478
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,350
which you could instrument of course %uh
this is what you get with random

479
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:44,049
remediation this is what you get with

480
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:49,559
GPF a unchanged

481
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:52,770
out the books this is what

482
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:56,919
yet with a

483
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:00,529
our lease

484
00:30:00,529 --> 00:30:04,409
no way this is what you get

485
00:30:04,409 --> 00:30:07,490
and clearly a so

486
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:11,539
and this is a this is although the

487
00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:14,549
cold running in on

488
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:18,380
stage with gay we were under for the day

489
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,470
but probably actually in North
underfunding

490
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:26,179
the problem was that as we we started

491
00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:30,039
the the sessions we could not exactly
replicate

492
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:33,520
session but basically it you know we did

493
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,440
better than the GPF which was and much
better than random

494
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,500
which was good so million dated

495
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:46,299
our methodology which was the only
phrase

496
00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:49,549
I was allowed to say about the whole
engagement

497
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:53,450
for and then ships are you really touch
I just a little bit in have

498
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:56,919
when he was going through the actual
buzzing part of this but

499
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:00,230
one and the other thing said sir he
really had to struggle through was

500
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:04,059
the way and and the measurements that we
were taking when

501
00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:07,500
we were determining how long it would
take them to be successful

502
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,820
with all the mitigating controls turned
on which

503
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:14,460
sergei was not able to successfully

504
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:18,090
as a network within the game controls
turned on well

505
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:22,019
I did not have the IT sector he and I
was not allowed to exploit

506
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:25,919
in you think that was connected to the
network so while you're here

507
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,769
fewer stumbling blocks hits in handcuffs
on but

508
00:31:29,769 --> 00:31:33,580
why the things you really want to do was
was checkin show that the mitigating

509
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,610
controls that we used for vet

510
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:39,720
bad things from happening on the network
because why the things we're very

511
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,029
concerned about is the insider threat

512
00:31:42,029 --> 00:31:46,669
and the US these in the world and people
bring in stuff and plugging it into

513
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:47,779
Ethernet ports said

514
00:31:47,779 --> 00:31:51,899
we may not be able to control any
someone's desk inside a closed

515
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:55,130
and it was nice to have the paranoia
justified

516
00:31:55,130 --> 00:32:00,010
because when we do turn back to make any
controls and and left open

517
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:03,179
the door a little bit for someone like
sergei to come in

518
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:08,029
and dad and FIS there is a lot of people

519
00:32:08,029 --> 00:32:11,380
concerned about their careers if we ever
at did

520
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,860
do I'll a full disclosure what we found

521
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:18,120
well so as is as you'll realize

522
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,240
rate this is not about forcing per se

523
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,309
this is about being able to inject into
the network

524
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:27,840
rate and of course fuzzing

525
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,080
is on the st. Indian for real
exploitation

526
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,380
that is enabled by injection so

527
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:39,090
mitigating controls isolation has

528
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:43,289
all the reasons to be paranoid and then
it was really good for us because sergei

529
00:32:43,289 --> 00:32:45,360
got a chance to validate his side

530
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:50,399
the same time from a corporate
perspective we got a chance to

531
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:55,210
better communique an understanding of
why certain mitigating controls existed

532
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,409
on this network

533
00:32:56,409 --> 00:33:00,820
because they're very cumbersome to about
people who don't understand

534
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:05,559
why this is so important cell

535
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:10,080
it was a it was very successful and on I
both the business side effects and the

536
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,909
scientific side effects and in

537
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:16,149
it's been a few it's been a while since
this happened and why the things that as

538
00:33:16,149 --> 00:33:18,190
isn't this has been in the past in

539
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:23,120
we did the research in and nothing ever
came out from it

540
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,519
it's it's really successful or even how
and

541
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:30,179
academia and and industry can work
together

542
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:33,500
and an academic can get his papers
published

543
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:37,710
and not necessarily interfere with

544
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:41,070
the reputation of any businesses that
may or may not have been involved in

545
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:41,980
this

546
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,130
search which 0 and 50 states

547
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:48,399
we tried to walk a fine line

548
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,799
and and hopefully will be coming back

549
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:57,669
what really good question is what is the
rule the full disclosure

550
00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:02,220
in this SCADA ideally

551
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:05,480
changes is an application changes

552
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,730
the game for full disclosure quite a bit
the idea being that

553
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:12,960
whale you did not find ski the devices

554
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,720
in the hands of the general public it's
not your iPhone if you

555
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,030
published SCADA advisory it's kind of
hard to make the argument

556
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:25,240
that skied exploit it's kind of hard to
make the argument that

557
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:29,129
you are somehow exposing the

558
00:34:29,129 --> 00:34:34,770
naive a and the

559
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:38,050
guiltless up common user who a

560
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:41,119
cannot be expected to take

561
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:46,790
protective steps to a paranoid level
York skater should be run by people who

562
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:48,929
are professionally paranoid

563
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:52,040
your vendors on the other hand

564
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:57,030
would not appreciated at all I

565
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:00,030
in even they'll big power companies by

566
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:03,150
a look at your from them and so is the
customers they have

567
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:06,859
a considerable pool

568
00:35:06,859 --> 00:35:10,270
its really know what as easy

569
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:17,270
to yet the under to release a patch a
media war story

570
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:22,720
it's not that the the whole idea behind
patching in the state assistance

571
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,220
is is multiple first you have to get the
vendor to develop the passion they have

572
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,890
to go to a long queue a process before
the patch is really going in

573
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:34,130
the vendor really needs to make a
decision about whether or not they're

574
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,369
gonna let the patch

575
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:39,040
be released and even after that point as
utility

576
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,089
or your keeper critical infrastructure
you decide when

577
00:35:43,089 --> 00:35:47,500
it's gonna be a good time to install the
patch in NY the things you always waving

578
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:47,780
it

579
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:51,030
decide about what are you gonna patches
is out

580
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:54,260
what other mitigating or compensating
controls you have

581
00:35:54,260 --> 00:36:00,220
to to possibly delay the ins insulation
the patch

582
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:04,000
so there's a lot of there's like a
complex things but when you have a

583
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,170
system that always needs to stay on

584
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:10,359
how do you pack something like that it's
not like every Tuesday we can turn off

585
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:11,300
electric grid

586
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,820
for for two hours we can rebuild our
systems

587
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:18,210
so I was happy to give the ammunition
that

588
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:21,990
a needed to talk to a particular vendor

589
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:25,380
has been recovered different on those
things now the vendor

590
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:29,119
at now I was not allowed to take back

591
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,040
the crash dumps but then there was
filmed

592
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,619
and add a informed

593
00:36:36,619 --> 00:36:40,550
have this saying that what's at stake
suspected to be

594
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:45,300
at quite brittle I remaining brittle
after a number of patches

595
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:50,359
at the next day a then the
representative came in from thousands of

596
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:51,329
miles away

597
00:36:51,329 --> 00:36:54,730
and and they had to be in by 7 a.m. to I

598
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:58,540
yeah and with I

599
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:02,740
hand they were basically doing that then
they respond once

600
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:06,040
have calming things dial you know

601
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,820
trying to talk this the down and

602
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:14,200
I was I enjoying the

603
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:20,650
the proceedings famous say said

604
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:24,579
haley's chic I didn't get it here

605
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:27,790
which impeded I tonight they would my

606
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:31,230
be able to say I would be if they had
lesser kiki vidis

607
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:34,290
yep remember the man trapped they took a
cheese home with them that

608
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:38,400
depth in israel I yet though it was

609
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,589
weird weird experience coming through
that thing to get another

610
00:37:42,589 --> 00:37:47,140
that K chill let's look into the future

611
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,540
the future is going to be this wonderful
I'll

612
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,560
much a more

613
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:58,010
reliable edge I'll smarter grid

614
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:02,700
maybe or maybe it's going to be this
long struggle

615
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,329
through a political divisions

616
00:38:06,329 --> 00:38:10,869
I love the bright future I'll and but
the way is

617
00:38:10,869 --> 00:38:14,099
all strewing with the rakes and

618
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:18,960
well surprised

619
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,550
or maybe maybe as we get

620
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:27,359
progressively and more darkened paranoid

621
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:32,160
in our outlook at maybe some really bad
things would happen

622
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,740
rate the way we normally do engineering

623
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:40,460
is by putting things together composing
things

624
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:43,460
but some compositions are deadly in fact

625
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:48,810
the greatest wisdom about security from
the academic point-of-view

626
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:52,740
is security is not composable if you
forget anything that

627
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:57,200
came ever came out the academic science
I remember this

628
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,900
on complexity kills as an hour

629
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,890
likes saying and I really like that
circle to

630
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:08,320
so and of course there are wrong threat
models

631
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,220
you know what is going to get you

632
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:16,010
this say is supposed to be real

633
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:19,320
rate here's your corral yours here you
forces

634
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,280
and this thing comes out the blue
apparently such things were real

635
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,160
in South America and therefore souls to
prove that

636
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:35,160
so what separates and where rodrico

637
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,420
the word you talked yesterday

638
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,720
jus Alito yet

639
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,089
any now with all the hype

640
00:39:45,089 --> 00:39:48,270
about the smart grid and every better
every did

641
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:52,010
media every to be a journalist rating up
a storm

642
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:56,380
about how it is going to improve life
and solve all of our energy dependence

643
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:56,980
problems

644
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:02,130
and somehow improve the client a hundred
years into the future

645
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:06,460
you have other when you know you talk to
a power guy

646
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:10,690
when he says it smarter grid thank you
very much

647
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:15,000
the green is already pretty smart it has
a whole buncha sensors

648
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,410
it has a whole bunch of other software
and hardware pieces

649
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:23,180
that take advantage of those sensors but

650
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,710
I is going to get larger as meters

651
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:30,930
in phasers are going to be rolled out
through the actual power grid

652
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:34,380
infected biggest mining would be in a
smart meters

653
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:38,310
it might be in all sorts census I'll

654
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:43,510
figures being discussed are tens of
millions of hundreds of millions

655
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:46,880
but it's clearly going to be a lot

656
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,300
a whole bunch of vendors are very keen
on a

657
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,460
replacing the car and controlling
element so this might read like

658
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:57,760
relays with what they call intelligence
electronic devices

659
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,790
all roll together in various

660
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:06,460
compositional waz and

661
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:10,290
so you held this problem

662
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:13,560
how do you secure hundred-million
devices

663
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:19,079
is really I to be going naughty question

664
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:22,630
the first issue that looms once you step

665
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:25,920
out to an academic setting a and

666
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,970
talk to people who run networks in the
world

667
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:32,599
is how do we know administrate

668
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:36,079
in with their you can actually afford to
remotely ministry

669
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,420
all those things then

670
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:44,329
the network environment is almost
certainly going to be the Internet

671
00:41:44,329 --> 00:41:48,430
ard Windows now make toilets tweet

672
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:51,579
and you can not find e-class

673
00:41:51,579 --> 00:41:55,280
the household appliance that has not
been connected by 01

674
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,680
where another to the Internet by we have
a radio

675
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,010
but do you trust that the environment to
cure your pack

676
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:08,180
how do you trust the identities in that
and liked

677
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:11,440
in will the solutions like a

678
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,849
authenticating solutions scale-up to
that scale

679
00:42:16,849 --> 00:42:20,260
trust is the primary issue in

680
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:23,609
the grand plans up smart grid
deployments

681
00:42:23,609 --> 00:42:28,339
how do you extend trust to hundreds of
millions of devices or

682
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:33,700
you know in a particular deployment even
its if it's a million for the utility

683
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,740
if you can trust them would other

684
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:39,960
how do you keep all them trustworthy

685
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:44,300
we talked to an operator over a large
electric utility

686
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,890
in they realize that the they could not

687
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:53,010
p for the bill from a big ISP

688
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:57,310
because the ISP reasonably quite
recently as it turned out

689
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:00,800
wanted peak rates huge fan

690
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,930
and only see and fees for

691
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:07,940
keeping the latency low enough to make
this a reasonable

692
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:11,410
SCADA control environment cell

693
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:14,859
they've realized that they would have to
build their own network they could not

694
00:43:14,859 --> 00:43:16,000
afford

695
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,190
the structure those he's when every
scale

696
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:26,720
any kind a solution that you find in a
more modern world like where I worked at

697
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,849
we had smart meter solution

698
00:43:30,849 --> 00:43:35,329
basically where that the mere had a cell
phone tied to it any with phony in

699
00:43:35,329 --> 00:43:39,520
usage data so we have a million meters
out here to do this

700
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,140
when there's an outage what happens when
a million cell phones make a phone call

701
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:48,500
at the same time you have a massive
denial-of-service attack on the phone

702
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,510
networks L

703
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:53,680
your carrier get all mad at you because
this happened so you really don't get

704
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,099
a lot of the day in a timely matter when
you need a when you have all these

705
00:43:57,099 --> 00:43:59,200
devices it presents a lot of

706
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,730
interesting problems about you almost
have too much day

707
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:08,000
at to get in a timely matter how how do
we extend trust get data where we needed

708
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,359
from

709
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:12,790
in a timely manner so that we can make
decisions moreover

710
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:17,609
ISP's tend to believe that if you buy
more bandwidth

711
00:44:17,609 --> 00:44:21,140
from them it will also improve your lap
see

712
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:24,339
not your lips she doesn't matter that
much if you're doing

713
00:44:24,339 --> 00:44:28,579
what their customers mostly do which is
download

714
00:44:28,579 --> 00:44:31,819
I'll which the the deal play games

715
00:44:31,819 --> 00:44:35,200
games are actually tricky cell

716
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,740
my wife who is a a maintainer

717
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:42,140
crowd that and every game player

718
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:46,050
way and keys might latency

719
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:49,510
a sensor the moment

720
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:53,000
something is interested something
interesting is happening on the network

721
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,020
despite the building with being just
great

722
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:59,630
she detects it when she's playing cell

723
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:02,650
on

724
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:06,410
ISP's may not be able to continue
assaulting

725
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:09,690
latency problems lateness requirements

726
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:13,020
SCADA by just doing what they usually do

727
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:16,660
through more been with at

728
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:19,720
of course I love referring to this

729
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:24,430
then year address at source Boston

730
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,630
in this can like talks were just talking
about before you know

731
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:31,530
we've got a one basically right now one
way network out to our

732
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:34,609
to the home media you know what happens

733
00:45:34,609 --> 00:45:38,359
in in what do you really buying if you
can get remote administration we can

734
00:45:38,359 --> 00:45:40,569
push date out to the meter

735
00:45:40,569 --> 00:45:44,869
when you when you get eighty percent
information you are in need from a

736
00:45:44,869 --> 00:45:45,980
one-way communication

737
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:49,300
out from the home so

738
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:52,630
when you start getting to a situation
where

739
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:55,940
the the meters are remotely accessible
then you've got

740
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:59,849
interesting ideas about people who can
actually update firmware on this device

741
00:45:59,849 --> 00:46:01,530
is because able to accept

742
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:05,050
data coming in and it's an evolutionary
argument

743
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:08,970
organisms either adapt to change
environment

744
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:12,530
that is to say their firmware get
upgraded

745
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:15,560
where they died and then there's a more
practical problem

746
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:20,380
about you know

747
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:23,869
how do you a commission them how do you
put them in place

748
00:46:23,869 --> 00:46:29,770
how to maintain trust to mean how do you
trust 200 million devices

749
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:32,980
a well one way is of course cryptography

750
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:36,589
it is said that you know we're pretty
good at

751
00:46:36,589 --> 00:46:39,740
using key based cryptography to
authenticate things

752
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:43,619
except maybe not a hundred million
things at a time

753
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:47,680
so authenticating things requires
sharing a secret

754
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:51,069
or a key at least with

755
00:46:51,069 --> 00:46:54,319
a every device in the environment

756
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:58,560
in just exactly how do you do that if
this is a human the

757
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,750
if is the human bound operation

758
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:05,079
the end it course a whole lot of money
if it is

759
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:09,490
a remote automated operation you have a
huge excess

760
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:14,400
so a really interested

761
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,460
observation that came to us from another

762
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:22,260
utility operator has been that they fail

763
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:27,349
they when the way a picky I for
authenticating their device

764
00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:31,230
they file that a certain scale the keys

765
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:35,220
the ephemeral bit strings that go on
those devices

766
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:39,480
course the more then the physical
devices themselves

767
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:43,260
with all the electronics and all the
kitten kaboodle so

768
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:49,300
I and that was know what E very
successful picky I deployment for them

769
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:53,579
managing this shitload of keys

770
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:57,000
means be able to replace them

771
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,630
when people lose them be able to revoke
that

772
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:03,680
being able to support the owners who can
yep

773
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,750
to do what they want to do so

774
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:09,970
this is huge problem and I was it

775
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:14,000
that it is not entirely sold one reason

776
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,280
why securing that those kinds of network
is hard

777
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,700
is that you want to protect the link
clear communication

778
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:24,119
infect the 61.8% 50 popular ski the
protocols

779
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:27,880
are originally designed for layer 2
broadcast medium

780
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:32,579
multicast me now

781
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:36,150
in order to secure layer 2 you need to
get

782
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:39,680
she's 12 devices

783
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,990
you need to engage them in cryptographic
protocols

784
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:46,260
implementing cryptographic protocols in
layer 2

785
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:49,849
without sockets is

786
00:48:49,849 --> 00:48:53,150
a know what a pleasant

787
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:56,250
thing to do. so programming with

788
00:48:56,250 --> 00:49:00,420
trains sucks programming with sockets

789
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:03,550
is just about how the internet happened
how

790
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:07,020
most protocols are implemented

791
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:10,970
how developers are trained you need a
whole bunch of developers so there is a

792
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:11,460
script

793
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:16,109
chicken-and-egg problem if or if you
need layer 3

794
00:49:16,109 --> 00:49:21,190
to distribute cheese and are other
things occasion protocol

795
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:25,520
you know you should you have to do it
before you've secured later to

796
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:30,619
right so what gives you that layer 3
layer 2 has already has to be under it

797
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:33,740
cell is a a chicken

798
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:36,800
an ad

799
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,780
and finally you want to upkeep

800
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:44,980
you know here's your there's there was
you see in confidentiality

801
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:48,069
how about integrity in the famous

802
00:49:48,069 --> 00:49:51,970
CI triple how much

803
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:56,290
is it in terms of energy forced

804
00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:59,690
to maintain a hundred million

805
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:04,930
computers doing what ever computation
they need to do

806
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:08,410
in order to a chip their own integrity

807
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:11,680
I mean your power meters are running

808
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:16,500
that CPU quest is not free

809
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:20,880
pushing patches to those you need some
relief at

810
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,900
bikes and finally if you want to go
there a

811
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:29,670
the way up to PM's here's the March 50
p.m. stressed Computing Group

812
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:33,849
right that he is probably

813
00:50:33,849 --> 00:50:38,109
so far the best that the hardware
industry can offer

814
00:50:38,109 --> 00:50:41,609
in community devices but

815
00:50:41,609 --> 00:50:45,349
how do you maintain a whitelist trust
configurations

816
00:50:45,349 --> 00:50:48,960
how quickly does that blow up

817
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,300
its a really good question if we

818
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:55,579
have the engineering ways

819
00:50:55,579 --> 00:50:59,280
to address those problems yet if we
still understand

820
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,180
or maybe we'll have to discover them
let's hope we will not have to discover

821
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:03,839
them

822
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:06,859
in the traditional way stepping on then

823
00:51:06,859 --> 00:51:10,800
going yep

824
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,940
it hit us again

825
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:18,619
so thank you for your attention and why
we still

826
00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:21,710
less than three minutes

827
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:25,309
critic

828
00:51:25,309 --> 00:51:29,069
story for the non-disclosure and known
vendor blame

829
00:51:29,069 --> 00:51:36,069
but I want to come back there became
certain attached to that

830
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:43,220
thank you very much questions

831
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:48,349
so sick miss you trip any switches
internal things you shouldn't

832
00:51:48,349 --> 00:51:52,750
arm sell part the

833
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:56,210
a okay and chic

834
00:51:56,210 --> 00:52:02,040
he

835
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:06,640
you can see chief there you go yeah I

836
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,020
part is a reason I mean and we spend

837
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:14,270
once we got our met and once we

838
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:18,510
had reasonable degree of control

839
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:21,740
over the GG we stand a

840
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:25,559
this was the only loud thing that we did
we spend the next

841
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:29,950
our listening and trying to understand
who was talking to

842
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:33,260
and what protocols were in use

843
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:38,609
and what that what that meant what other
front ends might have been there with

844
00:52:38,609 --> 00:52:40,079
other

845
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:43,510
energy server energy management servers
where their

846
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:48,040
its a it was an isolated environment but
it was a big buyer

847
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:51,270
united we in we said it's all about
defense in depth and how deep the hole

848
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:52,730
goes

849
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:56,369
when you're there and you're in between
your you make it to the middle

850
00:52:56,369 --> 00:53:00,579
these are not very mature mature Lee
coded

851
00:53:00,579 --> 00:53:04,200
system so you can imagine what you could
do

852
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,530
if if you're so inclined but

853
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:10,819
it was a fun exercise a you know

854
00:53:10,819 --> 00:53:15,069
basically we had the phone line with

855
00:53:15,069 --> 00:53:18,720
with the phone line or did we have did
they have a remote

856
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:22,160
access to that machine as well you
remember when we the

857
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:26,450
when when I would trade I'll switch
different phasing out

858
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:29,690
and that person would say up you now

859
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:32,740
yet another day another crash we had
character

860
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:36,020
console access a here comes the blue
screen

861
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:40,859
to the a machines yep cell

862
00:53:40,859 --> 00:53:44,490
you know it was an interesting
experience and of course you only want

863
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:45,740
to crash the things that

864
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:49,550
people want you to crash if it's the
trip

865
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:52,900
next over if it's a drive to the next
town for them

866
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:56,859
to reset that that thing and as a more
interesting things

867
00:53:56,859 --> 00:54:00,300
don't really resulting crashes in the
first place because if your control

868
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:05,200
system crashes it's going to be
noticeable

869
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,589
so but it and the lights don't go out
when the control system

870
00:54:09,589 --> 00:54:14,460
crash the lights stay on the the power
grid is more resilient than

871
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:19,010
then that than that yeah this is
actually one of the major

872
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:23,609
media miscommunications that they need
to be called in their bullshit

873
00:54:23,609 --> 00:54:27,480
the power greed was built before
computers

874
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:31,930
strictly speaking ended his ways %uh
electromechanical ways

875
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:35,349
of protecting itself and a

876
00:54:35,349 --> 00:54:38,440
over running itself if the more

877
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:41,930
controlled if more control involved in
trading

878
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:45,230
or I'll their final load distribution
you could

879
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:48,890
you can close breakers you can shut
things down from the system's

880
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:52,869
but the systems are not necessarily
required for the for the grid to operate

881
00:54:52,869 --> 00:54:53,690
it can be done

882
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:57,420
without the system's it would be a
really bad thing

883
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:01,290
if they'd if they had but it'd be like
Mark make flying back to the future he

884
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:02,960
be going back to the fifties

885
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,359
without a call delorean

886
00:55:06,359 --> 00:55:09,720
him just what you said I mean

887
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:16,720
issue go ahead scale the system itself
to the scalp

888
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:21,500
things like that lying SCADA systems

889
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:25,059
all the time aren't you the yes

890
00:55:25,059 --> 00:55:29,349
and its a good comparisons from the
flying by wire

891
00:55:29,349 --> 00:55:32,730
a modern aircraft a at some point

892
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:36,490
reach the new people mince aircraft
military and and so the more challenging

893
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:39,109
things along those lines are thinking
about

894
00:55:39,109 --> 00:55:42,369
a all this stuff is coming onto the
grade that

895
00:55:42,369 --> 00:55:45,630
they can produce electricity but not
very large amounts people think about

896
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:47,089
one megawatt

897
00:55:47,089 --> 00:55:50,839
as being a lot of electricity but it
really isn't on a grand scale

898
00:55:50,839 --> 00:55:55,430
have a great as big as maybe eastern
interconnect in the United States

899
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:59,619
but if you've got thousands or hundreds
of thousands of different little small

900
00:55:59,619 --> 00:56:02,980
solar arrays are wind farms you don't
know where this electricity is going to

901
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:03,799
come from

902
00:56:03,799 --> 00:56:08,640
you need a lot more information in a
short amount of time because the systems

903
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,040
need to solve the

904
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:14,109
the stated the system to do this every
six seconds

905
00:56:14,109 --> 00:56:18,720
anymore in EC get more more data in the
nation more sophisticated data it's also

906
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,799
involved

907
00:56:19,799 --> 00:56:22,869
and then at least in the United States
is also

908
00:56:22,869 --> 00:56:25,970
regulatory requirements said if you

909
00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:30,750
if you make real-time decisions based on
information it receives from the field

910
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:34,329
then there could be certain regulations
that apply in the system's

911
00:56:34,329 --> 00:56:38,700
which are very costly so there's a lot
of

912
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:41,890
you know compliance and business issues
with

913
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:46,540
the emergence of all this brow double
data that's coming in from the field

914
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:50,410
the you know just like I said

915
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:54,369
if your plane thats fly by wire that
cannot be flown by

916
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:58,030
human because it's

917
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:01,980
air dynamic instability that makes it so
agile in the first place

918
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:05,530
if the wire goes the plains

919
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:08,710
so all you now God for dead we get

920
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:12,200
cars that are drive by wire right

921
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:15,930
I my my truck has 7 computers in it

922
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:19,460
and I'm not enjoying that thought

923
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:23,260
not at all a house

924
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:26,260
last question from

925
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:29,309
as you know exactly what

926
00:57:29,309 --> 00:57:34,510
causing the crash

927
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:38,369
yes out to follow up information or
accessed

928
00:57:38,369 --> 00:57:41,970
to determine the problems picture

929
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:45,920
but the actual problems systems

930
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,670
yes yes but you can't just talk about

931
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:53,770
vendors vendors have been then there has
been given full report

932
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:57,559
with specific packet captures

933
00:57:57,559 --> 00:58:00,579
that their systems booked

934
00:58:00,579 --> 00:58:07,480
means anybody inside

935
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:11,280
people who wrote Stuxnet I mean look a

936
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,540
compared to the complexity of Stuxnet a
little father is

937
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:19,099
in OWL it's not its

938
00:58:19,099 --> 00:58:24,430
deciding the kindergarten rate so yacht
people wrote Stuxnet had access to the

939
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:25,069
manual

940
00:58:25,069 --> 00:58:29,119
that we didn't have and we did this
experiment chick

941
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:34,069
they exist yeah they kept the access to
the den centrifuges most likely

942
00:58:34,069 --> 00:58:37,480
okay so some was born about stock its
yet no

943
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:41,530
knows I sales tax and we're mostly we
said no staff

944
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:45,069
without we're not here to confirm for
tonight anything about stuff

945
