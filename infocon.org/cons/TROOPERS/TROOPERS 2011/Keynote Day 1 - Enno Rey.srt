57
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,780
but it wouldn't have been possible
without number of people who have

58
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,970
heart and contributed to get this going

are young W some will have the
opportunity to get

66
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,880
an idea what we do in the next days arm

67
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,360
b-sides a I mean we have a what we think
we have a mission

68
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,820
this mission obviously a salute to have
our customers perform the business

69
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,060
and again obviously I'll

70
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,110
say we have to employ all employees and
feed them

71
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,490
but that's at we try to

72
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,520
arm be sites the paid walk follow our
customers

73
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,330
we try to contribute to the public
security knowledge in debates and

74
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,870
number waz and troopers is one of those
ways

75
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,729
Antti are even if this might sound a bit

76
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:06,780
say emotional we try to make the world a
better place

77
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,560
this cysts are the understanding of the
NWS walk

78
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,260
not just perform I'll day-to-day job

79
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,590
but to contribute to public security
debate and knowledge

80
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:22,289
and there was one same mindset

81
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:25,960
which is particularly important for
along the sending a long walk

82
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,910
that can be broken down to say the
slogan from

83
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,419
theory to add we hella T which goes back
to the and sometimes

84
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:37,990
when in the end of the nineties so
what's a famous some

85
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,479
US a couple close lofton they had the

86
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:46,410
their slogan was a making a theoretical
practical

87
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,710
and this is what what we try to do as
well I DR NW

88
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,740
not just discuss things under
theoretical side

89
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,650
but shell are things can be done both
are

90
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:01,190
and the protective side of things and on
the attack side of things are

91
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:06,010
it's not just see or hear bring it to
reality and

92
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:10,490
thereby contribute again to a better
understanding of how security walks and

93
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,010
all things

94
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:15,099
some can happen and this will keep this
in mind please

95
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:20,599
this will play a role for his opening
remarks talking about young w's walk i'd

96
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:21,280
like a

97
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,510
to highlight to the fact that we and
what a number of

98
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,409
we such projects a farce of them as cold
as more young

99
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:32,150
which the contributes so we such

100
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:36,919
India's space of telecommunication
networks there's another one

101
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:40,680
to get a whiff to entities from
Dartmouth College

102
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,099
called trusts every dance let me try to
understand

103
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:49,640
Howell on dusty organizational reality

104
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,020
house atrocities Press saw how does some

105
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,620
how do a I souls for example taken
decisions

106
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,210
what's a motive what's incentive some
YSL seemingly a gap

107
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:07,140
between different laws some why don't
they behave in a way like say

108
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:11,060
Accademia would expect this is what we
doing this project some

109
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,219
I'd like to ask some of you to
contribute to this one

110
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:18,770
on details a piece I get back to me if
you interests at

111
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:22,400
knowing what happens in the space in
contribute

112
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,880
this for two we such projects we on one
of them

113
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,849
does not activity obviously we try to

114
00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:36,650
contribute to the greater good to the
greater public data sets will pass

115
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:42,229
this conference and we understand troop
us as our contribution

116
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:48,490
to death exact some space of Public
Security knowledge Public Security

117
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,539
debates on to our to do Sol

118
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:55,539
to be at say any event which contributes

119
00:07:55,539 --> 00:08:00,620
to to security was in general we try to
bring

120
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,409
together different kinds of different
groups

121
00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:08,120
which not necessarily speak to each
other a very often

122
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,450
that s people from industry people from
academia

123
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,729
and people from the what we call the a
community

124
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:19,449
we such as: which offers which are not
necessarily bound 22

125
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:22,620
say academic institutions but will
perform

126
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,940
things on their own will try to figure
out some

127
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,160
things walk cultural how to break things
dealers espero at

128
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,469
understand how things happen and

129
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:40,469
thereby progress on the personal level
decide if we group contributing dog to

130
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,250
troop us that as people from industry
people

131
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,520
from academia and I'll

132
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,630
as I said we saw just we want them to
interact

133
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:55,800
the main spirit of true persists bring
these people again a half them interact

134
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,270
have to communicate

135

a half damn educated necks are
generational thing for a sec

136
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,440
professionals

137
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,140

00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,100
of it's getting bigger this year we have
about

156
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,940
150 people and rolled and

157
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,449
just saw that tom including the speaker
us

158
00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:23,890
which just saw point %uh vietnam boss

159
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:27,860
that's not a point of view that is based
on perception

160
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,060
I after impression it's big arm its

161
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:36,350
I i have pizza giving the keynote last
year eg I gave in to the year before

162
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:40,190
at the time I haven't been signing in
front of so many people

163
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:43,620
as today so it is a bit like the

164
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,810
every year everything come its it's like
Christmas

165
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:51,220
sign you might recall a yet Christmas
it's all this year to talk is better

166
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,650
than it has ever be

167
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:56,120
on a Christmas we as a begun and the oil
law

168
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,750
more stuff on it than it has ever been
and I fear we mine that's of Christmas

169
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,810
to something we today asylum I mean I'm

170
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:07,589
I'm on the E 45 kind of I'm introducing
true plus

171
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:13,120
and it's going to start in this is like
a Halkett fields on the eve of Christmas

172
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,770
are like a looking up to great things to
happen

173
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,860
%ah yes I mean um are

174
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:26,400
obviously if a hopefully if true but as
the president himself but

175
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,480
that there might be a might be a about
various

176
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,449
mean so far getting your own presence on

177
00:11:33,449 --> 00:11:37,920
feel mind after the sniper 2 which you
but you can collect from the kind of

178
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,020
Christmas tree

179
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,740
maybe we'll bring Christmas tree to
tomorrow and and you can take it down

180
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,319
if you win the contest army

181
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:50,689
again two passes abroad bringing people
to get on to give you some numbers

182
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:53,990
it's about 60 percent of people from
industry

183
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:57,380
we have 15 percent from academia yes

184
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,490
%ah 10 percent roughly a

185
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:04,140
from say that with such community and be
a fifty-percent

186
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,930
you dance this is what them hold a tour
bus

187
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:13,569
assembled is here and they are from
various parts of the world

188
00:12:13,569 --> 00:12:17,589
so hopefully this will stimulator
discussion this will simulate

189
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:22,380
exchange whatever why trooper saw is so
important

190
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:27,209
from our perspective d interests eg
world is changing

191
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:32,300
there was constantly terrorists had the
architectural changes

192
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,260
I mean interesting world is changing all
the time and this is one of two

193
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,030
challengers and this is why I
particularly like

194
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:43,699
my discipline why I'm really glad to be
enlisted in for a sec farm

195
00:12:43,699 --> 00:12:47,549
fun and yes now us it never gets boring

196
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:50,819
it's always some best new challenge us
you attacks

197
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:54,160
and you protection mechanisms some

198
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,689
and all this but a at the very moment

199
00:12:58,689 --> 00:13:02,439
there was heavy I V architectural change

200
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:06,600
which might again having to change the
way Hall

201
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:12,319
we perform in for a sec and how it from
our perspective should be performed

202
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:16,270
at the same time are for most of the law

203
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:19,990
say the area of responsibility it gross

204
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,449
doesn't losses since you're responsible
for this different types of

205
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:27,299
system feel responsible for this yr hi a
variety of systems

206
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:31,030
a higher degree of heterogeneity Solon

207
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:34,209
again it's it won't get barring and

208
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:38,010
it won't get boring as a number of the
on NHL for Tex

209
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:42,339
changes as well it's not just said yes
and we have to protect

210
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:45,640
undergoes change its the frets

211
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,410
change as well and those two facts
together

212
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,870
me now one has to constantly on
constantly

213
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:56,160
progress constantly improve

214
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,230
to keep up with the pace and that's why
to process their

215
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,339
getting back to our discussion this type
of change

216
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:07,870
I mean um a keynote is meant to be a

217
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,610
say a hands to some degree a
simplification of things

218
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,540
and let's have a simplified look at
their way in that box while

219
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:19,559
look today I day recess of us

220
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:23,329
terrorists klein's

221
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:28,199
this lights as some all change in the
pariahs

222
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:33,530
what is going to happen yes silos will
move to

223
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:38,089
let's call it the cloud whatever bonus I

224
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:42,630
intelligence from that processing
largely most alert systems

225
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,750
that I call a smart phones here a

226
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:50,600
so what has been your network with your
systems at some point of time

227
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,910
and your network mediating access
between those

228
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,390
systems I'll will go to law

229
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:01,360
yeah will go to the Internet it's not a
law your systems normal on

230
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,500
unit block come will be somebody else
assist some saw

231
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,110
maybe a on the the front and processing
engines

232
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,199
not being under your management control
on

233
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:16,010
to it won't be your network wanna stuff
happens

234
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:19,350
and this is not only a technology change
but this brings

235
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:25,059
heavy architectural and conceptual
implications as well

236
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:29,669
are Toolman for some %uh view two main

237
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:32,839
say pilus of tea

238
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:36,290
a few interests in for a sec
architectures might go away

239
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:40,510
for us the concept of locality the
understanding like okay I know what

240
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,939
assistance are

241
00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:45,110
and that sell why I can protect into
something we

242
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,559
maybe by physical physical access
controls all by

243
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:51,790
arm whatever type of things that Obama
wants a

244
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,790
to the location our system is some

245
00:15:54,790 --> 00:16:00,270
can be found %uh all these types of
security controls will go away

246
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:03,970
and it's not only to concept of locality

247
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,240
is gone some what you might think okay
I'm we have had laptops in our

248
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,280
organization for ten years now

249
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,770
I'll what's this guy talking about
haliti still

250
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:16,370
having that tops in your organization
and most of

251
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,890
the places might have meant to Katie
said company provide at

252
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:23,169
entities a so you have some kind of

253
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:26,329
administrative fund management control
over them

254
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:29,709
and again and this one

255
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:32,910
the Society's our understanding BMW

256
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:37,209
we go away won't be easy you at some
point of time

257
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:40,220
la noche elements within the style one
my

258
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:45,919
just showed and I get back to this one
won't be under your control

259
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:51,040
but a I mean this is only one part of TF

260
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,730
things happening another part yes at the
same time

261
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:59,579
you get and even more systems that will
be connected to your network set

262
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:03,780
you will have to take care of on the
security side of things

263
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,089
them I P L what we call you in and other
things

264
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:11,040
on all types of entities can be
connected to net loss

265
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,319
and having to be secured embedded
systems all types that would be a number

266
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:15,620
of

267
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:19,819
there will be some talks on and that it
is some cell types of analysis is that

268
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:21,339
will pass

269
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:24,500
there might be controlled at wats which
Indian scan times

270
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,699
have been run completely separate

271
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:34,230
by a separate that group of people and
now de Sol you're seeing some March

272
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:37,549
on there was some conclusions drawl

273
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:40,640
out of these developments a

274
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:46,620
the first one as some a concert the
system management

275
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:51,240
looking at elements like cum seder the
cloud thing

276
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,100
the concept of system management like I
perform security

277
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,669
operations I perform security functions

278
00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:02,950
by having administrative control of
things on this one will

279
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,640
goal weight to some degree and this one
will have to be replaced

280
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,350
what I call trust management

281
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:14,780
you are no more india summer view a
sisal might have noticed soul

282
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,210
five years ago large pile my walk come

283
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:22,929
worse doing some technical things are
leading technical documents and

284
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:26,370
evaluating things from detective point
of view and today

285
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:31,600
%uh 10 or 20 I am forty percent %uh
vidaa negotiating contracts

286
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,570
and understanding what's in the
contracts and dealing with legal

287
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:39,460
arm this is a have a change and

288
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,700
on this from our perspective meets

289
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,850
I you have to get some understanding

290
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:50,760
what means what means trusts what means

291
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,240
are to work together with a third party

292
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,789
and expect this third party to act India

293
00:18:57,789 --> 00:19:02,730
in the sense of the own interests which
is not about control

294
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:06,289
some of you might still have the
understanding like I'll when we go to

295
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:07,590
the cloud when be

296
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:14,500
I love the handlebar on all things to a
third party is to perform for us

297
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,780
we must must been assaulted them me was
monitored on

298
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,929
are we have to have some instruments of
farm

299
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:25,710
the looking at an outside thing and
understanding what they do

300
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:29,230
and then the country's save if you have
those instruments

301
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:33,360
some dis Mon walk trust is not about

302
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,679
monitoring and controlling and of
solving

303
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:40,789
trust this to expect a third party to
happen the tool

304
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:45,330
act in my interests volat the ability

305
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:50,140
are to control it I mean if I trust you
and your turkey saws say my

306
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,840
my house here's a key for my house

307
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,070
a feel I get home %ah

308
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:01,010
and I I'm going to leave if I do sell

309
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:04,850
without cameras in my house and I trust
you if I have

310
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:09,530
a number of cameras in my house on I can
at every time a convo cable one what it

311
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:09,960
sees

312
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,250
you doing my house I don't trust you
obviously

313
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,380
and what you will needs is an approach

314
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,490
of trusts up

315
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:24,210
and not an approach of control I mean on
did you ever

316
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:28,220
at all at our say did you trust saddam

317
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,910
and maybe I'm potentially their fate

318
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:35,450
but you trust a damn and you did so for
whatever kinda Weezy

319
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:39,669
and what I want to we commend US try to
understand

320
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:44,770
who to trust and why to trust those
entities

321
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:48,090
and to understand some what

322
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,140
a trust is based on I mean I'm not
talking about faith

323
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:55,690
favors blind trust like all her God will
make things so

324
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:59,450
happen in a in a way that's good for
humanity which is a perfectly well it's

325
00:20:59,450 --> 00:20:59,710
um

326
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,960
stance but understanding

327
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,919
why and how to trust entities will be
one major part of your

328
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,679
future walk I gave a keynote at some
one-on-one time with phone to hear

329
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:17,090
there I have outlined term what I think
a valid reasons for trust like asking

330
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:19,220
questions okay lemme

331
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,740
how did some third-party behave in the
past

332
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,559
on how much information to give me late
trust me

333
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:32,019
who date to dig deep and on de salsa
taught sorts of questions that can be

334
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:33,429
asked to give a

335
00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:37,220
assay verified are a trust that the
space some reasons

336
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,769
and for some parts of the IT
infrastructure us you have to develop a

337
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:43,320
say in approach of trust

338
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,070
that s the fuss say

339
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:50,360
piece I want to deliver mckean second
ones

340
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,429
I mean some %uh him item might not be
the first time the European

341
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:58,230
keynote of mine and there was a

342
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:03,500
history will repeat some I'm I'm known
to be stocked a very simple security

343
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,110
will

344
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:07,559
its and this again

345
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:11,389
something I'd I'd like to to get your

346
00:22:11,389 --> 00:22:14,769
to understand to hopefully

347
00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:18,309
to get this message once again to troop
us terrorists

348
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:22,100
sake security fundamentals those
fundamentals

349
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:27,059
are there for a reason and looking at
this type of things

350
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:31,850
it turns out that I mean this one has to
be addressed by

351
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,259
some methodology so of trust but let's
have a look at dicks 1

352
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:39,509
let's have a look at the as much fun
side of things

353
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:43,559
it turns out Tom are

354
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:48,009
some elements moving this all or a
picture a Clyde in the immature

355
00:22:48,009 --> 00:22:52,490
infant stage when it comes to security
just might apply to control networks to

356
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,139
something we just might

357
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:57,299
apply to smartphones and to illustrate
this

358
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:00,509
a give you a seat citation

359
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:04,950
from from a sudden paper on computer
security

360
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:08,299
which goes like another major problems
defects

361
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:12,059
there are growing pressure us growing
process from

362
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:16,679
say management VIP's hard to interlink
chaparral at

363
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:19,950
but we ate computer systems which are

364
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:23,750
at the time maybe not computer systems
and

365
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:28,379
and traditional sense of what but pieces
like this

366
00:23:28,379 --> 00:23:32,490
into increasingly complex networks yes
this is what we commonly see

367
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:36,220
and there was on the line problems which
might be

368
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:42,039
operating systems do not provide
adequate support for computer security

369
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:45,799
which in itself might early to a number
of our

370
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:50,139
us a security problem saw security
implications

371
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:54,110
and if the you'll agree

372
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:57,250
that what's written hiya to some

373
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:02,419
degree applies for the count world of
these computing entities within your

374
00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:04,309
networks

375
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:07,429
the interesting thing I saw when was
paper written

376
00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:10,440
actually this is some of you might
notice one on

377
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,549
d the ahead

378
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:16,860
say economic side of people him might
notice one

379
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,350
that Anderson's paper on computer
security technology

380
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:23,860
at that computer security technology
planning study which

381
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,980
actually was written in nineteen seventy
tool

382
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:30,759
on the year well that one computer sir

383
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:33,820
computer games was like this Paul

384
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,279
this is th Gladys papon

385
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,490
are was written

386
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:44,480
and interestingly enough many things in
this paper

387
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,509
apply to certain types of systems

388
00:24:47,509 --> 00:24:50,679
Yukon net wats which leads a

389
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:55,029
to another conclusion if the problem
statement

390
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:58,580
hasn't changed since for DES made

391
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,669
don't waste dress set haven't changed
since forty

392
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:04,999
yes I strongly recommends

393
00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:11,259
to go back to from humanities once s at
fun test go back to the origins

394
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:14,590
to try to understand the wallet

395
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:19,450
and I think the and computer security
understanding the basic fundamental

396
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,200
principles laid out at

397
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,929
and see in time so laid out in things
they'll that we get beyond %uh because

398
00:25:24,929 --> 00:25:26,470
the Seven Sisters

399
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:31,049
understanding these fundamentals and
understanding how these fundamentals may

400
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:33,409
help to secure computer networks

401
00:25:33,409 --> 00:25:38,110
the should be a quite important piece of
you

402
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:42,019
if you walk this stuff was written for
wheezy

403
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:45,470
and as with cement and please some

404
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,659
followed as with some follow the simple
rules saw

405
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:53,220
to give you I'm say an application of a
simple

406
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,850
again aquino is meant to be transport
simple message S&S one

407
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:01,740
I'd like to to transport here looking at
this Sun

408
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,759
part of things

409
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,720
my a.m. there was a simple to conclude

410
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,929
from this on despot of things

411
00:26:12,929 --> 00:26:16,409
most netbooks alias all will be

412
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:20,879
unmanaged mess you won't be able to

413
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:24,789
to seek you out to control dust off with
means

414
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:28,249
with technical means you have been
useful in other parts of your network

415
00:26:28,249 --> 00:26:33,840
soul I allow myself to give a very
simple

416
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,530
say a recommendation here please please
please do not pros

417
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:42,760
us if you can somehow

418
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,809
avoid this i know i mean we aim for a
sec People v

419
00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:50,700
we saw farm say corporate organizational
interests

420
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,170
that to keep this in mind

421
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:58,760
do not process sensitive information on
smartphones

422
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:03,250
we got less of luck to you non yesterday
maybe it'll michaelson when this

423
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,030
workshop

424
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:07,700
are full of for iPhones and maybe

425
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,800
there is so sucky places where stuff can
be controlled and managed

426
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:17,530
but you should expects maybe in and for
your six months

427
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:20,590
the same the APC organization

428
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:25,010
County asking for use of smartphones
they might ask for not getting his

429
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,970
which is android-based and latest at
that point

430
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:32,179
forget about security by

431
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:36,530
controllers are technical means a
whateva this is an unmanaged mass

432
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,890
and if say a fairy godmother turned up

433
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:42,900
and said to me OK and you one one wish

434
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,440
as for the security of such types of
devices it would be

435
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,420
do not process Austar sensitive
information

436
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:54,020
bills this will not walk in the

437
00:27:54,020 --> 00:28:00,050
meet shot in a long time so far I've
covered a number of farm

438
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:03,660
what I think our architectural changes
in the info sekwalle

439
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:07,309
some unfortunately it's not only the S
and we have to protect

440
00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:10,590
that change es Salaam the world outside
its

441
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:15,120
with Fritz frats changes as well and

442
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,320
if there was one lesson one could turn
to you live from the assay last 12

443
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,700
months since last four-plus

444
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,220
on maybe from the whole year 2010 then
it's this one

445
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:28,380
you frats

446
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,530
a new attacks new types of attacks bill
shall

447
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:36,770
up so we have to prepare be prepared
mentally at least some

448
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:40,720
for their some towers

449
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,390
%ah I'm going to to discuss

450
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:48,420
some of the stuff that has been
happening on to to try to draw some

451
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,570
conclusions and

452
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:53,030
of it when I had to turn 10 star tats

453
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:56,260
someone who might know that was
initially día

454
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:00,360
in in January 2002 in a min made an
announcement like okay

455
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,910
presumably some systems have been hacked
and we suspect

456
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,990
say chinese authorities to be behind it

457
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:11,110
a level washed behind nets

458
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:15,820
this could have been a say a makeup call
and as we know in the meantime it wasn't

459
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,640
just says a Google in Adobe

460
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,710
but it was a sever many thousands

461
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:23,860
of large US some organizations

462
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:29,110
were affected by this one and if this
one hasn't been a game-changer

463
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:33,010
like okay something happen Cindy the
outside world

464
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:36,470
suddenly just one awesome amino know if
a sector

465
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:39,850
keynote in in early 2011 fun mentioning
Stuxnet

466
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:43,820
arm stock net loss

467
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,910
of could have been on my maybe I'm
actually ASA

468
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:50,220
kind of game change on the interesting
question s

469
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,940
why might stocks that have been a
game-changer

470
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,830
what's so special about it yeah it was a
targeted

471
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:01,140
tech okay the set things happen

472
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,620
I'd use 40 days which

473
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:08,240
means some ugly was so serious about
getting some

474
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,600
some jumped on that SEO days being
around and being use our tax in itself

475
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,090
is not

476
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:19,100
is a new are probably is stocks and was
not develop say bye

477
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,650
arm Johannes front sitting in a garage

478
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:25,910
but some again this

479
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:30,660
in itself might not be a a
groundbreaking the main

480
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,990
point of stocks net from my perspective

481
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:40,140
s its media excess turns stocks net loss
day hour so it was a proof

482
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:44,040
from theory to reality imagine you

483
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,830
you would know Tess a non flying objects

484
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:51,960
the flying through the sky society block

485
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:57,590
maybe you would be interested in say
that the nature of the type of object

486
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:00,840
but it was some Hall change the way you

487
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,650
a seat or what and this is so from my
perspective the main

488
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:08,810
national one has to get from stocks net
this

489
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:11,960
a text like dais

490
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,080
level was the origin eight and 10 was a
target

491
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:19,440
attacks like these might happen it's not
just a

492
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,320
assay paranoid to in for a sec guys like
a

493
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:28,160
whole this might happen and to

494
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:34,550
following some lines of thought of a
conspiracy theory

495
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:38,150
bad things might on Oct Pat bad things
time and

496
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:41,690
up an effort say two months ago law

497
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:45,200
in your own organization you you would
have speculated

498
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,510
some about like a lot well what would
happen if somebody breaks in two hours a

499
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,370
day

500
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:54,270
on people would have looked at you Ilya
crazy on this well it's not going to

501
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,080
happen you're paranoid

502
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,490
so please take a lesson things

503
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:03,669
that have been theoretical at some point
of time

504
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:07,820
might have tea in reality and

505
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:13,140
icons refrain from this one talking
about Stuxnet

506
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:17,190
I'd like to point out some things haha

507
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:20,480
presumably stocks net I'll

508
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,600
was initially deployed and Sadie

509
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,640
I Netlog slide was a supposed to cause
harm

510
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,770
by contractors USB deweiss houses

511
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:35,110
southward kites on a simple s

512
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:39,490
yall I'll external USB devices

513
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:43,360
in to be protected networks anyway I i
understand especially in the in the

514
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,380
title in in control net loss

515
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,460
one has to have a means of transporting
data

516
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:51,900
but is can easily be done by say

517
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:55,169
the maybe you speedlights s that up

518
00:32:55,169 --> 00:32:58,510
under some organizations control which I
know draw law

519
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:02,760
I of our some some desk for whateva

520
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,810
and whenever data has to be transported
take this peace dollars and use this

521
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:11,790
back to tune out let external USB
devices to connect to networks to be

522
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,530
protected

523
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:18,380
again if there was a fairy godmother
showing up like all you one wish

524
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:21,490
to secure control networks it would be

525
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:24,720
do not allow external USB devices to be
connected

526
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,090
and their small I'll stuff like this

527
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:32,340
analyzing stocks: net I mean sucks it
had a number of propagation methods

528
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:36,470
but amongst dole's was a say I'm

529
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:39,679
copping itself to unprotected network
Chace

530
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,400
and exploiting arm the exploit dead was
behind him

531
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,560
a Conficker dating back from to donate

532
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:52,150
on simple things could dash

533
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:55,560
in quite some net loss maybe half a
protected from

534
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:01,500
from Stuxnet like stuff and finally
Stuxnet had to months a variety of

535
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,330
further

536
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:06,950
technical things added a try to hide
itself by installing and rival

537
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:12,419
simple question again on Watson need to
install drive us

538
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:16,169
on production and on patrol Net but
machines once a on production

539
00:34:16,169 --> 00:34:20,550
how often do you need is to install a
driver so lock it down

540
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:23,690
do not allow installation of drivers
some on

541
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:27,090
if you are in charge of securing
controlled what some

542
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:31,230
on on those systems simple rules might
have

543
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:35,300
I mean I'm not telling you that %uh

544
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,550
the say

545
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:42,070
one would have been able to a to a white
and infection

546
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:46,179
stocks net fully but in some that lots

547
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:49,960
this would have happened if simple
security rules

548
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:54,060
would have been filed

549
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:58,450
going on on the time line so we had to
in 2010 we had to

550
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:02,190
r RI and yet stocks not some let's get

551
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:05,720
09-02-2011 there isa stuff from

552
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:10,330
say naughty in for second text space
that might change the way how we

553
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:16,260
policy security there was the data and
that was and still is the %uh price

554
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:21,260
in non say the Arab lot

555
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:25,250
which might have shed that the
understanding of TV out in capabilities

556
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,890
of the Internet

557
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:30,450
and that was on I'll just recently it

558
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:33,940
Japan Aflac I'd like to take the

559
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:37,450
opportunity to think of the week Thames

560
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:40,839
for a second back to high

561
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:44,760
block and back to troop us test two
lessons

562
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,500
I'd like to draw from that a pain of
process

563
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:53,180
we are living in a globalized wats
things that happen in one part of the

564
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,390
wards

565
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:59,970
are catastrophes take happen in one part
of the world

566
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:03,070
might effects in for a sec

567
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:07,630
environments network environments in
other parts of the world and not just as

568
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,470
fine a male ability

569
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:13,350
you might have notice that Cisco who
have attached a two-time CEO

570
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:16,530
one in march in one in September de ti
phat

571
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:20,020
idea are Moche patch day

572
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:23,040
to September they should a statement
like

573
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,570
all we won't term we won't have found
the March the

574
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:30,339
patch day as we understand that some of
our customers at

575
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:33,720
to very time have for different problems
to cope with

576
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:38,589
then patching the Cisco Systems but
obviously there's some impacts

577
00:36:38,589 --> 00:36:42,810
Asfaw say the net rights to be protected
at

578
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:46,690
from some of quake happening in some
part of the world

579
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:50,140
and there was a second lesson that is
some

580
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,810
talking about risk assessment

581
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:57,930
you might know that we at the on W we
have a strong stance as for risk

582
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:59,670
assessment and risk management

583
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:03,280
actually in the afternoon there will be
a panel discussing stuff like this and

584
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,460
Tom

585
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:08,280
I will be on the panel and I will I'll
hopefully

586
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,480
be able to argue from the position at
risk assessment sir

587
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,800
is a good thing and is needed at to act
on

588
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,620
in a in an efficient manner as fly in
for a sec

589
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:24,300
environments still risk assessment only
wats

590
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,910
living a variety year saying well you
its

591
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:31,710
far normal operation I'll

592
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:36,060
of art thing set can that can show up

593
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,930
and to our can be classified into
different risks

594
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:43,020
there might be Iran's that happen

595
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:48,100
but happened ray rally but which might
be a outside the scope of risk

596
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,609
assessment so not everything in the
world

597
00:37:50,609 --> 00:37:54,800
can be addressed before success meant
best things that cannot be addressed

598
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,510
aren't I think a conclusions some I
difficulty in so you

599
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:04,900
but some being able %ah having deny if
understanding that one can control

600
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,630
everything

601
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:09,089
by me to risk assessment might be a as a
set

602
00:38:09,089 --> 00:38:12,609
might be are

603
00:38:12,609 --> 00:38:15,740
back to the in for a sec to the thinks
of

604
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:19,630
things happening on I discuss Oxnard I
discuss

605
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:23,050
Sadie Egypt Bryce just recently

606
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:26,940
nothing's happened towers study hours a
break-in

607
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:30,300
and our city comatose of

608
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,589
s 20 hours a break-in

609
00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:37,520
I quite some %uh he'll are affected from
this one

610
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,930
to some degree they are so

611
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:44,690
a hot lots of lots of say speculation
going on

612
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:49,050
on what does this mean for us and two or
three alarm

613
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:54,140
how should we act I wrote a blog posts
about this and I i won't term

614
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:57,589
say a detailed discussion right here
still

615
00:38:57,589 --> 00:39:01,240
I'd like to ask two questions and to
bring them on the table tool

616
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,330
support my my main message of peace
opening

617
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:07,740
marks process I'll one can ask a white
did

618
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:12,530
day keep custom seats at all

619
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:16,170
terrace in the same official app
explanation going i goal in case

620
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:19,310
a customer did not have a backup officer

621
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:23,040
of Darrell authentication systems and

622
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,330
del indication systems got school day
could approach on

623
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:29,440
I was a arm

624
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:35,089
and ask but as he fights again on there
was another explanation

625
00:39:35,089 --> 00:39:39,820
from the conspirators conspiracy theory
space maybe

626
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:43,510
which goes like okay our same was

627
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:46,900
founded in the in the eighties in the
eighties some love you might know there

628
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,830
was a large debate

629
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:52,130
about seek skip check

630
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:56,570
the clipper chip and all the key escrow
debate so

631
00:39:56,570 --> 00:40:00,490
are I will train from any country
conclusions here

632
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:03,690
but still a peaceful remember our

633
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:08,050
I'd try to convince your understanding
who to trust and why to trust her

634
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:12,080
entities might lead to interesting

635
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:16,440
questions and conclusions here and there
was a second thing

636
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,710
I'd like to point out to them quite some
people ask himself some

637
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:24,350
and I am amongst those people let's
assume

638
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:27,460
customers he fights have been
compromised and that SIA

639
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:31,880
the current demos say popular assumption

640
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,069
out study hours a case

641
00:40:35,069 --> 00:40:39,819
like why when does some seat five person
will be on that success

642
00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:42,870
systems why wasn't there nag

643
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:46,290
to to some degree and this might remind
us

644
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:51,200
that was simple security rules to follow

645
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,589
and maybe day didn't fall those simple
security rules

646
00:40:55,589 --> 00:41:00,460
an ass did not another organization
Kamal

647
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:04,290
Commodore yes a I got this from the
Wikipedia article

648
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:08,310
article on them Commodores a privately
held group of companies

649
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:14,250
offering computer software an SSL
certificate products

650
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:18,460
let whoopi leaders for a sec privately
held group of companies offering

651
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,130
computer software

652
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:23,830
some anti-virus softer anti-virus I'll

653
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:27,230
like a well on what I understand

654
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:32,150
assess certificate products why to trust
an organization

655
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:35,370
cool of our security products

656
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:38,760
and say authentication

657
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,330
highly valuable authentication

658
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:45,790
and titties at the very same moment

659
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:50,670
from the very same company and I might
be conflicts at some time

660
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:55,020
if this part of business is not going
well are so maybe they have to push the

661
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,740
other part of the business

662
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:00,780
by lowering the standards so whatever
similar questions

663
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:04,120
as for the trust methodology I were far
too early a

664
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,720
which and and I didn't give details at
the moment but some

665
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:11,980
duck questions like what's the nature of
their business some

666
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:16,569
who'd a deep and on who are they related
leff

667
00:42:16,569 --> 00:42:20,020
asking those questions might have led to
a conclusion

668
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:25,080
call might or might not be right partner
to get allies as certificates from

669
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:30,130
a and term what de public statements s

670
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:34,819
presumably some registration age and in
sao you are was compromised so

671
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:37,950
this sold at this is a mafia-style

672
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:42,430
I'll tell us how you are father this is
where the that the place so the part of

673
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:44,750
the wall outlet and let us honor sir

674
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:48,290
a sun is shining and aid ha IDO

675
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:53,140
corrupted anyway actually day only have
one registration agent in in Italy

676
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:56,530
so it's not too far-fetched them to say
it

677
00:42:56,530 --> 00:43:00,720
maybe was Italy arm that's a story they
want to tell

678
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,960
interesting enough I have been a
registration agent flaw

679
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,359
for a major german on

680
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:11,810
CA sometime goal and at a time

681
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:16,069
up I had a dedicated smart cart just to
perform

682
00:43:16,069 --> 00:43:19,330
SAT at the registration process

683
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:23,560
I and this one suddenly was not easy to
to compromise where

684
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:28,670
s assigning often all the stuff was on
the Colin was a car that had 'em

685
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:32,760
at a time eat something in the air Fife
certification

686
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,830
a soda story like goal that guy in italy
has been compromised

687
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:40,560
some I that I didn't have far good
security practice

688
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,580
which would mean a lot cessation agent

689
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:47,270
I should perform a texan not based on
this a simple pass what

690
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:51,790
are something out what's wrong with that
and term

691
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:56,060
I mean a smaller more on this there was
some potential there was actually a much

692
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,990
broader and issuing a farm

693
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:03,940
certificates for certain entities which
again

694
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:07,120
my proof de our side the intrinsic part
of the white

695
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:11,160
as well united with the other part of
the world as some having dollar-some

696
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:16,030
entities compromised might lead to say
life-threatening conditions

697
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:20,080
for some people in parts of the world
they spread the rumor loss

698
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,380
that Iran was behind the attacks and I
was even

699
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:27,680
sayin Iran in hecka on

700
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,770
confessing the whole thing in some
public forum like oh it was me who did

701
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:32,299
it

702
00:44:32,299 --> 00:44:36,180
and I from Island I'm from Iran and I
act on my own

703
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:39,490
are maybe that's true maybe it's not

704
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:44,190
a point is: they played a card like a
old ass is soundly the FBI attacked by

705
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:46,359
governmental

706
00:44:46,359 --> 00:44:49,440
entity and tell we could protect against

707
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,690
a sense of the virus a hours a man
mention this yr

708
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:56,400
ATT at once assistant rats

709
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,049
he threatening us in treating our
business I mean it's a business they

710
00:45:00,049 --> 00:45:02,010
should be able to protect

711
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:05,540
and they should be able to explain your
holiday protect you should ask for this

712
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:07,510
to be a trusted that

713
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:10,589
I it sa the Act waiting for us online

714
00:45:10,589 --> 00:45:15,750
from 10 maybe not so much trust and one
might have been able to find ol its

715
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:20,140
by asking them the right questions this
aside the part of the message I want to

716
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:20,650
deliver

717
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:26,780
are and they even had some yeah

718
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:30,730
pick up a common a hiccup roof you could
cook could get this certificate

719
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:34,030
obviously that Guyana pupil diameter

720
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:37,930
Italy didn't get our cell

721
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:43,410
but saddam ask yourselves if obviously
there are entities are capable

722
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:46,600
of breaking in 2 hours a day and

723
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,760
presumably steel seat fights and if
there were entities

724
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,299
live a little break into a

725
00:45:54,299 --> 00:45:58,319
say well-established but maybe not by
Ron

726
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:01,420
CA entities

727
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:04,609
what would be way now go off to next Sun

728
00:46:04,609 --> 00:46:07,740
such a type of attack yesterday

729
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:12,339
it's a you should keep in mind its those
guys who did this self

730
00:46:12,339 --> 00:46:16,549
on might be on the next %ah gets

731
00:46:16,549 --> 00:46:21,890
might be a are say cloud infrastructure
us this is at least what I would do

732
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:27,109
I if I wanted to get my hands on say
centralized for processing and highly

733
00:46:27,109 --> 00:46:30,310
are potentially highly valuable data

734
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:35,770
arm it's not my intent to to spread far
did a very moment like a I'll just use

735
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:37,089
iCloud term

736
00:46:37,089 --> 00:46:40,140
submit get my get make a compromise

737
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:43,810
my intended s to deliver free say

738
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:48,650
main lessons so we learn from what
happened in the past the process

739
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:52,500
theoretical mites get practica

740
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:56,100
so you'd you'd better be prepared for it

741
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:59,240
better be prepared for it mean size you
should have

742
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,549
a set of tools I me we believe in

743
00:47:02,549 --> 00:47:06,730
risk assessment and in certain types of
risk assessment mission Amos you'll

744
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:10,589
to take decisions in a creek Mena

745
00:47:10,589 --> 00:47:15,430
things might happen and things might
happen in a way you do not expect them

746
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:19,080
a cell you should be able to cope with
things you have

747
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:23,319
not followed up thought offered as of
today

748
00:47:23,319 --> 00:47:27,569
again for weeks ago law nobody would
have I'll most people in a room one of

749
00:47:27,569 --> 00:47:32,170
not have have expected a break-in at
hours a day

750
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:36,150
got a point there some noticia thing
happened

751
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:39,210
how do you love it can you deliver it

752
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:42,690
safe rapidly are I use

753
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:47,500
there was scratching your head okay
older sign I never thought of this some

754
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,630
I have to get sir

755
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:54,040
say people together and we have to
discuss sir how to go on

756
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:59,740
be prepared for things that's the first
lesson second s figure out who to trust

757
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:04,160
ask the right questions some some of
those are laid out in the in the iraqi

758
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,420
not a gay firm and I'm happy to discuss
all this some

759
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:13,150
a law all on-site some some point it
will pass in the past

760
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:17,730
relationship but some understand

761
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:21,210
who you hand over our badu
authentication

762
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:24,250
up some parts of your education system

763
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:27,700
are say your data processing

764
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:31,560
and to there was some simple security
Willis

765
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:35,069
which %uh damn because they have waged

766
00:48:35,069 --> 00:48:38,200
try to all this we member to

767
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:42,880
a simple stuff this will help you in in
times of trouble

768
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,190
are we understand and I understand that

769
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:50,230
are say you might feel like him

770
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:53,279
her Alice in Wonderland wen Xia Inc

771
00:48:53,279 --> 00:48:56,330
when she meets does to the Red Queen
which

772
00:48:56,330 --> 00:49:00,900
one of T A multiple say

773
