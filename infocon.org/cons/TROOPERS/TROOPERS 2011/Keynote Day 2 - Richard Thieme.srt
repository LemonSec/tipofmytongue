1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,080
from what a hot pack it was great

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,259
from what i can. directly

3
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:10,510
say but was great soul of

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:17,510
its I F which not many people

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,910
say security space

6
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,920
toss

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:31,410
all Clyde

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,649
such to give the keynote today

9
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:42,140
everything else far as poss tell you
directly

10
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,530
which thanks thank you

11
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:52,530
good morning

12
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,469
you cannot hear me thank you

13
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:01,399
I understand that for some luv you
English is a second language

14
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:06,090
so when I get going I tend to go fast

15
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,600
a so if I am speaking too fast

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,140
please raise your hand who won't slow me
down

17
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,350
but it will give you something to think
about well

18
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,130
well I'm carrying on up

19
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,900
this this talk is has this a subtitle

20
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,520
which is staring into the abyss from the
Chi he said beware

21
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,790
staring into the abyss too long less the
abyss their back into you

22
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:38,009
what are the dangers a professional
intelligence and security work

23
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,340
is that we interact with the abyss we
look

24
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:47,110
over it are solid dialogue some in the
narrative you have heard

25
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:50,939
and the first day is an attempt to tame
the abyss

26
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:54,600
are and that's what we will do
inevitably

27
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,560
is try to make the safe in which the
space in which we work

28
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,610
feel safer but in the meantime

29
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:06,570
we have to remind ourselves from time to
time what it really is like

30
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:12,370
to always or often or even sometimes be
staring into the abyss because it has

31
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,599
consequences for us for us personally

32
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,730
for our families and also

33
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:23,709
for the work that we do on behalf
ultimately not only nation states but

34
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:27,190
maintaining relative stability in the
world

35
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:31,269
so when I'm going to try to do is

36
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:35,060
illuminate or articulate or

37
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,239
say what the real

38
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,349
big picture looks like to me and to tell
as much truth

39
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:46,430
as I know how to tell on the basis %uh

40
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:51,200
my years experience I V interacting with
people on all sides

41
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,410
the feds might buy one value is that
they have remained independent

42
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,870
my life are I was just

43
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,250
telling you know that once I was invited
to speak on behalf of Microsoft in

44
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,310
israel and the other speaker was Steve
Ballmer

45
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,989
in quietly and the side the person who
invited me

46
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:14,840
said the reason we brought you in this
so you would give credibility

47
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,239
to anything he might say about security
a

48
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:22,890
you get the idea Microsoft was at that
time

49
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,450
up making the pitch that oh I see
security

50
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:32,090
it does matter in the marketplace and we
will add it to the list of things to

51
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,830
which we pay close attention

52
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:40,019
in the future and that's really sums up
the problem for the whole space

53
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:43,069
the securities in the future and it's an
add-on

54
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:46,430
to a platform that was built forties and
access

55
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:50,069
and easy to use and not to be secure

56
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:53,159
and to be used among friends in the
corporate

57
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:56,260
academic government military and
intelligence environment

58
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,250
from which you came about forty or fifty
years ago

59
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,069
by which I mean the internet which be
came the digital platform for

60
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:07,530
everything and that's the source evolve
our work

61
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:13,439
and all the problems we face I'm going
to be speaking from the assumption that

62
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,720
I am part of this

63
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,280
so this is not judgmental accusatory it
is

64
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,070
observational and descriptive it is what
it seems to me is

65
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,430
true I but I'm trying to stretch the
paradigm in every domain

66
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:32,210
in every area people develop when I call
a narrative

67
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,130
%uh the security space has a narrative
it is self-talk

68
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,550
it is the way we talk to ourselves about
what it is

69
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:43,979
that we do and in that self talk we can
become

70
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:47,800
isolated from the larger picture and the
point if you have others outside air

71
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,509
space this is true for

72
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:54,949
any domain and so it's important to look
critically at the words we use even

73
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:55,690
words like

74
00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:00,470
security because we use them as if
everyone knows what they mean

75
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:04,169
are yesterday the word transparency was
used

76
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:07,340
I as if it were self-evident but

77
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,570
transparency on behalf of a person
making a presentation

78
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:16,789
is only self-evident if you already know
that the person is transparent

79
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:22,639
and so it becomes circular and yet it is
the very basis of social engineering

80
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,130
to count on people to believe that they
know

81
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:30,789
to whom they are speaking and from whom
a message or communication comes

82
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:34,479
and of course you know that is not
always true

83
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,570
in addition we live in a space which has
been defined

84
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:42,729
I use an american point of view since
1947

85
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:46,229
when the national security council and
the Central Intelligence Agency were

86
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:47,550
created

87
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:50,590
to do things differently in the world in
the US

88
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,949
had done previously and after 9/11

89
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:57,160
that has expanded dramatically

90
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,639
in terms the realization that what the
technologies we discuss

91
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,160
today have done is make obsolete our
prior notions

92
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,100
enshrined in the Constitution and the
united states like search-and-seizure

93
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,729
how how do you define I'm justifiable
search and seizure in a world

94
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:17,840
that has no walls friend tonight at the
NASA says

95
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,620
people are always asking the wrong
questions

96
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:26,340
the right questions are how do you
freeze the mind

97
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,580
how do you live in a world without any
walls

98
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,280
at all in when you define the paradigm

99
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,000
as security professionals often do the
narrative

100
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,270
which determines how people think about
a problem

101
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:46,650
then you don't have to worry about the
answers people give because the paradigm

102
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:51,259
or way of thinking will determine the
questions that they're capable of asking

103
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:56,020
this is true also in every domain in
addition the longer you work in a single

104
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,919
culture

105
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:00,870
the more you are assimilated you know
the Borg from

106
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,400
Star Trek ultimately they assimilate
everyone

107
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,580
all over cultures as soon as we touch
them begin to organise consciously and

108
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,660
unconsciously

109
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,009
to make us live within and think within
the paradigm a model and reality that

110
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:15,270
they articulate

111
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,479
a famous anthropologist Margaret Mead
once said

112
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,690
when I go into a new culture it will
take me a full year to learn

113
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:27,639
again what I have learned in the first
two weeks

114
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:32,050
because after those first two weeks when
you come in to see it all fresh before

115
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:32,569
you

116
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:36,740
and you see the social cues to which you
did not respond and therefore notice

117
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,539
consciously after two weeks you have
been

118
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:44,509
by virtue viewer interaction you have
been assimilated already

119
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:48,870
into the culture enough so that you pay
attention to the Q's

120
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:52,580
you behaved as the Q signal you to
behave

121
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:57,129
and it will therefore obfuscate or blur
your ability to see clearly

122
00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:00,400
what is going on in the culture because
to a degree you become part of it the

123
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,139
longer you work in this industry

124
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:05,940
the more the narrative becomes true for
you

125
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,000
you become arm timothy leary

126
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,810
apostle love LSD once said you never get
the truth from the company memo

127
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:19,180
never because once you join a company
for example

128
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,759
the higher up you go the more you have
been assimilated by the culture the

129
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,800
company until at the top

130
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,360
what you do is articulate the company's
view of itself

131
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,430
so when I go in as a consultant I often
find that most useful

132
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,539
to talk to the receptionist at the desk

133
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:42,669
or the janitors sweeping up and simply
saying what's it like around here

134
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:46,860
you get to choose but by the time you go
up to the top levels in the executive

135
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,570
suite

136
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:52,380
the truth is continually mitigated until
it becomes the company chose

137
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,120
it becomes that which people want others
to believe

138
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,880
so in security the weakest link in the
chain

139
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,630
is frequently that definition the
problem

140
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:09,540
and the definition of the problem is
very often not what we think it is

141
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,019
so what I'm really asking is who are we

142
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,269
in this space and nothing is harder to
see

143
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:21,660
then the things that we believe so
deeply that we don't even remember

144
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:27,620
that they started off its beliefs which
we had to adapt

145
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:32,360
when the paradigm is threatened in often
cannot even be

146
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,970
heard I'm I'm not going to give you a
talk

147
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:39,930
in which you say I have three things to
do next Monday morning get back to the

148
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:43,980
workspace in 1 2-3 take out a laptop 123

149
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,940
are what I'm trying to do is create a
way of thinking about what it is we do

150
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,500
that we'll

151
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,350
echo and in future weeks or months

152
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:56,230
things will occur where you remember
hopefully some other things I said and

153
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,390
they will cause you to reflect

154
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:02,060
that's my goal to reflect differently on

155
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:06,200
how you would look at it once upon a
time

156
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,070
tell this story just to illustrate how
strong a paradigm is

157
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:14,100
I've had three careers I taught English
Literature at the University

158
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,800
I was an Anglican clergyman for sixteen
years

159
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,230
which is when I began my interest in the
early 1980s in the transformational

160
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,959
power technology

161
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:28,380
and tried to interest the people around
me in what computers were going to do to

162
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,570
transform religious structures in
organizational life

163
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:35,470
and ideas I've got himself in images
identity

164
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:40,149
ours and others I and people said I was
crazy

165
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:43,810
a which may have been true but it wasn't
true

166
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,089
on the basis of what I was saying which
was the computers were going to so

167
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:50,300
transform the space is going to be as
big as the printing press once they

168
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,190
start talking to each other

169
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:55,209
so because I talked a lot I was

170
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:58,959
invited to participate in a program they
knew things were changing

171
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,800
but they didn't know how so they set up
a program for three years

172
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,970
called new paradigm Sferra leadership

173
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:09,829
in the Anglican Church in America and I
took part in that

174
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:13,550
and I was sitting there listening to the
people speak to each other about 20

175
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,579
people

176
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:18,110
our bishops in you know like that

177
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,769
talking about all the ways they could
change the paradigm

178
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:25,390
when I suddenly saw what we have to do
and I said I just

179
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:30,209
realized there's only one way we can
change the paradigm

180
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:36,170
and a pause for a minute and said what
and I said we have to leave

181
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:41,170
Cadburys quiet in about six or seven
seconds later

182
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,660
long time in a group everybody start
talking again

183
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:48,410
as if they had not heard a word that I
had said

184
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:52,200
because the threat %uh leaving meant

185
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,560
so transforming the paradigm

186
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,380
that it wouldn't exist as we have
internalized it

187
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:03,250
and the very people too many speaking by
the time they became leaders in that

188
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:09,089
organization had internalized the
structures by which they advanced

189
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:14,050
a friend of mine is a Cup policemen

190
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:18,370
he also belongs to well-known church
which I will not name

191
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,430
but its global and has

192
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:25,300
been in the news a lot and

193
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,790
he said you know when you join the
police force when you going to the

194
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,850
church same thing

195
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,899
he said same deal he said you're ready

196
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:36,370
and they put you in a place where they
can watch you

197
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:40,450
and and the police force he says you
know money passes hands

198
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:43,740
drug money gets lost things happen

199
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,170
you take someone into an alley and only
one issue comes out

200
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:52,529
wiping off your hands is and they watch
you to see how you react to that

201
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:56,339
and the word goes around quite quickly
he's one of us

202
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:00,779
or he's not and if he's not you never
make captain

203
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:04,220
you can stay but always on the edges

204
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,459
and he said same thing in the church if
you notice what's going on

205
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:11,790
and you blow the whistle you never going
to be

206
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:16,399
the archbishop a major archdiocese

207
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,420
this is what cultures do to us and this
is the danger of becoming

208
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:25,130
imprisoned in our own thinking so

209
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:29,730
it also has an impact on us to deal with
the things with which we deal

210
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:34,149
I have friends who are on the front
lines this war such as it is

211
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:40,100
I don't know how we define it and one of
them said to me

212
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,310
I have seen the face it evil

213
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:46,980
when you confront you can't define the
evil

214
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,560
but when you confront it you know it you
know it for what it is

215
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,079
its oppressive it wants to destroy

216
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:59,940
it is overwhelming and that has an
impact on us

217
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,310
I was one sitting at a dinner there were
three of us to dinner in washington won

218
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,180
this from the NSA months from the FBI
and

219
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,199
and then me weird talking about our work

220
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:14,160
in one of them said you have any idea
what it does

221
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,110
to just listen to people's secrets and
not be able to say

222
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:22,839
anything and they talked about the
effect it had on them over their life

223
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:27,010
and as a former clergyman of course yes
I do know what it does

224
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:32,060
clergyman contrary to popular image are
exposed to everything

225
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:35,430
you encounter if you engage with it you
emotionally wrestle with it

226
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:40,790
n you absorb it so yes I know what it
does and one other person said

227
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:44,290
imagine your sitting at headphones on

228
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:48,800
intensely listening to people on an
airplane cutting the throats

229
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,220
the passengers and you're listening in
real time

230
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,560
as we do too so much in the world

231
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:02,899
and you go home at night for dinner and
your spouse says how was your day

232
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:07,190
and the only thing you can do is say it
was fine dear

233
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:12,990
well it does have an effect on us to
stare into the abyss

234
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:16,070
so it is taking that into account

235
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,209
that the life I guess yesterday

236
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,440
you know almost apologized for

237
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,910
the emotion that powers this conference
in it without his

238
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:31,910
are values without his commitments and
without that emotional bias

239
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:35,220
to make a difference in the world in
which we live arm

240
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,509
we wouldn't act that's what motivates s
the most

241
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:43,410
and so I hope that when I get done
you'll think a little differently about

242
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,910
words like security

243
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:48,360
and cyber war and defense

244
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,880
okay now

245
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,980
discussions have security usually focus

246
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,709
and statements about security itself

247
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:04,430
this this is the a condition that I call
primary now you have it a

248
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:08,470
it is just taking the statements at face
value

249
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:11,630
inner literalist way but

250
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:16,870
to learn to understand the context what
I believe is called it sits in the bed

251
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:22,910
the statement you have to know the can
text the deeper context

252
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:27,190
and I find most useful knowledge comes
from turning context

253
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,910
into content context

254
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:34,040
into content now that may sound abstract
so

255
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,899
let me give you an example we had an
American guy named any burn A's

256
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:41,829
back in the nineteen twenties %uh is the
word public relations

257
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:47,209
comely known any bernie's invented the
phrase public relations

258
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:50,920
he was an advertising man any wanted to
give it a bitter twist

259
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,639
so we invented public relations as the
first active public relations

260
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:59,600
he was always focused on the context so
when

261
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,949
are for example publishers came to him
and said we want to sell books

262
00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:07,309
we need to sell more books he didn't
just advertise buy books

263
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:10,650
ordered this book cover

264
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:14,380
he called together leading intellectuals

265
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:19,089
and said is literacy important to a
culture and they all said yes absolutely

266
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:22,400
so he said when you sign a statement to
that effect and they did

267
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,390
and then he called a meeting of
architects and builders and construction

268
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,400
workers and

269
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,900
put them together and put the affidavit
in front at them and said you see this

270
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,870
Wii U participate in making america
great through literacy

271
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,960
and they said of course what do we have
to do

272
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,360
and he told them that was in the
nineteen twenties

273
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,750
in the United States for the first time
unless you are very wealthy

274
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,950
anyone who bought a house moved into an
apartment

275
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:54,740
after that time found built-in bookcases

276
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,750
built-in bookshelves and when you see a
built-in bookshelves

277
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,260
lining your wall what you put on it

278
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:07,160
books so what he did is create a context

279
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,280
which invisibly and unspoken

280
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,230
invited people to do that which was the
intention

281
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,669
are the publishing industry which is to
sell more

282
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:22,160
books well security in the real world is

283
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,380
like that too if we can see the context
in which we work

284
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:30,520
it will transform into content and then
we can think about it

285
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,919
and manipulated the bottom line if
security is what works

286
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:39,169
what works I once went to the Zen Center
in

287
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:42,280
San Francisco and I'm Zen

288
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,340
Buddhist monk came out and he came
forward and he

289
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:51,049
bout like this and everybody get up cuz
you suppose to

290
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:54,690
and bowed and he said you know why we
buy now

291
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:59,120
here it is in San and people thought
they were supposed to sound

292
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,740
religious you know situation always to
acknowledge the Godhead in one another

293
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,960
or we

294
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,950
bout to do this and that he was very
compassionate and kind being a Zen

295
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,080
Buddhist monk

296
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,070
and he said I know that's good but
that's not what I'm after funny when

297
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,000
people have exhausted their answers she
said

298
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,850
Wiebe how here because things seem
pretty much to work better

299
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:25,990
when you boil s my definition of
practical spirituality it's also

300
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,020
definition of security word

301
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,299
things just pretty much work better

302
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:35,100
when you buy now and things don't work
very well in the security

303
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,230
world today so let's spell it out

304
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:41,570
James Baldwin like American writer said

305
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:45,970
the price one pays for pursuing any
profession or calling is an intimate

306
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:49,020
knowledge of its dark side

307
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,200
its ugly side

308
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,220
and Philip K Dick another author for
america

309
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:01,250
said reality is that which when you stop
believing in it

310
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,669
refuses to go away

311
00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:07,809
so those the realities I want to talk
about

312
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:11,409
we do our work in a deep political
structure

313
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:16,450
deep political structure a deep
political structure includes

314
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:19,990
all love the partnership's collusion and

315
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:23,990
agreements we have between ourselves and
others

316
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,650
both in the overworld which is how most
diverse thinking ourselves

317
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:31,919
and the underworld which is how much the
most do not think about ourselves

318
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,610
but they are one thing like Enea the
overworld

319
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:39,210
in the underworld interpenetrating one
another and I spell out some other

320
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,220
details and figures that indicate

321
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,400
that without criminality the American
economy

322
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,860
would go down and so with the world
economy

323
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:52,159
in this raises critical questions from
what we mean by the word security

324
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,150
let me quote a definition have deep
politics is from Peter Dale Scott he

325
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,419
investigated the

326
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:01,010
is done a lot of work with the JFK
assassination

327
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:04,460
is a professor university-california

328
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:08,380
are fifty years after JFK was killed

329
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,659
now it's pretty clear that's not a
conspiracy theory

330
00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:16,100
its conspiracy it was a conspiracy he
was killed

331
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:20,080
as a result of a conspiracy we can
identify some other players

332
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,530
some motivations for Peter Dale Scott is
looking for is

333
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:27,289
it doesn't focus on who pulled the
trigger it focuses on

334
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:30,559
why did so many people one Kennedy dead

335
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,820
why did so many vested interest in the
American political culture want him dead

336
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,150
what was she doing that provoked such a
response

337
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:44,600
because they were serious then martin
luther king junior malcolm X

338
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,750
in Chicago fred hampton others

339
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:51,210
as well as Robert Kennedy as well as
Jack

340
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:55,320
so that was just how things got done

341
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,350
in those days now it's much more subtle

342
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:04,870
much more subtle Saudi politics he said
is if this is not a conspiracy theory he

343
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:05,840
said

344
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,789
it's about the conscious secret
collaborations

345
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:13,830
toward shared ins in deep political
analysis

346
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:17,770
the study of all those arrangements
whether or not we're aware of them

347
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:21,070
and they're deliberately not what you
usually repressed rather than

348
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,270
acknowledged

349
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:25,530
repressed rather than acknowledged now
this is

350
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:28,690
June criminal structures I grew up in
Chicago

351
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:32,549
there's no question in Chicago that the
only way you did business I have lotsa

352
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:33,490
stories

353
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,799
and worked with the political structure
growing up I don't think I was ever

354
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,270
asked to do something legal

355
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,650
not once I worked with an alderman

356
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:47,179
if she if he had for what is it doing
something

357
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:50,419
in three were legal in one was illegal

358
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:53,960
he would do it illegally to maintain his
integrity

359
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,360
that's the kind of guy he was so there
was a constant interpenetration

360
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,909
this is true with the intelligence
community

361
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:05,150
as well in addition

362
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,500
I've been part of an effort ad hoc

363
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:14,220
outside haven't affect and some aspects
the intelligence community

364
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,640
by raising questions about six so

365
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,710
a number of us get together and talk
about those issues

366
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:26,179
in try to make some difference that can
be taken inside the fence

367
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:29,760
are this is something I wrote in the
course above that

368
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,789
investigation information security

369
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:37,340
as one task both offense 7 defense it

370
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:43,600
over the intelligence community
sanctions breaking foreign laws

371
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,630
in every country including of course
yours

372
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:52,779
while prohibiting similar activities on
American soil

373
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:56,429
but simple distinctions a foreign and
domestic

374
00:23:56,429 --> 00:24:00,960
no longer hold it's much like in biology
I speak about by attacking now

375
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,450
in the porting a packing methodologies
and perspectives into the biological

376
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,630
severe

377
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:10,230
I do a whole whole talk on that and we
can no longer use the terms natural and

378
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,020
artificial

379
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:15,020
as if they make meaningful binary
distinctions

380
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,690
well in the same way we can't say
foreign and domestic why because

381
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:23,669
the structures in our society are
determined by the flow

382
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:29,000
up information within it and that shapes
our social interactions and our cultural

383
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,820
interactions

384
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:33,390
and their very identities as we
unconsciously assimilate

385
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:37,750
how r technologies determine we will
think and act and behave

386
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:41,409
and that is why when you go through a
transformational period all over prior

387
00:24:41,409 --> 00:24:43,580
ways relating to one another

388
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:47,730
into ourselves gold liquid its like
holding ice cubes the cold liquid

389
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:52,140
in the liquid ships through your fingers
and they will coalesce again on the

390
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,880
other side the chance for May tional
motion

391
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,880
but in new forms that determinant
pattern different kinds of interactions

392
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,049
in different kinds thinking so

393
00:25:03,049 --> 00:25:06,580
when you're talking about intelligence
and intelligence work you have to factor

394
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,340
in

395
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,090
that a very bad injuries around your
definition

396
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:14,429
which you think I've is a nation or
nation-state

397
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:18,929
have gone liquid it is so easy to point
that out in Europe

398
00:25:18,929 --> 00:25:23,830
where there used to be countries and now
there is europe

399
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:27,390
which is apparently very fugitive
massive Europe today

400
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:31,039
you know what it would look like it
would kinda look like all the seats here

401
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,049
would be Germany

402
00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:36,200
and then over there would be Portugal

403
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,330
in the big grease France

404
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:44,659
Germany may hold it up but you think a
bit

405
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:48,799
many think it fit anyway especially in
smaller countries

406
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,900
as Europe the boundaries have gone
liquid

407
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:57,330
the structures have been determined not
just by geopolitical rearrangement

408
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:00,700
but I jheel political arrangement fueled
and

409
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:04,330
caused in part by the transformation

410
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:07,510
I've informational structures

411
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:11,289
energy in information is all there is

412
00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:15,559
and information is just energy that has
become self-conscious

413
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:19,730
or has a padded or form

414
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:24,470
and so what happens to security
professionals in such a movement

415
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:29,400
the convergence in enabling technology 0
I've intrusion

416
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,900
which is absolutely as I say
search-and-seizure have gone by the way

417
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:39,179
they had to because the information
begins here and ends there and it's

418
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:43,029
transmitted back and forth through all
sorts of apparatus

419
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:46,690
but you can see it's American data or

420
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:51,970
German data you can try to tag it but it
just doesn't work because the technology

421
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:52,460
itself

422
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,830
mitigates against being able to isolate

423
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:00,679
and structure things as they were
structured before when nation-states

424
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:04,500
where primary means of organizing our
economic life

425
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:09,850
they're not there are met a national
structures not transnational

426
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:13,100
not with their origin in bonn or Berlin
or

427
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:17,140
Frankford but like Lando Calrissian
SkyCity

428
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:20,779
they float above the earth and they
operate in the earth

429
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:24,210
but their point of reference is
themselves their oligarchic

430
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:29,669
their met a national and the nation
states are maintained as the functional

431
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:30,520
units

432
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:35,570
dick still do important things but in
terms of the decisions that are made to

433
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,460
determine what happens to you and me in
our lives

434
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:42,580
that is not necessarily where political
action takes place

435
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,929
this is why there's so much confusion
United States we have a very insular

436
00:27:45,929 --> 00:27:47,929
narrative going on

437
00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:51,010
as if we are the masters of our own
destiny

438
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:55,220
instead of a participant in a world we
no longer control

439
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:59,270
if ever you we did cell

440
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:02,720
enabling technologies intrusion
interception

441
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,230
combined with the sensible urgency about
the counterterror

442
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:12,039
terror comparative and a clear mandate
that came down from our leaders

443
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:16,990
to do everything possible to defeat an
amorphous non-state entity

444
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:21,750
defined by behaviors rather than
boundaries or borders or even a clear

445
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:26,429
ideological allegiance this is created
in our minister but invisible and

446
00:28:26,429 --> 00:28:29,000
seemingly inevitable said conditions

447
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,200
that undermine our previous cornerstones
have laws and ethics and even religious

448
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,360
traditions

449
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,399
therefore security professionals

450
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:41,020
exercise an implicit not explicit but

451
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:46,940
implicit thought leadership by virtue of
creating the structures of safety

452
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:50,450
that bind inform society and
civilization

453
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:54,640
your real charge is not to defend and
protect the nation

454
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,620
which is how someone in the states might
have thought of it when they went into

455
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,049
it

456
00:28:58,049 --> 00:29:01,549
but to stabilize a world that is always
on the verge

457
00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:05,330
are threatening to become chaotic you
are thermostats

458
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:08,760
in the global homie este sis

459
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:13,429
that is designed to function like the
intelligence community itself

460
00:29:13,429 --> 00:29:19,730
in the trenches word exchanges data that
cannot be limited to national origin

461
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:23,200
to maintain a certain rough equilibrium
in the world

462
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,230
what is the ultimate goal apps security

463
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:31,320
it is to tell people with hope

464
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:35,880
as well as assurance that the world in
which you wake up tomorrow

465
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:41,350
will be recognizably pretty much like
the world in which you went to sleep

466
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:45,090
that is the goal security to maintain
relative stability

467
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:48,830
and yet we think a bit so often isn't us
verses them

468
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:52,649
as good versus bad as the other guys
that were fighting

469
00:29:52,649 --> 00:29:56,179
but who is the enemy well let's take a
look at who the enemy is

470
00:29:56,179 --> 00:30:00,559
and see if we can define with the enemy
is with a little more precision

471
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,880
I said that in 1947 we created the
National Security Council

472
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,440
and a national security state in america
which has become a pattern very much for

473
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,929
much of the world

474
00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:14,409
you have your own there is secret world

475
00:30:14,409 --> 00:30:19,250
hidden world that operates in response
to the terrorist attacks

476
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:24,559
911 3500 people died

477
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,100
I don't make lighted that but I will
point out that that is small compared to

478
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,309
many other events

479
00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:34,260
well that secret world has become so
large so unwieldy

480
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:38,440
in so secretive that in America we no
longer know how much it costs

481
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,929
we don't know how many people it employs
we don't know how many programs really

482
00:30:42,929 --> 00:30:44,289
exist within it

483
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:48,240
and we do not know how many agencies do
all the same kinds of work

484
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,320
you know there are 1000 271 government
organizations

485
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,059
and 1,931 private companies

486
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:00,350
working on programs related to
counterterrorism

487
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:05,260
homeland security and intelligence and
they're in 10,000 locations across the

488
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,590
United States of America

489
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:11,370
there are 854 thousand people

490
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,820
that's about one and a half times the
number of people

491
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,250
live in Washington DC

492
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:23,980
the whole top secret security clearances
in washington in the surrounding area 33

493
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,640
building complexes for top secret
intelligence work

494
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,370
are under construction or had been
billed just since 9/11

495
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:37,269
many security intelligence agencies do
the same work

496
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:41,490
they create redundancy in waste 51
federal organizations and military

497
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,159
commands

498
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:48,039
operating in 15 US cities track the flow
of money to and from terrorist networks

499
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:52,630
analyst to make you some documents in
conversations obtained by foreign and

500
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,149
submit domestic spying

501
00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:58,919
publish 50,000 intelligence reports a
year

502
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:03,809
so many reports that many the must be
ignored because no one has the time

503
00:32:03,809 --> 00:32:07,429
to read them now

504
00:32:07,429 --> 00:32:11,610
I don't make light I've what people have
to

505
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:16,279
be dealing with when we do this work

506
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:20,769
pin we want to know everything in order
to control

507
00:32:20,769 --> 00:32:25,250
that's what cybernetics is is it not
control systems

508
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:28,610
that enable us turn the world into an
image

509
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:32,809
of technical control now

510
00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:36,039
I have to tell you also wanna the effect
this has had on me

511
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:39,700
i'd again I def done a lot of writing
and

512
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:43,399
if somebody asks a good question I get
my non-fiction book

513
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:46,840
islands and clickstream and

514
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,080
about eight or nine years ago a friend
at NSA said

515
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,890
you know all these things we discuss
with you you can't talk about them or

516
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:55,340
write about

517
00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:00,019
isn't the only way you can tell the
truth is through fiction

518
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:04,980
up so I start writing fiction so in the
last several years and published about

519
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,870
thirty five stories them now in the
middle of the novel

520
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:11,140
should be completed this year called
foam you know quantum

521
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:15,620
quantum foam adjacency unconscious and
it is to one another in a chance for

522
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,610
energy information among them

523
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:22,789
a simplistic concept anyway this came
out last year I have a few at least you

524
00:33:22,789 --> 00:33:23,519
can get this

525
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,529
electronically I was told to make this a
very soft pitch

526
00:33:26,529 --> 00:33:31,070
so you can get this electronically in
all the forms in which electronic text

527
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:33,260
is available at Amazon and all the rest
a bit

528
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:37,809
at half price but I have a few in print
if you want a signed copy

529
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:42,299
at a very very reasonable price it's
called mind games

530
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:46,789
in the first story in it cause zero-day
roswell it's about hackers

531
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:50,399
it's about spice it's about UFO's

532
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,570
it's about it's about consciousness

533
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:56,590
in states of consciousness it's about

534
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:00,970
non consentual realities is what it's
about

535
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:04,250
the first story I got a wonderful
response the mattered a lot to me and

536
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,059
another friend different guide an essay
called up he said

537
00:34:07,059 --> 00:34:10,659
this story is terrific he said I was
laughing my head off do you know ninety

538
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:13,609
five percent to this story is true

539
00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:18,679
but that he said but you have to know
which ninety-five percent

540
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:22,109
in order to have the key to the code

541
00:34:22,109 --> 00:34:27,010
so a I stringing together and try to
integrate my insights based on

542
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:30,200
conversations with multiple people
multiple situations

543
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,520
to put together this picture the amount
of money we spend in the United States

544
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,320
alone is just

545
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,419
astonishing on intelligence and military

546
00:34:39,419 --> 00:34:43,099
work it was about 25 to 29 per set

547
00:34:43,099 --> 00:34:47,050
a budgeted expenditures 38 to 44 percent

548
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:51,220
%uh estimated tax revenues United States
yet the recent conversation

549
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:55,659
about how to cut cut costs because we've
gotten so out of control

550
00:34:55,659 --> 00:35:00,540
up didn't involved that sector in which
almost all love our spending

551
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:05,079
almost have it takes place it is so big
I remember a conversation we have it

552
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:08,200
wonderful guy named Bob attitude
recently died

553
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,920
did wonderful work for years and
security intelligence need

554
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,130
and somebody said to bring conversation
hi again I know who you are you're a spy

555
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:21,010
and he said no no spies work for me

556
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:27,060
spies work for me you cannot separate
security and intelligence from this vast

557
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,339
dark cave in which it takes place

558
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:33,359
the world have gray and black operations
military and intelligence work

559
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,390
it is a world within the world its
funding

560
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:39,410
its operations and its lack of
accountability

561
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:42,660
are endless it's just what cell

562
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,070
and yet it profoundly affects and funds

563
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:50,050
and is the source is so much about
thinking because the platform itself

564
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,869
came under that world

565
00:35:51,869 --> 00:35:54,890
as did the subsequent decision to say

566
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:59,640
have to the platform was developed we
need to make it secure

567
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,270
okay let's go to information security
now and see what it is

568
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:07,880
in fact we do here's a quote I hang out
with people who have insights

569
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,530
I myself know almost nothing this is
this is

570
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:16,060
I mean I'm telling you the truth now I
have no skills

571
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:21,829
this is why I speak its my brother once
said to me kindly he said

572
00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:25,300
your mind me the catfish catfish is

573
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:29,690
catfish big computer and I see why do I
remind you the catfish she said because

574
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:32,130
a catfish is nine-tenths head

575
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:35,560
and its head is nine-tenths mouth

576
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,700
its

577
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,810
my brother

578
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:44,820
family can say they're right

579
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:48,630
are but I talk to people who know what
they're doing in all the quotes

580
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:53,700
anonymously will come from them in our
other informal conversations

581
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:58,780
about this work we deal with vendors
everyday with our vendor security review

582
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,790
service

583
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:03,880
1 a.m. said: the way it works is a
vendor's brought to a Spain enterprises

584
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,099
lacing code

585
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:08,540
licensing coaching the vendor
two-pointer non-eu since offer their

586
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,579
building or bundle

587
00:37:09,579 --> 00:37:13,540
we analyze their code there is
resistance from the vendor to send their

588
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,430
code to us

589
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:19,980
ranges from this is a pain but I guess I
have to do it to make a sale

590
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:23,339
to I'm going to complain and drag my
feet to

591
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:26,750
no way and giving you my code I am the
Big Cheese

592
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:30,599
no third party is going to assess what
I'm right

593
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:33,820
when a vendor for where vendor falls
along the spectrum

594
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:39,300
parallels the economic leverage the
enterprise customer has over the vendor

595
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,800
if the enterprise is the size of
Barclays Ardell

596
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,680
and the vendors small the vendor
capitulate squiggly

597
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:51,140
if the vendor and customer the same size
there's more hemming and hawing but the

598
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:57,000
vendor gives in if the vendor is huge
and the customer is small

599
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,400
nothing is going to happen this is sort
of like the US not going along with

600
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,710
international treaties he said

601
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:08,470
they don't go along because they can get
away with it

602
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:12,300
why do you do it because we can

603
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,180
and yet we have created systems of such
complexity

604
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:19,410
that even define the interface out

605
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:22,480
application application application the
code

606
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,570
is literally impossible because inside
the systems are systems within systems

607
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:31,349
and the context the simplicity systems
as they say our economic

608
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:35,869
and political and social rather than
about the security

609
00:38:35,869 --> 00:38:41,730
we say we're doing a CIA friend said you
do not know what assumptions the system

610
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:43,089
is making

611
00:38:43,089 --> 00:38:46,849
what assumptions are implicit in the
architecture the system

612
00:38:46,849 --> 00:38:50,290
you cannot query the system about its
assumptions

613
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:56,260
UK queria to reveal its flaws or she
added its back doors

614
00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:00,800
the system is not self-aware what is the
system think it knows that it may not

615
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,490
know

616
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:06,670
people who build the systems do not
understand the principle

617
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:11,160
%uh or they do understand it and they
make you said

618
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:15,250
I have a friend hacker who was going to
do the right thing about disclosure and

619
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:15,970
announce

620
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:19,410
something flaw could then be fixed

621
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:23,890
and you got a phone call from someone to
say said an announcer

622
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:27,200
this so useful to us

623
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,650
just wait up

624
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:34,210
you use it are you don't know about it
the environment in which the logic is

625
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:34,960
running isn't

626
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,780
unknown from a security standpoint

627
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:43,000
this means the whole environment needs
to be audited to its not a good idea to

628
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,140
use new environments for security

629
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:49,119
critical code when PHP came out

630
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,400
people rushed to it because it was easy
to use

631
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,490
but look at all the problems that came
down the road you can not

632
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:59,079
use PHP and have security

633
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:02,670
period you can't do it

634
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:07,200
so who is the enemy where you're
beginning to see the enemy is %uh us

635
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,630
the enemy is the way we talk about doing
security what it is we think we're doing

636
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:13,390
when in fact in context

637
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:17,770
we may not be insuring security at all

638
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:22,089
at last year's Black Cat one of the joys
my life has been going to conferences

639
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:23,520
like this is where he ran

640
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,010
so much in I've been speaking at Def Con
for fifteen years now

641
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:31,380
which is some kinda record probably in a
long time friend

642
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,950
I've watched them change from hacker
handle two well-known person to do. dear

643
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:36,310
CIA or NSA its

644
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:39,890
wonderful watching the boys grow up

645
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:43,450
and I made that pitch years ago I said
for god sake you wanna hack

646
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:46,680
come inside hack your hearts out

647
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,829
in get cover to all the things you do is
a hacker

648
00:40:50,829 --> 00:40:54,170
the two-and-a-half quote us

649
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:57,170
and that's where the best and the
brightest are

650
00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:01,470
doing their work now so friend in mind I
were standing there looking at the

651
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:03,740
vendors you know what the vendor space
looks like

652
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:06,849
you been our essay or some other large
conference you see nothing but with the

653
00:41:06,849 --> 00:41:08,800
pond with the pan pizza pan booth

654
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,210
little chocolates little pencil cubes
gifts

655
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:15,230
and Booth bunny school or sitting there

656
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:18,420
action to send a piano a

657
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:23,260
to entice you into some security vendors

658
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:28,220
are anyway looking at all those vendors
spread out across this huge best base

659
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,970
and he says you know what

660
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:33,560
he said not wanna not one of them

661
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:38,089
any knows each one is not generalizing
from nothing

662
00:41:38,089 --> 00:41:43,170
he works inside he said not one of them
delivers and what they promise

663
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:46,650
and what they promise is to make an
enterprise safe

664
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:51,030
and they do not and they cannot do it

665
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:54,619
it cannot protect the enterprise

666
00:41:54,619 --> 00:41:58,180
we identify the threats that we can
fight

667
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:03,079
not the threats we cannot fight years
ago at computers freedom privacy Neal

668
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:04,109
Stephenson Road

669
00:42:04,109 --> 00:42:08,109
could to nama can't put a big pile chart
on the

670
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:11,990
on the wall he said let's look at what
cavemen were afraid of

671
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:15,640
and the biggest parted were

672
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:20,880
like hyenas you know but there is
nothing for ice

673
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,339
there's nothing for bacteria eventually
what took the cavemen down a lot of them

674
00:42:25,339 --> 00:42:26,670
were bacteria

675
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:30,550
and ice but they were all worried about
hyannis

676
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:35,430
or saber tooth tigers because that's
what they knew and were frightened

677
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:39,530
so they built their defenses against
threats they thought they could fight

678
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:43,069
in feared the most in vietnam

679
00:42:43,069 --> 00:42:46,930
we developed extraordinary electronic
sensor networks

680
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:50,560
to determine how many kills their word
term what was happening

681
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,869
didn't take long for the counter
measures to use those against us

682
00:42:54,869 --> 00:42:58,650
and people are sitting in bunkers in
saigon totally up the number bodies that

683
00:42:58,650 --> 00:42:59,690
were killed

684
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:03,770
according to our mcnamara inspired
technological machinery

685
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:07,510
that we had implemented for the first
time in that new way

686
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:10,880
and somebody did notice and said you
know we have killed more people than

687
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,460
live

688
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:17,329
north vietnam we have killed more than
than there are

689
00:43:17,329 --> 00:43:20,700
in response to that was to tweak the
system

690
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:24,619
not to go into the field to find out how
they had game the system

691
00:43:24,619 --> 00:43:29,829
to make us think that things were
happening that were not happening

692
00:43:29,829 --> 00:43:34,670
so much can be distorted to the
manipulation of the data

693
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:37,810
that you think is so clear kept I
graffiti

694
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:43,150
said someone once upon a time is the
opiate have the naive

695
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:46,300
your Stevenson had a wonderful cartoon
ride

696
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:50,819
one big you know the picket fence looks
like well this is one picket

697
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:55,220
sticking up and it was called
cryptography

698
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:59,290
and there was a bird trying to figure
out how to get past

699
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:04,950
or peter noiman at SRI I was saying Iran
vest is a well-known photographer very

700
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:06,420
brilliant guy

701
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:11,140
up and vest was talking about the
cryptography for voting machines

702
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:14,480
and how good it was and peer join in
said

703
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,740
that may be but the whole system itself
is broken

704
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:22,160
and he said that's not my concern

705
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,010
my concern is getting the best crypto on
it that I can

706
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:30,670
as if the broken machinery and the
manipulation of elections in american

707
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:35,130
as if we needed a new way to do it a

708
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:40,339
was unimportant security vendors sell
solutions

709
00:44:40,339 --> 00:44:43,819
that address our fears real and
imaginary they sell tools

710
00:44:43,819 --> 00:44:48,250
they can do what they can do and they'd
can not do what they cannot do

711
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:51,619
anti-virus as you know stops maybe

712
00:44:51,619 --> 00:44:54,990
if it's good eighty percent course you
can only stop

713
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:59,390
things for which signatures have been
written which in those that are known

714
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:03,290
and not those that are unknown until
they become known

715
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:08,119
right make his security powerful
invisible

716
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:13,250
to the user is not the first impaired
quote from a friend I remember be blank

717
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:15,630
laughing at the ATM

718
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:19,400
and other embedded device code he was
looking at because it was so simple and

719
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,609
easy to exploit

720
00:45:22,609 --> 00:45:26,220
mine on expert opinion I would say the
cell phone stuff

721
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:30,400
is even easier and we saw that appear
yesterday

722
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,589
do not do anything important including
ordering milk

723
00:45:34,589 --> 00:45:38,750
and your smartphone do not

724
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:42,530
so a fellow at CIA said so is the
Internet of Things going to be a

725
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:43,710
repetition

726
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:47,790
1990 C code over again

727
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:51,720
and I'll say this in the blunt
vernacular with which was said to me

728
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:56,319
mobile device security implications
currently sec

729
00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:03,319
more blank in the abomination we call
mainstream software

730
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:07,880
so that's what we're up against so what
is the security professional do staring

731
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,170
into the abyss

732
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:12,300
there's an article came out just
February 23rd

733
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:17,480
very recent security pros may be ready
to crack

734
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:22,170
security pros may be ready to crack
under growing pressure security pros may

735
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:24,760
be ready to crack up

736
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,819
faced with an attack surface that seems
to be growing at an overwhelming rate

737
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:32,140
security professionals are beginning to
wonder whether their jobs are too much

738
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:33,819
for them

739
00:46:33,819 --> 00:46:36,980
your feel like that Wade

740
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:41,950
as you read this you can get it online
you reminded me up after her Russian

741
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:46,349
a doctor didn't know what happened to
people start showing up in his office

742
00:46:46,349 --> 00:46:50,640
in East are treating them as normally he
would said he really took one in

743
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,960
pretty see came out to 10 people and

744
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,920
treated the second when he came out two
hundred people on the look out the

745
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,030
window in there with

746
00:46:58,030 --> 00:47:02,589
hundreds coming streaming news office
burned beyond recognition

747
00:47:02,589 --> 00:47:05,859
and finally he was reduced to someone
just going from one person to another

748
00:47:05,859 --> 00:47:08,359
saying they're there

749
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:13,119
there there that's a security
professional for you

750
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:16,150
there there there there

751
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:21,220
good in this article there 2.28 million
information security professionals

752
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:24,670
worldwide and according to my

753
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:30,210
good buddy simple nomad if that's true
then every time I use the word security

754
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:31,099
professional

755
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:34,220
I'm gonna make air quotes

756
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:37,349
because so many of them can't do
security

757
00:47:37,349 --> 00:47:43,050
professionally you wanna say the problem
is to tell the truth

758
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:47,609
about this space one has 21 not be a
vendor

759
00:47:47,609 --> 00:47:52,240
in to be willing to spill the beans I'm
getting owned

760
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,940
there are very few people were willing
to get up and say I work security

761
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:01,390
my job is to prevent intrusions we get
owned a lot

762
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:04,970
so I can to fail at my job sometimes it
gets

763
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:10,670
really really bad and this is how I deal
with it

764
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:15,280
that's the truth that's the truth we
encountered

765
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,750
in airing our dirty laundry we reveal
defensive techniques

766
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:23,260
we have adapted that in many cases may
actually work at stopping summer the bad

767
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:24,770
guys for a while

768
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:28,180
but by speaking in those techniques
publicly you telling your enemies what

769
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:29,290
you doing

770
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:34,430
and how to adapt to have another sexy
aspect defense you can discuss

771
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:37,430
you do it in a way that makes you
vulnerable all over again by giving way

772
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:39,160
the keys to the kingdom

773
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,230
even when we do our jobs correctly
another friend said

774
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:46,099
we're still all going to get owned I
meant think about that

775
00:48:46,099 --> 00:48:50,250
this is worse than being a weatherman
our stock forecaster

776
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:54,640
the real challenge is getting business
leaders to accept that reality

777
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,960
and allow us to redirect funding needs
to programs that will help companies

778
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:04,069
deal with that reality attacks can be
simple

779
00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:07,740
a silver bullet develop a single guy

780
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:12,030
this makes them easy to describe but
defenses are multi-layered and have time

781
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:13,329
lines have years

782
00:49:13,329 --> 00:49:17,780
intake teams and people to implement
defense is boring

783
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:22,260
because we already know what to do you
know the rubrics to apply in layered

784
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,210
ways

785
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:26,760
in order to ensure as much defense as
you can possibly have it is not a

786
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,609
technology problem

787
00:49:28,609 --> 00:49:32,480
it is a business problem that is why one
of the focuses

788
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,829
should be to make application security
as cheap

789
00:49:35,829 --> 00:49:40,630
and consumable by the masses as possible
so we are held back by people

790
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:45,280
and processes not technical challenges
success is the result

791
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,390
thoroughness just doing it and doing it
and doing it

792
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:53,790
and not been particularly clever and
successes gradual

793
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:57,470
and continue over time not sporadic

794
00:49:57,470 --> 00:50:00,540
and a lucid

795
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:05,089
what is the reality we did sky did an
awful lot attesting

796
00:50:05,089 --> 00:50:09,950
well known but I want want namely he
showed me chart

797
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:13,000
covers all the top products

798
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,760
he said no to drop off rate have known
malware

799
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:20,890
as soon as even basic Packers are
introduced

800
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:26,369
tyson custom malware which is obviously
mainstream reality now

801
00:50:26,369 --> 00:50:30,059
ineffectiveness rapidly approaches 0
percent

802
00:50:30,059 --> 00:50:33,540
it's not a question on whether or not it
doesn't work well

803
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:37,790
it's a question of how poorly does it
work 10 percent

804
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:43,040
20 percent and is it worth any cost at
all we spend billions on software

805
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:48,569
in billions on managing it in we get a
false sense of security by using it

806
00:50:48,569 --> 00:50:52,020
and then were shocked when the world's
computing resources

807
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:55,099
are owned ten times over it is

808
00:50:55,099 --> 00:51:00,089
insanity how much louder he said do we
security InfoSec professionals need to

809
00:51:00,089 --> 00:51:01,170
yell

810
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:04,300
this is topic need to be a headline in
the wall street journal

811
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:09,309
for the new york times in order to
people finally did notice in wake up

812
00:51:09,309 --> 00:51:12,950
a lot of people he said especially the
non-technical leaders

813
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:16,280
aren't willing to ask the next round of
hard questions

814
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:20,280
because they haven't come to the
realization that we've currently got

815
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:23,660
is fundamentally broken I mean

816
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:28,160
he said there are folks out there who
are still trying to perfect

817
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:34,130
antivirus nigs mousetraps

818
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:37,880
why do I raise this he said because a
truly wonderful in can initiate

819
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:42,440
honest dialogue about fundamental change
without first acknowledging the need for

820
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,750
that dialogue

821
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:47,700
that is this stuff doesn't work end of
story

822
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:51,770
let's start the hard conversation about
real

823
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:55,980
change are inability to accurately
identify

824
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:59,599
and articulate and communicate
technology risks

825
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:02,680
kills us what is the cost

826
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:06,550
in Adobe Reader vulnerability about
which i think you're here later today

827
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:10,790
when they are used to steal your care
diagrams the result in knock off parts

828
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:13,730
being manufactured in China

829
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:17,970
and you do know they steal everything

830
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:22,609
every it's not just them when Michael
Hayden general heading former director

831
00:52:22,609 --> 00:52:24,210
CIA and NSA

832
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:29,640
did a survey to find out who is most
feared in cyberspace as the penetrator

833
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:33,390
and you think its usual suspects right
rumanians

834
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:37,300
the iranians the Chinese the israelis
russians

835
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:40,450
United States

836
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:43,920
and you know what he said that with some
pride

837
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,059
said there's some pride well that may be
in extreme Tea

838
00:52:48,059 --> 00:52:51,900
example but the conversation is to incur
my life

839
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,920
my friends insist executive

840
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:59,220
levels in this isn't new this isn't new

841
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:03,380
he was looking at are HD Gary and other
things that have taken place you know

842
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,390
the HD Gary incident

843
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:10,099
up hiring yourself out to do bad things
shocking

844
00:53:10,099 --> 00:53:15,170
he said these are things we know about
software security problems in all sorts

845
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:17,309
of goods and services check

846
00:53:17,309 --> 00:53:20,970
greater societal dependence on our
technologies check greater complexity

847
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:22,150
check

848
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:25,650
people selling 0 days to God knows who
for money

849
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:28,890
check professional development digital
weapons

850
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:32,329
check a black market economy in attacks

851
00:53:32,329 --> 00:53:36,720
check industrial espionage checked
leaked information target information

852
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:41,180
traded information check intelligence
agencies

853
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:44,540
that have growing capabilities all over
the world

854
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:47,970
check real-world ramifications

855
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:52,170
for all of the above that we have been
discussing among ourselves three years

856
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:57,140
check in other words the theoretical is
not even remotely theoretical it is all

857
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:59,040
practical now

858
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:03,079
in we've known this so we shouldn't be
shocked by the things

859
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:06,829
that happen as your day can happen to
anyone

860
00:54:06,829 --> 00:54:10,920
another said member T bob's quote you
can hack need to remember and probably

861
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,750
better that sorta thing the newer

862
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:18,890
it's impossible to write a secure
application PHB is a shed

863
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:23,309
deploying mod PHP is the internet
equivalent of a bikers sucked bumper

864
00:54:23,309 --> 00:54:25,040
sticker

865
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:28,599
at a bikers really as HB Gary

866
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:32,849
found out be

867
00:54:32,849 --> 00:54:36,510
and then you go to other people

868
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:40,859
a much much is one of my favorite guys
cease to be much

869
00:54:40,859 --> 00:54:44,859
now is pietrzak going he said a dark
projects for darpa information security

870
00:54:44,859 --> 00:54:46,119
is a wonderful

871
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:50,069
I'm used to be with the loft which no
mention yesterday the loft

872
00:54:50,069 --> 00:54:53,390
other guys in Boston get together kids
clubhouse

873
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:56,849
you know Patrik anything are but they
did

874
00:54:56,849 --> 00:55:00,920
important things in much is now doing
that any given talked recently I think

875
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,309
it was referred to you

876
00:55:02,309 --> 00:55:05,329
a its source I think it was

877
00:55:05,329 --> 00:55:09,690
and the justices security devices are
starting to decrease security

878
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:13,220
rather than increases friend in israel
pointed out to me

879
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:16,640
little piece and the black box more and
more people are simply putting security

880
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,760
appliances in their systems

881
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:22,970
which means the security the system
itself is inversely proportionate to the

882
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:23,359
number

883
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:27,920
appliances you ed because you have no
idea what is inside the black box:

884
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,500
or how it is interacting with the other
things that you've added to the

885
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,299
increasingly complex

886
00:55:32,299 --> 00:55:36,230
system and last month

887
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:40,829
lot of audits were done in more than
half both internal IT security and

888
00:55:40,829 --> 00:55:42,210
external auditors

889
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:46,839
said the company's failure had serious
deficiencies in security compliance

890
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:50,230
we make a joke at well check the
compliance box but

891
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:54,319
over half were not even doing that in
more than half say they're playing

892
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:55,720
encryption purely

893
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:59,490
for compliance reasons they don't
necessarily understand how to use it

894
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:04,460
whereas I said implement it the
complexity is mindboggling

895
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:07,680
and at the top level the cloud director
I mean

896
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,770
is it's a friend who wrote to me
recently said I just proof read a new

897
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:12,430
use next booklet

898
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:15,990
by VMware engineers about the cloud
offerings

899
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:21,359
the complexity is mindboggling there are
so many interlocking components

900
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:24,619
at the top levels the car director
borders the V spare

901
00:56:24,619 --> 00:56:28,750
for the engineers described which the
engineers described as

902
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:35,750
requiring three million man hours to
design and build

903
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:40,460
maybe it's possible to get ahead in
these things but you have to think

904
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,299
outside the box

905
00:56:42,299 --> 00:56:46,089
you cannot think within the narrative
that we customarily employed to talk

906
00:56:46,089 --> 00:56:47,640
about our work

907
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:51,920
and get the work itself done it's a
paradox

908
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:56,589
you require serious investment in people
who have a clue

909
00:56:56,589 --> 00:57:00,109
season experienced security
professionals

910
00:57:00,109 --> 00:57:04,510
I that critical key component in all
effective security systems what does it

911
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:05,480
look like I wasn't

912
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:08,619
leading analysts to talk and I was at
the knockin

913
00:57:08,619 --> 00:57:11,760
and the guy who runs it very
idiosyncratic

914
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,299
I won't talk about the disc into
software use but it wasn't when you

915
00:57:15,299 --> 00:57:18,859
think you would use but he knew exactly
how it worked

916
00:57:18,859 --> 00:57:22,130
we're standing over on this side people
are various computers and

917
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:27,460
says just a minute looks this week in
the screen I can even see any goes over

918
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:31,640
that's okay that's what it looks like
you know the system so

919
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,920
well good you detect anomalies

920
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:39,260
you become the filter that wiggles when
an anomaly shows up

921
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:42,700
you know what it means and you know what
it doesn't mean

922
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:45,920
unlike a an IDS system

923
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,770
otherwise we're in trouble in trouble
anyway but

924
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:54,579
Dane gear said I think you tell CIA's

925
00:57:54,579 --> 00:57:59,390
development program said financial world
has proven by demonstration that we

926
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:01,440
humans are abundantly capable

927
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:06,160
a building systems we can neither
understand nor control

928
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:10,329
the digital world is insisting and a
second round of proof

929
00:58:10,329 --> 00:58:13,609
just as the greatest enemy of our
personal health issue be could

930
00:58:13,609 --> 00:58:17,900
ubiquitous cheap food the greatest enemy
of our national health

931
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:24,660
is ubiquitous cheap interconnectivity

932
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:27,680
one more quote I see I've got about 10
minutes left

933
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:31,720
I don't frighten anybody but I do want
to get to a conclusion

934
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:36,010
because this at least a modicum hope but
we have to face

935
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:40,280
what we're up against her to do that
this comes from a good friend Brian snow

936
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:43,490
recently retired as a Senior Technical
Director Dennis a

937
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:46,540
he said we had a credit bubble in 2007

938
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:50,030
the road on credit derivatives an
instrument widely used

939
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:53,619
little-understood and even less analyzed
today

940
00:58:53,619 --> 00:58:56,920
talked about trust a lot yesterday brian
says we have a trust

941
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:02,010
bubble we have a trust bubble riding on
trusted certificates

942
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:05,160
signatures crib tiger feat and protocols

943
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:08,900
did in wrote the users in systems as
trusted

944
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:13,480
but human trust which we think we
understand is very limited

945
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:17,940
by context and capabilities

946
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:21,970
I I don't know if you get Brian's
presentation online but

947
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:25,619
is always worth listening to and he
cited then

948
00:59:25,619 --> 00:59:28,690
I but general Hayden

949
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:32,309
who raise this serious serious question

950
00:59:32,309 --> 00:59:36,089
about computer security is defense
possible

951
00:59:36,089 --> 00:59:39,799
at a recent conference he said it was
struck by this question

952
00:59:39,799 --> 00:59:42,910
would be more effective to deal with
recovery

953
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:48,299
in with prevention in other words is the
web's so skewed toward advantage for the

954
00:59:48,299 --> 00:59:49,210
attacker

955
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:52,680
deal we are reaching the point of
diminishing returns

956
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:56,000
for defending the network at the
perimeter or even beyond

957
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,280
and should now concentrate and how we
respond to and recover from

958
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:04,190
inevitable penetrations in other words
if you know you're gonna miss quake and

959
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:04,780
tsunami

960
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:08,549
don't build a seawall this three feet
tall

961
01:00:08,549 --> 01:00:11,819
but focus on what you're going to do to
keep people alive after the way for

962
01:00:11,819 --> 01:00:14,720
seeds

963
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:18,589
the people I talk to inside when they
talk out of their anxiety

964
01:00:18,589 --> 01:00:22,700
are frightened because they know what
can come at us

965
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:26,579
and they know that power by virtue the
transformation infrastructure said given

966
01:00:26,579 --> 01:00:29,849
the ability to do what can come at us
too few

967
01:00:29,849 --> 01:00:33,579
in fewer people it is not take a
nation-state to launch an attack

968
01:00:33,579 --> 01:00:38,980
it some person decides the upside is
better than the downside is willing

969
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:41,960
to bring america to its knees and it
would be on its knees without

970
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,930
electricity including water

971
01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:47,869
and financial systems and other things
which is what s

972
01:00:47,869 --> 01:00:52,099
significant concerted well plan
strategically devised

973
01:00:52,099 --> 01:00:55,559
and well-executed cyberattack would
resulted

974
01:00:55,559 --> 01:00:58,660
and the people inside tell me and we
won't get back up from that

975
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:02,049
like in Japan in a week it'll take at
least

976
01:01:02,049 --> 01:01:05,210
30 days miss my son says release

977
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:09,220
three meals away from rioting in the
streets

978
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:13,490
we know it Brian sites this guy Sammy
said Johri

979
01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:16,910
up who made a presentation or congress

980
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:20,790
and he said US is vulnerable to a
strategically crippling Cybertech

981
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:25,349
from nations stay classy adversaries it
controls are real world critical assets

982
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:27,280
is legitimate part over territory

983
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,450
we must now provide for the common
defense that

984
01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:34,920
enterprise that was 2007 I think this is
two thousand

985
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:40,609
11 and all this takes place in a world
in which we use the word security as if

986
01:01:40,609 --> 01:01:43,040
we are all the good guys

987
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:48,290
Emile Durkheim great sociologist what's
pointed out the criminality is essential

988
01:01:48,290 --> 01:01:51,770
to society that emerges in response to

989
01:01:51,770 --> 01:01:55,380
niches that must be filled and then is
factored in an integrated into society

990
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:56,650
as a whole

991
01:01:56,650 --> 01:02:00,079
a lot of things that I grew up with that
were illegal are now

992
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:04,799
legal I wish to have a thing called
numbers part policy racket

993
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:09,839
numbers was called Chicago now it's
called the lottery

994
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:13,500
we stand illegal games gambling parlors
overtown Chicago

995
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:17,970
had to know somebody to get in so
another called casinos

996
01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:22,920
and and and they're everywhere now you
making advances here in New Zealand walk

997
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:23,970
past lotsa

998
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:27,480
houses a prostitution that's legal drugs
illegal

999
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:31,270
grisly family were getting marijuana in
a hundred fence because we can tax it

1000
01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:33,260
pretty soon would be texting cocaine

1001
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:38,500
heroin unfair means all the other things

1002
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:42,180
increasingly integrate and subsumed
things were dealing with so many things

1003
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:43,760
week Norris

1004
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,180
who is one of the leaders in information
security is an industry

1005
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:50,309
the tells you what's critical to do the
financial

1006
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:53,539
services industry banking banking

1007
01:02:53,539 --> 01:02:57,520
global banking is you in the lead

1008
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:01,359
after 9/11 that was one other a direct
talks with MFS I sex

1009
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:04,940
the financial services sector just a
month after 9/11

1010
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:08,450
stashed a rocky who is at Morgan Stanley
which existed then

1011
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:12,579
said you know urgency as a half-life
ninety days

1012
01:03:12,579 --> 01:03:17,020
every three months ago is down in our
willingness to do what we now see in the

1013
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:19,809
urgency the trauma is necessary

1014
01:03:19,809 --> 01:03:23,630
that too goes down but he was working
for banks that were creating massive

1015
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:27,420
in security in the world see this is the
paradox this is why I encourage you to

1016
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:29,250
keep the bigger picture in mind

1017
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:32,799
who are we defending and who is the
enemy

1018
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:36,299
3500 people were killed on 9/11 that's
not good

1019
01:03:36,299 --> 01:03:39,789
over 35,000 have died in the cartel wars

1020
01:03:39,789 --> 01:03:44,039
coming into Mexico over the drugs and
who laundered the money

1021
01:03:44,039 --> 01:03:49,150
for the Mexican cartels Wells Fargo on
the biggest banks recently paid $280

1022
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:50,410
million dollar fine

1023
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:54,359
for laundering $350 billion dollars in
drug cartel money

1024
01:03:54,359 --> 01:03:57,440
they're not alone all of the global
banks do it

1025
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:01,569
in the statistics a really daunting when
you look at bank American city back in a

1026
01:04:01,569 --> 01:04:02,730
course it's not just

1027
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:07,349
those banks in Swiss bank UBS just pay
to find a billion dollars

1028
01:04:07,349 --> 01:04:12,160
suspect paid a fine Barclays paid a fine
Royal Bank of Scotland Iceland bent

1029
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:16,950
up in smoke all criminal enterprises

1030
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:21,359
all criminal enterprises creating as we
ought to know if you wanna know here how

1031
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:22,180
much

1032
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:26,250
many billions if you paid the bail
people out

1033
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:30,569
whose is whose the enemy who is the
enemy

1034
01:04:30,569 --> 01:04:34,440
in america a

1035
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,490
without this is a quote from a study

1036
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:41,819
5.5 trillion dollars flows into and out
of american

1037
01:04:41,819 --> 01:04:46,369
treasuries a wondered criminal and
corrupt money

1038
01:04:46,369 --> 01:04:51,650
why because quote with out the dirty
money the US economy

1039
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:55,569
are external accounts would be totally
unsustainable

1040
01:04:55,569 --> 01:04:59,930
living standards would plummet the
dollar would weaken

1041
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:03,490
the available investment and loan
capital would shrink

1042
01:05:03,490 --> 01:05:07,319
in washington would not be able to
sustain its global

1043
01:05:07,319 --> 01:05:10,819
Empire end of quote

1044
01:05:10,819 --> 01:05:14,650
in other words the money-laundering
business

1045
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:18,650
is not carried out on the side it's
carried out as part of the global

1046
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:20,430
financial system

1047
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:24,720
which then comes to us and says you must
develop secure ways

1048
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:28,049
doing these transactions so the
criminality does not

1049
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:31,150
hold in this force is upset up against

1050
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:35,140
very tough decision it's like the guy
who came to me once waited till everyone

1051
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:36,799
left in East why do with this

1052
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:42,599
ethical issue this is back a ways so
this is toward the end of the nineties

1053
01:05:42,599 --> 01:05:45,530
and he was with i mean to
counterintelligence and if they went to

1054
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:46,369
Haiti

1055
01:05:46,369 --> 01:05:50,829
with secret mission operational mission
to interrupt interdict a supply line for

1056
01:05:50,829 --> 01:05:54,039
cocaine coming the United States through
haiti in the nineties

1057
01:05:54,039 --> 01:05:57,349
and there's a lot of political chaos in
in Haiti da

1058
01:05:57,349 --> 01:06:01,010
so he was worried that their mission
wouldn't get accomplished in any hurry

1059
01:06:01,010 --> 01:06:03,289
to a close associate of the president

1060
01:06:03,289 --> 01:06:07,539
was coming down any felt really good cuz
he thought he was coming down to make

1061
01:06:07,539 --> 01:06:09,609
sure the mission got accomplished

1062
01:06:09,609 --> 01:06:12,660
and imagine his surprise when he found
out that he was coming down to make sure

1063
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:15,859
the spine stayed open

1064
01:06:15,859 --> 01:06:20,079
that the cocaine continued to move you
know let's stop lying to ourselves

1065
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:23,150
about what it is that is the nature

1066
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:27,369
the global economy it is our job as
security intelligence people

1067
01:06:27,369 --> 01:06:30,589
to sustain by maintaining as I said at
the beginning

1068
01:06:30,589 --> 01:06:35,349
rough equilibrium to be a thermostat to
provide some kind of stability is trans

1069
01:06:35,349 --> 01:06:36,079
Global

1070
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:39,910
it is made available it is beyond
national borders it is about making the

1071
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:41,920
world a relatively safe place

1072
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:46,200
in which to function and it would really
help if we begin by telling ourselves

1073
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:46,980
the truth

1074
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:51,079
as a security professionals I quoted are
begging us to do

1075
01:06:51,079 --> 01:06:55,720
so that we can begin to address the real
fundamental questions

1076
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:59,250
in order to make this happen in a way
that makes

1077
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:02,789
some kind of sense observe yourself

1078
01:07:02,789 --> 01:07:07,200
observe yourself in the act this comes
from a profiler NCAA she said this is

1079
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,980
what I've learned to do

1080
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:12,210
notice yourself jumping to conclusions
in thought

1081
01:07:12,210 --> 01:07:15,450
or word and once you see that same
weight

1082
01:07:15,450 --> 01:07:19,119
stop interrupt backtrack

1083
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:24,349
ask is this really true or is it just
seemed sure was it something we have

1084
01:07:24,349 --> 01:07:25,670
said so often

1085
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:29,490
we have all come to believe it so deeply
we don't even see that it's a belief

1086
01:07:29,490 --> 01:07:35,160
is it real is the only way to change the
paradigm to leave it

1087
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:39,890
in reconstruct something else hi left

1088
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:44,160
because I heard what I had said and I
reconstructed a new identity in a new

1089
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,819
life eighteen years ago

1090
01:07:45,819 --> 01:07:50,349
and I've never look back building on the
foundation not rejecting the building on

1091
01:07:50,349 --> 01:07:52,520
the foundation aid bill

1092
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:57,150
ask yourself how do you feel about
thinking that way what is it you were

1093
01:07:57,150 --> 01:07:58,140
saying

1094
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:02,260
stop from completing the loop too
quickly who are you to know that

1095
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:05,510
to think that without sufficient data

1096
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:09,849
who does not fit the pattern in other
words be mindful

1097
01:08:09,849 --> 01:08:13,039
in vigilant I see that it's done

1098
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:18,049
be mindful individual mindfulness means
as supremely conscious

1099
01:08:18,049 --> 01:08:22,210
as you dare 2b because what this work
confronts us with each day

1100
01:08:22,210 --> 01:08:26,960
is not what have we done or on whose
behalf if we done at the enemy is us but

1101
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,890
also the victory is ours

1102
01:08:28,890 --> 01:08:32,190
if we admit the yin yang the black and
white mixture

1103
01:08:32,190 --> 01:08:35,659
good and bad the overworld the
underworld the interpenetration up all

1104
01:08:35,659 --> 01:08:36,460
the things

1105
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:40,080
even those we say we conflict within and
wanted to feed

1106
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:43,730
and how much the impact on us the real
question

1107
01:08:43,730 --> 01:08:47,000
always to ask ourselves who are we

1108
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,380
who are you what are you doing

1109
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:54,569
you got the courage to be honest with
yourself and your colleagues in your

1110
01:08:54,569 --> 01:08:56,020
bosses

1111
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:59,549
in ways that somehow near me to keep
your job

1112
01:08:59,549 --> 01:09:03,150
not be outed as a whistleblower

1113
01:09:03,150 --> 01:09:06,620
in still move this enterprise toward
those goals

1114
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:09,819
which originally attractiveness to doing
this work

1115
01:09:09,819 --> 01:09:13,500
intelligence professional security
professionals doing this work for some

1116
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:15,370
in the right reasons as well

1117
01:09:15,370 --> 01:09:18,699
as all the other reasons we do things

1118
01:09:18,699 --> 01:09:22,850
just think about it when you encounter
different situations

1119
01:09:22,850 --> 01:09:26,440
in the weeks ahead thanks so much fears
time

1120
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:28,900
and attention privilege to be here
