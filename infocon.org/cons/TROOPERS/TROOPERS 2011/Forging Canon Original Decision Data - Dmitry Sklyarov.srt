1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,210
okay a.m.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,430
just to make sure that we are stay in
time a

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,920
would start our next talk I would like
to

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,110
introduce Dimitris from from soft

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:18,949
or Russian friends as we set a single
long-term relationship

6
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:23,330
relationship between soft you're in W
Islands

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,650
we talked to tells said at

8
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,160
another conference Baltz exhibition

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,300
almost exhibition about some stuff
that's

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,170
to troll a related to you 22

11
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:44,120
for the cover us and said sounds really
interesting for troopers conference

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,160
because as anatole his keynote other
devices

13
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:56,070
might be affected some kind of IT
security impacts

14
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,980
I think this talk very excellent example

15
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,549
that other devices a running some kind
of but it's a sense of

16
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:09,270
security problems too so commercial
let's start

17
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,670
show us what you can scan you take

18
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:17,750
thank you Michael my name is me just
clarify I am

19
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,189
blood tests information security secured
and the least

20
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:25,360
ElcomSoft Moscow by basis information
security company

21
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,119
an I will present you speech about
fortune can original decision data

22
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,360
for sterol what's

23
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,079
for what's all this about former

24
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:43,380
for the cameras use some optics some

25
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,079
few to story mansion it was not to use
it to

26
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:52,060
manipulate with images you need to spend
a lot of time to change some think

27
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,740
on pre and the modern technology use

28
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,259
digital images and the it's very easy to
make

29
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:02,920
editing called them and produce almost
any result you

30
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,909
like doesn't matter what actually was
shot

31
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:10,000
there is so kind of

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,360
Hawks published on the internet this

33
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,370
right feature about

34
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,370
shark attack helicopter a

35
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:23,300
it will slow hawk the about this picture
that if

36
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,490
one of than best for to Griffith

37
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:31,700
on the russian of National Geographic
Channel actual it will just composition

38
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,190
of two images to cook from

39
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:38,280
different photographers are from
different places from

40
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,500
some guy cool photographer

41
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,250
a lot of sharks and from some military
photographer

42
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,730
both though this image is available on
the internet so you could tool

43
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,270
find original one and the see that

44
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:57,010
their almost identical to result if you
mirch masala them

45
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,790
and in year 2002 kindan no one of the
leaders of

46
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,720
photography and digital photography
announce that

47
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,840
system for verifying originality of
images

48
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,760
souls that system was designed to
provide you

49
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,290
assurance that image was not manipulated
after it was

50
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,490
taken and that complex

51
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,530
consist of Kannan 1b F

52
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,710
camera were expensive camera from Canon
and

53
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:32,550
some modification device in year 2005
and December

54
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:37,260
I bought my first digital single-lens
reflex camera from Canon

55
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,730
colonialists us 350 and

56
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:45,120
actually at I will see worry help you
with that camera its

57
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,230
very good piece of hardware it's very
useful and I like it very much

58
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,960
almost the same time I discovered that

59
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,680
my camera doesn't support initial
certification feature because my camera

60
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,970
is not too expensive

61
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:02,020
to fall for that feature I'll

62
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:07,470
but do your Slater IA discovered that I
i upgraded my camera to

63
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,950
you lost so TD camera little bit

64
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:16,150
more high little technology and the

65
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,930
I was happy when I found that various
some

66
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,280
menu items that money played a

67
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,410
enabling or do they blink original
decision data embedding

68
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:31,350
in image and from that point I was able
to start my research

69
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,620
I am you to search like photography I
just merchants to

70
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,600
my my my whole disk together in

71
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,900
start Orton I almost everyday

72
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,450
modern digital from the left reflex
camera from Canon

73
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:52,750
support original decision data welcome
produced for a year 2007 support it

74
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,229
although not all model all every every

75
00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:03,229
the filler Connor to start my research I
just made several images from

76
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:10,750
my camera using original decision data
enabled and disabled and just comparison

77
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,000
condition was very close and I
discovered that its

78
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,970
actually only two big difference between
enabled and disabled original decision

79
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:19,570
data

80
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,150
probably you know that

81
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:28,300
depict file is take it filed soul you
need to start read it from the very

82
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,130
beginning

83
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:32,610
read first good find how much they do
faded

84
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,500
and process the data then passed a mixed
bag and so on and

85
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,040
after lofted the wreath information
those

86
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,910
image that paid them all image data
stored in faded

87
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,970
Paris a general general general as the
picture

88
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,070
for image and I find that in fact

89
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,820
the data the date this method eight
start within the

90
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,360
injected file by almost any modern
camera

91
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,940
inside exhibit was there is some pig
with information

92
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:08,880
gold upset of original decision data and

93
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,419
contains values that I've said from
beginning cause the final

94
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:16,630
to that actual record of original
decision data which

95
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:23,289
store after mine image original decision
data from my camera or swath

96
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:26,410
160 bytes and I start the allies it

97
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:30,110
I made several for both

98
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,479
to compare to roll down son discovered
that several

99
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:37,800
parcel for original decision data all
with the same their marketing dream

100
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,870
I'm I decided that

101
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,940
Phils more teeth just marker

102
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,140
ne think mending full-length

103
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,240
in inside it next there is a portion

104
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,330
of for original decision data version
number two number of

105
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:59,400
regions that covered by original
decision data

106
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,510
4 usual description descriptors reason
number

107
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:06,730
upset of for data is in file

108
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:10,710
and length the region but all other by

109
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,210
are looks like a random one and azeris

110
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:20,770
no easy way to find what's inside if you
see

111
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:24,410
at range of they cover almost whole

112
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:29,330
filed except X if are impatient back so
we fuel

113
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,500
use covering this position or in that
position

114
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,470
data could be read to the same but so
can remember

115
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:41,560
which position was do you think you'll
making a shot

116
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,130
and the faucet time that a little
mentioned earlier n

117
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,580
usual decision data are all

118
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,010
house or file if cover it with some

119
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:57,110
region regional 0e the

120
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,039
main image the

121
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,710
the picture and three other regions
covered

122
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,830
all information from start to file
before

123
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:09,909
main image just Inc excluding kirtu

124
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:13,550
areas that not cover it with a original

125
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,999
soul carries

126
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:20,909
journal Lancet the destruction seen a
patient of

127
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:24,080
original decision data you can see there
are two

128
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,610
unknown the earliest one of them its at

129
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,990
beginning official decision data and
second one

130
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:34,949
is related to region souls of all

131
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:38,760
that records and the

132
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,890
I was trying to guess what that

133
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:46,120
they too could be used for an what kind
of information that

134
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,260
holes about Frost

135
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,720
unknown value probably is a related to

136
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,589
the whole image while that information
related to

137
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:03,320
specific region what kind of information
bizarre

138
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,399
20 bytes what

139
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,699
kind of function product produce a
result of 20 bytes

140
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:13,769
say she won right its

141
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:16,910
worry commonly used that function but a

142
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:20,720
its kind of out invitations so let's
could not be

143
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,459
just output of shet because it's Noah

144
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:28,630
outfit health and education incited what
kinda function do know

145
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,440
basic on hash function that provide out
some vacation

146
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,209
a smack soul

147
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:40,990
there was my guess that the first one is

148
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:45,279
PhilStar known well in related news the
whole file all other is a record so

149
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,220
we'll see FHA basic

150
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,019
function that age Mac its most

151
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:54,860
common ideals no actually if

152
00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:00,110
more experience than gation because it's
normal for industry to such

153
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:03,260
such approach but

154
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:08,160
a having only even just so there was no
way to

155
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,709
get deeper soul you need to start
exploration

156
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:16,769
of camera itself I'm not

157
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:20,029
a specialist in carbon manipulation I
like this

158
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:23,140
device but I'm not sure that I'm

159
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:27,589
able to take it with oscilloscope or
something like that

160
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:31,230
but I'll try to do something is my
camera

161
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,350
what the problem of hiking feel my where

162
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,699
I'm walk into bindles I am

163
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:42,440
II belief and professional in reverse
engineering communal software

164
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,600
and not only Windows but softer from
operating system not from

165
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,190
some 100 device from in operating system
you could

166
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:54,390
round by ago debugger you have a lot of
tools

167
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:58,660
you could mate a lot of researches

168
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,490
with instrumentation you already
available for you the dollar the label

169
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:02,920
for you

170
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,000
but with camera you I don't know how to
fish the bag

171
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,470
debugger probably varies some way
available for Canon

172
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:15,079
engineers but not for me but

173
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:20,199
a fortune click analysts famous company
company and produce

174
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:23,980
a lot of cameras and many people who use
that cameras

175
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,220
much more professional income where

176
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,300
and the organize some community

177
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,000
cool cd key can and taken to the realtor
skied

178
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,449
it's available on the Internet it would
be the site

179
00:11:37,449 --> 00:11:40,890
and fight a lot of information about
Canon cameras

180
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:45,449
actually there mostly oriented on pocket
camera slung on

181
00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:50,310
milk cameras but a lot of information
you could find their

182
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:56,170
helpful for digital single-lens reflex
camera to you and I use that information

183
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,439
just think you need to do is

184
00:11:59,439 --> 00:12:02,860
get down of field where you need to

185
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,990
get information from the camera I don't
know

186
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:09,819
howls they get this approach but one of
best

187
00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:13,170
best idea of a scene and its

188
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:16,880
real implemented use Inc let indicator
on camera

189
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,149
to dump content of the camera the roads
are called I don't know how was a

190
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:25,300
find the way to around it called by they
find it

191
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,300
and there are runs the Colt

192
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,140
and the cold just bleak every beat of
content of your field where

193
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,350
and their receive that information

194
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:39,230
collected to just been a date and get
full dump of of my Maria

195
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:42,809
and it's great I found that day in
saddam

196
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:46,029
for 40 one

197
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:50,740
of cameras on the Internet and start
walking music actually

198
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:54,100
almost impossible to do nurses union
result he did

199
00:12:54,100 --> 00:13:00,800
assembler and the I need to mention it
because I like it very much too

200
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,970
soul almost all of my

201
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:07,370
not solve all of my a ideals

202
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,459
the becomes correct while

203
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:14,100
after jimmy tingle film where and the

204
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,569
actually boasts reports the poor known

205
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:21,290
I just H max from some data

206
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:25,370
under some key Harris how which mark
from

207
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,660
region complete reproduce

208
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,220
region data by Swiss and the five has
function

209
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,459
obtain some 16 bytes result repeated
four times

210
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:40,959
and the usage Marcus H A one function to
obtain

211
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,040
short for the region always the same

212
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,220
you for whole image but to be good

213
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:52,020
we get for region fascist from previous
step

214
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,470
merge them together get a game 34 by its

215
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,480
and around the same age might function

216
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,500
to obtain file ish mark but

217
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:06,179
there is still some age marquee

218
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:10,790
its Mikey secret lament soul all I'll
simplification is based it on

219
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:14,929
secrecy of that part of the scheme

220
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:18,970
a I E was able to extract

221
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,209
that key from my camera that

222
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:25,250
Kia be inside camera from

223
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:29,429
to up for skated parts implicated by
different ways in different cameras

224
00:14:29,429 --> 00:14:32,980
way sophistication are lolss but

225
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:37,079
still different from camera to camera
from model to model

226
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:40,120
I two parts merged together

227
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,779
and left 32 beats of resulting key and
replace it with body ID

228
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:49,010
buddy border idea of terrorists kind of
unique identifiable

229
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:56,010
that unique for every camera produced by
Kanye

230
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,339
soul what we have finally

231
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:04,600
new about each mark function and about

232
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,689
original decision data rush into by

233
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:10,990
implemented by can up all

234
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:14,490
camera solve the same mobile uses the
same key

235
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:17,589
so if you have ability to forge

236
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:21,360
signature form 1k meryl so TD

237
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,390
any other camera could be forged to

238
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,550
different camera models use different
keys

239
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:32,949
soul you need to have key for each model

240
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:36,949
and after that you'll be able to log
find to

241
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:40,199
Fourche to sign a images for

242
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:44,579
any camera

243
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:49,079
the main problem for for Canon and for
customer so for the technologists is

244
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:50,000
that

245
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,920
key could be extracted from the camera
the measles problem and

246
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,429
its I'll make all technology

247
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:03,769
useless later

248
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:07,510
I ask to one of my friends who own it

249
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:10,839
yours for 2d to make several shots with

250
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:14,630
original decision data enabled and
discovered that can on

251
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:18,390
modified the system original decision

252
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:21,500
version becomes number three

253
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,529
the it contains much more information

254
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:28,010
its more complicated not not

255
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:32,890
much more but its more complicated

256
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:36,069
and the I'll start

257
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:40,079
more concretely to

258
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,600
generally all image divided in

259
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,480
several parts forge a pic file again

260
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,039
mine image user comments

261
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:54,429
is another part check marks is subtle

262
00:16:54,429 --> 00:16:57,730
II don't know what's exactly some

263
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,740
can insult or call its check marks soul

264
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,860
I call it the same way probably contain
some information about flash

265
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,689
about mold flesh uses during making cup

266
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:13,000
shop a image thumbnail

267
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,869
youth and now the region and the all
other by its

268
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:20,319
except terrorists excluded from

269
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,589
from checking all other bites are
covered by

270
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:28,049
region number two original decision data
itself

271
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:32,000
is excluded from the check in before
because it's

272
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,460
scan check itself

273
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,710
generally a Regency decision a.m.
another

274
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,750
another idea releases in Dayton now

275
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,220

the file

276
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,480
if in bed inside the date

277
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,770
generally original decision data version
3

278
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:57,460
contains for a heater and from
information part

279
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:01,549
I hear their complaints my career she

00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:45,470
just way to represent areas the current

00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:51,950
32 bytes it's funny that full plan

322
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:56,400
if a settler only four bytes souls a
just

323
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,789
you some slow Colt to

324
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:05,679
made many bites from only 32 bits of
entropy

325
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,669
souls a was unable to in brief that

326
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:13,130
number of entropy and I don't know why
is the

327
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:17,590
took such approach for me stupid

328
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:21,029
and after the cash management with to

329
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:24,470
random value secretly again profit
through them the fire

330
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:29,490
has function and up don't result all

331
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:33,590
32 bytes am that by its with-profits
threes

332
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:37,000
each mark tool get final

333
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,900
signature will store it in my original
decision data

334
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:46,020
going from be forced to your operating
system dry also that use it in all

335
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:49,380
modern I cameras from Canon

336
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,610
there you've just officiate 2056 to

337
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:57,350
produce result and fault is not to use
it anymore

338
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:00,980
its steel G-rated still stored in
original decision data

339
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:05,490
but it doesn't use

340
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,000
federal else on salt values a

341
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,600
infrared cameras they obtained for a
week inevitable

342
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,840
some random number generator generator
and

343
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,140
the generator is seeded by value or name
it

344
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,659
shutter count its number of for

345
00:22:22,659 --> 00:22:25,860
times let me roar in camera fall down
and

346
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,940
up a gain so actually well

347
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:32,029
shoals lifetime of your

348
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:35,210
shutter or how long keel could use it

349
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:39,049
before its whole long teeth already use
its sole

350
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:42,659
if you buy a camera from some great and
the

351
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:46,169
you need to check how long did was use
it you could

352
00:22:46,169 --> 00:22:50,130
youth original decision data a and
involved

353
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:53,649
value felt the

354
00:22:53,649 --> 00:22:56,659
that store two fighters decision date
and fight

355
00:22:56,659 --> 00:23:00,710
how long that camera actually was used
how many shots was made

356
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:05,470
from me Helen doesn't provide official
way to get this information

357
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:09,899
so you can just look in fact camera for
Nikon cameras for example there is

358
00:23:09,899 --> 00:23:14,270
special value in a diff that store is
that

359
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:19,380
cut shutter count for Canon you couldn't
use our resources and data to find it

360
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:23,100
and the

361
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,130
several warts about obtaining a schmuck
key

362
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:32,190
you remember that 3 member so structure
a key ID more Stadium

363
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:35,840
he sold actually filth do you love them

364
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,250
never use it inside camera they just
Corbett

365
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:43,070
to unusual decision date: but very few
some

366
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:46,210
another well you def I that cold

367
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:50,080
keyboard ID if I'd believe

368
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,650
I'm almost sure that its cool obtained
from key ID abort ID by some

369
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,890
unknown function function unknown to me
its

370
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:01,440
obviously known to ken but cable tidy

371
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,520
you store it bizarre visiting the camera

372
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,930
its unique for each camera even if

373
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:11,370
cameras on the same model and the

374
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:15,480
its somehow based it on only this too
will use

375
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,650
because then emissions certified only

376
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:23,450
key ID and mortality is by saddam
unification device

377
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:26,980
and know me keyboard tidy

378
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,290
is

379
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:31,770
use that free from softer

380
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,160
but in hardware verification happens

381
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:40,400
are key idea and more tidy somehow
allows you to

382
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,710
obtain few more tidy and keep your tidy

383
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:48,490
merge it lists all to tell you this is

384
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:52,240
value is 4 bytes it's generated by the
same

385
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,440
person or on the label number a
generator

386
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,410
and its just to be made different

387
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:04,150
features from the same camera signed by
a different

388
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:08,440
key soul camera new keyboard tidy

389
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,940
camera generates some random felt where
you

390
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:16,340
and the nurtured his buddy a deal that
could be obtained from Salt

391
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,620
its kind of uniquely you as I said
earlier

392
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:23,720
and the that result Inc

393
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,679
when you process a 3some function based
on this issue 1

394
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,740
lists not not worry complex the just

395
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:34,550
use 160 beats function to obtain

396
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:38,260
256-bit result and finally a

397
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:41,700
we got each Markieff for specific image

398
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,190
and that keys to use it for all new on
41 the image

399
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:49,429
purists

400
00:25:49,429 --> 00:25:52,540
are some notes about violence or of

401
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:56,340
bore tidy keyboard idea and key aide JD

402
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,950
his life in Rancho 129 I believed that

403
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:03,830
uni 100 device that used to be difficult
to fire

404
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,919
original Chelsea man just they're just
nine Keith

405
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:09,940
and key ID is refered to one of them

406
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:14,190
abort ides like board AD

407
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:18,729
its just some 32 bits where you and the

408
00:26:18,729 --> 00:26:22,599
if you news it's fark Shin

409
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:27,950
on use the triplet key ID more tidy and
keyboard baby

410
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:31,460
you could just sign any image from any
camera

411
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:35,479
because verification software from 10
a.m. never

412
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:39,109
tries to make NMH of

413
00:26:39,109 --> 00:26:42,440
camera model: low ke aage

414
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,629
more tidy soul you could just see that

415
00:26:46,629 --> 00:26:49,749
my camera use more tidy and

416
00:26:49,749 --> 00:26:52,839
key ID 1&1 and

417
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:57,049
if you knew keyboard ID for that well
you'll see you could sign

418
00:26:57,049 --> 00:27:00,409
images for any camera using that key

419
00:27:00,409 --> 00:27:03,710
and again I

420
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:07,450
keyboard tidy could be extracted from
Cameron

421
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:11,549
soul if you extract them you could sign

422
00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:16,629
any image from any camera using dry also
operating system

423
00:27:16,629 --> 00:27:22,559
successfully several warts modification
device

424
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:29,019
first also was introduce a the in
companion we'll see yours 1ds camera

425
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:33,499
looks like this and supporting the one
camera now it's discontinued

426
00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:36,659
a successor or was

427
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:41,609
Devika e2 introduced in 2004

428
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:45,559
support all camera base at

429
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:49,479
on trial several

430
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:53,339
or use it the original decision data
version 2

431
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:58,019
like can a lil city and now we
discontinued to

432
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:02,210
the most modern device

433
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:06,190
introduce it into south and Salem
securities its

434
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:10,070
very small piece of harder actually a

we r ElcomSoft by cheaper for 500 a

449
00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:09,169
but to any weights it I believe it's
expensive and Harris

key ID from the camera and now I could

481
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,120
use that value to sign he mentions and

482
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,250
Alliance marketing dream in in Hillel

483
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:13,220
I have for a teaser images from the
camera and could see

484
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:17,590
which will you use their all I have
excess

485
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:21,880
to update few prayerful that cameras and
extract

486
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,130
key idea extract cash million from

487
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:28,429
from fish Russian from update

488
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:32,750
and assuras Smallz you worry about

489
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:37,809
what technology front camera

490
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:42,730
really represents to people who

491
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:46,160
intended to use it a application

492
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:50,660
forces technologies police force
insurance company

493
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:56,720
and anything where each is significant
soul will just be sure of some man

494
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,050
but some evidence but if you re

495
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:05,380
if we can don't cameras memory

496
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:09,370
we can we Chem modify

497
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:12,559
feel well and Ron our Colt on

498
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,780
cameras process so we can we can extract
secret key

499
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,790
we can calculate original decision
Russian

500
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:23,720
to for cameras that we care keys

501
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,770
so TD 20d and 5d

502
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:31,970
and we can calculate original decision
data officials 3

503
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:35,140
for any version 3 camera use Inc

504
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:38,950
ended triplet of Ikea deport idea
keyboard baby

505
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:42,240
we can't gr8

506
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,740
unusual decision data for 1d cameras

507
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:51,120
motion to musicians and a devotion to
because we don't have a key

508
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,750
if you will have camera we will have
chance to extract the key and a game

509
00:32:55,750 --> 00:33:00,660
generate signature a.m.

510
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:03,660
for now all I don't more

511
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,200
know how to calculate keyboard ID from

512
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,000
randomly choosing key ID and more tidy

513
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,160
its inside smart car bring level have

514
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:19,080
some time to experiment with smart cop
track to discover that function

515
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,780
I'm almost sure that is based on sha1
algorithms because

516
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:26,530
that elegant implemented inside came
inside that smart card

517
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:32,090
and the vets

518
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:38,990
almost all that we can't do what on my
opinion can

519
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:42,929
good try to do Reese this technology

520
00:33:42,929 --> 00:33:46,470
be this in camera says there is no way

521
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:50,040
to my exam labile for

522
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:54,530
provide authentication of images its
could be

523
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:58,000
forge it for sure soul who the

524
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:05,000
should save that there is no way to use
that camera for all simplification of

525
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,390
images

526
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:12,129
probably in future version of cameras
will see

527
00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:15,810
some cryptographic controllers that
don't expose a key

528
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:19,000
free one source does it not

529
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,350
official one so I couldn't rely on it

530
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:27,470
I get informations that modern cameras
already have such

531
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:32,230
cheap but the just doesn't use it at
full power

532
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:35,320
souls a user s cryptographic accelerator

533
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:39,330
to calculate hash function much faster
but doesn't use

534
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:42,859
its ability to secure a politically

535
00:34:42,859 --> 00:34:46,470
smoke but a anyway he

536
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:49,540
to actually protect

537
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:52,659
this technology is a should avoid

538
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:55,760
run Inc and buttery Colt in cameras

539
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,080
for any of existing cameras

540
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,700
its steel not prevent soul you could
modified

541
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:09,109
feel well uploaded in camera there is a
great project called magic lantern

542
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:12,370
lantern exists they'll start from

543
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:16,070
can on 5 DA belief and they just

544
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:19,520
developed way to extend functionality of
Canon cameras

545
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:24,510
you need once modify can feel wealthier
and after that you create

546
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:28,290
special would settle on your compact
flash card

547
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:32,520
and and you called as a buyer if I love
to exact beam

548
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:37,770
and the to know your camera & additional
software stocks and warps and

549
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:41,460
helps you to do something that

550
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,050
not available in basic fin whale from
Ken

551
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:48,440
until can improve when running

552
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:54,970
not can and cold it's almost impossible
to made this technology

553
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:58,140
become secure

554
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:03,260
and I believe that can and should hire
some people who really understand

555
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,150
security

556
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:07,640
to avoid stupid mistakes on

557
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:12,119
making such fetch

558
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:15,330
verification system and the we report

559
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:19,240
to cannot September 21 of your goal

560
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,590
we still have no response from CanAm we
Steve

561
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:27,030
have no official warts from canales up
to say

562
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:30,920
concede or that probably there'll be
some problem

563
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,060
they just don't answered us we report to
sort

564
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:39,030
soul the new the problem but

565
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,260
the the main fine the main

566
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,960
manifest from this research that

567
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:51,150
nobody should draft results

568
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:56,080
of our education process any image from
any Canon camera

569
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:01,130
could be forged soul signature is not
reliable

570
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:04,750
purists then the presentation

571
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:11,750
and the now war I could try to show you
how it works

572
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,509
purists of her friend CanAm

573
00:37:21,509 --> 00:37:24,900
that allows you to

574
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,949
verify your images to rally

575
00:37:28,949 --> 00:37:33,640
you need to have door and integration
process you need to have hard

576
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:39,009
soul stoner

577
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:42,769
actually just any to make a picture soul
just

578
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:47,049
nobody's wants to avoid

579
00:37:47,049 --> 00:37:51,979
featuring okie

580
00:37:51,979 --> 00:37:55,359
no just connect camera

581
00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:02,359
computer

582
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:19,170
here is all image

583
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:31,160
too slow

584
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:41,700
charities

585
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:48,700
and no I just show you

586
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,410
so it could be verified I

587
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:13,410
from and softer opens folder

588
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:21,470
select image sure if if verified button

589
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:24,680
brought to start it and harass you could
see

590
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,940
dream mark it means that

591
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:31,490
each consider it to be Google arm not
modify

592
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:35,500
I use hexadecimal editor

593
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:40,960
when if I just

594
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:47,960
date in the disease

595
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:59,900
open the speech a game verified it

596
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:03,940
you would see

597
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:07,589
that emissions broken no good

598
00:40:07,589 --> 00:40:11,579
no I just run

599
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:18,579
graphical editor

600
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:25,490
me it's very hard for me because

601
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:32,490
because I'm not a graphical man and I
don't have

602
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:38,200
his fault with me I just at some

603
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:45,200
text too much

604
00:41:03,089 --> 00:41:10,089
i'm saying it could was other name

605
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:30,750
trying to verify it

606
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:34,690
and curious he'll sign that

607
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:38,140
mean that image actually doesn't contain

608
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:41,550
information for unification are you
graphical editor

609
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:44,670
we she's not aware of verification at
all

610
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:48,119
solely just removed all information
about

611
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:51,369
signatures souls there is nothing to
verify

612
00:41:51,369 --> 00:41:58,369
and no I use my own program

613
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:09,220
produced signed image

614
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:42,660
and verified

615
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:49,660
it's a key that's all

616
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:02,240
so if you have any questions I'll try to
answer the board

617
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:09,810
stored image kept sick

618
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:13,190
there were two values aboard

619
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:16,360
ID actually bork bork they distort

620
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,700
somewhere inside camera I don't know
exactly where it is

621
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:23,020
Boise ID youth could beat for any image

622
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:26,340
soul any image contains body of camera

623
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:29,860
bort ID for modern camera for mine but
for new

624
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:33,030
newer one you've whole

625
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:37,510
is again if some were inside camera and
if you made short

626
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:41,460
with original decision data to end own
that value is Corp each

627
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:44,570
inside usual decision date: but it's not
using

628
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:49,300
to complete CAE key calculation
performed in five hundred unification

629
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:52,800
but completed key in the pool skated for
stored inside

630
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:59,800
each camera

631
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:12,079
so I have two questions first the other
camera vendors today have similar

632
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:12,939
technology

633
00:44:12,939 --> 00:44:16,249
actually I trying to find

634
00:44:16,249 --> 00:44:19,499
who have such technology and

635
00:44:19,499 --> 00:44:24,549
discover that you can have and they
produce a

636
00:44:24,549 --> 00:44:28,279
verification software its software-based
verification

637
00:44:28,279 --> 00:44:31,729
and the cameras that support the
technology

638
00:44:31,729 --> 00:44:35,199
are all expensive one starting from

639
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:40,349
one and a half thousand dollars known
she came and supported

640
00:44:40,349 --> 00:44:43,390
and another company who formerly half

641
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:47,039
such technology was at from have some

642
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:51,219
half for camera models that support
initial certification

643
00:44:51,219 --> 00:44:54,299
it was seven years ago all and I believe

644
00:44:54,299 --> 00:44:58,150
there is no way to find Naser such
camera small soft

645
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:01,499
in the second follow-up question is

646
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:05,309
are you where any prosecutions based
solely on

647
00:45:05,309 --> 00:45:08,799
photos using this type of technology

648
00:45:08,799 --> 00:45:14,700
I believe that solely on photo snow
prosecution called the

649
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,260
be performance soul forties additional

650
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,190
but

651
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:24,080
idea of using photos not only in courts

652
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:27,920
insurance company basically all

653
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:33,340
the records on Fort soul if you have car
accident and the

654
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:37,120
insurance guy come to you and make for
the so you're your car

655
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:41,860
a I'd I don't think that the youth
additional genital

656
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:45,170
but they could and the should not

657
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:49,370
used like maybe watermarking see I took
this photo so I should get the royalties

658
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:49,780
for

659
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,810
application to actually this is

660
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:57,950
not I never heard about to using kits
for

661
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:01,850
holding ownership was for the Fort very
much easier way

662
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:05,520
to to use a just-published little piece
of your

663
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,530
little over the news on your website and
its it's already yours

664
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:16,530
a.m.

665
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:25,470
swimming how you extracted the keys from
the camera for

666
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:28,900
sir TD for example I

667
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:32,290
reversible fumes where I find were

668
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:37,020
actually key processes it's never store
it in my

669
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:41,360
in in up on deprecated form

670
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,920
you need Flash so it's only in ROM

671
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,120
in inside in such way in in love and
affection from the memory

672
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:52,010
so I just modified gym where and

673
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:57,300
at buoyant were original decision data
should be written to file

674
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:00,310
I just changed one address and

675
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:03,500
instead of I'll name one register

676
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:06,650
and instead of original decision data

677
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:12,020
he was written to file and four on your
camera if you have full dump

678
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:15,280
off-camera you could use only

679
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,180
December to me find all algorithms and
you could just

680
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:23,240
deprecated manually and that was the for
for cameras

681
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:28,680
market was green Jimmy

682
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:33,280
its turkey excuse me the hard work it's
toward

683
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,090
hardware or caman

684
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:41,120
hard work either that

685
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:45,310
key what one version of keys stored here
in camera

686
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:48,830
enough k to form soul I believe

687
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:53,120
its somewhere here too but it smart card
is very hard to crack

688
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:57,140
it's very hard to extract key from me
but I could distracted from camp

689
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:01,160
and what was the question

690
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:04,520
me I'll I'll

691
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:08,790
for the US can you a camera it's so one
can

692
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:12,180
its 256 be and fault cameras

693
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:18,030
for this one its two-part of 128 sold 25
six a gain but last

694
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:22,210
32b are just dropped out and replace it
with

695
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:26,180
body so its strong but its improperly
failed

696
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:29,900
okay

697
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:33,840
its interesting topic more questions

698
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:40,840
this what this is a certain portion

699
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:53,070
verification device so it works for all
models

700
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:56,510
from very beginning for

701
00:48:56,510 --> 00:49:00,720
national one two and three but actually
a

702
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:06,070
to build verification you need sha1
function

703
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:09,130
because even no md5 calculations

704
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:11,600
involved

705
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,930
performed inside device on this issue 1

706
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:18,640
and you need hefty from that camera from

707
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:22,130
5d camera and you need algorithms of

708
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:25,770
for getting keyboard ID from

709
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:28,930
bort ID and key aide if you have that

710
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:32,270
Saints I could jump in all such car by
myself

711
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:36,170
it's not a big problem but key since I
didn't

712
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:43,170
very hard to extract no more questions

713
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,900
G thank you so much um

714
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:53,900
thank you very much for your attention
and thanks for

715
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:59,880
troopers for your interview WN for
Michael personally for inviting me to

716
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:00,590
this conference

717
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:07,590
thank you okay we have a one hour lunch
break now and continue

718
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:13,570
about 130 was an extract up
