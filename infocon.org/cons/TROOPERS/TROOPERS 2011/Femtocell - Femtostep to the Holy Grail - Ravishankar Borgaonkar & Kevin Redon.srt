1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,630
sites who already knows what attempt to
Solis some people

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,849
um to talk about let's say
next-generation

3
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:13,139
a more by networks so it's a very
interesting stuff

4
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,880
femtocells especially are part of

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,570
as part of hot um thats

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:24,300
also part of the research that stuns
Mona project

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,699
mentioned in the morning so let's see
what Kevin

8
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:31,900
you have to tell us about and from to
step into the Holy Grail

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,829
thanks for the weekend

10
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:39,620
so many misery Michalis caring so we

11
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,059
tell you how the next generation while
US

12
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:46,530
whale US's really secure

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,860
so almost all the guys you don't know
about exactly from to sell only five

14
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:52,660
percent

15
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,829
so we just do the introduction the
Fantasyland how you

16
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,710
whole people by mean many countries just
two brief introduction

17
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,960
I'll be able to bring device
step-by-step so

18
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,250
aboard the telecommunication history
actually tilly 1950

19
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,220
normal life we're just using simple
phone lines and everything

20
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,479
and after nineteen it to you got
something like Wenjie

21
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,580
to just stop talk on the phone or
something in 1990 when

22
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,420
we got to GSM or in Europe and it wasn't
so late

23
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,600
launch for a CD in maine usse don't use

24
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,710
any GSM kind of thing but somehow it was
broken

25
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,869
we already know how to use broken

26
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:38,530
flexion s why the introduce 2.5 is a

27
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,540
GPRS it's only for the detox can
actually

28
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,920
then day in bash 2g

29
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,360
his leg one's religion coating on the
security flaws and having

30
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,799
new features and increasing bandwidth
unit each unit from 2002

31
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,119
seen you don't generally we have %um TS
in CT images

32
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:59,570
2000 in USA and basically a putback

33
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,969
you have seen that evolution in the mood
lighting to nato from TG

34
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:06,159
then we have a 2.52 utility known as a

35
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,890
just EPA which has a higher bandwidth
you can download you can stream your

36
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,540
menu much faster using this technology
than we have 3.9

37
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,950
G it's generally defined as Lt lomax but
nowadays

38
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,760
on people are considering it be. just as
a 4G what exactly is not 4G so

39
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,569
Aten once is completely consider the 4G
on WiMAX to be called exactly

40
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:32,599
our and we should be next evolution in
this box and we'll really have seen or

41
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:35,750
only to the search is going on there are
some time to San switcher

42
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,750
which %uh with Ltee from to suit your
account bizarre collection

43
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,800
but we haven't girl but they are these
boxes are not in the market to know

44
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,349
so and for the GM

45
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:50,700
unified picture looks like so we really
knows

46
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,019
more while which we have already know
and the fish

47
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:57,040
I connected like on the building's you
see the

48
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,580
michael c are the more white-collar
which is tenderly call

49
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,670
Nordby nor visa Tom name in a tizzy

50
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:08,670
missed an election redefining as a No be
and we have a unique to confirm

51
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,970
along that side so this is kinda by you
see on the building or something

52
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:13,569
sexually

53
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:18,670
and behind that all the signaling and
connection goes to work call signaling

54
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,250
network

55
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,200
this lake issue thing for the package
through it and it is for the circus

56
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,069
which will call you a cop car outside

57
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:28,220
may not establish are you in the day
work this is

58
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,870
very very simplified picture because
this syndrome it's very very

59
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,530
complex and if I show you the bigger
picture looks like something like this

60
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:35,950
so

61
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,459
after this signaling system we have the

62
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:44,239
authentication system be a lot it in
manage issuing calling card Billings and

63
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:44,920
everything

64
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,959
anyone for the SMS gateway weekend

65
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:52,519
transfer which exhibition mister are

66
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,290
then coming to st. Michael sales so I
told you about like these are the

67
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,930
senseless evil nor be

68
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,980
usually close of issued size which was
seen in the

69
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:06,010
in the buildings we ship a life huge
which misapplied huge power 24 hours

70
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:06,769
exactly

71
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:09,840
slowly slowly we have seen this kind of
devices

72
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,810
used to size do it again on these
devices having to cloud

73
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,530
this to kilometer range again for this
device and you know it took limited

74
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:23,699
very good signals then then it comes
like these kind of US is very small

75
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:27,759
because says sexually and already have

76
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,780
and they're also becoming cheaper and
cheaper I think plays a this

77
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,009
these kinda do it is very expensive
that's why the and

78
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:37,520
it has to maintain the property
maintenance cost and you in the

79
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,580
manufacturing cost too much

80
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,310
for these books you can now it is
getting two thousand you can have do

81
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:46,259
those boxes you can also have a play
some open source tools on it and you can

82
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:46,720
have your

83
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,540
on GSM network practical difficult to
get you for me or maybe a

84
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,860
workplace exactly and recently

85
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,400
it's like here to two or three years ago
about two years ago

86
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,720
so commercially these boxes has been
launched me to call from process

87
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,410
which has very short-range Iskander

88
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:10,880
and last year you because company name
call you missus

89
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,850
the launch when one from person like to
fill US's which are called

90
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,479
actor said are and the other David

91
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,180
for iPhones if you know iPhone you can
buy these kind of fairness

92
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,400
so into you travel outside love your
country for

93
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,060
dromi and only thing are you you can buy
this at the silicon

94
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,770
connecting these devices to your laptop
in the hotel

95
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,270
and you can have your own network in the
hotel

96
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,060
like if you're going through and but
your network is from Germany

97
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,600
so you can have your a t-mobile in Italy
and can

98
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,740
have all the local call inside only
reporters room

99
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,580
so they're trying to read by these boxes
but we haven't seen in a commercialized

100
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,860
that any over that has lost his two
assistants but

101
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,080
also in February the recently launched a
new US is which are exactly

102
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,030
of decide actually which are called a
USP misprint disinflation

103
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,250
it's very very small size but we haven't
seen i've seen the morning in the

104
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,060
Mobile World Congress but we haven't
seen exactly how it works and

105
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,430
I could picture so orders from does it
exactly

106
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,069
so it's an access point basically you
can would you add

107
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:21,490
putting on in your home and you can
connect to a move by learn you can use

108
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,750
it as a completely

109
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,030
Norment said so it connects your mobile
phone to

110
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,960
3G network better there is also a
company called it is they who provide

111
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,660
to G finkelstien sexually but I don't
think so in your printer we have we

112
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,090
haven't seen any wine that

113
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:39,710
in your printer launching two different
a sense in the market so so far no VOC

114
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,199
know the

115
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,300
fenderson boxes which are computed 3G

116
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,970
so the Seas a box of word of foreign 10
percent

117
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,910
which is available in UK actually this
is

118
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,990
from person having depict much larger
size so this is definitely launch

119
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,440
heading in last year in last year in UK
actually

120
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,180
and this was a guest 2000 it for right

121
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,069
yeah two others injured native peoples
are not exactly

122
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:11,750
and there is no distinction that you can

123
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,949
you cannot connect anymore why did this
to our to defect

124
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:19,690
access point there is under to you
technology really will call you

125
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:23,050
%um a which is a 111 USA

126
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:26,400
in there don't you you more like an
extra parts for clay KY

127
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,949
my heart for 10 after that your
connection goes to the telecom signaling

128
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,490
telephone network actually but does
phone still in required to be have a

129
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,030
feature in nearby lake in the future
endeavors inside your phone

130
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,759
so the the restrictions for those kind
of technology retreat from the sale

131
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:44,340
you don't need to have any kind of
distinctions any to you

132
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,870
any phone which can support 3G you can
connect to this for sale

133
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:52,550
and it has a very less code is like less
than 20 me to see if you can if you name

134
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,240
it and you can use december sales and
Max

135
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,360
426 users who can't connect this from
person at a time

136
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,900
very low power devices is to install you
can just buy an

137
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,169
no need to do anything just by your
power supply internet given

138
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:09,580
that's it and its technical invisible
Nordby this

139
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,240
30 GB standard me originally some
companies

140
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,930
lawyer tell you to do from to sail
access point

141
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,819
AP or just something to sell

142
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:24,080
so under the event is actually for user

143
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,479
basically by company or widest invention
has been occurred because

144
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,089
most of the time users Steve at a home
sector working

145
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:35,159
it goes inside your company for 16 hours
most of the time

146
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,700
to stay inside the home and when you
stay inside the home you don't need to

147
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,080
reconnect to the moonlight towers

148
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,390
so for the operator it has been good if
deployed with these boxes and you

149
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,160
connect

150
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,550
who this box is a beautiful you can be
of Lord from their tower

151
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:53,519
so they can Inc disk every city of
torreón on the users can

152
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,060
lovin dat been the art form they can
connect to this blog so they can

153
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,269
included a duck every 15 much larger we
actually

154
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:03,529
and without and reducing the price

155
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:07,680
and deployed very high-bandwidth can
provide location-based services

156
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,589
really there are two or three companies
which are trying to develop some

157
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:12,290
applications miss on

158
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:16,140
10 percent like a App Store kind of
thing to their applications like if you

159
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,399
buy this from to sell the commercial
some companies are commercializing and

160
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,870
advertising like this issue by this from
personal

161
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:25,980
you can ask you can Aguilera it
children's number or your wife number to

162
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,459
this from personal and when you are at
the office

163
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:31,720
and fewer if your wife came at four

164
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,050
you recommending it SMS from from the
sale to move my leg

165
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:38,910
life isn't for me or your children is at
home so they try to come which led this

166
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:39,529
from Brazil

167
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:42,740
adding new applications like this but
some people's

168
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:46,830
still debate okay wifi is much better
than using from person at home but there

169
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:47,580
are some

170
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,300
only debate over this issue Kate can
drain your battery alarm

171
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,740
or something other end is actually

172
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,920
and and wonders for over to elicit
extended commission of course

173
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,970
you should really get really good
connection on your formal way phone and

174
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:02,300
men

175
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,920
if the user is using a much more
doubtful have caused again

176
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,380
generate more revenue if you are using
more data then

177
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,850
of course traffic of love that's why
they introduce products to

178
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,750
offload the traffic of current sales &
increase the

179
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,100
did become a city there and there is no
solution cost

180
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:25,209
in this products like are before this
device something 100

181
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:30,430
you actually burden US AT&T alluded you
these boxes computer you feel you can

182
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,450
just go and you can say I don't have any
code is at my home

183
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,680
the resale getting this boxing so
durable many

184
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,709
full code is you don't need to switch
topics busy

185
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:43,560
UN in Japan soft bank also provide these
boxes completely free

186
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,690
so price on this device is very low so
they don't need to

187
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,930
so there is no cost to produce these two
actually no maintenance courses so

188
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,610
because these devices can be configured

189
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:57,579
remotely and which new maps big
engendered some new revenues

190
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:00,820
by reducing the cost us and these boxes
have back pain

191
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,640
I reconnect with the rich now it is
although burger lows

192
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,279
the love very much if you can activity
so so did abortion iti

193
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,990
over okay so it's a vote says so why we

194
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:18,089
taken this topic to research actually
seen classical me

195
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:21,430
we don't have any actually students
sales stupid

196
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,970
so what the security there which kinda
for

197
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,060
encryption on my own also many

198
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,380
secular yes interested and not

199
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,399
all phones sure that mean you make the
call not all fun show you that

200
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,970
your college in 15 there are few months
would show you that when you make a call

201
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,529
some similar percent its display that
you for your call is in Clifton

202
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:48,000
but all on phone doesn't have any
security so we

203
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,070
was so we think I've okay let's this
time

204
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:55,029
tried to research some try to do some
research on this box is because

205
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:58,200
this time we have access so these

206
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,769
two things are combine in a sealed box
no so again

207
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:05,709
played on this box NC what kind of
things are protocol a message

208
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:10,589
exchange to urge the click on site so
we'd world that's why we try to

209
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:13,680
research in through an

210
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,120
so that's our frontal hockey pictures I
will explain what are the parts

211
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,950
so basically you buy you said inside the
home this is a while in waco connected

212
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,170
to spend for sale

213
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,470
radically from here you for a while you
were

214
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,940
internet connection or any broadband
connection issue beautiful

215
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,470
from here connection goes to copper
decide which is in

216
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:38,000
inside the network and this line goes to
360 nobody can

217
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,560
insolvent take what back if i going
inside for the communication between

218
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,149
operated and %um fenderson box which is
that cool

219
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:48,269
it's completely in 15 so nobody could
succeed

220
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:51,519
after that condition was to secure to
get rid of course Mitch

221
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,279
filter on the traffic only allows the
package which are coming from this box

222
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:59,860
once the package from a lower I V six
package

223
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,860
role of security gateway to divert on
Packard Stewart

224
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,990
it's gone action be gateway which has
all the 532

225
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:11,570
indicate these boxes the box this will
not indicated by a pitch in to give me

226
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:12,370
an

227
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:17,420
it will pass all the traffic and I were
to work the classical so this fight is

228
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,750
completely a classical

229
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:23,670
telephone signaling system traffic goes
to Missy Odysseus in or after this

230
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:27,160
it a lot and on the tele Columbus OH
civic

231
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,250
are but they also have a kind of
sandwiches for the authentication

232
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,029
purposes only

233
00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:37,010
so they cannot indicate users are
connected different person by using

234
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,000
directly having us different so in which

235
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,120
for that indication on this homework and
your five it a lot

236
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,120
it's a lot easier classical your home
location register amid

237
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,180
all you information of SIM card
installed executive so when you try to

238
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:49,790
make call

239
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:53,389
all you ever Simba information has to be
very fine art indicated

240
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:58,079
it a lot 100 this frontal says

241
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,250
so and the moment we're from researched
you can have this from personal

242
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,459
in different countries tests in trail

243
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:10,040
having everyone from different operator
18 of a destroyed this punctured and the

244
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,449
moment and many openers

245
00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:16,050
during development stage many our a
dirty trying you in the LT development

246
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,380
is tinsel

247
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,829
a its or okay

248
00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:24,449
but at the moment on the open sea if you
buy from the sale

249
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:27,829
you're going to take a SIM card which is
really be that visually design

250
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:31,589
anything up you know okay so when we buy
from Brazil we have a specific symptoms

251
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:32,680
weekend putting

252
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,889
more by Anne only that SIM card is
allowed to conduct this box is made from

253
00:14:35,889 --> 00:14:36,970
a breeder has

254
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:42,870
total freedom that any SIM card can
connect to this box

255
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:47,680
yeah and some operator freud completely
feel you are here to make a contract and

256
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,820
you have to pay per month for the
service

257
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,149
but as I told you earlier that some of
those employed completely free

258
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:57,350
again think it's completely free so just
go n tick a box n

259
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:01,670
try to do some research okay or so until
you some

260
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:06,389
things inside the box so the location
because it is important for this box

261
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:09,480
because in classical system if you guys
know

262
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,250
all over the country s your location
began tell you the exact location of you

263
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:17,269
from where are you making column from
which location you send SMS

264
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:20,510
and for the same reason they have to be
locked this fantasy to a particular

265
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,670
location

266
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,670
edition identify the location of this
box

267
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:28,529
anytime and writing or drawing is not
possible with this book selection

268
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:30,370
verification techniques plea

269
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:34,449
very important role here oh and of
course they don't want to you to take

270
00:15:34,449 --> 00:15:35,949
this box right to me

271
00:15:35,949 --> 00:15:39,899
outside of your country and have our
local send you always know their

272
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:43,380
you and your girlfriend or wife always
have a contract that you guys in

273
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,949
pollen on FB so when are you going
anywhere in the country will restock fee

274
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:48,199
so they don't like the picture

275
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:52,250
actually then so different you to make a
to avoid roaming calls

276
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,029
and OC that we have a problem with
although produce

277
00:15:56,029 --> 00:16:00,560
on their on pregnancy license see if I
think this for 25 plane

278
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,910
India so t-mobile doesn't have any kind
of

279
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:07,449
or Vodafone doesn't have any licensed
redistricting senior actually

280
00:16:07,449 --> 00:16:10,730
some lessons conflict even if they don't
want to be in this box

281
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:14,769
outside so that's why the heck did look
asian chick with the box isn't exactly

282
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:17,000
fun or

283
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,209
ansel location of you that is required
for lawful interception i'm italian

284
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:21,970
delivered lawful interception

285
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,300
actually soap holder if you take these
boxes okay

286
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,360
you might have guessed that okay should
connect your broadband connection to

287
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:28,920
these folks

288
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,350
of course the first thing first thing
comes SIPA press

289
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:35,440
based on IP address in the candidate
okay boxes is

290
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,440
even Germany maybe Otero Germany first
thing is very simple

291
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,089
is very easy to continue GPS meet the
standards is

292
00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:47,910
the standard Facebook should have it GPS
which is a up to operator

293
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:51,600
meetings begin at so far we have seen
all the conditions which are living in

294
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,160
Utah

295
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,529
they don't have any cheap if inside only
defenders in general Evelyn

296
00:16:56,529 --> 00:16:59,730
US has a dedicated

297
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,240
chip for G GPS really going to take the
GPS location

298
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,569
but GPS presents a problem that if you
are the inside the GPS signals are very

299
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:08,900
weak at home so

300
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,220
it's not reliable solution the tone is
very thick do best when do you live

301
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:17,390
is for the capturing the surrounding my
personal information

302
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:21,480
sales Sun Microsystems weren't exactly

303
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,309
so when you turn on this from the sale
it has achieved only cater to you

304
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:28,429
which scans surrounding to the entry
signals

305
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:31,650
from the surrounding so all the colors
outside of this building

306
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,720
always in week these three parameters

307
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,710
MCC MNC and look at native that some why
can't record

308
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,860
mobile network cord and location
airports all these

309
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,830
towered image this thing goes for this
box can capture these

310
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,950
T Bennett s and sent back to top it off
and wish

311
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:52,200
exactly in this country I am in

312
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,039
what on the surrounding operator fails
an ordinary love which in your field

313
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:59,289
and how it used to be so this
information and again miss on this

314
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:01,280
information they can

315
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,380
find out latitude and longitude and they
can exactly match for you are exactly

316
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,360
look at you okay this box is at the
moment displacing you in making

317
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:15,470
call using this box detective exactly

318
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,120
a so in short I can tell you don't do
something with this

319
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,780
metrics the first I tell you about I
feel it's very easy to use any proxy you

320
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,260
can use

321
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,390
open if you know something any tool to
just show you our

322
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:30,400
you are using the same I painted this
very easy tonight

323
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,570
very difficult to break a second thing
is

324
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:38,140
good get second thing is the 02

325
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,650
avoid GPS thing actually so the market
you get some kind of

326
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,860
journalists like this if you go in NE
China

327
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,580
side and if you try to buy these kinda
US issue getting

328
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:55,480
15 15 or 20 really cheap right actually
can get a GPS John when you can jump

329
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,070
John did you can signal in the same me
for the naming my crucial information

330
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:03,210
you get a 2g or 3G jammer

331
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,470
on the research website so just by the
generous

332
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:09,720
turn it on put me in the box it will
block

333
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,900
all the signals so this works remarks
can

334
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,770
any surrounding my personal information
three blocks he doesn't say anything at

335
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:17,250
all

336
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,390
back to the so and then or

337
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:24,360
third way like we have seen the

338
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,870
Nana BTS there actually in the sale he
will mission

339
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:31,890
these books cost 2000 something again
big box this weekend

340
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:36,530
image MNC NCC analytical so we can fix
the setting of my home

341
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,690
okay if you look at a table or something
i can reply to this country

342
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:44,200
box military the same convention
sequential k I'm on the same place

343
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,980
exactly

344
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:48,700
6 it's a easy to spot million

345
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,160
an for a research we need all the
research

346
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,160
inside the cage best like twister in one
min nobody can predict

347
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,419
what we doing militia something so week
before more all the experiments inside

348
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:03,610
cage and were able to pic all these

349
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:06,840
matters and use it from the sale in you
actually s

350
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,530
easy to succumb all those things so for
the next

351
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:13,570
apart hobey had the box

352
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:17,780
a wheelchair and what militias things we
see inside

353
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,260
my Collingwood you

354
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,710
temple sells they are meant to be cheap
and still at home and they're really

355
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:25,230
cheap

356
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:28,659
is a femtocell this the hardware a most
of the time

357
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:32,190
they have a CPU to internet connection

358
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,830
and FPGA it's not always an FPGA to be
he was an FPGA to

359
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:41,049
to have to encryption and so on on its a
nowadays it can be included in just a

360
00:20:41,049 --> 00:20:42,070
few itself

361
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:45,840
and it's very used and then something
cut all the episodes come with a SIM

362
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,010
card and a SIM card lake and a phone

363
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:53,740
is there to identified for sale liking
the phone you identified

364
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,900
on on the other side said antenna so
that Santana for them

365
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,130
for the treaty signal that the antenna
for the 2g signal and that's all the

366
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,830
ex-chief you see it it's shielded so

367
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,900
very very cheap hardware

368
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:13,110
is this year for some truths whole how
to test the security and Stu

369
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:16,590
like always on an embedded devices how
you test it you she's

370
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:20,159
scanned net network usage days web page

371
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,309
to withstand a network is only ports a
GOP

372
00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:27,070
the web-based to web interface but web
interface has some Christians

373
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:30,559
where you putting don't know the
credentials evander to

374
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,230
client operator does a noite least

375
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:38,240
socialite doesn't know it is a a web
page

376
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,610
on it's not interesting at all own 10
you look at the board itself

377
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:46,049
on older wats you have some J tackle
some cereal

378
00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:49,419
their issue also in it its nuclear the
CPU

379
00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:52,679
so we connected shield cable but we
don't know

380
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:56,419
login trumps it's locked in a long
trumps at the beginning it's a

381
00:21:56,419 --> 00:22:01,299
very secure so all the ports are blocked
web interface doesn't really in schools

382
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:05,710
on the on the boards to there's no
longer trauma and so on

383
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:09,030
but first impressions all the time not
very just

384
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:14,200
temple sells like I said very cheap so
they don't wanna send some

385
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,789
some opera saw some guy repairing the
femtocell if something is broken

386
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:21,820
only do it on Bing at Penn there some
special guys day

387
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,960
pay a lot of money for the maintenance
costs YouTube Partner

388
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,270
no maintenance cost you have recovery
procedure

389
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:31,280
in the recurrent procedure menu press it
is just

390
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,600
install the whole software just
factually software

391
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,840
than boots and critics operator

392
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,480
some small traits to get a real images
and

393
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,960
thats where we when we attack using the
recovery procedure

394
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,490
if this one is secured to step to
recovery procedure there's always a

395
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,179
button

396
00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:55,260
somewhere press three seconds the button
and recovery procedure starts

397
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:58,440
this is a somehow details as reform

398
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,850
procedure so at the beginning it start
some

399
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:06,340
some special channel who connects to
operates it gets the recovery procedure

400
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,140
itself so the recovery procedure

401
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,520
is not on the temple sale dirt on campus
eldest

402
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,450
just some some mitigation but recovery
procedure

403
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:19,520
any thoughts recovery procedure I at the
beginning it gets

404
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,039
paramita analyst these are two important
use it important because it uses

405
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:29,360
HTTPS on all the on almost all the other
parts getting the family and so on it

406
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,400
uses HTTP

407
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,669
here sheep yes permits and panelist the
permits least defines the

408
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:38,830
continuation of the femtocell whose to
operate so

409
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:43,830
I'll and other stuff will see a song and
then the finalists gets the finalist

410
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,900
checks each time where is to find ways
different like

411
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,799
if it's proving get the new fine where
and install its

412
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,080
all the time was our encrypt it and
assigned so

413
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,240
it's not very useful to look at the HTTP
traffic because

414
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,940
into you lol itself the use hashes you
don't know if it's

415
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,650
careful you don't know shit some route
recovery efforts

416
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:08,710
it some hash it inflicted it signs it in

417
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:12,400
execute a M and every time

418
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,289
measures it notifies the operator okay
not successfully flashed

419
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:19,330
this vision so long but

420
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:23,440
a lot of problems arise first when it
uses

421
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,289
term when it gets to recovery procedure
hits get it over HTTP

422
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:31,850
its also interested in science but if
you play with URL you get

423
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:35,700
unencrypted version it still thank you
cannot change it but it's untreated

424
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,409
in his own treated you can Res all the
recovery procedure and that's how we

425
00:24:40,409 --> 00:24:43,559
we may just a gram this one

426
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:48,620
just by looking the recovery procedure
program

427
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,130
so that's the the festival part second
one

428
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:56,000
hugg it doesn't use much authentication
only defense to sell

429
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,840
result in two key so used to create
instance on of the federal self

430
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,520
and speak connected to to we connect to
the server

431
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,770
to get a list ans in the same way

432
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:11,789
we can just phage this server and defend
the cell will not authenticate to serve

433
00:25:11,789 --> 00:25:12,820
so we can provide

434
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:17,610
any lists two lists are not signed they
only rely on its GPS

435
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:21,539
to be situated and thats that's how
that's the problem

436
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:24,650
again we have to list so

437
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:28,850
when we when we can't give the least we
can change a poem it is and we can

438
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:33,200
give all I'm a list where the famous ok
agents the signature and so on

439
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,960
so he we also faked her he will speak to
me

440
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,779
do Beach yes and from a long time
because because we have two lists

441
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:45,090
are of the previous I'm of the region
way you could also

442
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,840
records deeper doing d come she the
cryptids

443
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,070
and look in it and provide images like

444
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:56,640
always on the sample sale it uses Linux
but to source code is not

445
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,450
available so we can't compile all images
we used a measures

446
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:03,480
modify them into violence

447
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,750
an and other more critical flaw actually
at the beginning

448
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,990
on everything is checked so if its
intricate

449
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:14,700
signs so if it's not the real recovery
procedure it will not accept it

450
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:19,020
but you can even exec insect your own
public key to the signature C

451
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,400
the even when recovery procedure starts
you can you any image

452
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,720
with own signature in with the on
public-key and it works and its

453
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,120
some some huge law to permit on this
we've seen

454
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,220
I it defines the time to sell itself so
PC VAT with him

455
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,940
Seba Houston he made a matter how which
is important

456
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:42,460
and he is to public key this from leaky
is used to check your signature

457
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:46,190
all the images so if we can provide
permit a listed

458
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:50,260
just remind you on public-key and then
you can't write your own images

459
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:54,020
200 flat defines the the mood of the
femtocell

460
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:58,580
if it's used for commercial purposes for
trial so if it's just for development

461
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:02,700
so if you change to have a flat 20 for
development

462
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:07,140
well you gets to to recall doing you get
to root login again

463
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:11,100
used issue and you log in so that's two
architecture its

464
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:15,429
it's really inexpensive stuff you're
just have to

465
00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:18,870
you just provide to continuation meters
you provide to

466
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:22,380
to own immense all-time list

467
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:26,529
and you provide timely fed finalist fine
wonderful

468
00:27:26,529 --> 00:27:30,419
which lists modify its at some software
and give it again

469
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:34,850
and this is how we we've been able to
flash the device itself

470
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:38,159
and to completely take control of its
but

471
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,610
it's not you can say not really
interesting because it's just the

472
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:46,320
a device it's just and other network
devices like a computer hacking

473
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,610
to but third implications a

474
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:52,909
more important San any just wrong tell
because

475
00:27:52,909 --> 00:27:56,929
that's too elements of the net after to
commit for who put it home

476
00:27:56,929 --> 00:28:00,169
so once you have this you can access the
telecom network and that's a critical

477
00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:01,140
part

478
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,500
depicting some security in its trips you
signature but

479
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:09,909
if this one fails they have control of
it ingenuous accident

480
00:28:09,909 --> 00:28:14,330
when we analyzed images we also find
some so there was to a first-half

481
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:18,220
there was the first web interface not
interesting it just shows the status

482
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:21,789
but there's a hidden web interface
provided by the

483
00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:25,620
fender of the temple says where you can
set anything

484
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:30,490
you can song you can see just had to sit
tells but you can also say

485
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:33,909
please send on this frequency chibi
please this operator

486
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:37,220
disconnected this IP second so long act

487
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:40,779
the operate such middle freighter itself

488
00:28:40,779 --> 00:28:45,130
use Justin yes this interface to
configure it all to play its

489
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:48,789
and that somehow knowledge to have to
control of the

490
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:53,309
of this of this interface and said
anything

491
00:28:53,309 --> 00:28:56,899
then like I said we have access to to
the network itself

492
00:28:56,899 --> 00:29:01,110
thank you you I'm we can switch is a
leading

493
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:04,600
so you can show you the have even told
on those things

494
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:11,600
can you which young

495
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:15,870
sold at the femtocell we love we sold it
assume no connection

496
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:20,370
but actually you don't you need it it's
just use it for for the beginning to

497
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,159
show all

498
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:25,070
to see how it works but to to fine-tune

499
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:28,620
the flashing itself its only over the
network's so

500
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,820
as soon as you head control over the
network

501
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:35,370
you can't write your own images you can
everything without entering

502
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:40,250
that the hardware we we see the boots

503
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:45,240
takes out offensive with a good some
small small heart

504
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,679
an snow we have to to to login

505
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,960
the password not really hard its and
chief

506
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,179
so we can reverse its and if I say not
so secure you can track its but you can

507
00:29:57,179 --> 00:29:58,429
also brute force its

508
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:02,549
it's really small and she received it
yet Nexus

509
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:06,399
nice but people's I'll have

510
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,779
so that's the term insulation all the
servers

511
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:14,179
other love you too much do everything
machines easy to use

512
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:21,179
now we can have access web interface

513
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,620
spaced its

514
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:30,049
it should be on so that's the web
interface and BC

515
00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:33,159
changed dunno will change that's all

516
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:36,590
its we were and normally

517
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:40,370
you should have the credentials to 12
where to web interface

518
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:43,630
burt's it you don't need you just have
to click to attend the same link to

519
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:44,549
refresh it

520
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:47,850
and then you have access you don't need
any credentials and she can see two

521
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:48,990
stages

522
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:52,190
that here to engineering mood where you
can say okay

523
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:56,240
I don't want this want to sniff the 2g
networks 3G networks

524
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,549
the sort of using general meeting he can
just turn off your right here

525
00:31:00,549 --> 00:31:04,909
scant all which type of an to sell it is

526
00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:09,559
all but in a ball I mean you can change
everything that defines the fam percent

527
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:09,860
with

528
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:13,240
with this weekend to face is also the
database make you can interact

529
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,850
itself but the web interface is not nice
and more interesting is

530
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:22,289
gold yeah

531
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:26,230
nights general yet and this is really
interesting stuff

532
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:31,070
right now this box so in the standard
standards is the anti-maastricht

533
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:34,539
this box closed open and thus any open

534
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:38,059
orders clothes womens clothes means
open-wheel

535
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:41,970
only add subscriber to this from 26 so
if you want to add your wife's number

536
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:42,840
European

537
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,519
you to call opportunity fees and my
wife's number so they will and

538
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:50,029
this number everybody to this database
exactly a

539
00:31:50,029 --> 00:31:54,080
in open this box will be here in like
normal base stations

540
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,580
any user can connect a different person
and music

541
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,630
so completely open parts for began
installed

542
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:04,940
seen OpenAccess don't scorn export kinda
actually seen you been

543
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,309
did dipping sexually be choppered it has
to be allowed on our

544
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:13,649
I N open more literally this from the
same can accept any

545
00:32:13,649 --> 00:32:16,490
more by User like if you have a
wonderful time to see it can also

546
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:19,940
allowed to connect with people were
using it can also allow to connect or

547
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,269
two

548
00:32:20,269 --> 00:32:24,320
or to use actually an you are you don't
need to do anything so you can just like

549
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,630
any connection and you're used to deploy
the company

550
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:29,669
just go back to ginger yeah

551
00:32:29,669 --> 00:32:33,350
and here deployment your that's hot spot
yet

552
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:36,490
on what sport and enterprise and there
is also some new

553
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:39,649
from we have seen which is for the
enterprise very you have a company

554
00:32:39,649 --> 00:32:41,820
injuries and all this list of

555
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:46,769
by enterprise companies users which are
connected to the work phone number and

556
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:47,419
everything

557
00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:50,730
you see is deploying getting the second
generation

558
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:54,779
this is where you tell which operator
you up normally you know your own leader

559
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:58,230
30 broadcast only different traitor you
buy it

560
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:01,429
you can teach yourself and create all
the conditions saying and Deutsche

561
00:33:01,429 --> 00:33:02,580
Telekom oh I'm

562
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,679
AT&T in so long pictures let its

563
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:09,929
re long green

564
00:33:09,929 --> 00:33:13,059
yet so that's the web interface

565
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:16,230
we we have access to the emphasize ends

566
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:19,570
as we see there's a lot of structural in
20 minutes home with the management

567
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:20,330
server

568
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:23,539
at a point is the performance
measurements old to be

569
00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:27,990
no fees and home movies Lok to activity
and report every hour

570
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:31,230
okay during the last I will

571
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:36,860
ahead to kilobytes of voice traffic two
megabytes of data traffic and so on

572
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:41,090
we now also have access to Web several
so all defender sales

573
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:44,279
Stumpf to another them to result in
there so now we have

574
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:48,190
to in the sand you all other the cells
deployed

575
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:52,130
operator some privacy issue saying
basically work

576
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:56,850
we got access to their from to say
infrastructural so what I connection

577
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:57,860
which I showing the

578
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:02,529
first picture like that the show and
even so in this car HMSO

579
00:34:02,529 --> 00:34:06,299
who collects although the poor suffering
to select the deployed thousand from two

580
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:08,159
cents in all the polls in time to save

581
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,250
sandoz report to get so we're and we
basically got access to die so what

582
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,970
we're doing for national store and the
information consist of

583
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:18,290
misstatement someone services to

584
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:22,820
operation administration and management
server it provides to

585
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:27,240
try some new images if to pretend want
to cash it so we have access to all the

586
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,530
images to do all he wants to do new ones

587
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:34,280
we could also push all images so this
procedure is not like to write like to

588
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,010
becoming push it a bit more secure

589
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:39,429
with infighting whole yes between allies
truly ants

590
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:43,300
if we can push all images which Intel
only attempt to sell stake

591
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,470
images and images on this

592
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:50,050
it's a mess true by its provisioning

593
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:53,250
so in the provisioning it tells the
femtocell which am

594
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:56,720
which phones on the to connect to its we
can get two provisions of the other from

595
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,390
the cells

596
00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:00,420
so we can't say for this time to sell

597
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,869
we know that this number were connects
to it and so on

598
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:07,260
autism prime interest rates change in
the city

599
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:11,710
already shown its at some move on to
some science and integration

600
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,760
and more primitive threats we have a
location

601
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,150
you want to do it okay the picture is
not clear exactly so

602
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:21,470
as he told you be grabbed his
information from the performance

603
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:25,780
minister was amiss MCI Mia and fair lady
feelin is important because on this from

604
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,540
the silly me

605
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:31,720
the unique feel it. from American
exactly try to look at where the fantasy

606
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,910
and also soared on the precipice as I
told you like

607
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:38,510
some forms show the inclusion Lake when
you make a call official that okay to

608
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,089
call in

609
00:35:39,089 --> 00:35:42,320
in Kips Bay Shore signal directly so
what we need

610
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,599
we turn on the ignition on the spot then
say don't use encryption

611
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,079
and and India entered you did the same
actually for the call was

612
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,980
and get an incomplete we tested on the
nomination the same one was not coming

613
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,680
so the caller's independent discovered

614
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,839
missile this guy was an incomplete and

615
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:03,260
misfit dispute figures interesting so
were disfigured his

616
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:06,890
exactly so these are the additional from
to sell boxes

617
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:10,720
right now I just want to be but we can
social all the time to assess which I

618
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,730
don't wear Obrycka

619
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:16,200
so get exactly these boxes exactly are
those location

620
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,880
so we also have access to a different
person grabbed a the exact look

621
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,180
information and we map you exactly

622
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:26,290
so we can show on the femtocell spotted
in this area

623
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:30,310
so this was a map and is at present
thinking was once

624
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:33,540
is dropping of course we can check

625
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,740
what kind of traffic going in from this
box to operate at

626
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,849
so like if u send any SMS to your wife

627
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:42,869
to any fan actually week

628
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:46,190
we take on the package so mean exactly
look into

629
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:49,829
SMS semester sexually yes to its

630
00:36:49,829 --> 00:36:54,609
they say to increase to call to encrypt
exceeding cryptid

631
00:36:54,609 --> 00:36:58,849
between your phone and the femtocell as
soon as it is on the phone for sale

632
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:02,890
DLP a text is going to see more there's
no and training trips know there's no

633
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:03,640
encryption

634
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,490
and children traitor dates and drifted
until the temple cell

635
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:10,859
or any new would be so issue have shot
behind in would be

636
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:14,760
you get everything on untreated it's not
just a SMS it's also the

637
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,609
data traffic or it's the voice traffic
so we can recall that we can record a

638
00:37:18,609 --> 00:37:20,240
voice in weekend back to voice

639
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,829
we can see which led which went
interface you use

640
00:37:23,829 --> 00:37:27,890
quick trip which makes you look dead all
the data traffic in so long

641
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:31,050
n most interesting impact actually and
why we're killing

642
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:34,770
as I told you this box can be known as
open access you know something

643
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:38,660
so I can turn this box is open access
and again i lo all you guys to connect

644
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,349
his book

645
00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:43,700
and when I can see known in against your
lesson with I can feel older mature size

646
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,490
just hoping

647
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:47,970
from GPS Pakistan even mechanic on the
cause

648
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:51,970
and you can if I ever actually and so we
can't end over the lake

649
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:55,190
I'm going to listen to his call and you
didn't want to connection I can't turn

650
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:55,829
my box

651
00:37:55,829 --> 00:38:00,240
or two and here we have a better signal
from my box of course his phone

652
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,109
by by technical things his phone
automatically get connected to this book

653
00:38:04,109 --> 00:38:06,589
because this box has a producing a
strain

654
00:38:06,589 --> 00:38:10,570
and of course you looking to do I mean
he will you not get any kind of

655
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:11,619
notification

656
00:38:11,619 --> 00:38:14,650
for protecting so we can use in please
call or sms

657
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:19,060
me and the second part extra thing for
city limits that

658
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:22,380
really little late we had access to
perform a swimming so you know

659
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,640
the information of all these boxes has
been stored there so we can

660
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,960
try to kept above information then the
software update

661
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,760
like this event was used to push some
new full moon or the new modification to

662
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,740
the new from persons

663
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:37,869
wish we had access to this form a team
is an interesting thing was

664
00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:41,339
before launching a new product
development David only

665
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:44,780
a new images of upcoming femtocells

666
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,940
so will your house is good but we don't
have maps

667
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:51,030
so then the provisioning so what and

668
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:54,490
from dozens of course we can configure
on the campuses like as

669
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:58,079
as I show you here in the map
information once we actually those books

670
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,550
we can also ask that box turn off
encryption

671
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:04,440
tone of your operator financial
something else shopping or something

672
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,430
anything actually

673
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:08,940
or we can just crashed and box and that
boxing

674
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:12,530
work then other guy has to cooperate and
box is not working

675
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:17,589
please show do something because even if
you try to do

676
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:21,050
trashing of you try to be saved if you
look what we got we know how to change

677
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:21,920
that setting

678
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,730
select it will not work or regulatory
fleischer committee

679
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:30,329
this thing and he's not some attacks
which are

680
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:33,900
mention cannot be convenient if you
stand there like

681
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,210
these are the possible attacks could do
on a fantasy

682
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:41,300
and analyze very cater to convene 2006 I
guess

683
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:47,010
we analyze halting spectacle and I think
this is the smallest actually we have

684
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:50,210
much better than does it back soon if
they locate these are the kind of

685
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:54,160
tation has impact for extremely home for
something

686
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,950
so I don't think so did in this analysis
based on practical and theoretical

687
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:02,599
but we use we were able to perform these
attacks practically ensures okay

688
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:07,319
it's really really possible even more
than these attacks

689
00:40:07,319 --> 00:40:10,980
so conclusion okay as with orange juice
interest in technology that

690
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:15,290
although produce a living to have so
that they can offload the crappy can

691
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:19,480
try to generate from new revenues with
some 3G technologies even the eighty is

692
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,430
coming they can

693
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:23,730
for way too much better service to the
user so they're living it and they don't

694
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:25,000
need to

695
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,960
pumps mile you know financial strain
being

696
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,890
producing new technologies but openness
need to do their homework as

697
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:37,940
you have seen okay what are their flaws
or through the impact if you going

698
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,940
public and if you try to make something
different

699
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:44,290
act like somebody could big discuss this
militias device packed into this box is

700
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:48,180
somewhere into it like if I wanted to
take okay what my neighbors talking to

701
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,300
my girlfriend or something

702
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,030
your friend or something you could just
took their boxes and you from the

703
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,369
Commission anything could happen
something like that

704
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:57,430
so often used to do their homework
because definite position and they want

705
00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:00,750
to keep their definition and no this
privacy is more concerned so many

706
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:05,660
biting you always think your privacy
notice so that we have a huge impact

707
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:09,099
coming future they have to think about
their definition incomes up security and

708
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:10,619
privacy

709
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:14,329
they had to follow specification like
specifications easier to use some kind

710
00:41:14,329 --> 00:41:15,190
of Kristen

711
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:19,180
ppm or in PM kind of solution to provide
better security so that

712
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:23,099
on the clearances which are these boxes
you this I stored insecurity

713
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:26,240
unified this box I cannot get some
critical

714
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,730
credentials by economic schedule
critical

715
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:33,970
credential credentials on maybe I cannot
access to legal me

716
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:38,710
network at all actually so they have to
follow the specification secure the new

717
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,200
Acer

718
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,450
the network actually and currently we
are

719
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:47,619
trying or about to finish okay whole
weekend extend our work to ensure

720
00:41:47,619 --> 00:41:50,849
messy back to reach this device would
have in the future

721
00:41:50,849 --> 00:41:54,180
we're trying to get more into the
network are trying to find possible

722
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,990
flaws are trying to provide some

723
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:59,859
new improved suggestions for the TV
standard body okay so these are the

724
00:41:59,859 --> 00:42:01,589
things you have to reconsider

725
00:42:01,589 --> 00:42:06,220
this point or maybe can use as a simple
instigation device which is complete you

726
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:09,440
feel you can have in twenty dollars or
something so again

727
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,480
first you see get a divisive been some
kind of man in the mirror

728
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,869
act like you're talking to your friends
I can sing Sun rising to you us

729
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:21,160
displaced hi something like that we're
trying to produce those kind of things

730
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:21,770
in people's

731
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:24,900
and trying to push suggestions to the
operator

732
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:28,460
okay what things you need to consider if
you want to block him to sit with you

733
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,460
and what things are you missing inside

734
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:34,700
if I could also do some traditions to
the standard body

735
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:38,380
doing a little research public area in
economic unions

736
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:42,170
also wish only shown to like at the
beginning on

737
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:47,329
of the slides we've seen that there is
something distinction between two areas

738
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:51,010
suppo we only looks at access network

739
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:55,310
what's what's India with didn't looked
at the core network we have

740
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:58,690
defend herself gives somehow access to
the poor network

741
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:01,910
and Sri did not act its sole for now its

742
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:05,420
only and knowing what we do for your
operator but there's no

743
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:08,510
there is no cost for them its it's not
very critical

744
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:12,000
we don't return those the floor vendors
know the flow but they say

745
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,700
okay in the next version it will be
fixed we don't care about Justin

746
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:19,069
and it doesn't cost a lot of money bets
ethylene

747
00:43:19,069 --> 00:43:23,180
as we can get access to core network
that's very dangerous for the

748
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:26,740
further a preacher's 20 preachers
detention operations and all

749
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:30,130
telecommunication network a happy if it
works

750
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:34,540
day its nots habits to have something
she chooses to take on the Internet

751
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:38,810
he'd operators have mutual agreement
acne and that actual sales we just one

752
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:42,339
extends from voice now with the fam
purcell if we have an axe to call it

753
00:43:42,339 --> 00:43:43,060
work

754
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:46,150
like on the internet we can test a lot
of things we can really attack the

755
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:47,650
network and

756

afraid that my entree to and so long
within

759
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:59,670
to detail we only constraint on the
access network that

760
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,740
impact somehow somehow critical

761
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:07,980
that's with the home beamed UMTS but now
Indian tehe advance and so on the home

762

763
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:14,980
there is no issue 3 teaching anymore
this just packet switching India's a bit

764
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:15,550
less

765
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:18,609

but I don't know so far they have been
declining

790
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:07,200
one question about that s homes

791
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,690
to say basic elementary security
measures missing

792
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:15,300
out as the other

793
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,990
you'll information security was missing

794
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:23,400
no even elemental security like to
credentials to connect

795
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,710
message to send it's the same like you
use for

796
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:30,400
to have performed to get a performance
measurement or there really a lot of

797
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,050
stuff that we're

798
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:34,589
not secured all just realized that the
connector

799
00:46:34,589 --> 00:46:37,640
dispenser cell is a trusted that for
many don't have to you

800
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,920
don't have accessed to the home
management

801
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:45,390

803
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,780
IDAs there's no IPS there's no not
another firewall weekend with this

804

805
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:59,109
intercommunication or maybe our addition

806
00:46:59,109 --> 00:47:02,750
dimensional idea for final but no strict
