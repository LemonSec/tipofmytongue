1
00:00:02,659 --> 00:00:03,050
okay

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,399
next book smudged

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,559
talking about PS so next hour

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:17,119
it

5
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:23,029
believe here PDF excellent

6
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:26,420
I heard you her some nights on my aunt

7
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,929
73 talk okay

8
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:33,770
I could as because the first happens and

9
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,219
wanna make everyone seen so

10
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:41,860
from them mercy you covers in the
background

11
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,910
PF out for myself and then can
interesting stuff

12
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,510
the I have

13
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:53,190
syntactic ambiguities in p.a

14
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,199
and on how it can be difficult to say
precisely what

15
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,739
what the PDF

16
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:04,799
do you open it so and I i wasnt

17
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,240
which as well as being set up has been
where working and

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,970
bad I'm anyway also throughout the
slides it

19
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,979
a to conflate Acrobat leader in

20
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:20,570
bat itself and I

21
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:26,040
having a terrific song on the slides yet
if something seems like nixon's the

22
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,590
other

23
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:30,259
as concise want so

24
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:34,159
I akron is originally

25
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,890
at created in the early nineties are
several other

26
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,040
other formats: at the time for I

27
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,140
documents formats

28
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,189
there were you can't basically hand

29
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:51,259
the and the document someone

30
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:55,420
and it looks the same everywhere Prince
everywhere and so forth on

31
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:01,939
I think shop

32
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:06,340
session today

33
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:13,340
as resolution

34
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,959
and in

35
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:44,959
crazy six

36
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,950
it

37
00:02:53,950 --> 00:03:00,950
its the fridge

38
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,790
said

39
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:11,790
is

40
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:31,780
okay

41
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,110
okay a

42
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,390
its there's a bunch of code and was
written

43
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:51,130
it's been revealed or services

44
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,510
shipping fees yes where where you you
replace one piece

45
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,770
you want and

46
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:01,810
when you done do you still have the same
thing started

47
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,300
and witty the

48
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,170
the is about a

49
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:15,180
14 the mines good Adobe Acrobat

50
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,710
less for for reader

51
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:23,030
as doesn t Isaac

52
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,190
partisan doesn't that'd

53
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:32,690
and the scale

54
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:38,090
this in perspective fire 2.7

55
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:43,010
would 10

56
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:47,380
the

57
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,910
basic idea for for PDF is also was one
hundred

58
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,490
members way back okay

59
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,870
so the big the big

60
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,500
reason for its existence was to not

61
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,640
script and

62
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,290
couple some drawbacks it was good to me
sexy like really

63
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,420
are his fate it is a faltering

64
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,490
language it's basically fourth but that
also means that

65
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,630
you can play chess

66
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,070
your printer and

67
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,450
these there's no its its

68
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:29,660
fledgling leaders and we'd actually be
certain document

69
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,010
ever print cuz you have to refer to
finish

70
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:36,420
executing in first so

71
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,920
there's a good mother like works to you
could you can remind

72
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,200
operators in language to you and make

73
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,780
heard exactly to you deterministically
sugar

74
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:53,310
Manship anyway there's

75
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:57,200
with actually actually just stock

76
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,650
recent proposal for what became PS

77
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,870
its there's a interchange this like a

78
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,340
the idea was like pre-rendered the PDF

79
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,660
John's static at buttons

80
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,750
like that and anyway and

81
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,050
but it's basically a it's you avoid all

82
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,120
the the

83
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,940
halting problem its problems yes and
also make a lot more

84
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,120
ficient p is

85
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,460
bunch freed just 6 that you can

86
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:36,240
parse in the fixed find

87
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,580
predicted time and there that is all

88
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,910
related big victory today

89
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,210
destruction and so if

90
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:50,250
if you ever use like sent you see like

91
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,400
time Lake like

92
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,260
gibberish hi speaker like that

93
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,550
on Oranje PDS

94
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,600
but actually they're the

95
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,960
the if it's not as actually all

96
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,150
you can access in texted

97
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:13,330
and a bit

98
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:17,510
characters there are entrance and so
wanna damaged

99
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:21,479
is so an object as looks like yes

100
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:25,260
its easy to take

101
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,750
hours a page and as the its

102
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:33,210
box or it's it's a pageid

103
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:36,410
by times

104
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:41,390
7q and the job production for example

105
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,419
and

106
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:48,800
mislead yet PDF like this cell did

107
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,400
the I suspect is intentionally
internally

108
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,910
16 referred to as carousel you can also

109
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:02,010
had makin revisions

110
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:06,990
PDF by Basant illicit

111
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,620
SG and you see redactions

112
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,970
PDF naked

113
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,750
fraction an awesome

114
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,990
to be scared there is

115
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:27,350
its the numbers features uses

116
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:31,730
very very very short list but %uh the
first in the job descriptions up

117
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:35,040
is in version 1.2 and its

118
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,940
me for the Acrobat forms in

119
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,920
one inversion 38 is mortgage it was
generalized

120
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,120
just at

121
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,570
you won a javascript action when you
open the document

122
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:54,870
and necessary there was a lot of

123
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,050
1350

124
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,060
think he said multimedia features stuff
that

125
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:06,410
that next the

126
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:10,270
different at different times

127
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:14,390
cover that and also

128
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:18,010
just recently least

129
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:22,070
the 10 back

130
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:25,089
that the biggies and boxed using

131
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:30,120
same sandbox artist uses and

132
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,440
its she's too much complete sent

133
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,050
not cover much about that so

134
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:42,600
the thing is there's a interview
reaction to the

135
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,490
against them PDF his stripped-down

136
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:49,959
version for arrival processes that

137
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:53,440
this Lease all interactive

138
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,750
content is basically removed and

139
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,860
the doctors always going with the same
time changed

140
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,470
deterministically and

141
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,579
at

142
00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:13,130
the the the mean

143
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:18,630
primary specification works for PS has
been up posters and I said

144
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,470
and there's a funny like right very very
beginning

145
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,530
right very very document is funny thing
it says

146
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,560
standard is not specified message for

147
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:37,320
valid the conformance files readings

148
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,810
there there's

149
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:44,209
well actually does actually specified
conformance but it

150
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:49,870
basically says faults you know
everything's okay

151
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:54,089
that the

152
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:57,440
this when you when you return is
documents which you need to pay

153
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,280
attention to his

154
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:04,760
things it doesn't say and

155
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,459
attacked and so for current and future
so you can

156
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:12,690
you can 2300 page there's a a

157
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,880
is the an ODBC face

158
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,220
in the in there as well but its

159
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,220
with the documentation foreigners
running across my song

160
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,740
yes and

161
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:31,240
its its

162
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,940
is it as you can see in the back missus
is that

163
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,290
ABCDE provides new security for any

164
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:41,579
bases his program dachshund
responsibility

165
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:45,550
database administration keep secure

166
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:49,520
they did actually finally disable this
in

167
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,449
in back version 9 and sexy completed

168

run on been sound video and

172
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:11,319
and fisheries this another changed

173
00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:15,740
form cock that only works on the on the
extent of one's

174
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:21,270
design stuff for generating codes

175
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:24,270
digital signatures on forms like that X

176
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:27,600
parsing there is and stumble on

177
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,020
petrol us this in

178
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:35,180
next it is actually lot less exciting

179
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,630
is a family a

180
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,680
there's certainly a territory where you
be sleeping tonight

181
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,490
already tagged said it like on paper
sale

182
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:50,250
accurate support for it

183
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,520
there's jumped salon JavaScript

184
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,959
and most about that

185
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,000
there's a the RAM see

186
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,180
jewel like trent with you can print a
filing

187
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,970
see modifications 23 all that really

188
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,819
doing stuff other in

189
00:13:10,819 --> 00:13:16,180
its is actually forced leaders its is
kinda on the honor system

190
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,220
interviewed again actually forces

191
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:25,620
in making such files

192
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,150
the alternative presentation

193
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,910
San so busy document will

194
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,199
look different depending on like like
with using

195
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:39,220
with your print the printer on the
screen see

196
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:44,059
you can have like a the the using the
nothing to do with that is is like a

197
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:47,630
in water marks on documents so that the
water mix not

198
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:52,839
isn't sprinted then it's relate

199
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:56,160
also you much larger firms II

200
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,319
the moments all this in spec connection
believe is true

201
00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:05,050
it basically is this their system

202
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,459
action they do you get to the name
program

203
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:12,010
right with an economic you want

204
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:16,939
and and

205
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,620
and as like like like I can't be the
first person

206
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,220
shoes noticed season and thought it was
a bad idea

207
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:28,199
I and its can actually work is going to
be something

208
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:31,860
restriction actually yet we just passed
commander txt

209
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,050
to with taxes by around

210
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,280
with wanted D Stevens

211
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,309
made public last year last spring

212
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:44,970
so and it was the interesting

213
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:48,439
different more than one PDF reader

214
00:14:48,439 --> 00:14:51,630
that had did had this

215
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:55,319
which means at least people father said

216
00:14:55,319 --> 00:14:59,709
PDF reader anybody

217
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:03,000
commit as well as popular dollar boxing

218
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,240
brink sexy

219
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,770
better want just plain

220
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:13,990
so the original rationale for this was
once upon a time when

221
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:18,069
people the city's RC months they would
have

222
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:21,860
certainly a table of contents or can
longer something

223
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,770
on CD there was a PDF you open and then

224
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,819
the links to stuff on the CD in Euclid

225
00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:33,079
goings there that's as is the

226
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:38,500
been trying to you return work now

227
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,280
and then is offensive other

228
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,470
very curious things

229
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,750
available in the from

230
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,290
Johnston the in the current versions

231
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:55,920
pre restricted you could

232
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,860
have menu items icons

233
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,179
me files

234
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:07,650
things like that design

235
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:11,179
the the deuces restricted in

236
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:14,689
are it is restricted unless you

237
00:16:14,689 --> 00:16:18,750
signed the p.m. with some sort of public

238
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:23,380
he and from what I understand it and the

239
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,550
the the certificate has been stalled so
it's

240
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:30,970
using shelling think ministry

241
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:35,439
say

242
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:42,010
and you can select earned restriction
yep

243
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:45,949
into the faded

244
00:16:45,949 --> 00:16:50,410
syntax so the the actual

245
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,439
I guess languages is actually pretty
pretty easy

246
00:16:53,439 --> 00:16:57,380
Street I Millions numbers stranger

247
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,110
strings are bounded by fantasies

248
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:04,939
an extreme person it is a Christmas

249
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:07,949
not number did is an extreme it

250
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:11,510
last 10 names

251
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:15,689
slash its liking and

252
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:20,370
script and untac same thing

253
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:24,329
persons comments arrays

254
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:27,420
square brackets dictionaries are

255
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,929
double back basically isn't

256
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:35,010
green true cell

257
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:38,660
streams economic big big strings

258
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,870
they have demands that you can awesome
press them

259
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,370
that and then objects which is like how
missus

260
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:50,980
structured are just good like this where

261
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,799
used for a you put on Dec 10 and object
needed

262
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,980
and these other things mister trip

263
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:02,950
we do a reference is basic operator

264
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,840
and ordinances the the number you gave

265
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,640
and then this is the version number so
singer sticking in the parkin

266
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,600
filings

267
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,690
these which version you want

268
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:24,610
so in this example here object using

269
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:28,360
strain and 3 isn't

270
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,700
says example is

271
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,780
reference string said

272
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:40,450
ones just

273
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,970
the receptionist

274
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:47,970
is not that not

275
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,790
or Snyder you need a person his

276
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,809
as if you defined

277
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:59,190
113 12 you can Union

278
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:03,340
is a is another

279
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:07,390
San similarly

280
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:12,440
trying this is although you put the

281
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,540
the tape the names

282
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:20,440
directly entity diction line

283
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,990
and

284
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:27,880
E person does actually

285
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,420
resolve these want isn't actually

286
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:37,640
this nation them and it's actually
possible a good thing

287
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,850
had the accident this

288
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:44,549
cuz because then you could say have
injected

289
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:48,210
that call that contains

290
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,450
to congress itself

291
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:55,200
streams there's about

292
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,059
616 possible is

293
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:02,429
compressing the India and you can you
can

294
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:05,470
use in the use the functions

295
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:09,840
anywhere you want and there's the

296
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,010
the encryption

297
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:19,559
is pendulums way

298
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:23,309
so on the names of these

299
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:28,960
you all yuan X substitution seized

300
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,590
and miss

301
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:37,450
when it's once skating the

302
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:41,340
X so

303
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,620
the modded

304
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,950
there at the Veterans Affairs exactly
paint onto the page

305
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:53,840
there in a very solid postscript like
syntax

306
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,909
which is BBC pushy the arguments

307
00:20:56,909 --> 00:21:00,279
first you call the operator and their

308
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:04,320
the pretty easy actually let me look at
it looks really complicated

309
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,620
basically like restrain re: like

310
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:12,139
the name number and you'd

311
00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:15,419
and so on

312
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:19,779
its he said

313
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:23,909
and if you print this like said

314
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:27,049
29 if you

315
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:32,000
extent way

316
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,549
good

317
00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:40,169
stack next operator different from
fourth and PostScript

318
00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:47,169
they will actually teamster stack
operation

319
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,940
skip so

320
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:56,730
Acrobat uses is companies in the spec

321
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:01,990
JavaScript engine and

322
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:05,309
the this differences

323
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:08,370
between compared

324
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:12,019
used said Firefox

325
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:15,039
is mercy doc listed

326
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,149
the global

327
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:21,510
handle differently because the

328
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:25,909
to be able to you past you other

329
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:28,980
other

330
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,120
think that their other

331
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,149
texted things in Acrobat that

332
00:22:35,149 --> 00:22:38,279
is necessary and stored

333
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:41,630
various ways it is necessary serif or

334
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:45,049
and its the end

335
00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:49,000
unique behaviors a consequence

336
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,490
and of the the midget document is
accessible

337
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:58,269
demanded 6 isn't

338
00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:04,580
and the just been sandboxed

339
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,779
and unknown

340
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:14,779
at noon the precise boundaries sandbox
actually bed

341
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,039
its currently not allowed to say like

342
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:21,350
ride desk

343
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,380
through it anyway surf you can

344
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,950
the salon a place you can pull to hear
from

345
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,980
like icons sound files and

346
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:35,490
and things like that the numbers pay
number words on the page

347
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:38,590
some these can actually difficult to
resolve this year

348
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:42,070
sure denounces on

349
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:45,090
PDF for example this

350
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:50,889
this function returns the boundary box

351
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:54,139
word on same page

352
00:23:54,139 --> 00:23:58,559
and a half do at least horse supporters
to know where the

353
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:04,399
thats that word will be on the page like
how big it is

354
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:07,580
anyway visited to like the

355
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,080
file name: file size: that

356
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:16,649
you can access document Intel and

357
00:24:16,649 --> 00:24:20,909
if the condensate change worsen

358
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:24,559
which would

359
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,169
make a a house is really annoying as

360
00:24:28,169 --> 00:24:32,110
all times you and using

361
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:35,630
that and you can also call

362
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:40,639
functions in one document from another

363
00:24:40,639 --> 00:24:43,990
the you have to set up a have time to
the documents

364
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:47,529
are disclosed each other there is

365
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:50,700
you can communication between

366
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,850
stockman's so

367
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:57,049
poorest repeat yesterday sector

368
00:24:57,049 --> 00:25:00,480
actually found this interesting worked
with the

369
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,490
engine

370
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:07,759
with global city the Taipei

371
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:10,769
mobile doesn't change once reassigned

372
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:14,120
360 like in in Firefox few

373
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,899
signs and variable a brilliant

374
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:21,309
for you the reason recent

375
00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:25,289
string minute routine misty's string but
in

376
00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:28,799
in Acrobat deleon doesn't

377
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,029
changed to it strings have an extra mean

378
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:39,029
after you assigned string

379
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,820
so this some some

380
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,570
stuff has been used where recently
better

381
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:53,630
nonce law I mean

382
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:58,700
not anything you please escape they've
seen so far

383
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,090
most misleads issues from station
JavaScript

384
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:05,200
parts and within news

385
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,960
for example is checks its running in

386
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,500
in Acrobat as is running in SeaMonkey

387
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,070
by itself that up and then

388
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:19,409
busy grams that first annotation
geneticists

389
00:26:19,409 --> 00:26:23,190
like a sticky

390
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:27,549
the and as a subject an author

391
00:26:27,549 --> 00:26:31,399
clinton's good falls the

392
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:34,620
value that field and

393
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:38,929
exact basically project is something
similar

394
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:42,590
into SG interests

395
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:46,870
has pages and pages for like s gibberish
looking taxed

396
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:49,960
and Cincy scans the

397
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:54,210
season grams the

398
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:57,240
each word of the page Mike dis

399
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,620
topside and put it all together

400
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:06,019
what's that

401
00:27:06,019 --> 00:27:10,919
the him

402
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:14,360
target accident the

403
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:18,950
defeated Cindy now when curious way

404
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:23,279
suspected sex on wall their summer in
China

405
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,830
that is is generating

406
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:30,980
be like a the consecrated

407
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,279
another file like discarded

408
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:38,269
just X in there

409
00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:42,139
but it's also attended like a lot no sir
spaces

410
00:27:42,139 --> 00:27:45,210
and the funny thing is is that if the
new if

411
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:49,059
if they've done revisions document the
malware

412
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:52,970
there heading later reason this morning

413
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:56,039
than the

414
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:59,809
me yes

415
00:27:59,809 --> 00:28:03,149
so sense you can run a flash

416
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:07,039
say from from Acrobat the initial

417
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,870
additional tax attack vectors for the

418
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:14,179
the accident resumption that

419
00:28:14,179 --> 00:28:18,190
bility from which is not last

420
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:21,539
from two years ago you

421
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:25,330
was a reason exported via PDF files

422
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:32,330
were to people answer is a reason to go
a few years expired

423
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:38,330
people was the

424
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:42,289
there's also a

425
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:45,909
ability the love

426
00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:49,519
like play between risk could

427
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,870
that uses and

428
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:55,929
the quite keeping it

429
00:28:55,929 --> 00:28:59,490
is there was a by the

430
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:03,049
would from years ago

431
00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:06,220
there is access to present in till

432
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:11,860
last year and

433
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:15,149
anything said parents

434
00:29:15,149 --> 00:29:18,429
basically

435
00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:21,659
to even if you had the test

436
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:25,570
or flash everywhere else

437
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:29,940
his your song yet PS

438
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,870
and also the from a crack has its own
separate

439
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:37,179
Flash Player when the browser

440
00:29:37,179 --> 00:29:43,360
you can with different version

441
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:48,169
says good

442
00:29:48,169 --> 00:29:51,580
so you think

443
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,620
so decided

444
00:29:54,620 --> 00:30:01,620
in

445
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:08,820
is so the

446
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,909
is here between

447
00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:17,340
in usually the way you represent string
is

448
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,549
seized ask have healing

449
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:24,979
and then symbols or began

450
00:30:24,979 --> 00:30:28,190
in

451
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:31,700
Acrobat Arthur PDF sorry in PDF

452
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,499
ewbal their nixon

453
00:30:35,499 --> 00:30:40,419
and also beginning and and there is
nothing in the spec about what to do if

454
00:30:40,419 --> 00:30:41,929
these don't agree with each other

455
00:30:41,929 --> 00:30:45,809
so I said

456
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:49,720
do ACA Adobe Reader a bunch

457
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,269
do you and

458
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:57,330
your will doing

459
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:01,229
uses these to you

460
00:31:01,229 --> 00:31:06,239
to sugar stream we

461
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:10,519
also used tokens 22 figured

462
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:17,419
stream if you don't also dude

463
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:21,599
which to use keep the ensuing token and

464
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:27,099
so what is the

465
00:31:27,099 --> 00:31:31,549
what is the content streak is it

466
00:31:31,549 --> 00:31:35,279
his contain like four times

467
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,379
10 he's Acrobat are soaring

468
00:31:39,379 --> 00:31:44,979
reader when make point

469
00:31:44,979 --> 00:31:49,369
an instant in its is valid

470
00:31:49,369 --> 00:31:52,749
reported will be stream

471
00:31:52,749 --> 00:31:56,059
and dozen

472
00:31:56,059 --> 00:31:59,369
because you have the wrong have
appointed

473
00:31:59,369 --> 00:32:02,769
someone than stop

474
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:06,440
first instrument as you

475
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,029
entirely in and basically an

476
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:15,710
empty if you explicitly said

477
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:18,869
stopping first 10

478
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:24,289
so ruling

479
00:32:24,289 --> 00:32:28,619
dude if it points the line feed before
the instream

480
00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:35,039
work to the instream at doesn't there's
an

481
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:40,450
the Indians doesn't

482
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:44,080
few you pointed to some object

483
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,269
lowered file the wrong kinds the

484
00:32:48,269 --> 00:32:52,299
the PDF and to the object itself and

485
00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:55,460
actually actually

486
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,919
wines the demo

487
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:01,970
busy does this trick to you

488
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:08,820
display yes to

489
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,080
so things aren't defined

490
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,320
locator just using don't

491
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,549
object Andy Tobin recognized

492
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:22,559
and things defied

493
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,570
there's day on to you

494
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:30,700
a with rapid access

495
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,309
the PDF is a across from stable to be

496
00:33:34,309 --> 00:33:37,649
assets on the public's file with

497
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:41,899
looks like this uses for the N actually
contributing if you want

498
00:33:41,899 --> 00:33:45,619
is everything did

499
00:33:45,619 --> 00:33:48,849
mister you

500
00:33:48,849 --> 00:33:51,979
well the buried objects

501
00:33:51,979 --> 00:33:55,929
her standard anyway

502
00:33:55,929 --> 00:34:00,200
this is with this means is 0 injected

503
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,729
and number this is the largest

504
00:34:03,729 --> 00:34:07,259
vision to see you can treating you want

505
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:11,169
then 101

506
00:34:11,169 --> 00:34:14,200
points off to the

507
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,559
so that 10

508
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:21,589
one starts our side

509
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:25,020
13 10 and

510
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:29,760
said

511
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,809
to

512
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:36,609
for meters the assets

513
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:41,159

happens feel better

518
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:57,920
the they did on actually empathy version

519
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,299
you cross reference

520
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:05,000
is we've decided to fine reached

521
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,299
fields so

522
00:35:10,299 --> 00:35:13,660
there's actually a

523
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:19,540
actually have a talk with in

524
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:22,569
some people Adobe that was actually
going on

525
00:35:22,569 --> 00:35:25,809
in Acrobat is it

526
00:35:25,809 --> 00:35:29,079
if the the fetuses broken anyway

527
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:32,260
and stir to you ill going to rebuild

528
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:36,270
scan the file 20 together a valid

529
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:41,210
file pieces fines

530
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:48,210
and essentially the strange behaviors
are consequences that

531
00:35:49,369 --> 00:35:53,510
when the things the Pierre also

532
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:56,569
in the ass suspects is sister file bed

533
00:35:56,569 --> 00:36:00,819
actually elevators

534
00:36:00,819 --> 00:36:06,230
anything else wanted they've actually
tried to you

535
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:09,329
trying to enforce this actually win it
is for reader

536
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:14,130
Exped it whereas

537
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,230
busy these days there's there is way too
many documents

538
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:20,710
broke including

539
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:23,910
you do something like

540
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:27,740
tickets three-year late the

541
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:32,819
the PDF comes in have like white space
the

542
00:36:32,819 --> 00:36:36,180
and sale sent

543
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,529
anywhere you make

544
00:36:39,529 --> 00:36:43,640
that's perfect okay post interviewed

545
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:47,510
is OK still so you can stick in Psych

546
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:51,980
valid XE and

547
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:55,980
it's used for example

548
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:00,740
since the

549
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:05,640
okay so the

550
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,390
numbers spots in zip where you can

551
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:12,890
capital Richard is sense

552
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:15,930
assuming that this has to be and

553
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:19,130
that's okay because in as a

554
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:23,750
filed comment because the very end that
sick

555
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:27,410
for it doesn't matter what see visitors

556
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:31,710
before this and then just store the
press the PS

557
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:35,170
with no compression as the sickness

558
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:39,329
stupid and

559
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:42,329
or rather looks good

560
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:46,470
there's the the compressed

561
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:51,220
yes and structured

562
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:56,349
then the NDP here and so when actor

563
00:37:56,349 --> 00:37:59,930
if and then

564
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:03,369
and

565
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:06,720
actually money United back into

566
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,819
trip begins in and

567
00:38:09,819 --> 00:38:13,029
it's perfectly OK be anything

568
00:38:13,029 --> 00:38:16,619
you can also if you just do it like that
Prosser

569
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:20,390
wrong activities care the

570
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:23,520
and using actually at the end of outings
this action

571
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,130
necessary

572
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:31,250
its so

573
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:35,940
you can pretty pretty one citizen
advisory comment

574
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,599

like this because it is dole then
simultaneously

699
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:54,690
it anything about this actually since a

700
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:58,090
a stick this thing on the end is that
office

701

703
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:10,380
include like an office document class

704
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:17,190
this area and I had a PS quien

705
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:22,850
was summer

706
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:29,850
now

707
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:38,170
system last night right

708
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:51,060
work

709
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:54,860
okay so

710
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:58,110
held six so headed

711
00:50:58,110 --> 00:51:01,530
was busy nudging

712
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:05,440
file said link was ten thousand or so

713
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,050
so it's laughable the rest while the
object and then

714
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:12,200
since the process everything said it was
still

715
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:17,100
correct all the rest the object to be
found but no problem used is

716
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:20,390
muscle beautiful open up had a text
annotation

717
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:24,960
on it which is basically like a separate
sticking out where you bees

718
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,380
for text overlaid on top and so is a
pretty content

719
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:33,380
stream that I i success in

720
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:37,260
summitted is a pointed so it is
appointed

721
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,420
the netted one

722
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:44,430
did fields in the

723
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:47,460
PDF to the object that

724
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:50,720
scooped up file and then I could access

725
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:55,180
the well I do two different different
JavaScript easy access

726
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:58,570
the stream d the Medea

727
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:03,100
fields and for the for the

728
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:06,840
texan tissues even easier cuz I just
first

729
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:10,280
the object directly and just drop the
source code

730
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:13,660
PDF want age cuz

731
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:20,660
text annotation just text text thing

732
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:31,700
yes okay lines

733
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:39,870
synergy concern with explosions can be
better

734
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:44,360
the

735
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:49,250
is he was a lot a lot more in the the
next revision

736
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:52,620
the ISO spec research working on
currently

737
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:58,160
to you actually the

738
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,990
more I guess precise in what's was PDF

739
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:07,840
what can sing about PF doesn't test
cases

740
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:11,010
test type

741
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:15,320
do he's been flirting with doing other

742
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:19,190
17 performance for PDF example

743
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:24,020
using file singer office except for me

744
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:27,910
terms that they actually came the same
idea interesting bits and pieces

745
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:31,210
is a with PDF as well and

746
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:37,270
action handed couple years ago and also
there's there's a connection

747
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:41,420
for their United

748
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:44,530
so and stuff

749
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:47,560
which I'd

750
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:51,410
running out of time citizenry have any
any questions

751
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:57,730
there yet how disturbed

752
00:53:57,730 --> 00:54:01,330
basically if he doesn't doesn't

753
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:05,640
so you actually

754
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:11,760
across much should

755
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:18,760
only works you printed it doesn't work
on on the screen actually so

756
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:24,180
anyway so he have any questions

757
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:28,750
yet

758
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:33,710
yes

759
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:40,710
X impacted

760
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:47,890
a good question

761
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,400
this is look at

762
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:56,050
versions PDS systems problems more
restrictive

763
00:54:56,050 --> 00:55:03,050
reader and if you see suspected

764
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:07,100
if you said East solution to this issue
just sandbox

765
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:11,060
the entire and dude

766
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:14,310
care so much with 2x

767
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:18,920
threat

768
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:22,870
others %um certain how used

769
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:26,100
their illicit

770
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:30,500
going Ford

771
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:34,530
action writers least rating cracked PDF
first place

772
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:41,530
next question

773
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:48,479
yes

774
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:55,479
okay okay

775
00:55:57,839 --> 00:55:59,189
its lunch break
