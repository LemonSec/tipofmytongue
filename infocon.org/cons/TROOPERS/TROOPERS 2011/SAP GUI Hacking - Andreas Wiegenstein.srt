1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,090
the address will present some really

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,370
you stuff about I SAP we hiking

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:11,450
and this is one of the talks that will
be held very first time it's true press

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:12,420
conference

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,490
so expects quite you

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:20,300
stuff just up to you hi

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,580
thank you very much for inviting me I'm
for the troopers conference we have

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,869
designed this picture which is

9
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:31,679
our trip was about to forge just a few
words about me

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,739
and about the company I work for I'm

11
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,790
I followed what you forge inching

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,870
one victory for channel specializes on

13
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,489
SAP security and more specifically job
security

14
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:48,520
and this is practically the only company
does that

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,370
except of course SAP on I'm

16
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,550
an active SAP security researcher since
2003

17
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,930
back then I fount the first the road
ASAP

18
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,239
was a buffer overflow in observing
ironically in

19
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:09,130
the password field arm since enough
given couple of talks

20
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,830
and rice conferences recent black cat on
a different topic though

21
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,090
I'm and a.m. also about mentioning me
wrote the first book

22
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,270
on sichuan programming there was no

23
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,380
yeah that's a comprehensive resource
before the book

24
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,770
no with it's out in was was released in
2009

25
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,369
at a City Press and Sam what much a
forged us is

26
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:36,829
first will be based in heidelberg one
kilometer

27
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:42,100
away from this building am and our
specialty like I said it's our security

28
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:47,290
we have written and up security scanner
static code analysis tool forever

29
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:52,210
and be provide also very comprehensive
security guidelines if you try to write

30
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:52,640
your name

31
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,680
custom morning I'm missing something

32
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,149
which Mariano where mentioned before my
honest what was on

33
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:04,479
SEP standards what you can do were on
when you install the SAP standard

34
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,739
misconfiguration missing pages and stuff
like that what the focus on is not the

35
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:09,020
issue

36
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,580
the standard but what the customer just
the custom coding

37
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:17,340
this is our domain mistakes you can do
when you write your own custom code

38
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,420
and for that we have written guidelines
to provide training and consulting

39
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,720
to help customers to securely extend
their SAP Business

40
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,410
so I'm today

41
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,340
which Mariano the beginning also mention
most companies believe they're doing

42
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,019
enough

43
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:38,510
regarding their city security they have
a whole bunch of things

44
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:43,349
they're doing segregation of duties
authorizations picture management and

45
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:44,129
whatever

46
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:47,720
and the belief is OK we are now

47
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,090
safe everything said range but

48
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:56,670
unfortunately most companies do not
consider

49
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,709
Colt they don't consider if I write my
own called

50
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:03,890
I may introduce a back door to all the
security i

51
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:10,200
built customized patched and so forth so
this is a typical picture we see at most

52
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
companies today

53
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,220
if you're telling them they are risks an
out-of-court

54
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,610
the kind of go blank and reboot am

55
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:24,069
in their mind because they have never
heard about that cell

56
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:27,069
I'm what I'm going to talk about today
is I'm

57
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:31,379
program called subquery which is
basically the main

58
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:35,500
user interface you joost for recipe
today of course

59
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,090
like Mariano showed us we can use SAP
with Ben implications

60
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,870
web services but the old days and still
today in many many uses

61
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:49,659
use up to a cell and some who is closely

62
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:53,189
interconnected with up I'm

63
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:57,489
I found this risk to a couple of months
ago and the City of rain spoke so this

64
00:03:57,489 --> 00:03:58,549
is authentic

65
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:02,049
about this million or language a.m.

66
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:07,650
if you look at at the park down there
1738

67
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,140
and I even spotted the at character in
it kinda your

68
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,680
so I'm if you talk about

69
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,250
sup who we also need to talk about up
because sup

70
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,949
who is the primary rendering swoosh
about applications

71
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:25,970
and the visit about application for
college

72
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:30,370
controls so I'm first let's talk a
little bit about

73
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,600
up itself there as a couple of
information

74
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,009
list each year most importantly is a
proprietary language

75
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:41,840
addition Ishan up its not freely
available so if you're researching

76
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,139
about you really have to try and every

77
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:49,590
a lot of things Yukon cool to certain
resources and we told us the compiler

78
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,750
stuff like that it's all closed it pro

79
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:58,610
generates platform-independent code
someone else is important for talk today

80
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,090
yeah I'm there are some

81
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,870
its there so a lot about called

82
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,009
I come back there's a lot of other
according to 66

83
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:13,639
system 150 plus million lines of code

84
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:16,850
and on top of that customers create new

85
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,509
croat in the thousands of lines
partially millions of lines

86
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:25,650
without proper guidelines I'm

87
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,009
okay let's get that we don't have too
much time in this talk I want to go to

88
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:29,840
the exploits

89
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,610
or to the presentation of it were a
pretty fast so what is up with

90
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,690
who is a proprietary fat client provided
and maintained by ASAP

91
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:42,620
again it's closed source open source you
have to take it as it is

92
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,919
I'm is available as either a Windows
executed or a job application baby have

93
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,300
slightly different

94
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,880
most mostly the same I'm the
communication between sup who in the

95
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,080
back end is through the yet practical

96
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,180
its again a city specific

97
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,080
usually its not encrypt S&P also

98
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,960
openly communicates that but it can be
encrypt it since then it has just

99
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,210
compressed

100
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,729
which kind of real security but

101
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:14,580
its its usually okay so much what's up
lead acid

102
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,750
it renders about doing for programs

103
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,610
any standard user interface for me for
most companies if they want to inject

104
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:26,020
appears to be back at so I'm

105
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,580
also some we this is more interesting
provides

106
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:34,280
certain methods to interchange files
between the SAP applications

107
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,000
and the front

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,229
and it's also a scriptable so you can
basically do something with a few

109
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:47,319
you can record a session you can replace
session for automated testing

110
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:51,699
also possible from this phone

111
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:55,139
okay I'm when you're talking about sup
we hanging I

112
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:59,569
divided this into three distinct
sections sections 1s

113
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:02,810
you want to talk about attacks in South
we that

114
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:08,400
originate from an SAP server so here the
attackers a compromise sir

115
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:15,020
and the the user the client is actually
attacked

116
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,190
in order to do so we picked a couple of
functions that

117
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:22,560
available in up which I'm going to
demonstrate in a moment

118
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,900
first before me a.m. about has a
function module which is called WS

119
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,669
execute and this function module is you
write a book called

120
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:33,740
Chan execute alaska months on

121
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,139
the client for some who is installed for
the user thats

122
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:42,770
starting a program on the server the
program can

123
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,940
send arbitrary code to the client and
have a textured

124
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,889
a second function module using briskly
up note

125
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:54,210
which as the name might indicate upload
the file

126
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:58,729
from the client mess-up go isn't to be a
secure server

127
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:03,139
hence by seamer so there's a Guido not
function with just the opposite

128
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:09,400
notes a file from the server to the
client

129
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,419
we also have certain additional measures
methods

130
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:16,060
in CIA in a class called see a good
friend and services

131
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,590
and this provides functions like access
to the clipboard

132
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:25,370
getting directory listings on the client
and so forth a bunch more

133
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,879
so I'm if you look at all that they are
all

134
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,300
either based on the up command call
method of

135
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,190
which does oil oily communication with
Window System

136
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,890
an on-call calls in in the abstract

137
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:43,669
I don't want to discusses much bring
about this is basically

138
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:47,890
all drilling down to those methods

139
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:54,870
sonya just first demo

140
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,959
so what I do know I'm connected through
to our

141
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:01,830
SAP server and virtual forge

142
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,410
and I'm invoking and other program is a

143
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:09,480
specifically prepared which makes use of
the functional units I've just sold to

144
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,529
you

145
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:15,550
okay and when it starts up I'm going to
write

146
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,000
little file

147
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,339
guys I'm having a great time

148
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:27,019
group

149
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:32,820
your ex troopers

150
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:39,820
Sony store that in our data for like
with give it some random name

151
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:53,410
no

152
00:09:53,410 --> 00:10:00,410
okay i mispelled it

153
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,920
an unknown up okay II it took a while

154
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,720
so what happened now I just created
distorted on my local drive by the

155
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,980
a program was stunning it took a minute
now 'em

156
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,570
might expect tells me that someone has
modified my file

157
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:23,650
in if I want you know it so

158
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:27,280
what happened here the content of my
phone was changed

159
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,080
from the server ends

160
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,740
so basically when this is over do it it
scans my local filesystem

161
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,990
for files actually a problem just sex

162
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:42,910
check for specific folder it reads all
the text files in the folder it looks

163
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:46,280
in the folder if if I misspelled the
garage troopers

164
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,180
it then changes to file and upload
against my client

165
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:54,750
without me getting any hint about what's
going on and certainly the finest there

166
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,110
what it also does it also started
notepads

167
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,210
with this file so this is done through
on operating system command

168
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:06,280
on my client as a proof-of-concept and
when it also did

169
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:13,280
about show you that one it created user
on my computer called troopers

170
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:17,180
all of this has been just done by the

171
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,380
up so when I executed to primp

172
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,670
it started Liz that check fights my
client

173
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:26,940
exchange my file is uploaded it again

174
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,010
it started not pitch runways come on

175
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:33,710
and it created a user on my system

176
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:37,190
what does that mean it means in this
constellation

177
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,270
if I'm sup weak lines and i connect with

178
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:44,570
the server actually owns my client and I
don't

179
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:51,510
you can see it so

180
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:56,020
but the ramifications of course in place

181
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,510
I'm I I'm using the old subquery
seven-point 10

182
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,560
and some we7 point 20 which is

183
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:08,070
release now can completely restrict this
kind of excess or if you're running a

184
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:12,300
subsequent 720 you can say I don't want
in your voice commands I don't want

185
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,480
file access and social so you control
that

186
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,620
there's also an additional information
you should read if you're still running

187
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,030
a subquery 710 order because

188
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:28,420
otherwise you have these kinds of
problems but of course if the problems

189
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,470
only if there's militia scored on a
server

190
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:33,790
but this is just a proof of concept to
show you what can happen if the service

191
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,020
militias so member one

192
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,620
for section was the service even now of
course

193
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,930
which is more common declined to Siebel
or more specifically the use in front of

194
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:45,840
the Chinese people

195
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,240
so you're not checking what can what can
I do

196
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,250
um if I'm

197
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:57,270
trying to manipulate sup away and a
couple of things i wanna show you first

198
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:57,870
of all

199
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:01,810
I'm the topic forcefully browsing

200
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,340
which is a well-known problem in better
locations

201
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,720
which means I can change parts of the
screen and

202
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,930
emulate buttons that are not they are
all make

203
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:16,680
on editable fields editable and so forth
and there's something I wanna show you

204
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,090
know

205
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:24,090
so I wanted to do that I need to first
log on again some recipes system with a

206
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:32,630
restricted user song

207
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:40,870
and I'm trying to go to them too much
infection issue 01

208
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:44,710
original Snitzel creations and

209
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:48,280
keeps what's

210
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,710
I'm not authorized

211
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:55,500
use transaction seems everyone across
the eulogy was

212
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,830
very restricted but I can go to
transaction

213
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:02,200
St 30 SE 30

214
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,670
am offers methods flava front analysis
to check

215
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:09,360
which programming time which programming
tricks

216
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,540
a faster than others to improve
performance

217
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:18,190
my coat so how does it work I can pick
some topic for example

218
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,220
access to internal tables and I've

219
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,480
bet called on the left side and it
caught on the right side in can say well

220
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,740
okay measurement and then it says okay
the left cordis

221
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,040
'em several microseconds on the right
Qantas optimal

222
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,150
0 from am which is probably not exactly
correct I'm

223
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:39,890
but this gives you the possibility

224
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:43,910
to test which faster however I'm

225
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,240
what happens behind the scenes this that

226
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,020
the program a problem in Sweden it reach

227
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,760
the contents of those disabled feel so
if I go in here

228
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,940
icon changer it's blocked but because

229
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,180
behind it if you look at the source
court and a purpose always available

230
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,510
source code you can see that you can

231
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:09,640
modify the code if you have certain
privileges however my user doesn't have

232
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,580
the privileges

233
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,180
from but I'm I come across

234
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:18,010
a nice little too which is called window
pic

235
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:22,260
and went to hike allows me to change

236
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:26,230
element so for example I can now check
what is the window ID of the specific

237
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,770
element

238
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:32,160
and reached and from here I can for
example say well

239
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,440
I 12 changed in read-only mode

240
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,680
so I can go piano and type something

241
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,240
but this just makes for a couple of
seconds and certainly someone notices

242
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,740
you something's going wrong and freezes
again

243
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,770
so of course one thing would now be too

244
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:56,480
enable it to be the leader in its
disabled enabled the legal

245
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,910
but this is a little bit cumbersome so
there's an alternative

246
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:03,110
your I can also say which is is your

247
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:06,310
sent texts

248
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:10,600
so now instead of activating just

249
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:17,600
type in some up for months

250
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,960
soul this month actually do what I try
to beginning

251
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,890
they are telling the system to start the
transaction issue 01 bitch

252
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:30,110
lost me to read get access to users

253
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:33,120
sonar send the texts

254
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,990
thank you very much link but now it's in
here and now again go to measure

255
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,710
runtime:

256
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:46,110
what's what happens there was no runtime
measurement the court was executed

257
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:49,970
when the system was trying to muzzle
runs an offer internal table excess but

258
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:50,680
actually it

259
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,790
now jumped to a transaction issue 01

260
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:58,450
and as you can see it now I am inside
the transaction although previously I

261
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:02,050
did not have the authority to start it

262
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:05,590
which means I can using this simple tool
went away

263
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:10,070
which is freely downloadable from the
internet manipulate subways trains

264
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,830
make this in a few enabled and do
betting small

265
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:17,530
this is of course really example there's
something really bad happens

266
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:20,980
because this is called which I can
execute usually

267
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,180
I'm this is not possible and to support
fixed I'm

268
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,220
for for a lot for a long time but them

269
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,510
problems like that gives users easy
access to

270
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,630
right called in if I have the authority
to write out of court

271
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:38,420
i en route because about record is not
restricted

272
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:43,050
buy anything because or privileges
except the code uses authorization

273
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:45,640
checks in the code that would restrict
the use of

274
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,680
but if I can control the court I don't
use any authorization checks

275
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,830
of course still in this transaction here
although I'm now

276
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,950
in the transaction if I want to for
example 2a to use or something

277
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,340
I can't do that because this problem has
additional

278
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:07,310
authorization checks apart from 8 to
start it or not

279
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:13,430
okay so this was an example that you can
really

280
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:16,870
them yeah forceful drones

281
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:20,790
sup Hui

282
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:24,290
but another thing which is a little bit
more curious is that you can

283
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:29,460
even I'm trigger cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities in subquery

284
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,510
on

285
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:39,510
let's go back to my city system

286
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,150
so I just type in a text and

287
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:51,340
as you can see the text us your insight
certainly

288
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,200
just writing checks test which is
nothing better

289
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:02,200
course let's try this again

290
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:11,490
individualism time restraints

291
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,630
I'm just trying to start in a large

292
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:20,670
which is the first thing you do you try
to testing

293
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:24,010
scripting and here it is

294
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:27,830
so even a subquery application can
consist

295
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:31,600
of rosa parks signed and that case I'm

296
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,070
this is actually exploravision

297
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:39,780
which contains as you look at it source
code HTML code

298
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,640
and if um custom application

299
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,430
few simple to this to this I'm custom
control

300
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:50,450
for HTML you can embed scripts

301
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,550
and run it of course the test is not as

302
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,780
as good as it sits on the bed because
there's more Dom you can't

303
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,070
me to keep your something that is not
inside I'm

304
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:03,130
with their national big information
regarding that

305
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:07,600
insights ugly but you can still execute
script unit/units the content

306
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,250
office certainly interface well

307
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,390
the more interesting part of that is I'm
b-sides

308
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:18,690
running JavaScript you can also I
mention that all your scripts up to you

309
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:19,330
itself

310
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:24,930
let's try this again but missed some
Visual Basic Script which can be used

311
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:28,520
to sort of script sup we

312
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,460
automatically without any into
intervention by the user

313
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,060
started

314
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:42,119
for a time

315
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:45,879
okay now I am back the script and it
tries to

316
00:20:45,879 --> 00:20:50,710
start transaction which is called issue
38 original settlement programs

317
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:57,710
secure that

318
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:07,039
okay somebody a or so

319
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:12,119
in they did what you should do they
changed

320
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:15,980
the the flag that allows us to remotely
execute croat

321
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,269
total to execute scripting so we have

322
00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:26,269
yet on except with them

323
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:42,450
okay don't see it now I do that at the
end of a talker first one to show you

324
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,160
something else which is more interesting

325
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,400
so what should have happened years that
court should have also executed like the

326
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,710
JavaScript instead it just me the script
and

327
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:53,950
it actually executes condoms going so

328
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:58,710
what when the lessons learned here

329
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:02,000
for developers do not transport
important data supply ground troops

330
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,100
which means if you

331
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,430
write something in a control which is to
say but don't read it again

332
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:09,730
hoping it nobody enable it I'm

333
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:13,870
issue using the HTML control I'm make
sure

334
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:18,430
did you do it securely and you don't see
any input sewage because otherwise you

335
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:18,960
may have

336
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,270
a cross-site scripting problem and she
is also an him how to disable subway

337
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,600
scripting rich mining

338
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:29,060
dear colleagues at the company currently
did and not knowing that I need is in

339
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,040
the presentation

340
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,660
um so I'm you can lock this down

341
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:39,280
okay number for pictures my opinion the
most interesting

342
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,390
attack against sup creates an attack
from the internet

343
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:46,100
I'm the Mariana also mentioned that

344
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,290
am most companies say well what can
happen

345
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:52,520
are locked in our internet we have no
direct

346
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,170
link to the outside world if you're
running on the subway you have known

347
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,220
better medications

348
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:01,220
when you're safe nothing can happen no
one can get into or excuses

349
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,920
but this is Brian we actually found a
way to a tech

350
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,290
from in Internet application a subquery
application

351
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:11,470
so how does that work

352
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:14,750
so we jump this cross application
request forgery

353
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:18,420
which is close to cross Chris cross-eyed

354
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:23,110
request forgery differences Justin in
cross-site request forgery

355
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:27,650
one back page a text another web page so
you have a broken hip

356
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:31,060
one more page on the right and one of
the left and one of those

357
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:34,770
something bad and high as a request into
the other through the brazen

358
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:38,170
however in this case the fire requests

359
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:41,770
from the internet through the browser
into up to you

360
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:46,300
so prerequisite is of course I have a
running suppli session which are

361
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,080
currently ash

362
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,679
and a.m. I also have a browser open

363
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,380
which is talking to the internet through
my corporate level

364
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:00,120
seemingly I'm I'm pretty safe but the
militias

365
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:05,810
about chance and specific Kaman's under
certain circumstances to simply

366
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:10,700
and trigger a common to support

367
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,530
ongoing demonstrate that on this of
course

368
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:19,070
some friends have disabled this as well
again

369
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:24,050
so they're pretty tight about security
in my brother okay

370
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:28,830
so I'm no going so again here's my
subcommittee session

371
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,850
just open here's my bros in I start the
browser

372
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:39,140
had no effect expects up to you I get
this prompt

373
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:43,210
which asked me do I really want to do
you need

374
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:47,280
the user to join us and this common came
from the internet

375
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:51,910
so by by downloading the specific page

376
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:55,400
I downloaded Akamai wanted jumped from
my bros

377
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,520
engines coolly and tried to delete this
user

378
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,530
of course this is just a proof of
concept and there's

379
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:06,770
risky because this specific SAP
transaction issues everyone has a

380
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:11,310
from 10 you try to tell you the user and
across like to request for prosecution

381
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,240
request forgery conned overcome

382
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,470
trent this of course and Oakley yes but
of course I don't do that but this is a

383
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,710
proof of concept that

384
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:21,970
when you're locked into sup we in your
secure

385
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:26,610
Internet Intranet and in the same time
use a browser on the Internet

386
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:30,500
and come across the militia side it's
possible more specifically

387
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:36,150
boss possible that command control verse
from the browser into you softly

388
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:41,720
and take your system no

389
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,120
I don't want to be she cell

390
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:50,450
however I'm we we discovered this one
rib in a team

391
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:54,100
via go recipe has pitched also

392
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,440
a while ago and but still

393
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,110
its it's important that you apply those
pages in order to be secure from this

394
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,100
kind of attack

395
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:07,230
so know if you have some minutes left

396
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:11,179
ninety minutes long so

397
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:14,910
first two things them I would like to
recommend to you if you interested in

398
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,210
this kind of problem

399
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,410
insecure about poor tourists from other
port I'm

400
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:23,720
bears some and organizational bizarre
.org the business security initiative

401
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,770
I'm which was cofounded by to forge my
company and on up sis

402
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:32,440
his company and it deals with top
threats in

403
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,830
SAP environments and your trying to
build this up to build a community here

404
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:40,740
so everybody interested in that is
invited to participate and contribute

405
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,080
content

406
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,900
and also if you're interested in
literature

407
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,250
regarding up development is horrible
unfortunately did

408
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:53,110
only available in German so if you want
to right secure a book called you have

409
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:56,060
to learn German

410
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:59,620
and should you be in the position to
find 20 days

411
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:05,060
here's the email address send them
securities issued

412
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:09,840
okay am basically I finished thank you
for your attention

413
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:16,840
if you have questions

414
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,490
okay any questions

415
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:22,770
know ASAP yes other

416
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:27,170
so to some question about the

417
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:31,220
across application request forgery was
that use the euro

418
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:35,890
endless boys no activates some bras
object

419
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:39,030
am basically I'm

420
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:42,220
the not telling too much about this it

421
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:47,480
it is downloading a specific file type:
which is dynamically executed by sup

422
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,040
we with a type of a specific extensions

423
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:55,120
Israel is transferred to your system
certainly takes over Open City

424
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:02,120
execute set/sets that's a basic word
course

425
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:14,860
see if I can get this worded and would

426
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:21,100
you

427
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,330
i'd

428
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:30,330
okay let's let's try this again

429
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:36,890
ni

430
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:40,320
I don't know it was a quick

431
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,360
shell melham

432
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:50,580
thank you

433
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,710
I'm midst Blitzcrank kind of lost it now

434
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:58,800
where was my ability the crisis gripping

435
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:05,800
okay should too long

436
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,670
again the input movie and

437
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:21,670
moms No

438
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:34,530
maybe I have to log in again that might
be the problem just a minute please

439
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,610
so when you when you change the setting

440
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:51,610
that allow scripting you have to login
again otherwise it's not effective

441
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:16,200
you check first okay no it's their books

442
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,490
called executed so VBScript code I just
inserted

443
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:26,020
makes up we open a different transaction
as the 38 like I mentioned before which

444
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:30,400
Colonel Sanders yeah I mean SE 38 now
and superstar that

445
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,450
so it's possible by if you have a
misconfigured certainly climb that

446
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:39,580
and you get import in and as such in
HTML control

447
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,910
element part of the application then
somebody conscripted

448
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:46,620
going to bed things without even
noticing so three days

449
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:50,130
basically different kinds of attacks
server against client

450
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:53,730
militias client against the sample
session and the third one

451
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:56,850
I'm locked in the Internet bingo

452
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:03,850
thank you very much attention thank you
very much impressed

453
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:08,740
a.m. other further questions
