1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,520
set for and his according to data center

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,649
using Cisco an excess thank you so

3
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:11,599
yet there's more details I don't think I
have to introduce myself

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,730
anyone that important to group group

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,330
which someone might know about and
working for a company called

6
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,529
I recall alright this is

7
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:26,730
Cisco nx-os for first has anybody here

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,300
her double heard of the annex OS systems
or the Nexus is

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,460
1234 well what you that's pretty cool

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,680
and do we have any any representations
from

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,610
from ciskei well in that case I was a
story about

12
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,100
that's fine so a.m.

13
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,329
I'm gonna talk about a short
introduction to annex or worse

14
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:57,410
from my perspective and

15
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:01,050
my a bit of history of what I've been
researching

16
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,680
and a review of the on delaying group

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,680
the budget on of in

18
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:23,140
of you

19
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,549
area all rights blah blah blah and I
have a few

20
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:31,110
through problems with the Cisco and
annex or system

21
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,150
animals we can talk about and some

22
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,770
africans those questions and also do a
short demo

23
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:44,720
all summations so what is

24
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,869
and excellence from my perspective

25
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:52,270
it is actually I E built-in

26
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:57,440
MontaVista Linux system based on the 26

27
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,679
and colonel which we all know is

28
00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:04,280
fairly old by alright I mean

29
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,429
I suppose they called update these
always I'm so

30
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:10,590
span of a.m.

31
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,069
the loop look look somewhat somewhat
like this it's a big

32
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:17,360
the yes box with teleport's

33
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,459
for old

34
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:23,810
all you guys working with these the

35
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,079
the types also all systems are there in
in the square

36
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:31,810
the kind of systems that are actually
running this operating system

37
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:38,810
this as you can see is quite a few so
anyway

38
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,380
lost year

39
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:48,769
i'd may I a an accidental discovery of a

40
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:52,570
an attack that my friend FX

41
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,709
phone about nine years ago and

42
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,820
which then was classified as denial of
service attack

43
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,579
against world most Cisco Systems

44
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:06,829
this was patched and no one really sort
for a few years

45
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:10,500
and tomorrow and the

46
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,470
does a bit always be surprised votes
what about the whole thing

47
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,120
what happened so I try I I sold it to
you to the whole thing

48
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,010
and I was able to recover columns was
quite interesting

49
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,200
and later on my

50
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,680
I went back to to look look at the at
the Cisco firmware

51
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,150
oils and I was able to recover like 10 X
files from

52
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,150
from the binaries that Tuesday gives you
when you download it or

53
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,620
when yeah ways towards mused of

54
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,889
and some a number one abilities

55
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:49,060
when I haven't really looked into the
city

56
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,519
his DVD CD or F security stuff and
they're simply because

57
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,190
I don't really know Cisco I'm just a
hiker on this researcher

58
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,639
so if you have any Cisco specific
questions

59
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:06,299
I probably causes so

60
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:11,269
a.m. the Cisco 7000 which have been
focusing about

61
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:14,419
is the biggest badass thing you can

62
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:17,600
ever find out when it comes to
networking

63
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,210
you'll most likely find the scene lords
and why are men such as bank finance

64
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:27,460
poor environments you can pretty much
wrong

65
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,360
hold data center using one of these
machines the

66
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,979
the dorm by the fall with 512 tended

67
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:40,620
switchboards which is while wats when it
comes switching

68
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,139
and as you can imagine if you if you can
invest in new

69
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:48,699
your status and you may want to save
some money in buys

70
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:52,150
this G junk mail which is

71
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,840
from my perspective more no more than a
single male a.m.

72
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,250
the impact however if you if you own one
of these machines of course your mobile

73
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:02,790
ads

74
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,360
obviously you can probably stop
everything in

75
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,860
modify the traffic so

76
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,300
well yeah of course rootkits I haven't
looked into this

77
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,830
which is sunset on the researcher I

78
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:23,050
multi2 destroy the world all rights

79
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,759
a.m. this is a picture I stole from

80
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,130
from Cisco it describes the

81
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,789
the layout of the system the saudis

82
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:39,139
to the disease or virtual device
contexts

83
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:42,940
Cisco described them is with his

84
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,090
alright

85
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:51,690
anyway a.m. these are two virtual
switches

86
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,730
in in in in the picture and

87
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:59,330
in theory they should be separated by a
lady one

88
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,820
and all these protocols for letting go

89
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,370
between the switches as as any normal
switch

90
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:12,060
thank you in

91
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,480
a.m. group

92
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,260
in yeah he did you know

93
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,760
could

94
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,510
I am yeah good

95
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:32,470
as mine is one though anyway

96
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:37,360
so as you can see there's a little stuff
beneath all this witchy

97
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,160
and they forgot to include the Linux the
which is in there between

98
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,890
I am so I'd just one point where it is

99
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:48,230
sorry if you if you can imagine

100
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:52,160
if you own the next year on the whole
you hold your golfing which

101
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,830
is that so

102
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:59,890
my point of view 30

103
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:04,880
I'm I wanted to show you a bit of what
the underlying the next looks like

104
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,770
when you when you show its

105
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:13,280
to audience to understand this so

106
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,390
what we have here these for a

107
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:22,120
all US system look like I mean I this
system is just one kernel

108
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,920
with all the services everything built
into it and

109
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,580
as this is a Linux the they've to taking
all these particles movies

110
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,600
interpreters and made him into demons

111
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,240
did nice and everything and

112
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,160
as that will say you should never really
do through to the room

113
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,730
the report you can I mean none of these

114
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,780
not all these demands or either change
from

115
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:54,660
that were as any kind of other
protection so you can just imagine what

116
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,750
would happen if you

117
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,740
if anybody would find like a on ability
in any in any of these

118
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,940
particles that any modern switch today
has the capability of really

119
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:08,160
the impact would be enormous you would
only

120
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,320
little listener pretty much because

121
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,970
there's no other protection than

122
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:20,650
this whatever is so

123
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,720
II I started looking into

124
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,870
other things find

125
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:31,530
this was leary's up I was left field

126
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:35,910
so I started looking into

127
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:40,340
come on line interfaces as you all know
these

128
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:45,000
nifty Cisco for more money to face yet
when you SSH or Telnet

129
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,680
of bed to a Cisco Voice

130
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,950
you get this really cool

131
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,990
interface we can't add it helps you know
in every way possible

132
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:01,000
it's really see so I i find out that
these

133
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,840
the this this command line interface
actually drives from

134
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:10,230
a number of configuration files Baggins
is quite interesting because you know

135
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,550
know when as far as we know it was
really seeing what's

136
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:18,310
with my dick is all about so I started
looking into this and I phoned

137
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:22,100
interesting strings

138
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,710
such as him which I thought was quite
interesting

139
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:31,700
a.m. in a few places

140
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:38,440
in these corporations now

141
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,570
we all know that as a few

142
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,790
moans their I mean 681 hidden ones

143
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:51,330
you come on this is

144
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,430
this is what the conflagration place
looks like

145
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:58,540
at the top there you have the syntax

146
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,540
which is what's the interpreter would
expect from you

147
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,100
okay with type system you would type

148
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,520
GDP and there will be an important some
some pie

149
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:15,370
and as we can see it something to go to
between zero in sixty five thousand

150
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:18,500
Thursday's however

151
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,440
the key were hidden points out

152
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,660
that's GDP in this context

153
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,560
will not show up on any help or on any
Todd

154
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,270
or and unless

155
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:37,840
you can't do the exact why statements
they will just say well that's nice

156
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,500
no such thing and to demonstrate that

157
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,930
this is what it looks like from the
command line

158
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:51,020
is quite interesting isn't it

159
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,970
yes

160
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:59,470
obscurity reliable security so

161
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:03,070
a.m. world GDP as you might have noticed
is

162
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:06,530
am interesting from like your
perspective

163
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:09,670
so he ID the

164
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:13,250
I pulled wrong with it a bit and

165
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,320
found out that you could St command line
interface

166
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,880
using gdb first ball

167
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,240
this is a normal come on the neck
sources

168
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,160
people might know if you're on just
chill processes

169
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,540
you'll see the Linux processes

170
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,790
which is beneath the whole system and I
was

171
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,310
kinda surprised at first because I
didn't realize it was a Linux until I

172
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:44,430
started doing this alone would from
these processes looked so much like a

173
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,460
red

174
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,280
a.m. so this is what happens if you

175
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,630
typed the correct command with

176
00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:00,320
yeah a process ID prisons

177
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,210
I did open porch: you can just connect
in

178
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:09,050
do whatever you like so what could
possibly go wrong

179
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:14,510
a.m. I had I not give them with this
because

180
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:19,510
you can own the whole thing so I'm just
gonna show you roughly what he can do

181
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,970
and as we all know using gdb you can
call

182
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:27,620
functions compiled in into the processes

183
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,870
and complete works sometimes dozens
sometimes does

184
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:36,070
so us we all know what all these
processes running

185
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:40,210
running on route context if we just call

186
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:44,720
arnal bash ID usual

187
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:51,720
you be there's endless possibilities of
destruction

188
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,580
so that's that's that's the first wave

189
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,800
actually escaping from the command line
interface into the

190
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,340
into the underlying obscurity

191
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,600
a.m. so what would happen if you if you

192
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,320
if you skate

193
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,980
everything on the

194
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,100
this shell is driven by pseudo

195
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,750
because what you have in your hands when
you log on to the Cisco switch

196
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,090
this is cool chill which invokes used
ones

197
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:32,080
in some cases or in many cases and

198
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,920
can anyone hear spot the problem

199
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,550
in this suit was filed

200
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:44,220
is here

201
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,180
he says all

202
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:49,690
no password so indicate in any case

203
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:53,709
if you are able to escape from this
packing crap

204
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:58,100
you can do whatever you like pretty much

205
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,410
I haven't really dug into these commands
because

206
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:05,930
I just don't wanna that interesting
because

207
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:09,100
you can read this in so many ways least
is dis

208
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,029
but you can you can just imagine me

209
00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:17,160
for instance the when you're on the
system GDP

210
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,829
will start with the DB server and
context such

211
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:26,100
its it interesting

212
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,730
and also I've been up indeed compiling
the shell

213
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:34,220
to see what what it's actually doing in
some cases

214
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,459
and this is some scary call that I came
across

215
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:40,459
I mean you shouldn't really

216
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:43,930
launch the app uses

217
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:49,440
from binary system and this is not

218
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:56,430
is this is not one occasion medications
as a concise as you can probably imagine

219
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,820
those in those possibilities of
destruction

220
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:02,310
when it comes to when it comes to this
televise

221
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:05,519
so

222
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,180
I figured that everything is running his
routes

223
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,529
everyone X accused of

224
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:18,480
using pseudo were obvious reasons and
even binders new pseudo

225
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,589
so I mean is this even fixable from an
architectural

226
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:28,620
standpoint when the real I

227
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,890
solely on using pseudo and

228
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:37,329
roots of for everything and

229
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:41,699
I've been asking myself this question is
it possible to fix this

230
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:44,839
you know of space quick fix in some way

231
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:48,320
I don't know I personally I don't think
so

232
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,420
I think they have to rethink the whole
concept of

233
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,890
excellence in order to securities in any
perspective

234
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:00,339
of course I mean

235
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:04,569
you can have lucky lucky you can have
real nice user

236
00:16:04,569 --> 00:16:09,010
you know us problem happen so

237
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:13,699
moving on what bout me too

238
00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:18,490
a.m. CDP Cisco discovery protocol is

239
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:21,709
a slight said previously see

240
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:25,040
effects cross today denial of service

241
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,949
2001 a and we could

242
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:33,730
iPhone again and as we can see here
sipes no demon

243
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:37,310
message as everything else and is
running as root

244
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:43,050
what could possibly go wrong a.m.

245
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:46,500
yeah soul this is

246
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,620
this is the cool stuff mean I haven't
Crofton

247
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,670
unexplored for this yet simply because

248
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,680
I suck assembly but it's fine

249
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,640
because I don't wanna extra I don't
wanna destroy the world but

250
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:04,630
this is this is the this is one the core
dumps that I've been able to craft

251
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:11,630
and as we can see there is problems

252
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:14,970
and the

253
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:19,359
many have you for all we know that this
is

254
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,980
not good and

255
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,350
yeah interesting stuff this is what
actually happens

256
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:32,090
they've them they've made

257
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:36,690
their own mother function obviously

258
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:40,649
must be a good thing

259
00:17:40,649 --> 00:17:43,250
are no you tell me

260
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:47,450
by mean I suppose if you're if you wanna
do stuff you don't wanna

261
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:52,059
I mean memory allocation really really
fast maybe you need to make a new one

262
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:56,279
a windfall for obvious reasons you
listed water and a few protections

263
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:01,389
maybe that so

264
00:18:01,389 --> 00:18:04,480
I've been I've been

265
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,669
otherwise in this vulnerability and

266
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:12,070
my conclusions somewhat or

267
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:15,970
that the dealing better

268
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,669
is a 16-bit value which means it could
be

269
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:23,190
pretty big the

270
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:28,279
this is this is from the from the

271
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:31,679
from the actual X-ray thing

272
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,370
and as we can see that

273
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:39,409
they take the 16-bit value

274
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:42,629
making you byte value which is eight its

275
00:18:42,629 --> 00:18:46,139
and they convert the lawn

276
00:18:46,139 --> 00:18:50,730
from sixteen internet which concludes
truncation

277
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,639
and then the allocate memory using the
8-bit value and the

278
00:18:54,639 --> 00:19:01,639
men called using the 16-bit value so
anyway

279
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:08,490
its gonna break however you do it and
that's just one of the problems I mean

280
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:11,769
are being a meanie studying the cold the
did

281
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:17,149
life found out that when I was the wrong
this II try to find out where is my

282
00:19:17,149 --> 00:19:17,879
payload

283
00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:20,950
I wanna see if can do something cool
here

284
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:24,299
which I couldn't from the payload
pictures

285
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:28,929
the in the cold there was a hard-coded
pointer

286
00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:33,200
we saw didn't understand why because it
was members to and from

287
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,870
that hardcore pointer which is scary
enough

288
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:40,659
so I looked at that point remark or
dampen yeah there was Michael dans

289
00:19:40,659 --> 00:19:45,610
so the using some kind of

290
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:49,639
or publication the I'll it's not really
my area

291
00:19:49,639 --> 00:19:56,000
mean

292
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,970
kaya so that's pretty much what happens
when the

293
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:03,119
did you did you say I am 1400 bites

294
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,360
located 7 and then

295
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,450
system yeah

296
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,050
so

297
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:16,930
other other five funny stuff

298
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:20,530
a.m. in the Linux

299
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:24,610
system there's a pass the file I think
any other than a system

300
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:28,220
it contains the user's that can log on
to the machine

301
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,250
the

302
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,630
the uses has two

303
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:37,920
be there in order for

304
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,860
log on to you her he also has to be in
the

305
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:45,820
this is a configuration file for the
system rights with see that the user is

306
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,360
there

307
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,060
and iPhone these FTP user

308
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:55,290
which for all

309
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:58,740
all reasons as a password but

310
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,640
he also no shell so it's not possible to
use its

311
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,320
as far as I know I mean that might be
some otherwise some other attacks

312
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,590
factors we can use this user but you can
please log in using its

313
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:14,160
using message and I haven't really
looked into that

314
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,670
from I crack the password and

315
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:21,320
v1.2.3 and

316
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,990
body started to Google in

317
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:29,060
this is any way with the configuration
file looks like inside

318
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,730
and excellence miss you see you have the
up dude

319
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:38,530
but you don't have the FTP dude so
that's an interesting way of

320
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:42,100
actually back Tory the system the issue

321
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:49,100
in just one layer not the other ID to be
four

322
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,910
you 123 good Aires

323
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:56,610
is nothing interesting home

324
00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:00,860
the most interesting I could find was
the it was an example on hold to

325
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:05,880
make your own snake all certificates and
the examples for the ad was an

326
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,160
123 for some odd reason so I don't
really know where it comes from

327
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,680
looks like

328
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,010
someone made her made me have written
example

329
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:23,010
doing something and and do you want to
three with your response word so

330
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:30,980
anyone know where this stands for in

331
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:34,790
if anybody has not played New Year

332
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:39,440
laid on the floor use god

333
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,920
iPhone God in the Cisco

334
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:49,190
not using it. cutie producing the shell

335
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:53,800
itself this is the shell that starts
when you long

336
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:58,080
as normal user to this is Google Voice
this is all the

337
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,410
parameters you can supply to its from
the command line

338
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:06,310
so in Example you're able to escape the
come online as they

339
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:10,560
Dom user you don't have really have been
permissions but you can still a typical

340
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,440
online sarin

341
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,130
inside the Linux but you you just have a
normal user but

342
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:18,240
you don't really care about the news
because you really one oldest

343
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,650
the router from the router perspective
how do you do that

344
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,970
a.m. for civil

345
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:29,090
you could jumpy

346
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:35,430
into any version please contact us large
or

347
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:42,430
you just skip all the rules and

348
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:47,460
that's a god I

349
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,630
I've been up in the a.m Corinne Google
about this

350
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:56,020
and this possibilities of destruction

351
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:00,150
even this and they say that this is a
feature that needs

352
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:03,350
so

353
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,670
I don't think they're gonna do

354
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:09,900
do away with it because they needed it's
a feature

355
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,570
the

356
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:16,740
for for those who knows annex OS

357
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,000
you do you know that you switch between
BBC's if you're not mean

358
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,080
I guess that they

359
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,400
what the actually doing the background
is launch another shell

360
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,640
with the ID of the context you wanna go
into

361
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,760
that's what I guess

362
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,000
so I guess the but

363
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,340
Mike my perspective issue should be on

364
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:44,320
in some other way so

365
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,490
a.m. I told you wanna show you some

366
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:52,570
Asian stuff when I found these
vulnerabilities I was looking around to

367
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,550
see if there was a DeLorean wrong
because

368
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:58,160
I felt like I am

369
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:03,970
back from the future or something group

370
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:08,690
ago and excellence

371
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:11,940
I actually have a minute an ex always

372
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,710
in my view where because

373
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:20,090
simply because there is a female version
an excellent

374
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:23,420
there is no real magic anybody can
download it from

375
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:26,570
from siskel Kong it's called the

376
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:32,570
one from we the one thousand comes with
the 60-day trial license

377
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:37,350
for anyone who wants to broken wrong
with the system

378
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,840
so back to the future

379
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,610
a.m. him y'all

380
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:48,310
sees

381
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:51,490
yeah will we're we're in the in the
linen the

382
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,760
in the Cisco system anyway

383
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,070
so wanna 11 one thing I

384
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:02,280
I tried 11 really early morning when I
was hungover and

385
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:07,090
been really know what I was doing I was
just pointing wrong with its and

386
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:11,760
I found out that can do

387
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:18,760
something like this

388
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:25,840
pop

389
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,190
back from the future good

390
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:33,029
I mean I tried to fall for these
presentations I tried to

391
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:36,190
to find references to when the Bhakti

392
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:39,789
vulnerability was first discovered and

393
00:26:39,789 --> 00:26:45,100
the first reference iPhone was from 1991
I think

394
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,840
and

395
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,289
yelping up in buzzing around with

396
00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:55,639
with with the stuff in life

397
00:26:55,639 --> 00:26:59,840
phone maybe five or six different places
we can do this

398
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:05,409
and that's simply because the in the
configuration files

399
00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:08,980
the the do some kind of input validation

400
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:13,389
but they have a kinda been put at ease
states like anything

401
00:27:13,389 --> 00:27:16,610
and that's what the user

402
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:19,980
and us we all know shes

403
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,679
invoked from the next the newspaper
perspective so the just shove everything

404
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:24,379
into

405
00:27:24,379 --> 00:27:28,970
into the backend and the

406
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:34,149
yeah glory good

407
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:41,149
a.m.

408
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,640
so for those have you are interested in

409
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,910
bug tracking there's a few bugs

410
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:58,130
you might be interested in in Truckee
the so those

411
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:01,530
is actually quite quite a few more

412
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:06,030
but these are the most interesting ones
when it comes to

413
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:13,030
from total annihilation compromise and

414
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:16,960
I'm also thanking one

415
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,190
Miguel Gonzalez from the PS or

416
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:24,590
right Ridge teen at Cisco because he's
been very helpful

417
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:29,100
he calls medications to see everything's
alright if I have released anything yet

418
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:35,440
and you once I threatened to resolve
anything because he didn't answer is the

419
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,440
his emails and then the day off to
recall

420
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:43,480
mean so yeah

421
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:50,480
it. questions as i said i

422
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,650
I i'm not a good siskel experts I don't
really know anything about the system

423
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,050
except that it's broken

424
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:13,050
in

425
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:21,860
check know best actually shell

426
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,050
yes I've actually had a question that
that

427
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:28,350
different conference and we had to take
it because I hadn't checked

428
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:32,780
the point so I had to go in and see but
there's nothing there

429
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:37,740
on a motion I didn't try the mean

430
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,890
I even tried to deploy my own chill

431
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:44,040
222 the to the

432
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,120
as the sages you can do you want them on

433
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,080
but that doesn't really work however
there are some really nifty stuff if

434
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,700
you're interested I can show you

435
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,260
in way

436
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:00,000
who group on this exit from this

437
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,710
craft this is the Linux

438
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:10,710
you'll

439
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:15,460
this is actually the shell which has
been executions when you log on

440
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:20,030
as a normal user it's a script day

441
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:24,960
and gets the

442
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,780
Journal complicated when you when you
start looking at is up in trying to

443
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,630
exploit this but my country dudes

444
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:35,660
the only thing over been able to do is
wrong

445
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:40,580
that's as a shell nothing else

446
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:47,580
you know its it looks really messed up

447
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,370
any stats on how many of these are out
there in the wild

448
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:02,790
a.m. workforce I know those

449
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:06,600
I'm from Sweden we have maybe six or
seven of them

450
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,800
in the country because there's some huge
I mean

451
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,430
you need to have like a review your
status and when these

452
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:16,900
and where I found this was actually a
customer of mine

453
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,910
is one of the bigger banks in Sweden

454
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:25,260
who was rebuilding the whole internet
banking environment so

455
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:28,790
site hasn't providers have something
like this

456
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:32,570
probably probably the I mean you buy
these

457
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:37,700
big is a model for about 250,000 euros

458
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,980
and yeah

459
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:47,980
you

460
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,780
couple yeah so what are you guys gonna
do about it

461
00:31:54,780 --> 00:32:00,630
watches retention

462
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:06,040
you know that you can

463
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,790
last school for the source code tonight
you can

464
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:13,550
actually other you can do the same
because

465
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:18,380
salinas system what what's in the
criminal what they change their

466
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:23,730
they have to right right normally on
support page

467
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:26,770
its products email

468
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:31,750
source necks rights

469
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:37,470
come just you have to email right so
that could be

470
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:40,640
maybe your way K

471
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,360
probably do that either haven't really
thought about use I'm not really into

472
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:44,860
these

473
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:50,250
all licensing your was a good idea

474
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:57,250
any other questions yeah but there

475
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:07,770
decide see see bach

476
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:11,179
them are there any remotely exploitable
stuff because

477
00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:14,740
for your text actual local user

478
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:18,360
you to write exactly exactly I haven't
