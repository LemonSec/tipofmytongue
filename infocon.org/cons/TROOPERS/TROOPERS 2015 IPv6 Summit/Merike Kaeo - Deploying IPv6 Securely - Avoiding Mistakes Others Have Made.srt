1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,530
10 so arm

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:07,210
so gonna spend the next hour-and-a-half
talking about

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,660
arm really architect secure networks

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:16,650
chrome you have ipv6 boy coming United

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,060
Boyd six-month me

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,439
so arm

7
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:28,369
just you know I I have up I feel all

8
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:32,700
okay I started kinda when I started with
I

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,270
or here

10
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:41,420
but whatever since 2004

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,500
I'm but it's interesting because

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,260
from a security perspective the only
thing

13
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,980
changes that people are paying a little
bit more keyword

14
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,500
really arm I

15
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,390
last year think on arm

16
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:06,560
and terms a standards and best practices

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,860
so I'm talk about it in the mood for
different way

18
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,619
I'm said

19
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,770
you know basically of production myself

20
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,479
and also talk about the six requirements
people never look at that

21
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,110
arm under the point ipv6 networks they
just wanna

22
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,210
you know make packets call the ipv6
transport

23
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:32,390
you know make sure that nothing breaks
for but then they go

24
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:39,390
oh yes purity that's really up

25
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,560
secure ipv6 infrastructure a lot of
people like to call themselves

26
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,840
network engineers right the key word
being

27
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,189
engineer and are you actually doing in
the engineering

28
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,070
when you're architecting ipv6 deployment
are you just turning on

29
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,570
and rule

30
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:03,399
of you know heard practices 6
appointments but looking at the apt by

31
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:07,100
data and I P six a sec fit

32
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,349
good and the latest technology
developments

33
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,480
so I looked up at me arm

34
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,239
I I'm I start building backbones and

35
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:21,849
II on spoke with me very early

36
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:25,040
and ok a lot of their equipment all the
time

37
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,870
and so they hired and I ended up doing a
lot of things

38
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:35,870
up arm then up

39
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:40,579
and then in nineteen said

40
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:44,030
I keep K no

41
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,560
I'd we should do some with security

42
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,000
up

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,970
because I was here and you know nobody
ever

44
00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:01,540
so I hope

45
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,889
and that got me very here yup

46
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:08,640
way

47
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,329
and I'll up

48
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:15,220
year and it was quite interesting

49
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:21,329
because and for doing and I'm

50
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:26,739
I forgot to mention that the other day
but up

51
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:30,310
would

52
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,709
my early crap

53
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:39,049
and nope

54
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:42,930
me

55
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:47,180
up

56
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:54,180
but I can very month up

57
00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:01,560
so I don't know up

58
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,040
on really about security and so

59
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,349
so when looking at

60
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:13,560
secured arm I mean a lot of

61
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,489
I mean were are we trying to protect
against

62
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:20,579
you know some people go crazy and just
say

63
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,400
security consultant everything and
secure

64
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,560
yet what you trying to achieve you know
if if

65
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,419
something about me more for an
embarrassment and fear you know

66
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:35,280
by go out of business really you have to

67
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,409
these trade-offs and you have to do list
now earth and you have to think about

68
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:43,240
you know what I believe that the most
important things from security aspect

69
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,879
and I we say no

70
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,409
let's go back to the fundamental when
you really care about

71
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:51,430
you want to understand what the threats
for two years environment

72
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,590
arm you want to understand where you
wanna ball

73
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,139
in an what is the actual birth your
business by

74
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:01,150
these days on I'm a chief security
officer my company

75
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,300
so I have to get budget right now I have
to

76
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,469
you know figure out where is the actual
address

77
00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:10,940
what is the impact why hear about this
vulnerability

78
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,849
today fourth impact so negative all that
all deal with that when

79
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:18,830
time and some really you do have to
think about

80
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,370
you know where my vulnerable what is the
address

81
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:27,050
and you want me to do anything about
this so

82
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,330
you know rough uncommon from a variety
of places

83
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,759
right there's purple hair we know this
now with pls

84
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,029
I I mean there's there's no announcement
probably every three months

85
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:41,340
right since May about some new
vulnerability

86
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,740
that's critical arm so protocols have
errors implementation

87
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,259
air arm offer both feature

88
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:52,389
from vendors alike up with our future
you know you like

89
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:56,500
about on active attacks

90
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,009
right these are happening more and more
I'm a lot

91
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:03,680
were you know that there's the doctor

92
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,990
criminal activity going on so these
active attacks

93
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:11,740
years ago weren't that great third
they're pretty seriously

94
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,819
there's and of course configuration
States

95
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:19,520
and so if you bad thing or a something
and routing

96
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,279
you know or configure filter right back
thing

97
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,870
sometimes as

98
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:31,610
up here sorry got pop

99
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,120
used for reconnaissance on the wire

100
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,289
a up

101
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:41,370
know where the eye and

102
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:45,000
what hit by the vendors and of course

103
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,460
number ap

104
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,310
so if we look at what somebody

105
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,330
you I'm my you can you can

106
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:59,270
drop from the network you can send are
math

107
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,979
right I traffic on are

108
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:06,039
replay passengers modify them transit

109
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:09,570
are right Melissa coding people into
running at

110
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:13,500
writing from phishing attacks your first
impact poor

111
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,190
exploiting bum offer for them

112
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:20,800
way to think about and when you're
looking at you infrastructure

113
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,580
law because on camera environment you
are

114
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,889
component all gone whether not nothing

115
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:32,300
wall if you're bigger you just have
mourned by pain

116
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,919
popping up

117
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,240
but you basically have the central
portion

118
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,370
the basically the backbone network that
could be one router

119
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,800
which is it could be about whatever your
back on

120
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,320
and then you're connecting either
customer

121
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,979
appears arm you know all the branches
and of course we have the

122
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:57,850
on responsible for your arm

123
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,949
operation and you know sometime

124
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:04,540
some Johnson security operation

125
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,530
arm but the key point is right I mean
you have to look at

126
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,630
of by here

127
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,919
so I right how can you actually secure

128
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:17,940
everything devices

129
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,960
than everything

130
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,250
by 19th in fourth

131
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:30,450
your network operator cool so

132
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,510
you know again I keep talking about you
know having a

133
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:38,180
no engineering architecture so you need
to understand

134
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:42,510
problem the point I P right what is the
problem

135
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:48,839
security thank arm are you where are you
deploying it re

136
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:51,880
courtroom or

137
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,650
for and also looking at you know what do
you have your

138
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,480
your your security concerns and
typically

139
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,130
kinda break it down you know the clock
sir logical access

140
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:06,760
the controller management plane running
main data plan

141
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,089
he's a very logical ways to think about

142
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:13,410
on you know putting in some kind of
security controls

143
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:16,860
and then also have procedures in place
printer

144
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,970
response and me that speaks a lot to the
auditing

145
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,850
I logging and all speak a little bit
about you know

146
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,710
different on logging on

147
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,190
happen this is something that I
personally have I P

148
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:35,840
working pension so

149
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,240
you want to keep in mind

150
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,350
right you want data access on the
network earth

151
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,920
making information the spaces

152
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:54,400
confidentiality I arm

153
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,490
ensuring that yep of

154
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:02,460
are preventing intrusion and on and

155
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,940
the reef start with the service life
because

156
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,960
security difficult security

157
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,980
from them and over the lower

158
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,350
here's up

159
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:20,350
side AP you know my

160
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:25,220
okay me for me simply trying you know

161
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,670
whenever some other app hey but I was
thinking about

162
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:33,850
and

163
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,350
really security snapback it's just that
there's a lot

164
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:41,710
and knowing where the details of that
you have to look at

165
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:45,520
have become or and I can't stress enough

166
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,380
that you really have to are hear you

167
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,550
are mitigation thing and

168
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:56,840
you know people silly thing

169
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,840
you know be more secure I'm

170
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,270
and up for me. by years ago

171
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:06,570
I'm

172
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,030
small up in common I'm

173
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:13,110
invading have any to the master

174
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,290
year 2001

175
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:21,300
and it was interesting cuz I thought of
comp

176
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,750
right so I would use that one stopping

177
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,390
you know I'm that anybody might probably

178
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:32,090
on everything am gonna knock

179
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:36,250
people came up to me and I but your
security consultant I mean

180
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,980
you know everything clear Mike
absolutely and I hope that somebody

181
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,460
actually

182
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,970
the password logged into those must
something

183
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,570
because about answers about

184
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:51,790
I did a risk assessment me it's a
win-win situation

185
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:57,260
nothing happens me cause all those now
Mike their emails that I know exactly

186
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:01,330
you know anybody around here thank you

187
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,610
when people look at it Mike you know you
have to yes

188
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:09,940
songpop

189
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:14,070
that so if you start looking at arm you
know look at ipv6

190
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:17,940
and look at the kind of a security
architecture you want

191
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,000
me the same fundamental requirements

192
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,220
for what you trying to protect against
up to 5 p.m.

193
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,280
496 arm for

194
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,670
when you're starting to deploy our and
some %uh view ready to pour

195
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:35,160
really no think about some things here
arm

196
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,200
in others there's no for behavior in

197
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,250
possibility because of the extensive
after thing

198
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,860
II very much just like from people

199
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,970
say I want feature 1301 exactly what I'd

200
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,720
or really so you want

201
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,949
band-aid solution know that we I P word

202
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:59,149
all and you wanna continue right

203
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:02,449
not a good idea so in some way right

204
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:05,529
ipv6 was also created

205
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:09,480
and you know think about IPSec happen

206
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,139
13 confidentiality from Thunder to the
recipient

207
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:17,179
great idea well everybody wants to do
not

208
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:20,759
frightened everything else that they've
before

209
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:24,079
so there's problems there but is up
something

210
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,779
you wouldn't want your environment art
so where's not not a realistic advantage

211
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:30,300
versus actually hindrance

212
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,990
and cut a mobile app taken into account

213
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,040
with ipv6 multiple offices interface

214
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,199
so with the but you do

215
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:44,319
there standpoint on

216
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:48,730
and then a poor thing keep

217
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,769
on people I it was interesting

218
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:55,569
me where whenever pointed out issued Rep

219
00:13:55,569 --> 00:14:00,279
like up before I up

220
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:03,790
all right the run for pockets evolving

221
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:10,110
cannot be so to me it was you know we
weren't being engineers in terms of

222
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,100
figure out the issues

223
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,809
resolve the issues by noonish resolve
those issues and keep on

224
00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:20,100
so to me that wanted

225
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,920
I think people really the point so if
you're looking at

226
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,670
you know New York security well
fundamental

227
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:34,270
but with the same for both ipv6 or ipv4

228
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,950
arm networks are the security properties
in service

229
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:41,310
by what do you want to protect and work
more Tom

230
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,520
the properties are II arm

231
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:49,420
up security for example you know the
integrity the confidentiality having

232
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,620
authorized access

233
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:55,600
government same but with different for
ipv6 architectures

234
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,090
is that you've got to multiple addresses
per interface the poor cooperation

235
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:03,820
I E are our neighbor discovery and some
other

236
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,360
work on the month there's more
information right that was done

237
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,230
deliberately

238
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:11,500
because at the time that ipv6 is
architected

239
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,550
they were thinking that hey you know all
this on

240
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:18,450
are a changing addresses know about
takes a long time coming automated

241
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:18,950
somehow

242
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:23,370
course now practice they found that from
about automation isn't really practical

243
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,570
but so you have to think about it on

244
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:30,700
also potential application integration
and what I mean by that

245
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:35,170
is ours in an environment in 2007 were
due to security suspend

246
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:40,200
for the ipv6 rollout yes there was 2007
it was a very large large company

247
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,200
and they were arm

248
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,060
creating there are other thing plan and
it took him a couple months

249
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:51,130
know Michael so difficult about that and
they were like well you know we want to

250
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,400
look at a new paradigm

251
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,650
because for adverse thing you know that
ties into how we do our filtering

252
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,360
strategy

253
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,860
and we want to keep our filters to
minimum in our filters application-based

254
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,800
so can you actually high in somehow
you're dealing with application

255
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,670
into the overall advertising strategy I
and you can't do that

256
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:14,260
after the fact but you have to do that
right in the beginning

257
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:18,700
actually on was talking to somebody
couple months ago whether

258
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,760
other very in March March March ipv6
only network that

259
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,930
are being planned for and they're doing
something similar

260
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:32,930
both quite interesting and course in
others the ever-evolving products

261
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,220
me think about you know where is
automation advantage

262
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,759
versus a security risk there's always a
trade-off he's a proper

263
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:44,549
ability birth all right apart no

264
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:50,809
on how I ipv4 conference going to be
around at least

265
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,949
him to say up the up-front

266
00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:57,669
of way so you always have to think about
that

267
00:16:57,669 --> 00:17:04,669
and you know what the best for doing
that on

268
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:11,110
and the last point also with security
services have been used to adhere to the

269
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,200
security policy

270
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,560
requirements by are million them nations

271
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,610
I P for from patients so I have to write

272
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:22,920
security policy my environment and I
have to thank

273
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,170
okay so how are they up

274
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,400
document hand

275
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,500
there the operation no

276
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,760
movie

277
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,700
policies and even some other compliance
mandates that I look at my

278
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:44,050
okay so they some rip

279
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:47,590
way I boy early in

280
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:52,180
most of it yes

281
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,540
the one thing for network address
translation

282
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:01,210
has become such a security feature from
any why

283
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:05,550
down so

284
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:09,919
I am NOT a fan

285
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,580
so arm you know I P six automation I
think most

286
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:17,250
Republic where these arm so from the
particle

287
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,500
capabilities right arm neighbor
discovery

288
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,140
was created so that it will allow no 3
each other

289
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:28,190
them segment so automatically create
verses and

290
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:32,049
find the neighbors I'm also a router
advertisement

291
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:35,539
no automatically create their own yep

292
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:40,350
a gap

293
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,399
for you arm automatically

294
00:18:43,399 --> 00:18:46,950
free the address is rape

295
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:51,620
now of course security issues a pretty
bad right direction

296
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,690
now are on

297
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:58,750
so when you're looking at

298
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,990
arm you know and come back the architect

299
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:05,409
right you really wanna think about your
address and name

300
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:08,600
scheme and and really you know arm

301
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,850
have been a number of different
environments were they haven't really

302
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,190
thought about other thing

303
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:16,190
and then later on they have to actually
go back in

304
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:19,620
recreate the routers think plan because
they realize that the filtering was

305
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,779
getting so out of hand

306
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:23,990
and for anybody that you know is have

307
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:27,600
created you know firewall rules about
you know that you don't wanna touch from

308
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,029
you know you wanna touch miss as little
as possible

309
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:34,340
and especially got thousands know the
environment

310
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:39,139
even if you have five I because it's
like one day you understand exactly what

311
00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:40,110
you configuring

312
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:43,299
and then you bring thank got these

313
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:47,620
10 mines mine ordering and

314
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,669
nope not as easy as as as it may seem

315
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:54,029
you have to think about back towards
them you know on

316
00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:57,630
you know back up traffic not a contest
so

317
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:03,230
you know easy in theory but harder in
practice arm

318
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,260
right

319
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,290
the last point okay in this is the thing
I'm I

320
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,450
I always come back to security is and
always will be

321
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:15,690
a an afterthought I wish it weren't

322
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,260
I'd are as i've seen. deployment there
really is

323
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,200
armed because there's three things in my
mind that you have to think about

324
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,250
from soccer security identity which is
the authentication authorization

325
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:32,130
integrity right meaning that you
actually have some kind integrity

326
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:32,910
protection

327
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:37,210
either for your management proposal a
reporter calls knowing that I was

328
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,380
actually the person that sent you the
traffic

329
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,560
and an auditing logging in management

330
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,560
confidentiality to me up but for policy
decision

331
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,100
and I know the people talking about
encrypt everywhere

332
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,220
II we say that's a great concept and
theory

333
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,990
but in practice what happens if you lose
your keys by

334
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:01,530
youth and market your data again art and
so I have nothing against

335
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:05,080
confidentiality but when it comes down
to practicality

336
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,670
Care Bear I care about that more right

337
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:13,110
going the other complaints about the
fundamental

338
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:16,230
right arm you need to figure all

339
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:21,150
need to figure out what you want to do
in your environment

340
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,270
and over the last 10 years arm at

341
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:28,130
in other and various different are
scenarios considered

342
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:31,870
but you know for over 10 years I miss
last 48 is a small

343
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:35,140
allocation throughout evolved and so

344
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,710
on in terms of what I S p's will filter
on arm

345
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:42,930
from database from fast 64 there'll be
probably for the next twenty years

346
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,710
people saying that was a really bad idea

347
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,770
yeah probably but you know something
that's what it is

348
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:54,530
I some notable last before and
point-to-point links there's an RC that

349
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,940
was written were actually the
recommendation was last 120

350
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:02,940
I want well people some people thought
that should be a slow 64

351
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:08,340
more or less most people have decided
that you know you should use this law 64

352
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,870
for your point the point LinkedIn
allocate last one 27th

353
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:14,230
when you can

354
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,850
and I just saw dropped actually in the
eye

355
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:22,450
yep that's being are written on to
explain from pick you up

356
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,660
arm and

357
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,550
really when you're thinking about how
you allocate I mean it if similar

358
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:35,030
reform in there are a lot of addresses
but keep in mind that you know hopefully

359
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:40,150
around for the next on no I'll 20 30 40
years

360
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,340
arm and so

361
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:47,230
are make sure that also you know you're
looking at thing boundaries in

362
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:51,179
up some space that in KC you know you
allocated

363
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:56,059
I'll I'm you know one space that you can
actually have US

364
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:59,320
depending on you know your

365
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,520
picture so

366
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,480
arm you know after saying and routing

367
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,840
has worked for about 15 years you know
really there's not not too many problems

368
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,480
on be an ass and everything else is
still evolving

369
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,130
just keep that in mind so would be an
ass

370
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:22,340
a lot of the issues are come from you
know when you are getting a ver

371
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:26,309
record refers quite a record with are
you know happy eyeball

372
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:30,230
backup quite fascinating days on
depending on the implementation

373
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:35,630
and then what's involving are really
controls for layer 2 and layer 3

374
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:41,010
arm you know their store bombing because
there so issues in terms of spoofing

375
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:44,120
and on potential now serves the power

376
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,820
so the I yes it's working on playing
vendors are important

377
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:53,450
certain work in the eye yes or their
running come up with their own

378
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:56,200
but just keep in mind that these things
involving

379
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,940
K which is OK arm and also %um

380
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,240
galaxy with portable are arm

381
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,610
and also the monitoring them for his own
and the application

382
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:11,670
what they do on transition technologies

383
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:14,920
I remember being when I got involved in
I

384
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:19,790
ipv6 security 2004 because I was living
in Venice Beach at the time in

385
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:20,580
California

386
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,130
in there was an ipv6 conference in Santa
Monica

387
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:27,770
and at the time I think there were

388
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:31,990
33 a

389
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:36,900
the conditions 6 technologies arm there
were being discussed

390
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,980
33 different proposals arm

391
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:44,250
you know over the last decade there's
been a lot of different transition

392
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:48,120
technologies that have been discussed
the zip and standardize

393
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,670
arm summer being deprecated just because

394
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:55,310
a when when environment found that he

395
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:59,450
you now they want to go to ipv6 and
they've realized that they saw how to

396
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:02,060
support ipv4 and how do you do that

397
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:06,670
arm sometimes they figured out what was
the easiest in their environment

398
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:10,170
not became an IQ proposal for transition
technology

399
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:15,340
arm so in all six the fort reno ice atop

400
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:20,510
on not 64 were basically the first
couple that were

401
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:24,440
thought up that way you know this might
be a good idea but then later on as

402
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,170
people were doing of appointment there
were other one

403
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:31,120
your flight XRD carrier-grade NAT Nat
444

404
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,560
I'm I will say that I work for next
boeing's I mentioned earlier

405
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:40,160
thousand we had a strategy to actually

406
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,870
arm turn the ground station the five
satellite ground station

407
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:47,910
to do it. 6 and our decision had been

408
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:53,100
donated in the reason why is because we
look at the operational costs from

409
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:53,979
arm

410
00:25:53,979 --> 00:25:57,789
I from the people on personal
perspective than what we're paying

411
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:01,799
to actually get to the need to be six
then eventually want to get

412
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:05,940
to it was much better to do that
immediately then to work from some

413
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,669
transition technologies and then go to
that later

414
00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:12,259
so that was just that decision that was
made about

415
00:26:12,259 --> 00:26:16,379
time and I was actually part about that
arm that group

416
00:26:16,379 --> 00:26:19,590
strategy and I actually still believe
today

417
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:23,840
that if you can think about going native
b6 sooner rather than later

418
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,599
so do stock why

419
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:30,929
arm a lot of people are trying to
utilize that

420
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:36,080
arm you know some with that of another
and basically trying to help build an

421
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,899
ipv6

422
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:41,629
only native infrastructure arm it
assumes that you have an ipv6 network

423
00:26:41,629 --> 00:26:47,840
and enables you to pawn off ipv4 over it
on the premises but your network is

424
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,539
primarily ipv6

425
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:52,919
arm but that a the services primarily I

426
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:57,450
before song that from a lot of people
using

427
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:02,279
and from conversations I yesterday arm
they said also that yeah I mean people

428
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:04,899
are finding that it's so hard to write
Iran

429
00:27:04,899 --> 00:27:08,619
that basically and the problems that
they're having that if the poor thing

430
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:10,879
punctures forcing function

431
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:14,659
for folks to now look at needed better
I'm buying me a

432
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:18,720
up a good thing 6rd

433
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,879
something that I am also have
proliferated

434
00:27:22,879 --> 00:27:27,749
quite a bit on and tries to help with
building a dual stack infrastructure

435
00:27:27,749 --> 00:27:31,599
on a Fran 3.0 fr provided

436
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:34,879
an application that only ran on ipv6

437
00:27:34,879 --> 00:27:38,200
and a actually came up with an ipv6 are

438
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,629
I think four-point structure that
provide that service

439
00:27:42,629 --> 00:27:44,270
want

440
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:48,420
a call arm with ipv4 plus arm

441
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:52,450
I V ipv6 over ipv4 and the problem

442
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:56,640
nap so

443
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,680
arm in the talk about this listing: a
bunch of different transition

444
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,740
acknowledges the people you live thing
idea

445
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:07,610
for now scores of people

446
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:13,520
on but really in in my mind by when
you're looking at transition technology

447
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,120
think really carefully

448
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,870
about what you need in your environment
and whether or not you can go to need

449
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:26,809
6 rather than later

450
00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:30,760
sorrow

451
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:35,010
I it was always wondering before I
really got into ipv6 why are people

452
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,539
talking about security

453
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:39,799
bill then I mean you know either the I
yes I

454
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:44,200
appear in the hallway conversations and
then I never heard about security

455
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,490
bill and but you know when I'm not five
pars

456
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:52,840
to guard for the conference is in 2000
2003 I kept hearing the security bill

457
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,909
then and one day I was like alright

458
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:59,299
let me see what this is all about and so

459
00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:03,049
about the three thing so

460
00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:06,360
after prime that ipv6 was being I I

461
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,299
architected there were some well-known
fragmentation attacks

462
00:29:10,299 --> 00:29:13,710
Nike I don't know Lamphere summer anime

463
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:17,140
one-on-one White House forum was
fragmentation was one of those attacked

464
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:17,880
by

465
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:23,500
now pretty widely known and so are the
engineers were like okay we gotta

466
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,780
you know make sure that an ipv6 we
handle fragmentation

467
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:30,610
better so you know you put their so they
prohibited

468
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:33,780
in the standard its prohibited a

469
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:38,110
to have fragmentation buy into media
devices overlapping fragments

470
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:42,539
not allowed and devices must drop me a
sample packet for last min 1280

471
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:45,809
by this is what the standard says that

472
00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:49,880
doesn't necessarily mean that for
implementation do mine

473
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,400
just just reality check here also there
with the broadcast

474
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,760
arm attacks right again I think clancy

475
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,510
or summer II was get the two confused
arm

476
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:04,580
but so in ipv6 they removed the conserve

477
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:09,049
dedicate a broadcast and there's also a
specific language in the specifications

478
00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:12,530
to avoid ICMP v6 amplification attacks

479
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:17,549
and I think that was actually the Smurf
attack and then

480
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:21,780
the biggest reason that they talked
about IP I our security being built in

481
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:25,330
was because the standard mandated that
IPSec

482
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:32,330
be implemented to be ipv6 compliant now
back in 2004 2005 I saw a lot of

483
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:35,669
ipv6 implementations that did not have
any I

484
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:40,480
second minted I it's okay so they
weren't standards compliant but

485
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,450
so why

486
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:45,879
right people were still trying to plan 6
answer really

487
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:49,919
arm you know the myth around hey
deployed because it's more secure

488
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,529
on was a policy and its too bad because

489
00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:57,700
you know than 1 people found out that
while it's not really secure so why

490
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,559
deploy it

491
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,090
by the calls this whole issue
uncomfortable while redeploying anyway

492
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:05,299
in advance the place in RVC became
forcing

493
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:09,509
arm so

494
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:12,950
you know but for you do have to think
about securities

495
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:19,100
so alright how do you start

496
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,169
and I had a couple

497
00:31:22,169 --> 00:31:26,259
I and the first thing that people always

498
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:29,860
homie was are you're right or

499
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:33,720
number one wall don't break anything
this

500
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,539
yes we know terrible yes we everywhere

501
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:42,269
yes we're using advanced not are but we
know that I will never get it now

502
00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:45,659
right our ties you know that

503
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:49,330
you know everybody does and

504
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:52,690
also right they said don't we architect

505
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:55,869
her problem emplacement

506
00:31:55,869 --> 00:31:59,840
so

507
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,840
who on

508
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,940
and really you know you have to think
about

509
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:11,539
you know what is best for your
environment

510
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:15,379
future network operation

511
00:32:15,379 --> 00:32:19,710
better because the water pipe

512
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:22,960
10 which is Kandhamal

513
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,940
were really terrible breaks so my

514
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:31,830
that on art is something

515
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:35,409
rape the post or

516
00:32:35,409 --> 00:32:39,059
right the problems come and when when
something

517
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:42,059
issue so how quickly

518
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:46,289
hurt

519
00:32:46,289 --> 00:32:49,600
so you're going to the poor ipv6

520
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,769
my eternal ipv6 enable what else do you
do

521
00:32:53,769 --> 00:32:58,210
right and a lot of people don't think
about actually

522
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,549
securing their device right if it
secured

523
00:33:01,549 --> 00:33:05,629
with ipv4 you need to do the same thing
with ipv6

524
00:33:05,629 --> 00:33:08,649
to me that's not feature parity

525
00:33:08,649 --> 00:33:13,220
that's just making sure that your are
putting in the right controls

526
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:16,230
for you know securing access to your
device

527
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:21,139
right and you also have to secure the
management plan

528
00:33:21,139 --> 00:33:26,039
arm and you know the script overlooked
in ipv4 small

529
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:30,549
and so with ipv6 right and with a lot of
different

530
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:36,440
arm the knowledge service attack now
coming to the surface with NPP and a lot

531
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,549
of other protocols

532
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:40,659
on you know we have to be better
protecting them

533
00:33:40,659 --> 00:33:44,590
and so you have to put in the the
mechanism either about via

534
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:48,429
some kinda access-list control or arm
rate-limiting

535
00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:54,740
by it for the fact protocols and so this
is true for both ipv4 and ipv6

536
00:33:54,740 --> 00:34:01,129
on can even begin to tell you how many
environments i've seen where they decide

537
00:34:01,129 --> 00:34:01,619
to

538
00:34:01,619 --> 00:34:05,610
you know slowly get the operational
folks used to having ipv6 in their

539
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:06,299
environment

540
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:11,589
turn on ipv6 and put no controls and for
the SSH access

541
00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:14,790
and I actually did that by accident

542
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:19,669
also in my home router and I had I could
be four go down

543
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:23,020
turn hours on a conference someone might
oh yeah

544
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,250
I can get in VIP

545
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:29,399
there yeah well now like okay but this
is bad it really put in the filter

546
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:32,710
I was happy that day the up however

547
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:37,060
by it I I'm I'm realize that hey you
know I keep telling people about putting

548
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:37,950
infielder I'm

549
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:41,070
that myself well and so

550
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:44,879
you know you really have to look at it
something that I've always find find

551
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,419
interesting though is that

552
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:50,169
aren't you have different syntax usually
forearm

553
00:34:50,169 --> 00:34:53,940
ipv4 and ipv6 and matt hasn't really
gone away

554
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:58,550
so you can just replace your ipv4 syntax
ipv6

555
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:01,610
which means that your scripts also have
to get updated

556
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:05,860
so

557
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:10,050
S&P arm we had a proper yesterday

558
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:13,720
actually by Gabriel in the other but
became

559
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:18,040
really great of up I

560
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:22,730
sex and basically right the realities
are that

561
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:27,290
today arm ipv6 need support Israel

562
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:30,380
it depends on the vendor depends on the
platform

563
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,810
on S&P over 6 p.m.

564
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:37,220
for is also notable arm

565
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,650
but the realities are them

566
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:43,059
is problem will be done

567
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:46,609
using on

568
00:35:46,609 --> 00:35:50,890
and then you know years up

569
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:54,930
your or so

570
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:58,890
arm 10 things to know about I

571
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:02,190
environment is that years ago

572
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:06,769
on when the standard started crying

573
00:36:06,769 --> 00:36:10,180
they did it so that there was a

574
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:15,630
I for me already changed

575
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:19,640
last year's and now there's protocol
version independent

576
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,829
okay so they applied both whether not
using

577
00:36:22,829 --> 00:36:28,460
fourth transport and awesome the latest
ones listed here are the IP forwarding

578
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,569
table may have been

579
00:36:29,569 --> 00:36:34,430
mid-flight p on as with the pic that in
the talk yesterday

580
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:38,839
where cable actually walked through
different Juniper and Cisco devices them

581
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:42,019
k devices arm support is

582
00:36:42,019 --> 00:36:45,440
is random right and so really

583
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,730
arm if you're looking to do any he

584
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:52,109
I support with with ipv6

585
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:55,759
devices than you really do want to look
at

586
00:36:55,759 --> 00:36:59,210
on doing he walked really understand
what supported

587
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:02,539
because sometimes the documentation is
on

588
00:37:02,539 --> 00:37:06,480
and the US and while it says hey this
supported

589
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,249
you will find that not all so

590
00:37:10,249 --> 00:37:13,920
sorry do halfback check arm

591
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,489
also with S&P ride arm can you actually

592
00:37:17,489 --> 00:37:20,900
utilize ipv6 transport from the

593
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:24,269
agent to the collector and the
collective to the viewer I

594
00:37:24,269 --> 00:37:28,619
that's not always the case so you really
have that out on the fender bender

595
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:32,279
basis and then viewers they support ipv6

596
00:37:32,279 --> 00:37:35,519
on so

597
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:39,109
nothing to look out for when you're
doing an SNMP walked up to

598
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:46,109
impact

599
00:37:46,549 --> 00:37:48,950
yup

600
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:52,289
arm callin

601
00:37:52,289 --> 00:37:56,130
in some cases of

602
00:37:56,130 --> 00:38:00,539
five-part apart so I did a couple

603
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:04,309
recent see devices

604
00:38:04,309 --> 00:38:08,119
so the popcorns for the next yes I

605
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,160
that ample

606
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:18,160
for you yup

607
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:24,170
and our this actually happened in one
environment

608
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:28,820
on this is also something to look out
for in this speaks to the knowing

609
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:32,390
which are address is being from the
interface

610
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:36,610
you know for the source and so in this
environment right they created global

611
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:38,080
unique addresses

612
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,710
and then in there a in their router and
the

613
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:45,050
proper less they explicitly now allow
the

614
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:49,000
arm gall bladder through well it turned
out that

615
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,420
the axo snmp-server use the UI 64

616
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:56,530
address as a source address so with the
night at the router

617
00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:01,630
through you actually have to look at
what you actually application

618
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:07,170
you by with force today pic so

619
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:10,340
its makes ipv6 quite interesting it up

620
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:17,340
you learn to use Wireshark really well
so

621
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:21,930
logging people love and hate logging I

622
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:25,300
you always want a large enough
information to be useful but not

623
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,220
overwhelming

624
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:30,359
anyone to create a backup plan for track
a blocking information

625
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:36,410
the fog for available and of course the
one thing I always ask is are you

626
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:39,650
timestamp synchronized people like pot I
N

627
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:45,109
and up yeah donna I mean when Finn
devices first came out that was the

628
00:39:45,109 --> 00:39:46,410
first thing I have on my

629
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:50,670
so how do you ensure that the you know
logs synchronized right on them

630
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:53,869
like now well we just make that
assumption my

631
00:39:53,869 --> 00:39:57,350
okay that's great for people five years
North devices

632
00:39:57,350 --> 00:40:01,710
but might be just garbage right as how
do you correlate

633
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,170
dialogue that you know

634
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:08,529
the I'm amp so these other fundamental
simple things right

635
00:40:08,529 --> 00:40:13,720
but you have to think about it so

636
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,299
when you're looking at locking by in
auditing arm

637
00:40:17,299 --> 00:40:20,769
can you actually listen arm I

638
00:40:20,769 --> 00:40:25,220
you know you think these protocols using
ipv4 and ipv6

639
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,660
transport right it's not just the given
I'm

640
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,999
and now I'll give another example so

641
00:40:31,999 --> 00:40:36,119
II didn't know this but six years ago I
was giving a talk at an Aug

642
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:40,359
on ipv6 security and I have that slide
up for Xfire

643
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:45,769
as a prime them synchronized right and I
have this woman in the audience who was

644
00:40:45,769 --> 00:40:49,319
actually the arm Area Director

645
00:40:49,319 --> 00:40:53,609
think or now she was the working group
chair for NTP

646
00:40:53,609 --> 00:40:59,970
and in her hugh was the document that
would actually standardized NTP over

647
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:04,839
6 and she said you know i've been in my
email Q and you shame me into finally

648
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:08,329
looking at it and sending it off so
about 25 standard

649
00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:11,930
missus like five or six years ago I

650
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:15,690
and sounds like no I didn't even realize
that the standard with

651
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:19,880
yet ratified for it to be over v6 you
know

652
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,589
and so on your it was fun interesting

653
00:41:23,589 --> 00:41:27,769
me so when you're looking at the Auto
management functionality

654
00:41:27,769 --> 00:41:30,999
by do you have to actually after back
question

655
00:41:30,999 --> 00:41:35,309
is a supported over or because it's not
a given

656
00:41:35,309 --> 00:41:38,539
on there's a lotta I the point

657
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:41,609
now and larger company were

658
00:41:41,609 --> 00:41:45,099
arm making the request the vendors and

659
00:41:45,099 --> 00:41:48,999
solve the problem always has been that
the vendor

660
00:41:48,999 --> 00:41:52,400
asking for the customer something the
customers are waiting for the vendor's

661
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,690
just to do something

662
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:57,460
yup

663
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:01,259
not paul also on lawyer over

664
00:42:01,259 --> 00:42:04,769
9 and I happened I promises

665
00:42:04,769 --> 00:42:08,869
yesterday I'm are deploying

666
00:42:08,869 --> 00:42:11,910
that have just made appointment

667
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:14,940
energize this we started

668
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:18,390
going ID

669
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:24,019
over 9 membership

670
00:42:24,019 --> 00:42:27,960
and so arm you know that's when I first
learned about

671
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,309
over 9 its ten years later I

672
00:42:31,309 --> 00:42:35,359
and many environment to utilize

673
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:39,890
low environment over

674
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:43,660
and I did a quick look

675
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:47,190
on pools action for the common schools

676
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:54,190
or I can't some other

677
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:02,369
so let's look at some other comment the
reason

678
00:43:02,369 --> 00:43:05,869
on and secure six networks

679
00:43:05,869 --> 00:43:09,190
so when you're looking had after thing I

680
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:13,270
phiri always nation aspect that

681
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:16,359
arm you know you put you static
addresses

682
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:20,819
but release date for configurations
probably what most people use

683
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:23,990
and I am are sometimes also statements
are

684
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:27,640
configuration on Pardesi addresses

685
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:31,579
course for created because everybody
wants your address up private

686
00:43:31,579 --> 00:43:34,940
and then there's that continues
controversy between

687
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:38,049
router advertisement using p sex

688
00:43:38,049 --> 00:43:41,779
and I'm not sure that ever makers of
Michael

689
00:43:41,779 --> 00:43:45,289
or I'm so we all know

690
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:48,839
up right part both

691
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:52,260
so you have a link local interface arm

692
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:55,279
any is fine cast address on them

693
00:43:55,279 --> 00:43:58,480
back address on cast artist

694
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,480
with a no smoking any other group and

695
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,510
I did this on my Mac yesterday just the
crime scene

696
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:12,270
like here okay you know and I see at all
surprised because I'm used to seeing a

697
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:16,400
on you know the FFF me the link local
address on a global address

698
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,670
Michael the third one hit the routing

699
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:23,520
first enough that ok man but then

700
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:29,290
you know on the front like okay you know
so they keep adding

701
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:32,930
more and I'm going right so when I some
traffic

702
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:36,420
you know when I'm prime up

703
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:42,230
which why but this kid

704
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:46,550
again I don't know what happened I

705
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:50,280
got the temporary address you know
privacy on earth

706
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,640
and and you know here think low pollen

707
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:57,700
and all that now there's more you

708
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:01,250
also yesterday health

709
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:05,920
really interesting to find now that
there are some operating sys were

710
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,000
user privacy at this they don't time now
sup

711
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:16,839
right that an interesting

712
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:20,430
so really a practice by what people do
is

713
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:24,279
they define static addresses for
anything that's really critical

714
00:45:24,279 --> 00:45:28,579
so on privacy at this is

715
00:45:28,579 --> 00:45:32,519
I mean there used by default by save
this number it's really buy microsoft

716
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:33,640
arm

717
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:37,650
but for me I don't have anything against
privacy officers

718
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:41,950
as long as I can correlate on the
information to log

719
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:45,160
by on the security person when the
incident happened

720
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:48,710
I wanna know was responsible writers
Melissa

721
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:53,200
our summer I see on the network but the
traffic this war which both the spending

722
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,729
and so as long as you can correlate
logging information

723
00:45:57,729 --> 00:46:03,319
and no which privacy address it is that
corresponds to certain log entries or

724
00:46:03,319 --> 00:46:03,920
certain

725
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,339
you know behavior I don't care what
happens to use

726
00:46:07,339 --> 00:46:13,630
it but I've also found that the ATP v6
is used in a lot of environments exactly

727
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:14,680
for this purpose

728
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:19,609
I want to know which device which
address when and that specifically so

729
00:46:19,609 --> 00:46:21,089
that you can correlate

730
00:46:21,089 --> 00:46:24,759
any kinda information when something
like this happens and you know

731
00:46:24,759 --> 00:46:30,049
and so there's that trade-off in terms
of do you wanna know which machine was

732
00:46:30,049 --> 00:46:31,180
that sent something

733
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:38,180
verses yes absolutely I want to know

734
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,990
and not not as always a fascinating
topic on

735
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:46,800
I I really kinda gave up

736
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,740
in terms of trying to convince people
that not was not a good idea

737
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:55,890
when I learned that there were six
separate implementations on the market

738
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:58,099
that did not fix the mouth

739
00:46:58,099 --> 00:47:02,130
right which is not standardized but they
actually

740
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:05,970
you know translating ipv6 address
through neither I address

741
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:10,380
and I said okay you know people will do
whatever they want

742
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:14,010
appointment on my recommendation will
always be

743
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:17,380
to arm not utilize that one

744
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:20,670
not necessary my and

745
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:25,800
a and not just I'm with security there's
never a

746
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,520
there's best practices but you have to
look at which

747
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:36,520
best Proctor's applied your environment

748
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:41,290
and this should be pretty where a lot of
people also

749
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:45,050
arm you know how does the node get
initialized more although automated

750
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:49,230
arm things that happened that from a
security perspective right

751
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:53,430
you wanna be where r and where the
potential vulnerabilities pack factors

752
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:56,589
so you know in theory got this

753
00:47:56,589 --> 00:48:00,559
trust router it sends a routing
advertisement so that

754
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,829
arm you know the horse can create their
own a

755
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:07,420
well acceptable address and then you
have neighbor discovery

756
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:10,460
wright also so that horse they can
communicate with

757
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:14,150
I'm and in theory you had because Abbas

758
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:18,099
texan's send GA privacy at after saying

759
00:48:18,099 --> 00:48:21,740
and then also filtering mechanism that
will provide all the protection

760
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:25,500
now

761
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:30,140
practice you really have to think more
about how do you avoid spoofing

762
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:33,309
denial of service attacks arm on you

763
00:48:33,309 --> 00:48:38,569
avoid overriding houses I I was a huge
issue in the beginning with people then

764
00:48:38,569 --> 00:48:39,890
think about the fact that

765
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:45,049
I'll K you know somebody really over
cache memory

766
00:48:45,049 --> 00:48:48,049
and you know switching longer available

767
00:48:48,049 --> 00:48:52,170
on and you know there's mac filtering
make any sense

768
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:55,380
probably not mormon overhead

769
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:58,470
burden I'm maybe for you critical

770
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:04,299
devices using not and so wanna things
also it's getting better now

771
00:49:04,299 --> 00:49:07,339
time but host behaviors have to be
understood

772
00:49:07,339 --> 00:49:11,599
arm ascendancy GA I don't know or

773
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:15,430
anybody that's like them and I spoke

774
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:18,730
track just in case but

775
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:22,329
it was interesting to me because I think
the router vendors were the ones that

776
00:49:22,329 --> 00:49:24,010
actually implement the plan

777
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:27,250
yet the horse don't by Microsoft doesn't

778
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:30,319
and you would think that somebody like
like you know

779
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:33,670
a host operating system they're the ones
that most require that

780
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:37,960
so I've been kinda stupefied by that arm

781
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:41,809
and of course is more there to
mitigation techniques that are needed

782
00:49:41,809 --> 00:49:46,380
I you know to avoid arm Facebook thing
and knowledge services

783
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:50,410
ox so you know

784
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:55,230
just this is just an overview slide in
terms of anybody that doesn't know what

785
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:55,670
send

786
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:58,870
is on basic stands for Secure neighbor
discovery

787
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:02,090
and it it's supposed to protect against
full

788
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:05,630
messengers by to create false entries in
turn a broke ass

789
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:09,150
on you know dealing with neighbor on
reachability

790
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:14,420
texan failures arm Roberson solicitation
appetizing tax and so on

791
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:17,910
on but it doesn't are

792
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:21,170
protect against a few other things that
you know people

793
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:24,800
some people thought they will provide
confidentiality nope not at all

794
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,570
it also doesn't compensate for any you
know insecure

795
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:33,220
arm I link layer so there are things
that I can't protect against

796
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:38,190
I'm but like I said I mean secure
neighbor discovery send

797
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:42,410
I I know if nobody that using it anybody
in this room

798
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:46,950
yeah and so their school work going on
me I

799
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:50,860
here arm I'm gonna be there next week
and

800
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:54,670
I'm curious just you know maybe maybe
somebody in the government you know the

801
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:56,300
Don't Ask Don't Tell is using it

802
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:59,300
have no idea but I still follow it

803
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:03,440
because you never know I mean in concert

804
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,500
it's interesting and practice wait and
see

805
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:11,600
so but these are issues that

806
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:15,430
or more fundamental and and practical
right now so

807
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:19,240
you know better router advertisement and
CPB 6 filtering

808
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,900
and so most people that a the point in
larger

809
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:26,400
are environments have actually you know
been speaking to vendors

810
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,990
to create specific solutions because
they have that you can their

811
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:30,840
environments

812
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:34,370
on so you know broke are

813
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:37,460
RA and DHCP servers are reality

814
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:40,470
so arm right now networks was

815
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:43,740
with visitors that use either arm

816
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:47,440
router advertisements already CPB six
for assignments

817
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,630
will have the exact same problem
somebody comes along with the rogue

818
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:51,230
server

819
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:55,690
I'm so basically they're asking for
features that limit

820
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:59,430
there are any messages be text messages
can be sent from

821
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:02,460
so specifically allowing the Round Rock

822
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:06,380
router advertisement messages only from
routers and

823
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:09,920
pp. 6 responses only from p2p six
servers

824
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,390
arm there's also some

825
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:17,980
if inadequate and that has the ability
to filter on an outsourcing destination

826
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:21,060
so only allow messages to the routers

827
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:24,990
arm multicast adverse to go to the
switch interface that have routers on

828
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:25,430
them

829
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:29,960
and only allow messages are to all the
dhcpv6 server

830
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:34,349
multicast address to go to the switch
interface that happen d

831
00:52:34,349 --> 00:52:38,220
six servers are realized on them so
these specific feature

832
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:41,280
that dog rocks a request for a couple
years ago

833
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:45,260
and so there are vendors that actually
have this functionality in them

834
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:48,329
and then of course

835
00:52:48,329 --> 00:52:52,000
on there's the specific layer 2 security
mechanisms

836
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,530
are a card key six card I

837
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:58,810
ipv6 neighbor discovery inspection arm

838
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:02,030
and also sabe and all Corby's

839
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:05,510
art get better all over them layer to

840
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:08,859
arm I traffic I

841
00:53:08,859 --> 00:53:13,060
and to be able to help out with either
spoofing or also

842
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:16,960
the knowledge service attacks so

843
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,030
I'm one thing that was interesting is
that

844
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:23,270
are a card is mostly a Cisco Feature

845
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:27,000
on yes it has been standardized on

846
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,400
I know of at least one vendor that will
never implemented

847
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:35,420
and it's because a the way that the
licensing

848
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:38,750
is on the contractors by Cisco

849
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:42,940
and so you know I don't know

850
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:46,349
whether or not any other vendors have
implemented it on

851
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:49,450
and this is like a year ago that I talk
to this one particular person

852
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:53,700
more another vendor so I don't know I
mean

853
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:58,160
I mean I think other vendors are doing
things that are probably are a part like

854
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:02,299
I'm like router out advertising card I
think it's a really good idea

855
00:54:02,299 --> 00:54:06,049
has some really good functionality so
folks least look at it

856
00:54:06,049 --> 00:54:13,049
yes devices

857
00:54:14,369 --> 00:54:16,320
filtering

858
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:20,650
so security to me a lot over deals with
access control

859
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:25,920
I it's a filtering is a huge part of
that filtering is something that

860
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,100
most environments to really poorly I

861
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:32,170
and also when when your troubleshooting

862
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:36,360
any kind of an issue the first thing
that many operational teams do is they

863
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,220
kick off the filters for the interface

864
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:42,470
because you're trying to troubleshoot
wisner packet getting from point A to

865
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:44,390
point B what could be the problem

866
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:47,870
and UK coffee filter to see if that's
causing

867
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:53,000
an issue I i've seen this often enough
that I know this is absolutely true

868
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,220
arm and sometimes people forget to put
on

869
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:59,390
put the filter back on again when they
realize that now it's actually cute

870
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:02,450
a DNS issue or you know whatever of fish
was

871
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:05,830
on but really we we we need to be

872
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:09,480
very cognisant up the filtering and the
filtering strategy

873
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,850
which again by sometime to the other
side

874
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:16,150
sex so arm

875
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:20,270
this is actually a configuration that I
have at home

876
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:23,410
on obviously I'm showing you the
documentation

877
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:27,610
you know address but I do have a slot
for needed

878
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:30,690
and this is the configuration that I
have

879
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:34,400
because I only wonder allow what's in my
home

880
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,400
at work i'd out you my upstream provider
I don't wanna

881
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,870
are and so on

882
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:45,740
in many small businesses I whether night
before

883
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:48,980
6 you should be putting and price thing

884
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:53,440
filters on you know too many people do
not do this

885
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,220
I but if you have a prefix

886
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:01,460
you know you have a sudden assign you
and you you're not a backup power

887
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:05,080
for anybody else or you don't you live
anybody as a backup

888
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:08,130
something then this is just something

889
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:12,760
we should all be doing and recommending

890
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:17,870
to everybody else

891
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:21,630
so general far wall best from prop

892
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:26,340
EVA before sex you want explicitly deny
all traffic and

893
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:29,370
only allow what you need you should

894
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:34,920
some environment very arm

895
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:40,160
do not rely on your firewall

896
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:44,350
protection network I've heard are

897
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:47,800
all together some people like to file

898
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:51,460
arm you know never better than the other

899
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:54,760
aren't we have although Hill

900
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:59,060
so me a firewall line

901
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:02,230
to protect yourself against

902
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:07,160
on so we trap see so I don't have this

903
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:10,710
pointer Inc talk about it yesterday

904
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:14,230
right saw that column

905
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:17,290
and he actually did some research

906
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:21,100
in terms of ipv6 after that you should
not

907
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:25,500
see on the Internet there's traffic that
South

908
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,180
how their early no but this

909
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:32,260
so again me that mean you know

910
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:35,980
by the you just very simple

911
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:41,070
authors for just the nine source
addresses from an ipv6 address

912
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:46,860
you relation forwarding so

913
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:50,310
hear something gross I P to consider

914
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:53,400
arm and again the ones that I'm hiring
you

915
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,670
right visa visa fourth

916
00:57:56,670 --> 00:58:00,540
this is that if you see them

917
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:03,740
you know they should never be propagated

918
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:06,160
you know obvious is who obviously

919
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,850
hopefully from the past network no arm

920
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:16,850
you know me it's just stop propagation

921
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:24,520
and you know from and also reject the
pack packard

922
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:28,400
which have your own me

923
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:31,880
visa simply check and by

924
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:36,120
arm you know really equipment vendors my
people

925
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:41,040
no reason why you have to configure them
or you know they could just pop

926
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,410
template say yup you know

927
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:50,940
authors on and some

928
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:55,490
just show slides for you can you know on

929
00:58:55,490 --> 00:59:00,380
for what what's relevant you guys I
think all know this already

930
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:03,920
arm but because %uh the Smurfette power

931
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:08,300
and on their one with

932
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:15,080
him no issues are a lot of people start
talking all i think im Puno ipv4

933
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,830
networks which is just silly

934
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:20,160
bankers you wanna paint our on

935
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:24,080
so based on II 16

936
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:30,420
feature parity or not 6 and this is
where they did not understand that

937
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:33,720
house heard ICMP 6 packets right why

938
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:37,220
operation and so you happy

939
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:40,920
constant what they are why don't they
are later

940
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:44,040
are I I sex

941
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:47,690
so forearm

942
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:52,260
more things to consider with the ingress
I six pack packet filters

943
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:57,500
is I a and this one's interesting deny
sending packets that use the routing

944
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,060
header

945
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:01,630
unless using mobility features now this
was

946
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:04,859
arm starting under type 0

947
01:00:04,859 --> 01:00:07,820
K are now there's also a routing header

948
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:11,090
type and there's another article header

949
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:15,690
arm that is being I standardized by
Cisco

950
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:19,630
really feels more where are
software-defined networking

951
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:25,320
on so there are folks that want
deprecated extension

952
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:29,710
on yet there's more should

953
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:35,440
and merely on what we need to make sure

954
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:40,359
that angers functionality were you can
specifically

955
01:00:40,359 --> 01:00:44,040
filter out specific extension headers

956
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:48,430
and possibly hi him a bit later

957
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:51,750
I'm things like 62

958
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:55,290
warm arm and to raid 0 aren't really

959
01:00:55,290 --> 01:01:00,220
my much they were they were implemented

960
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:05,690
ten years ago or so arm but it turns out
that they caused more harm than not and

961
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:06,359
so

962
01:01:06,359 --> 01:01:12,970
our people are to start so

963
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:16,160
these are the ICMP v6 I

964
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,810
types that you absolutely need War II

965
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:23,210
six operations so arm

966
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:27,270
you the the pipeline Co 0 the new route
destination

967
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:30,340
on you need certain types for are

968
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:33,410
happened your discovery arm

969
01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:38,350
so in my recommendation right don't
filter on specific types

970
01:01:38,350 --> 01:01:41,540
just too onerous I mean figure out
another way

971
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:44,990
to try and avoid any kinda denial of
service

972
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:48,720
on pricing traffic I'm

973
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,980
because filtering is is it looks

974
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:55,940
easy but it's actually hard when you're
trying to mean

975
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:58,640
so you know or you can have a code block

976
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:02,550
that just says okay here's all the ICMP
specific filters

977
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:07,430
I but also look at how good are the
operational folks in your environment

978
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:11,140
like what I've learned is that it's
really easy to say

979
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:15,850
well why aren't these people doing that
why aren't they doing PCP 38 you know

980
01:02:15,850 --> 01:02:16,940
inggris filters for

981
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:21,390
traffic everywhere and then I get into
an operational arm round my

982
01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:27,120
our interesting okay that device has an
issue you know you put into filters and

983
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:30,190
you know there's a bargain so you know
the router reboots

984
01:02:30,190 --> 01:02:33,530
and here's another issue here's another
issue

985
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:36,850
so everything is really easy in theory
and make sense

986
01:02:36,850 --> 01:02:41,850
by but in practice story so

987
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:46,470
arm if you can free then be specific in
what you feel

988
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:50,620
sex on pipes but

989
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:54,450
you know reserve operations arm
sometimes I was just boy

990
01:02:54,450 --> 01:03:00,970
filtering ICMP b6 entirely on

991
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:04,310
when i was alluding to earlier we need
better ipv6

992
01:03:04,310 --> 01:03:07,370
extension had a filtering arm

993
01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:11,140
and especially on you know

994
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:14,470
the currently defined extension header
table

995
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:17,600
the hop by hop pop the routing under
fragment header

996
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:21,320
ESPN a teacher for I p sac

997
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:27,830
destination options

998
01:03:27,830 --> 01:03:31,490
here's why for the routing header right
this was a problem

999
01:03:31,490 --> 01:03:34,540
and it was

1000
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:38,100
a big problem within a year the I'm

1001
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:42,420
here started finalized standard her

1002
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:45,760
so it's very quickly done everybody
understands problem

1003
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:49,040
and so became RC 2460

1004
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:53,360
and basically what it says is that you
know the routing hunters use by an ipv6

1005
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:57,800
source to list one or more media no be
visited on the way

1006
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:01,430
to the PAC nation each extension

1007
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:06,940
shit headers should occur at most one
except for the destination option

1008
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:11,020
header which for white ipv6

1009
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:15,070
no must accept had from process
extension headers

1010
01:04:15,070 --> 01:04:18,350
in any order occurring any number

1011
01:04:18,350 --> 01:04:23,000
I'm in the same packet that's already

1012
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:29,270
fun to me occurring any number so what
would happen

1013
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:32,590
is when you have a router 50 by

1014
01:04:32,590 --> 01:04:36,030
it may contain movable Inc no addresses

1015
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:39,380
and the same address maybe more one

1016
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:43,990
same which means that you could have a
scenario

1017
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:47,360
where you can have a amplification
attack

1018
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:50,580
were you know the route bounces between

1019
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:53,910
the PPACA bounces between in b-more I'm

1020
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:57,850
for 1000 over

1021
01:04:57,850 --> 01:05:00,940
exploited they decide

1022
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:01,670
okay this is

1023
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:05,119
really bad idea for come up with
something better

1024
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:08,780
the router 50 because we know that

1025
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:12,040
routing recommended night for

1026
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:16,940
why would 6 people can come up with
answer

1027
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:20,119
so they did arm the

1028
01:05:20,119 --> 01:05:24,030
yesterday gave a talk about arm
basically

1029
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:27,079
source routing in ipv6

1030
01:05:27,079 --> 01:05:30,670
arm this new type about it header but
they've also

1031
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:34,420
of through how to avoid this issue okay
so I

1032
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:39,140
so anyway so when the sprouting hunters

1033
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:42,280
mop right so on there

1034
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:45,540
you know they thought that okay we can
disallow processing

1035
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:48,809
I but allows all other

1036
01:05:48,809 --> 01:05:52,790
both so dropping

1037
01:05:52,790 --> 01:05:57,240
requirement fires he's on and

1038
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:00,790
are and then RC 1594

1039
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:04,740
was the deprecation the are rotting 0
that's right so

1040
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:09,460
right so

1041
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:14,380
the RC 2462 talked about how do you
actually implement extension headers

1042
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:18,470
and then RC 5095 haitian

1043
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:24,369
routing 50 but one other things that
people have to recognize

1044
01:06:24,369 --> 01:06:28,480
had a routing under hi you that would

1045
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:32,390
environment so really you couldn't
always just point-blank

1046
01:06:32,390 --> 01:06:37,099
the routing so it was interesting
because

1047
01:06:37,099 --> 01:06:40,280
arm you know different vendors I have
Cisco sampling

1048
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:43,329
slide but depending on which I

1049
01:06:43,329 --> 01:06:47,000
version are you running depends on how
much granularity you how

1050
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,839
were actually are dropping the routing
header on

1051
01:06:50,839 --> 01:06:54,109
Supplier you R-twelve got you be

1052
01:06:54,109 --> 01:06:57,420
you could only II filter out

1053
01:06:57,420 --> 01:07:00,440
the entire routing header workers on

1054
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:03,400
I major upgrades you can actually

1055
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,599
filter on the routing header type-0
specifically

1056
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:10,190
on but not everything ok

1057
01:07:10,190 --> 01:07:13,559
a lousy done so Kenneth

1058
01:07:13,559 --> 01:07:17,650
equipment specific and no vendor
vendor-specific also

1059
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:21,700
and so this is something that where

1060
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:25,109
extension headers there's a lot of
controversy about

1061
01:07:25,109 --> 01:07:28,369
should we arm thinking I'm

1062
01:07:28,369 --> 01:07:33,319
arm there's actually some work being
done

1063
01:07:33,319 --> 01:07:38,289
research how much filtering so I S

1064
01:07:38,289 --> 01:07:43,440
he's are 39 largely for pregnant arm

1065
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:47,940
but there's there's the thought that you
know expansion matters

1066
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:51,440
because also there the biggest problem

1067
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:54,769
operation whenever I

1068
01:07:54,769 --> 01:07:58,480
bunny you you know a vendor

1069
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:02,230
that deals with security and they say a
we support ipv6

1070
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:06,509
my buttons past for whether or not they
really know what they're talking about

1071
01:08:06,509 --> 01:08:06,759
is

1072
01:08:06,759 --> 01:08:11,619
what do you do with extension now the
only question I have to ask and

1073
01:08:11,619 --> 01:08:13,680
depending on their answers when they say

1074
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:17,040
yup that's a problem like you get when
they're like

1075
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:21,000
extension headers I go okay you know a
couple years

1076
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,319
%um because because this is the problem

1077
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:27,409
I i mean extension headers may

1078
01:08:27,409 --> 01:08:31,190
a its it purely a performance issue by
the way

1079
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:35,199
I I mean extension headers processing
them in a sex

1080
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:38,670
per domain very difficult by

1081
01:08:38,670 --> 01:08:42,889
so using the pump it up into the CPU
power so that slows everything down

1082
01:08:42,889 --> 01:08:46,619
but that's the fundamental problem and
so

1083
01:08:46,619 --> 01:08:50,980
what's gonna happen future I have no
idea right i mean we need

1084
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:54,049
fragments I would like to think that
people

1085
01:08:54,049 --> 01:08:57,609
mostly lifelike ether so no

1086
01:08:57,609 --> 01:09:01,690
thing but but be aware that this is
something

1087
01:09:01,690 --> 01:09:03,490
that

1088
01:09:03,490 --> 01:09:07,080
keep on the lookout for because people
can bypass

1089
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:14,080
curious fighting everything and you'll
get the slide so these are just

1090
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:19,960
arm some recommendations and

1091
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:25,140
on in our uses all the time in terms of
looking at you know what you can do

1092
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:28,200
I actually last night change the one
from Comrie

1093
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:32,460
arm because and I want to make sure that
all these pointers are still valid

1094
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:35,890
good to see that you're still is I
double checked

1095
01:09:35,890 --> 01:09:40,700
because somebody's our old you now the
one from get that bike

1096
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:44,590
10 years 15 years yeah but it still
valid

1097
01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:47,610
I in nineteen crummy used to have this
nice

1098
01:09:47,610 --> 01:09:50,760
comfort pro ball gowns well they have a
service

1099
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:55,370
right where you can get the the bogan on
ipv6 routes through

1100
01:09:55,370 --> 01:10:00,400
are you know the BDP are announcements
and so rather than creating templates

1101
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,070
wherever they now have a new

1102
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:06,350
reference with a descriptive reference
arm and then also point to the service

1103
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:07,260
that they provide

1104
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:14,110
with which is a good thing so one thing
that was interesting also to know

1105
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:18,110
is that on you have more ipv6 reserved I
versus

1106
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:22,920
right and so I just took the other day
and I wasn't familiar with

1107
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:26,650
orchid here so I'm I'm actually gonna
see if I can

1108
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:29,820
I can beat up on that next couple days
arm

1109
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:33,400
but there's a couple of addresses that
were added here on

1110
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:38,670
and the discard only prefect support
that so in terms of ipv6 reserved

1111
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:39,560
addresses

1112
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:44,120
by you do you want to keep up with
what's on the latest developments are

1113
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:47,330
in this is purely in my mind so that you
can

1114
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:54,330
are you know add to your anti spoof
filters

1115
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:57,680
so BGP prefix filtering

1116
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:01,770
again this is also the same pripyat b6
and ipv4 networks

1117
01:11:01,770 --> 01:11:05,800
and our you know the problem in most
ISP's

1118
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:09,830
is that people are not filtering
comprehensively arm

1119
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:14,280
the filtering their customers prefixes
and filtering prefix is going on other

1120
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:14,910
network

1121
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:18,340
so we all have to get better at
filtering

1122
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:21,690
arm I give a security one day talk

1123
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:24,690
four years ago and my every third

1124
01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:27,740
word was filtered my first question was
how many

1125
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:32,220
you're running networks I mean do you
think your filtering effectively

1126
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:35,260
nobody raised their hands said I'm gonna
get you guys

1127
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:38,470
because filter I'm going to be so
annoying filter

1128
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:41,770
that you're going to filter and I
literally did this for about five

1129
01:11:41,770 --> 01:11:42,230
minutes

1130
01:11:42,230 --> 01:11:45,630
one guy right and I was in arm Japan

1131
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:49,570
I'm I want because ma'am if we promise
to filter

1132
01:11:49,570 --> 01:11:52,989
we stop

1133
01:11:52,989 --> 01:11:56,889
yeah and I decided to trust them but I
did have a couple people actually come

1134
01:11:56,889 --> 01:11:59,499
up to me at the end of the day and show
me some other

1135
01:11:59,499 --> 01:12:03,019
03 talk about it you know even if

1136
01:12:03,019 --> 01:12:06,019
12 people to be better at this

1137
01:12:06,019 --> 01:12:10,260
you know I'm happy on for we really do
have to think about

1138
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:14,550
love them all arm you will find that

1139
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:19,969
are these particular examples look very
much similar to the PAP

1140
01:12:19,969 --> 01:12:23,280
a and a prime right you have to

1141
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:26,999
thing you know why want to actually
create pockets opens at 5 a.m.

1142
01:12:26,999 --> 01:12:31,229
my care wasn't much better if I don't
have the same my writing

1143
01:12:31,229 --> 01:12:35,550
think so sometimes a trade-off

1144
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:38,929
anywhere or over havel

1145
01:12:38,929 --> 01:12:43,610
what's better to be implemented in your
environment but

1146
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:46,699
arm you know why make sure that at this

1147
01:12:46,699 --> 01:12:53,699
are a illegitimate traffic you know is
not propagated so

1148
01:12:53,729 --> 01:12:58,630
here's a couple we r v6 prefixes to
consider in terms of your & Poor's

1149
01:12:58,630 --> 01:13:02,429
filters arm your own prefix 6

1150
01:13:02,429 --> 01:13:05,489
phone no longer you live arm

1151
01:13:05,489 --> 01:13:09,189
sixth for also deprecated paredo

1152
01:13:09,189 --> 01:13:13,530
and I always look at the newer
developments like I just pointed out in

1153
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:14,090
RC

1154
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:17,130
6890 there about three or four

1155
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:21,909
that were added in the last three years
Mike orchid

1156
01:13:21,909 --> 01:13:26,369
couple others so as urs new developments
in the eye

1157
01:13:26,369 --> 01:13:31,280
here come up with new specialized use
addresses this is true for ipv4 as well

1158
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:32,360
as ipv6

1159
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:36,239
and sometimes they get II

1160
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:40,099
they get depleted from the special-use
addresses so this happened

1161
01:13:40,099 --> 01:13:44,269
me with ipv4 I give are given a lot of
security basic security

1162
01:13:44,269 --> 01:13:47,889
workshops in there RC 3 330

1163
01:13:47,889 --> 01:13:51,780
that was that only got with ipv4
reserved at birth

1164
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:55,780
and there was one part that I gave in
somebody pointed out that

1165
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:59,539
wait a minute this address it was a cuss
I people for adverse

1166
01:13:59,539 --> 01:14:00,530
it was actually

1167
01:14:00,530 --> 01:14:04,329
be allocated to be used arm to drop some

1168
01:14:04,329 --> 01:14:08,300
use and so I have talked to Bill Manning
who was the original

1169
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:13,079
author are that are CP 30 that are you I
need to update that

1170
01:14:13,079 --> 01:14:16,840
and so it turns out this r/c 6890

1171
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:20,829
is created specifically for both ipv4

1172
01:14:20,829 --> 01:14:27,829
and ipv6 in that house the latest so did

1173
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:31,039
monitor on you know reserved addresses

1174
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:37,400
not just static and this just shows the
configuration example

1175
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:44,199
I'm and I did I do this because
sometimes people just cut and paste by

1176
01:14:44,199 --> 01:14:47,989
really shouldn't do that so I didn't add
some other newer ones on there

1177
01:14:47,989 --> 01:14:51,320
and this is something I have a breakfast

1178
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:55,340
compensation summit this morning yeah
forget my slide

1179
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:59,429
arm iraqi them I'm gonna put the

1180
01:14:59,429 --> 01:15:04,309
2001 v8 at birth at I

1181
01:15:04,309 --> 01:15:08,650
in that is good practice I mean that was
specifically created

1182
01:15:08,650 --> 01:15:13,179
the fact that people K and other crap

1183
01:15:13,179 --> 01:15:16,320
duration: and they case

1184
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:21,020
crazy stuff the current page example
password when

1185
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:24,360
I kid you not that's why you have a lot
of this you know

1186
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:28,699
Cisco one or I have a book by road

1187
01:15:28,699 --> 01:15:32,369
and I put password is let me and I
thought I was being funny

1188
01:15:32,369 --> 01:15:37,570
writing this is 1999 I don't think about
it so much there's a lot of let me and

1189
01:15:37,570 --> 01:15:40,949
around number I hope that wasn't my
fault it

1190
01:15:40,949 --> 01:15:44,900
0 but people do they literally cut and
paste so when you do

1191
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:48,969
examples you wanna be careful about that
also arm

1192
01:15:48,969 --> 01:15:52,110
people use you are

1193
01:15:52,110 --> 01:15:57,480
filter on our IR allocations okay when
ipv6 was first getting

1194
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:01,409
boy that was probably a good idea now

1195
01:16:01,409 --> 01:16:04,429
I think we've gone to the side that

1196
01:16:04,429 --> 01:16:07,020
if you there right there

1197
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:13,570
summoning allocation keep so keep that
in mind and so

1198
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:17,570
this was something that people used to
do in terms of use their current

1199
01:16:17,570 --> 01:16:18,540
allocations

1200
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:22,020
on it needs constant updating I only

1201
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:25,630
here's a the used to be best practices

1202
01:16:25,630 --> 01:16:30,030
it is warp so

1203
01:16:30,030 --> 01:16:37,030
II with your way

1204
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:48,340
up

1205
01:16:55,840 --> 01:17:02,840
that up

1206
01:17:17,530 --> 01:17:19,080
up

1207
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:22,200
okay

1208
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:29,200
call didn't know that yep

1209
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:38,270
yeah I think in a strict code

1210
01:17:44,850 --> 01:17:51,059
yes

1211
01:17:51,059 --> 01:17:54,880
yeah because most people we don't think
about the operational consequences

1212
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:59,170
fight and the fact is that you know
filters depends on your environment

1213
01:17:59,170 --> 01:18:02,820
right if you're in an environment that
you have to be stricter

1214
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:06,920
and you have very good operational teams
were there cognisant

1215
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:11,979
that and and keep up with that great but
there's other environments were you

1216
01:18:11,979 --> 01:18:14,639
create a filter and you just do not
wanna touch

1217
01:18:14,639 --> 01:18:18,940
from by a unless there is like an
absolute emergency

1218
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:23,440
right which which happens if you have a
million devices right I mean

1219
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:27,489
I think environment and they say think
about your filters carefully because

1220
01:18:27,489 --> 01:18:28,739
once you're there

1221
01:18:28,739 --> 01:18:33,559
its it it's going to be a huge amount of
effort to get anything

1222
01:18:33,559 --> 01:18:38,710
changed and that's because our
operational issues also you change

1223
01:18:38,710 --> 01:18:40,579
something every time you change
something

1224
01:18:40,579 --> 01:18:43,920
you risk that you make a mistake can

1225
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:50,170
and something happens so

1226
01:18:50,170 --> 01:18:53,590
so I put the slide almost they have the
ipv6

1227
01:18:53,590 --> 01:18:57,230
talk just because I want people to do in
price per filtering

1228
01:18:57,230 --> 01:19:02,449
get better at it and so Armin on the
decision is where do you do it

1229
01:19:02,449 --> 01:19:06,850
right do you do it at the ingress to the
router which is the BCP 38

1230
01:19:06,850 --> 01:19:10,840
I always say that I don't want people
talking about this

1231
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:14,050
p38 anymore because the the specific
case

1232
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:17,250
an even-par Ferguson right who actually
work with

1233
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:20,670
and where no extremely well he's a
cooper be p38

1234
01:19:20,670 --> 01:19:23,800
he doesn't talk about PCPA anymore he
says

1235
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:28,190
anti-smoking anti-smoking filters and so
I've

1236
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:31,250
long been a proponent doing it at the
egress

1237
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:35,239
so as close to the source as possible
before you could potentially

1238
01:19:35,239 --> 01:19:38,320
spoofing arm and then

1239
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:43,040
you know really anywhere that you could
just put an anti-spam filters

1240
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:46,650
and as you can configuration

1241
01:19:46,650 --> 01:19:51,199
isn't necessarily difficult especially
and some smaller enterprises

1242
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:56,020
I or home robbers and I've been a huge
proponent of seeing whether not

1243
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:57,580
equipment vendors can actually

1244
01:19:57,580 --> 01:20:01,560
do this automatically way like just
learn what the actual

1245
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:02,740
prefixes

1246
01:20:02,740 --> 01:20:06,240
using and then create that filter it
only allow traffic

1247
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:11,180
out with the source type: or

1248
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:17,350
or brother from okay so I already talked
about

1249
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:22,160
wife you know why secured

1250
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:26,200
sex which obviously is think the wrong
on

1251
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:29,300
but I'm gonna by IPSec

1252
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:33,500
I happen to really like I think it's
very much

1253
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:37,450
on Open VPN

1254
01:20:37,450 --> 01:20:40,600
yea but arm

1255
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:44,150
and and I think you know the vendors
crude

1256
01:20:44,150 --> 01:20:47,960
arm so back in 2005

1257
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:51,250
I actually decided you know this is a
really great opportunity

1258
01:20:51,250 --> 01:20:55,490
I I right because

1259
01:20:55,490 --> 01:20:59,050
and I can easily say

1260
01:20:59,050 --> 01:21:02,690
well

1261
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:06,720
Microsoft I

1262
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:10,500
yeah and on in on Cisco Juniper

1263
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:13,770
hip

1264
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:18,020
that's good I I right

1265
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:25,020
have all issues operation because the
interoperability

1266
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:30,940
problem arm

1267
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:34,790
and family on that never happen because

1268
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:37,469
the vendors while they read

1269
01:21:37,469 --> 01:21:41,610
one game I was just saying this is the
right thing

1270
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:45,489
you and I'm you know they're waiting

1271
01:21:45,489 --> 01:21:48,949
no cost early

1272
01:21:48,949 --> 01:21:52,199
so that didn't happen

1273
01:21:52,199 --> 01:21:55,999
but let me just give you move it up

1274
01:21:55,999 --> 01:22:01,380
quick you know pointed here because I
think that all the pls issues

1275
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:04,610
many I mean every three months or so

1276
01:22:04,610 --> 01:22:07,809
he

1277
01:22:07,809 --> 01:22:12,099
FBI yeah they're having these
conversations about you know what you

1278
01:22:12,099 --> 01:22:15,739
last week and then

1279
01:22:15,739 --> 01:22:18,969
like are you have IP so arm

1280
01:22:18,969 --> 01:22:22,349
yep

1281
01:22:22,349 --> 01:22:26,409
so arm one of the biggest issues I

1282
01:22:26,409 --> 01:22:29,550
his right which is why pls became easy

1283
01:22:29,550 --> 01:22:33,139
was how do you potential I

1284
01:22:33,139 --> 01:22:36,639
you could do the same thing with sec
some apre

1285
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:39,159
you know chain

1286
01:22:39,159 --> 01:22:43,110
roots arm but in my mind also

1287
01:22:43,110 --> 01:22:47,750
coming imp

1288
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:51,870
so as long as you some here relationship

1289
01:22:51,870 --> 01:22:55,730
IPSec easy

1290
01:22:55,730 --> 01:22:59,960
last on could be useful

1291
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:03,389
for any things brain arm any kind

1292
01:23:03,389 --> 01:23:10,020
integrity and confidentiality I'm

1293
01:23:10,020 --> 01:23:13,050
but what you really need tropical fall

1294
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:16,330
on and the window of opportunity

1295
01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:20,650
I'm humping so

1296
01:23:20,650 --> 01:23:24,159
something it this is a thought
experiment

1297
01:23:24,159 --> 01:23:30,639
me but I have written something up in
2006

1298
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:34,230
that arm actually from a mine said
answer

1299
01:23:34,230 --> 01:23:38,040
just a courtesy what the thinking was
but you know there's too many things

1300
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:41,370
going on and I was my fault

1301
01:23:41,370 --> 01:23:45,070
always on if you could use

1302
01:23:45,070 --> 01:23:50,699
IPSec right for integrity from

1303
01:23:50,699 --> 01:23:54,250
sapir would you be able

1304
01:23:54,250 --> 01:23:58,580
the way kinder right because

1305
01:23:58,580 --> 01:24:01,900
scanning how most

1306
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:06,239
they wanna see what all you know

1307
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:09,620
information back if you actually had

1308
01:24:09,620 --> 01:24:15,500
would end up happening packwood

1309
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:19,780
so the I

1310
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:22,840
thought that wall everything happening

1311
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:25,500
today

1312
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:30,050
a lot of so if you could

1313
01:24:30,050 --> 01:24:34,300
stop without me

1314
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:37,500
so are berman

1315
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:42,350
fears but here the vendor-specific

1316
01:24:42,350 --> 01:24:45,990
appointment issues on there's a locker
intro

1317
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:50,410
are bold defaults so are you stop us
from session

1318
01:24:50,410 --> 01:24:54,070
here the ones are recording no I for

1319
01:24:54,070 --> 01:24:57,520
under like what we wanted policy Mike
ball

1320
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:02,560
like the people I'm or proper settings
nobody's gonna

1321
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:05,930
mess with them on mass their really you
know there's a

1322
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:09,520
he and so think about what the default

1323
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:12,720
should be because you're all security
experts

1324
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:16,890
my eight-year-old for the on talk to
each other say hey this is 40

1325
01:25:16,890 --> 01:25:20,350
think the past by say

1326
01:25:20,350 --> 01:25:24,140
are you know must happen recommended so

1327
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:27,250
creep that people I I'm arm

1328
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:30,640
certain meet the requirements the eighty
population

1329
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:34,860
any other morning on

1330
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:40,520
there's also configuration I wanna
paneling

1331
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:44,650
me on is IP Sep

1332
01:25:44,650 --> 01:25:47,910
I'm and I said your the standard complex

1333
01:25:47,910 --> 01:25:51,870
but for the user shouldn't be yet for
the users

1334
01:25:51,870 --> 01:25:55,650
because most vendors jargon that

1335
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:59,250
is ridiculous by what is my IP

1336
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:04,150
with v8 care about the people men

1337
01:26:04,150 --> 01:26:07,610
now actually met with the you know

1338
01:26:07,610 --> 01:26:10,690
but I i mean

1339
01:26:10,690 --> 01:26:14,310
when you configure something I wanna
know is there a

1340
01:26:14,310 --> 01:26:17,670
medication is their integrity and you
are using

1341
01:26:17,670 --> 01:26:21,580
your password i care about. mob

1342
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:22,090
p

1343
01:26:22,090 --> 01:26:28,040
now I gotta like Google search arm

1344
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:31,150
and

1345
01:26:31,150 --> 01:26:34,900
so in with ipv6 and I p sac

1346
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:39,380
right arm are not people aware that I
could be

1347
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:46,380
to not backwards compatible I one use IP

1348
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:57,370
I alright I think reports nearly the
same

1349
01:26:57,370 --> 01:27:02,680
right I'm so except except that

1350
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:06,080
the eyepiece people didn't know I P sec

1351
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:10,430
and so they were surprised how you mean
you don't just have an adverse

1352
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:14,220
you have to wait to get an RA and then
you creepy others so there were some

1353
01:27:14,220 --> 01:27:15,460
work but they have to do

1354
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:20,430
taxi but that was fixed well I don't
know

1355
01:27:20,430 --> 01:27:23,570
seven years ago arm but the figures

1356
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:26,670
that I to that's my first question

1357
01:27:26,670 --> 01:27:32,480
vendors on shipping to because most
people still use I could be one

1358
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:37,590
I P has been a standard for the years in
the biggest issue here

1359
01:27:37,590 --> 01:27:40,910
if you decide to go I you

1360
01:27:40,910 --> 01:27:44,830
by then it's not I

1361
01:27:44,830 --> 01:27:47,920
so I've decided that I'm upgrading tie

1362
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:51,890
to I tried in this year the sky

1363
01:27:51,890 --> 01:27:57,040
31 and so vendors have done their own

1364
01:27:57,040 --> 01:28:04,040
way downgrading so

1365
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:09,300
arm fascinating arm

1366
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:15,020
OSPF me mandated I P because back

1367
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:18,440
you know everything I protector IPSec

1368
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:23,980
fascinating that how so when most people
did

1369
01:28:23,980 --> 01:28:27,290
30 %eh well aaah

1370
01:28:27,290 --> 01:28:30,450
is a should or may were

1371
01:28:30,450 --> 01:28:33,470
yes p by have placed security header

1372
01:28:33,470 --> 01:28:36,980
which does your on encryption is a must

1373
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:40,210
so for those of you that may not now 82

1374
01:28:40,210 --> 01:28:47,030
authentication header oh I have a I have
also that to you in a minute

1375
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:50,210
subscriber days yes here

1376
01:28:50,210 --> 01:28:55,660
an idea but but there's a couple more
things you have to think about also PKR

1377
01:28:55,660 --> 01:28:56,030
yes

1378
01:28:56,030 --> 01:28:59,740
right PKR what certs

1379
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:03,670
you trust right there compromise yea arm

1380
01:29:03,670 --> 01:29:06,950
part is I you are likely to health

1381
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:10,270
most that now has been standardized but
again

1382
01:29:10,270 --> 01:29:17,270
seen however point help

1383
01:29:18,150 --> 01:29:23,230
I think everybody in this room I i mean

1384
01:29:23,230 --> 01:29:30,230
up and so here's

1385
01:29:30,610 --> 01:29:34,270
arm thing so with yes p.m. I don't

1386
01:29:34,270 --> 01:29:37,590
so what age there's free to provide

1387
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:41,210
integrity checking throughout the entire
packet so from the header

1388
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:44,990
to the end and the only thing that's not
included is the fuel that can change

1389
01:29:44,990 --> 01:29:45,580
during

1390
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:49,200
and by so your IP addresses and

1391
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:52,410
some option but integrity pocket

1392
01:29:52,410 --> 01:29:55,780
so back in 1998 there was an
interoperability

1393
01:29:55,780 --> 01:30:00,090
past on eyepiece and people realized I

1394
01:30:00,090 --> 01:30:04,240
oh wait a minute age doesn't go way

1395
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:08,390
and so on they will I that wow we have
to do something about that so that

1396
01:30:08,390 --> 01:30:09,020
bakery

1397
01:30:09,020 --> 01:30:13,380
something called yes no so ESPN coupling
security header

1398
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:17,000
was really defined to do arm
confidentiality

1399
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,330
but then they also added integrity so
that you could

1400
01:30:20,330 --> 01:30:24,410
to integrity only or rather did
confidentiality integrity

1401
01:30:24,410 --> 01:30:28,000
but you could only use it without their
confidentiality

1402
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,310
portion so that you could have integrity
without arm

1403
01:30:31,310 --> 01:30:35,250
and integrity is down for everything
except for the IP headers

1404
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:39,400
right and some people there's
controversy is that good enough

1405
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:43,630
it is good enough so on when you
actually do an analysis

1406
01:30:43,630 --> 01:30:47,550
work at protective poor with a8 there's
immutable

1407
01:30:47,550 --> 01:30:52,070
feels right and really the field it

1408
01:30:52,070 --> 01:30:54,210
saxifrage on minimal

1409
01:30:54,210 --> 01:30:58,450
compared to what you have with the SP
and I i would love to have an awkward

1410
01:30:58,450 --> 01:30:59,120
conversation

1411
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:03,200
people to you know you want the details
but

1412
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:08,220
the problem yes p that it's very
difficult to tell whether or not

1413
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:11,350
packing is on just integrity

1414
01:31:11,350 --> 01:31:15,990
which means that you know your firewall
idea look at the traffic

1415
01:31:15,990 --> 01:31:20,260
weather and the reason why is because
that information

1416
01:31:20,260 --> 01:31:23,800
with and pocket you can see

1417
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:27,910
this image more

1418
01:31:27,910 --> 01:31:31,240
from yes the

1419
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:37,510
so yes 100

1420
01:31:37,510 --> 01:31:41,130
yes

1421
01:31:41,130 --> 01:31:44,230
trailer in the trailer isn't

1422
01:31:44,230 --> 01:31:47,970
is the actual information about
integrity protection versus

1423
01:31:47,970 --> 01:31:49,380
confidentiality

1424
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:52,680
surf if you're thinking about you know
if device right

1425
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:57,140
only go so far to a packet where you
don't know whether or not a thinker

1426
01:31:57,140 --> 01:32:00,830
I so that's been a problem and sold

1427
01:32:00,830 --> 01:32:06,270
ship all the way

1428
01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:11,130
the end yes part so I'm

1429
01:32:11,130 --> 01:32:14,450
the eye care actually came up with with
a solution to this

1430
01:32:14,450 --> 01:32:18,030
which is called west by cAMP remember
what the W stands for

1431
01:32:18,030 --> 01:32:21,200
but this way here yep

1432
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:24,700
popularly on p.m. help tech

1433
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:28,200
or arm I or I encrypt it

1434
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:32,210
and just as a are kinda trivia fact Ryan

1435
01:32:32,210 --> 01:32:36,030
anybody know why they created AH versus
the SP

1436
01:32:36,030 --> 01:32:39,880
this month

1437
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:43,460
are it wouldn't be relevant today but
this was back in

1438
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:47,110
members started in the mid 90's and
they're worth of government

1439
01:32:47,110 --> 01:32:51,010
are crypto import-export action so

1440
01:32:51,010 --> 01:32:54,230
with authentication right there it
didn't matter how long

1441
01:32:54,230 --> 01:32:57,160
he was with are encryption

1442
01:32:57,160 --> 01:33:00,410
that matter by in the US you couldn't
ask for anything

1443
01:33:00,410 --> 01:33:05,580
certain countries that were more than
forty and so they decided to make that

1444
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:07,130
difference between just

1445
01:33:07,130 --> 01:33:11,500
the arm integrity by the authentication
part versus the

1446
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:17,260
are actual confidentiality ripped apart
so that if you were to export then at

1447
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:18,730
least have really strong

1448
01:33:18,730 --> 01:33:22,230
equity authentication technology so that
was really why

1449
01:33:22,230 --> 01:33:26,970
each you created so there

1450
01:33:26,970 --> 01:33:31,950
yeah so here some other issues with the
bell

1451
01:33:31,950 --> 01:33:35,590
vendors right does a view that overlook
that I think back to even try to do

1452
01:33:35,590 --> 01:33:37,010
between two devices

1453
01:33:37,010 --> 01:33:40,290
3 on I mean to me this is really
ridiculous

1454
01:33:40,290 --> 01:33:43,790
yep they all have different

1455
01:33:43,790 --> 01:33:49,470
are you know default settings in the
one-lap

1456
01:33:49,470 --> 01:33:53,470
one right to speak for the mod PE the
diffie-hellman

1457
01:33:53,470 --> 01:33:57,800
and really what that is is how do you
indicate you know the initial

1458
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:03,170
exchange to thank you to peers but the
hackers group 1542

1459
01:34:03,170 --> 01:34:06,290
right I know that it's you know how long
is the key size and

1460
01:34:06,290 --> 01:34:09,810
768 you know 2048 bit

1461
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:14,050
but tells me nothing and this is what
you see in the configuration

1462
01:34:14,050 --> 01:34:17,480
mean from got better they've got more
automated

1463
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:20,840
you know this is people

1464
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:24,600
and then because even more fun

1465
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:28,260
right with speaks to actually the
terminology issue so

1466
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:31,470
by morning say I say I

1467
01:34:31,470 --> 01:34:35,380
yes a mean bone it all means the same
thing

1468
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:39,700
and so somebody that doesn't know the
standard using main mode configuration

1469
01:34:39,700 --> 01:34:45,730
here it became PSA hear your life right
here you know

1470
01:34:45,730 --> 01:34:50,930
the same thing Sep

1471
01:34:50,930 --> 01:34:55,010
your number three different terminology

1472
01:34:55,010 --> 01:34:59,010
use so my mind right this is not

1473
01:34:59,010 --> 01:35:03,160
technical issue whatsoever it's just
purely terminology but it makes it

1474
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:04,590
difficult for people

1475
01:35:04,590 --> 01:35:09,780
and well they just say forget it on

1476
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:13,620
just this worth are by

1477
01:35:13,620 --> 01:35:17,090
you offended

1478
01:35:17,090 --> 01:35:20,230
yes looks exactly again

1479
01:35:20,230 --> 01:35:24,660
be here and have everything underneath
work

1480
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:28,550
the wage and I didn't interoperability
test proctor

1481
01:35:28,550 --> 01:35:31,730
when that was still there Juniper and
Cisco

1482
01:35:31,730 --> 01:35:34,950
for no big boxes and was going to think
June

1483
01:35:34,950 --> 01:35:38,160
did stuff under the cover it was so easy

1484
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:41,270
ERATION

1485
01:35:41,270 --> 01:35:44,590
the problem want to get out pic

1486
01:35:44,590 --> 01:35:47,600
you know and then school course you know

1487
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:50,830
had interesting Federation it

1488
01:35:50,830 --> 01:35:54,490
I worked out so so I property engineers
it was the most

1489
01:35:54,490 --> 01:35:57,790
roundabout configuration seen

1490
01:35:57,790 --> 01:36:01,210
up it just logically to me never made

1491
01:36:01,210 --> 01:36:04,820
I mean yes but no and

1492
01:36:04,820 --> 01:36:11,130
here so on and you'll see the mercury

1493
01:36:11,130 --> 01:36:15,610
than but these are these are what I
would recommend is taking a look at it

1494
01:36:15,610 --> 01:36:19,090
in terms of the latest in terms of
security functionality

1495
01:36:19,090 --> 01:36:22,920
fight for CB devices I mean lots o I

1496
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:26,050
back and forth in terms of what should
be the basic requirements

1497
01:36:26,050 --> 01:36:30,530
arm summer the latest with arm broader
apostle neighbor discovery

1498
01:36:30,530 --> 01:36:35,290
sentencing GI again nobody's using them
as far as I know

1499
01:36:35,290 --> 01:36:39,800
but I think have some merit because
somebody is still developing

1500
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:43,530
fight at least from standards
perspective cisco has it implemented I

1501
01:36:43,530 --> 01:36:45,310
think jennifer has implemented

1502
01:36:45,310 --> 01:36:49,390
but to me the key point is you know
these this host the vices

1503
01:36:49,390 --> 01:36:53,180
on this one here

1504
01:36:53,180 --> 01:36:55,280
where they're still on draft day

1505
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:59,570
out take a look at these documents and I
hope

1506
01:36:59,570 --> 01:37:02,820
laos porn I'm Co of everything

1507
01:37:02,820 --> 01:37:06,800
and we're trying to finalize next week

1508
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:10,260
on we basically consolidated about

1509
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:13,780
eighty or ninety drop you will see a lot
of different are

1510
01:37:13,780 --> 01:37:18,090
references because we want to put
everything that had anything to do with

1511
01:37:18,090 --> 01:37:18,780
ipv6

1512
01:37:18,780 --> 01:37:22,840
30 and put it into one document as a
best practice

1513
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:27,170
K and the last time up there was like
eighty or ninety RC's

1514
01:37:27,170 --> 01:37:34,030
at work trying to consolidate so so as a
summary

1515
01:37:34,030 --> 01:37:37,060
arm I don't like the word differences

1516
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:41,910
yeah mayor security by look at what's
under your control

1517
01:37:41,910 --> 01:37:48,910
and try to mitigate the risk as much as
possible on

1518
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:56,660
and some basic principles right arm make
sure that address assignments or provoke

1519
01:37:56,660 --> 01:37:57,360
perform

1520
01:37:57,360 --> 01:38:01,260
in a reliable manner cannot be spoofed
in whatever way that

1521
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:05,030
that makes more sense in your
environment on and make sure that

1522
01:38:05,030 --> 01:38:06,690
malicious behavior can be

1523
01:38:06,690 --> 01:38:10,590
I care a lot about auditing

1524
01:38:10,590 --> 01:38:14,390
and management texan cuz I wanna knowbut
anomalies

1525
01:38:14,390 --> 01:38:18,440
again my role is somebody that is
responsible for security

1526
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:23,370
my I one thing Ford efficiently but I
need to know when something bad is

1527
01:38:23,370 --> 01:38:23,870
happening

1528
01:38:23,870 --> 01:38:28,310
my network and these days are longer are
targeted attacks

1529
01:38:28,310 --> 01:38:31,550
and any one of us can become a target
for

1530
01:38:31,550 --> 01:38:36,630
knows who thing

1531
01:38:36,630 --> 01:38:42,240
you have to harden the host Ryan this is
25 for an ipv6

1532
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:46,290
not forget about filtering are a in New

1533
01:38:46,290 --> 01:38:49,560
when you're enabling ipv6 by

1534
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:54,340
make sure that you provide a are some
restrictions in terms of who can access

1535
01:38:54,340 --> 01:38:55,880
your device and from

1536
01:38:55,880 --> 01:38:58,910
from from where on and also

1537
01:38:58,910 --> 01:39:03,440
protect traffic between hosts as I said
before

1538
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:07,790
I'm all about encrypting everywhere but
you now remember key management

1539
01:39:07,790 --> 01:39:12,080
and the issue I always raise at least a
few have integrity protection which to

1540
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:14,160
me is more important I wouldn't know
that

1541
01:39:14,160 --> 01:39:18,120
I'm sending you something you know that
it came from me and

1542
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:22,190
that nobody's modified transit to me
that much more important than the

1543
01:39:22,190 --> 01:39:23,330
confidentiality

1544
01:39:23,330 --> 01:39:26,460
write something should be confidential

1545
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:31,720
but not everything in my mind and if I
use the key or something happens to the

1546
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:32,970
credential back in

1547
01:39:32,970 --> 01:39:36,630
scripted what right

1548
01:39:36,630 --> 01:39:42,910
so these are operational considerations
think about and so as a conclusion

1549
01:39:42,910 --> 01:39:47,580
right a lottery thing pointed out true
ipv4 and ipv6

1550
01:39:47,580 --> 01:39:50,800
people sometimes just forget to include

1551
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:54,100
these mechanisms ipv6 protection
mechanisms

1552
01:39:54,100 --> 01:39:57,659
arm you may need to modify

1553
01:39:57,659 --> 01:40:02,879
policies when when regulation say you
must have not I we say

1554
01:40:02,879 --> 01:40:07,229
why by what is the fundamental security
protection

1555
01:40:07,229 --> 01:40:10,269
where you think I should have not
because maybe

1556
01:40:10,269 --> 01:40:14,849
ipv6 environment I do not want not so
what else can I do

1557
01:40:14,849 --> 01:40:20,709
arm and critical

1558
01:40:20,709 --> 01:40:24,329
identify actual versus perceive Press
when

1559
01:40:24,329 --> 01:40:27,359
2.2 crypto crop cryptography

1560
01:40:27,359 --> 01:40:30,479
Protective Services and keep credential
management

1561
01:40:30,479 --> 01:40:34,959
mind I and there's actual Ruth versus
perceived risk

1562
01:40:34,959 --> 01:40:38,169
there's a vulnerability may not apply to
you

1563
01:40:38,169 --> 01:40:41,550
have to look at it worship
