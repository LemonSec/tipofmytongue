1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,480
yeah good morning everyone likened the
2nd editi IPSec security summit

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,500
I hope you enjoy the dinner Lisa once
joined us on yesterday

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,730
yet working with the police on them gone
too is now talking about his nephews

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,450
executed standardization efforts

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:19,699
now daughter yeah thank you morning on
my apologies for my voice I'm a freak us

6
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:22,890
to the wing walking around with not a
lot of cloth

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,119
you know what but I'm and I can barely
talk I am

8
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,060
this presentation is about a recent I
basic security standardization a fort

9
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,030
I lassie are you attended the basic
security summit

10
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,680
and yet and my talk I get this email our
talk so

11
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,360
some that here for the presentation that
I'm going into the today

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,180
is essentially colour new documents that
were published

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:50,289
in the meantime we're not publish at the
time I when I D the previous

14
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:51,110
presentation

15
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,199
on I also there are cases in which a

16
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:57,399
fortunately we made some progress with
it

17
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:00,879
those documents on the time so we have
let's say something else in

18
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,860
in that area I mmm when eaten

19
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,299
when it comes to the motivation of this
presentation I mentioned Acer

20
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,880
already and in other talks if you think
a lot

21
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,200
ipv4 the ipv4 will I am

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,520
essentially everything that has to do
with mitigation a world where

23
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,540
you know Odin once we were hit by

24
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,630
you know the frank and soften it up
religious and if you think a lot for

25
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,369
example

26
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:31,619
a scene 3 not tax predictable DCP

27
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,770
a seconds numbers predictable

28
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,290
I up PCBs in their report comes along

29
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:42,560
I'll usually all those things where
implemented in a bad way

30
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,829
from the beginnin and then eventually
when we were hit by different kinds of

31
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:47,450
attacks

32
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:52,680
I am there were documents that were
published on the topic with mediations

33
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,270
or athletes many implementations where
updated

34
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,200
to mediate or seizures

35
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,340
I am a problem with that is that
obviously we don't want to

36
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,710
a to you know repeat the story of ipv4

37
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,750
or the ipv4 wall in which a

38
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,930
you know the medications were out in
ones we were hit by the products already

39
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,660
I'll so you prolly your pricing this way

40
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:21,459
I on the idea of the scope of much of
the work that I've done

41
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:24,700
is to sensually tried to you know how an
alternative but

42
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,570
to that us or other done you know going
on the way of being heaped

43
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:33,110
by a baby for any shoes but to try to
you know incorporate mediations

44
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:36,810
in the specs I mean you know
implementations to so that those issues

45
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,940
can be avoided

46
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,709
um as I said before

47
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:44,860
um I'm going to colour documents the

48
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,480
a

49
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,690
have been published you know from the
time I did the presentation last year

50
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:54,440
or documents that have seen some sort of
process of you know protest on

51
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,570
at the same time I'm also going to
Mission documents

52
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,790
that should have made progress but for
know the body of resource

53
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:05,270
where stock I am first the whole

54
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:09,950
I will start covering a at topic of ipv6
addressing

55
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,300
I of course the former the syntax of

56
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,410
the syntax on the semantics of a ipv6
addresses are no

57
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,300
binary by everyone essentially have the
global routing prefix some

58
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,780
beats for southern aiding and I need to
face it: and ADA is that

59
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,920
I'll season ipv6 you have many many
nites for the interface Eddie

60
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,240
they are many more create creating
create the things that you can do

61
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,580
I suppose to the ipv4 were wary you only
have a few weeks for their cost $80 and

62
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,370
there's no much

63
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,300
but you can do there are different ways
in reach you

64
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,590
considering the face a the as you know

65
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,040
the let's say this done their way to say
the interface a the when you loose like

66
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,230
or stateless autoconfiguration is the
first one

67
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,239
this one in which you embed Mike address

68
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,050
but they are all the ways in which you
can possibly said that interface Eddie

69
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:07,350
I'll so some of these are described here
for some pool

70
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:11,310
I you can embed your ipv4 address in the
interface Eddie

71
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,140
in this way you can actually done right
the others in the way so

72
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,269
the old the eighth grade 1 APS API

73
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:21,640
they support is former I you can also
said

74
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,100
you know the %uh the the interface
enables small body is this as well

75
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,470
with typically refer to slow bite out of
his son and so on and so what

76
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:33,010
I'll if you think about this security
and privacy implications

77
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,350
of no ipv6 addresses I'll

78
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,820
on let's just assume for the time being
that we are talking about

79
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,870
other tests that in bed that Mike
address okay because there are many

80
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,550
different ways in which can sit

81
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,710
the interface eighty a one of the

82
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,669
implications is that you can correlate
network activity over time

83
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:55,200
and that's kinda like simple you have it
it you know it

84
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,370
feel that he say 64 bits long which is
18

85
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,650
a slate globally it globally unique
number because my country tis

86
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,160
at least in theory are supposed to be
globally unique so

87
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,480
if you see for example some sort of in
the face it:

88
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,500
I E you know you see some ipv6 address
at some point later on you in time

89
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,210
you see this same ipv6 address you can
easily tell that that's it's a note

90
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,700
why will the course if we are saying
that we embed them I countess

91
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,390
under my car is his globally unique a
then the interface eighty

92
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:29,150
is leaking out there identity of NO up

93
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,970
things can also be like actually worse
because

94
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,200
that of correlating they were activity
in the same nadler it's not that bad

95
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,260
but you know things get works when

96
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,300
up you can correlate

97
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,820
network DVD of an old a CMOS from one
network to another

98
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,020
they DA speed is simple if we are sane
that

99
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,490
the interface ATM bids the mic address
and that

100
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,690
Mike addresses globally unique that's
kind of like a bit in

101
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,950
it as serial number a unique serial
number

102
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:05,200
in the interface Eddie so for example we
could have an old

103
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,760
that connects to one network I'm gets
the safety six others

104
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,110
of course in bold here you can see
what's supposed to be

105
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:18,370
the increase eighty and then let's just
say that the same nose lobes

106
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,450
at some point in time to the southern at
work

107
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:25,800
of course the prefix will change because
he more than it was supposed to be the

108
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,440
strong one

109
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,450
but the interface a these the same

110
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,980
why because we're always some bedding
again you know that i cud is

111
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:37,710
so by looking %uh day in the face eighty
you can essentially did the final

112
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:42,850
and that's something that you know you
don't really want %uh

113
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:48,100
of course um if for example you than
that in the need to face a yarmulke

114
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:48,530
address

115
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:52,120
michaud Asus do follow patterns so for
example the upper

116
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,300
three bites correspond to what is
referred to us the

117
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,120
all you why or OEM

118
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,880
any sessional unique identify or
something like that which is a value

119
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,300
that identifies the vendor

120
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,889
that manufacture the new interface card
on you could

121
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:09,169
to some extent assume that the you know
no other three lights

122
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:12,699
are to something random but the ponies
that

123
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:16,639
if they re some structure in these feel
in the interface eighty

124
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,630
then I'm not occur that you know wants
to SCANA for a live notes

125
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:24,020
doesn't need to scan the whole slash 64
space

126
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,940
but can actually you know target a
specific product

127
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,300
and the final one

128
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,130
I with cheese from my perspective not
that important enough the previous ones

129
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,289
is that %uh my car is also leaks

130
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:41,590
information about lost it bender DUP
reviews the bites

131
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,620
sorry for some reason you know that
there is some

132
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:49,840
a lists a some Marler somebody really
did that affects

133
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,199
let's say the my sis manufactured by a
real take

134
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,190
just by lookin at the ipv6 address you
could tell the device

135
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:00,570
is fun factor by Realtek without the
need of even though we like

136
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:05,210
OS a up operating system stuck
fingerprinting

137
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,450
all that kind of stuff up

138
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:12,060
let's look a little bit more in into
legal

139
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,729
about these topics I'll the first one is
about scanning

140
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:19,130
I have kid AI have kept the SCA sly form

141
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:23,940
for a while and unfortunately to some
extent there is still some through do it

142
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,389
I so you still find people that claim
that be six

143
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:30,440
%uh the worse are note possible to scan

144
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,430
up is funny because a few times I've
been at conferences

145
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:38,849
when the previous speaker made exactly
the opposite

146
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:42,089
argument and then the well I had the
sliding my

147
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:47,040
in my talk um so you see the sort of
claims

148
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,430
quite a lot this is one of the inmates
up typically associated with

149
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,860
you know like me ipv6 security or with
ipv6 that if you want just gonna be sick

150
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,680
never eat

151
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,910
sensually take like asia's I'll

152
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,550
so usually when you see the sort of
claims you have like two options

153
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:07,610
I'll one of them ace you know what you
mean that the guy that said the sort of

154
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,220
thing

155
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,840
was on brock's on Jul 1 assuming then

156
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,790
all he had some sort of reasoning to get
to that conclusion so I assume the later

157
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:21,380
on the my I thought but I assume that
people make in this sort of claims

158
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:26,830
a they football respected that if not
occur wanted to scan on ipv6 network

159
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,360
they had to go through the entire

160
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,870
slashed 64 irish-based which of course
in that case yes

161
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,950
it would take like asia's well

162
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,720
but mall if you would like a more
elaborate on sir

163
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,860
there's these rough that we author there
has been this

164
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,660
stock in now lay waiting 42b

165
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,050
said for publication East draft dash

166
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:55,230
IDS up sick ipv6 cost-cutting we
describes

167
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,920
not only others coming which is the
topic then we are discussing right now

168
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,560
but it also discusses like or and many
different techniques

169
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,210
for you know they were reconnaissance
I'll

170
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,240
at some point in time what we try to do
it was to find out

171
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,700
whether you know the other sizzler
really run them you mean

172
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,300
have prolly or you may have seen these
results solar with either

173
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,680
we measured you know public Internet
servers

174
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,530
and try to find out or try to idolize if

175
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:28,600
the yeah this is we're following any
Potter so this is what we form for

176
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,040
example for web servers

177
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,410
up it doesn't really matter or it
doesn't make much sense to going to you

178
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:34,940
know they're

179
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:38,900
a specific details but what's important
here is that

180
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,350
if you look at the distribution of our
it is the other sis

181
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,530
keel clearly follow specific Potter's so
is not that they are to run them

182
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,680
for example these other sitting here

183
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,930
and what we call Arlo white other sis
which means that the address of the

184
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,700
server in that case was the prefix

185
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:00,290
on Sun small value so that means that
you said the interface 82 all zeros

186
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,810
adjust it you know some the the last
bite or so

187
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:07,180
were said to a small value this is the
same stuff

188
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,550
for main servers saying stop for the
Ennis overs

189
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:15,410
which I well you can easily till that
the patterns are even more clear

190
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:18,550
so for example if you are not a current
you were trying to find

191
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,420
you know allied systems you wouldn't
just try running

192
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,330
irises or even others is that in Big
Mike at recess you of course

193
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:29,510
will try to target the South recess
because like almost 75 percent of the

194
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,580
others decide their

195
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,400
okay then you could think about you know
well how old do you find these are the

196
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:34,870
ones

197
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,050
yeah I mean these ones could be
interesting or important

198
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:42,340
but of course %uh when I not occur is
trying to find systems to

199
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:46,780
to attack he is going to try first of
all to find the services that are

200
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,160
are no easier to find I'm a should I

201
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,530
more myself to the I think that it's
coping the microphone with the

202
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:58,580
this with this because the correct yes

203
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:05,140
okay well oh maybe this was at work

204
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,230
well

205
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:11,420
so when it comes to mediation of of

206
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:15,440
these issues I'll they all the stuff
that had been

207
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,090
laissez I'll the the say published by
the ATF

208
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:23,150
it worse you brawley what you probably
know why it's

209
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:27,810
I ipv6 temporary RSS out is that I run
the mice on the change over time

210
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:32,060
but the phone with those other sis is
that they are generally PayPal from La

211
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,680
and operational point of view so you
have a network analysts say that you

212
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,150
find that you know yesterday there was
some system that was trying to fit some

213
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,810
other systems on your local network

214
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:45,920
well um then you go to them they won't
try to find out what the device

215
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,810
you just don't know because the others
changes all the time so that something

216
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,680
like kill

217
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,420
could be a let's say I'm useful from the
privacy point of view

218
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,280
but when it comes to know the people
operate in network usually

219
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,280
results its its it it's actually painful

220
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,960
and this is a reason for week many
enterprises when they deploy v6

221
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,540
the just not the same bill temporary
offices all together

222
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:14,440
so we try that the time on this is
something that he's like a change

223
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,580
or like it some sort of progress from
last year we finally got these

224
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,220
RFC polish %uh this is what used to be
other

225
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,440
ATF 61 stable privacy RSS

226
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,910
so these are seeing the Polish already
I'll

227
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:33,380
this this r/c essentially propose like
an alternative way

228
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,300
to generate ipv6 addresses are they the
ice

229
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:40,100
extremely extremely simple I you
generate the interface Eddie

230
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,700
by hushing this is a harsh version
depressing on for the time being

231
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,580
%uh you can forget about every all the
other parameters just think about the

232
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,250
prefix

233
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,370
and the secret key okay so you

234
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:56,090
performance you so you could get a cash
over to prefix on a secret key

235
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:59,500
the secret key of course secret so if
you connect to

236
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,890
this network the perfect is going to be
some sort of pre-fixed

237
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:06,690
so you get some so for the cash portion
less now say that you moved to a

238
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:07,770
different network

239
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:11,610
is the prefered is going to change you
get any friendly interface eighty

240
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,470
but if you move back to the original
network you get exactly the same

241
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,370
interface a

242
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:20,070
why because the prefix didn't change so
the idea of

243
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:24,450
well of this a scheme is that why you
stay in the same then work

244
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:28,910
your address so with the same unstable
but as you move from one network to

245
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,410
another

246
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,910
your interface any changes so that that
something that is

247
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:37,260
no not we did on purpose so we won from
the point of view of the local network

248
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,360
the other is to be stable stable but not
predictable

249
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,050
so you always get the same others but
it's a random number so from the point

250
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,270
of view of the guys

251
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:48,290
running the local network your %uh this
is so with the same

252
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:52,370
so if they find that your system whilst
know trying to attack other devices

253
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,730
infecting other devices or

254
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,610
on Salon all day mopping from basic
service to

255
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:01,050
in on all is going to be straightforward
because every device

256
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:05,040
always gets a modest but as you move
from one they were to another thing that

257
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,030
they say the changes

258
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,510
would means that is not possible to
correlate network Pvt

259
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:13,370
you know across the network and at the
same time sees the interface said he's

260
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,860
going to be around the ball you

261
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,050
that means that if not occur wanted to
you know

262
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,180
scanned than they were well in that case
he should try

263
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,310
ok you need to try the whole slash 64

264
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:27,600
I outer space which would mean that you
know

265
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,300
police up a in theory such

266
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,210
study not tax would be impossible

267
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:38,120
as a kind of 0 what way this I describe
this already

268
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,330
as a kind of update this is something
that I don't know if it's public but

269
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:42,600
I'll

270
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,960
that I can share the release like the

271
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,270
they are working right up to in to
commit this

272
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:52,750
a to Linux at least two world what

273
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,990
I don't no known the much about the
internals of

274
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:59,630
of Linux but apparently there
implemented this in they were monitor

275
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:02,440
which is what about these you will use
when you have then you know the

276
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,810
graphical interface for generating the
other sis

277
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:09,370
on their faults from goal are very
interested in committing these 21 right

278
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:13,290
so that's a good thing so this is in the
works I'll

279
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:16,730
but I guess that we could expect that
the CR we

280
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,850
we will finally be able to find this in
the

281
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:26,850
you know in those operating systems up

282
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:32,130
yes I yeah

283
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:36,780
up yeah I what does so

284
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:40,100
the thing with you know in all these
cases where we are we r

285
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,020
assuming that Knowles they first of all
they take the iris

286
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:48,380
that the head I mean these are not the
same a leisurely

287
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:52,960
generating their ipv6 addresses so this
could be useful for some before the

288
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,430
casing we do you have a hostile

289
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:59,250
and you know the this knoll some there's
no such thing such as it does

290
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:03,240
it's a buyer's print the coffee ready
for not risk of course in this case yes

291
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,820
I mean you're did some extent okay I am

292
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:10,790
but a so what we're trained to

293
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,930
address here is a case in which knowing
ology to make

294
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:18,030
scenarios there's no one like explicitly
change in the RSS

295
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,900
and you want to be able to you know to
some extent be able to correlate network

296
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,390
Pvt

297
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:26,580
of course nothing prevents you from
citrus like even money reconfiguring the

298
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,330
for nitrous

299
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:32,090
K a another thing is that for example

300
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:36,250
when you use these scheme you are
mediated in know things such us

301
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,850
you know they were activity correlation
I of course

302
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,240
in the same way I mean you could not
only nowadays change your Rs

303
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,590
so that your activities cannot be
correlated but no

304
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:51,600
most people probably wouldn't do it okay
a

305
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,880
so I say said before there's a Linux
implementation in the works

306
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,130
I the got exactly if by the time I

307
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,650
the distal blasier these guys were
walking already but

308
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:06,010
you know there was some fall the Los I
think at the time

309
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:10,430
he was like the freelance insult to
speak the guy is now working for recut

310
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:15,800
and I am they are less able team or t14
getting the is committed

311
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:20,639
you know to Linux which is a good thing
I

312
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,620
but you know that in b6 you have
essentially two different mechanisms for

313
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,810
in on the work of new out on the network
operations 01 is

314
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:32,320
slack the other one is the ATP version 6

315
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,110
I when it comes to the aid to be the
Reese the CB version 6

316
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:39,310
their seles a no formal recommendation
on

317
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:43,950
hull in the ATP version 6 ever will
select the others is that he tries to

318
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,390
lease

319
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,810
to the client right so there have been
cases of the ATP racial six servers

320
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:52,520
with just generate incremental analysis
and of course there are

321
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,510
other cases in with the just run the
mice the the others is that the lease

322
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,620
so we try to the here he still port

323
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:04,230
the exactly the same scheme that would
force like for the ATP version 6

324
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:07,890
of course did you know the main
difference between the two schemes

325
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:12,330
is that in the case of luck this system
that he's out to a sign in the iris

326
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:16,530
is the one generating the IRS with us in
this case in the case of the ATP version

327
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:16,950
6

328
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:20,240
is the server the knees to you know
generate then

329
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,680
there the others to be released so in
the

330
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,200
near very similar way as in the case of
slack I'll

331
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,760
the interface eighty is computed a

332
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,040
us a source Aloha Shing a number of
parameters

333
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,230
as you can until easily here there's

334
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:41,410
the prefix undersea quickie this is this

335
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:45,240
these are the same two parameters that
we were employing in this similar scheme

336
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:45,730
for

337
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:49,410
know for slack there you know the stuff
that has to change it here

338
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:52,780
is that for example rather than having
and interface

339
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,160
identify your which we had in the
previews

340
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,640
no expression here we have these value I

341
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,560
a ID which is a you know I parameter
that you have in the ATP version 6

342
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,420
which somehow identifies a network
interface so it's kinda like the same

343
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,170
thing but

344
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:12,460
but in the ATP Vishal seeks speak and
then we have these

345
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,930
I key in the you it. would use

346
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:19,870
essentially like clay and serial number
so the idea is that

347
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,930
0 we use the press X we as the secret
key

348
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,650
but we also want to use a value that
will change from 1click client to

349
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:27,270
another

350
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:31,370
if not you know all clients will get the
same RSS and in the same way we want to

351
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:35,040
use somebody that identifies a network
interface card so think about for

352
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,750
example

353
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:40,470
some cost that has to network interface
cards the clay in a deal be the same

354
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:44,080
if the it's connected to the same they
were we both interfaces

355
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,360
preference is going to be the same
secret key is going to be the same

356
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,110
so it's going to be these value the one
that we were sold in different addresses

357
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,640
for

358
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,820
each of the interfaces so that
essentially the idea I one thing that

359
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:00,470
it's interesting from the scheme that
let's just assume that

360
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:04,320
you have for example for resiliency
porpoises

361
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,450
you have two different the 8gb version 6
servers

362
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,880
on the same network okay now

363
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,680
well if your the ATP visual six servers
work to assign just you know run them I

364
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,510
said missus

365
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:20,520
then the building on the DHCP server
that leases the address

366
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,800
you'll get a different address okay so
again

367
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,950
let's say we have truly from the it
should be servers if

368
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:31,890
the one that Israeli media this is this
one in mind probably pretty stable at Rs

369
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,550
but some sort of iris now if no it's
this other server

370
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:39,400
you know lease in the %uh this the
Russell to be different word

371
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,110
you can use on their property
proprietary protocols to that a

372
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:47,010
they can like synchronized the a the
other is least that amount

373
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:51,540
okay so you have some particle that Los
both the ATP visual six servers

374
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:55,340
to communicate with it we each other so
they said okay you know I have been

375
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,590
granting the saudis

376
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,890
so if you have to grant the same obvious
to the same note just the specific

377
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:00,670
address

378
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:03,750
but again you know the mechanisms

379
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,170
or that the particles that you know have
so far been specified for that a profit

380
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,020
re:

381
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,100
on the other thing is that again you
need like additional machinery

382
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,020
right protocol to synchronize the two
servers now

383
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,440
if you think about it a word %uh would
happen with these

384
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,920
scheme that we're describing here he
helped to the friend DHCP servers

385
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,150
and you go figure exactly the same
secret key on both

386
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:30,110
servers they would produce accepted the
same other sis not because they are

387
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:33,760
synchronized to the databases but
actually because of the algorithm itself

388
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,960
I mean all of all if all the parameters
are the same

389
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,280
of course the result is going to be the
same so the prefix is going to be the

390
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,770
same because it's the same network

391
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:45,780
I love these values are essentially had
to do with a client so they are going to

392
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,410
be the same

393
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:50,740
same thing here I'm secret key depends
on what you configure

394
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,810
so again you configure same secret key
on less a multiple servers they could be

395
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:55,670
5-10

396
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:59,150
whatever number of servers you 1 on all
the service

397
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,570
with end up for the San the same Otis so
this is something that

398
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:06,030
you is so I guess in nice side-effect of

399
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:11,310
implemented the skim I love this
document was adopted by

400
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:15,250
a.m. the the it should be working group
in November last year

401
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,250
on my plan is to have these

402
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:23,060
a ship for publication I'll do in the
next month or so

403
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:26,160
whether that's golson easy way or not

404
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,080
it's a whole different game but I i
think that from my perspective the

405
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,080
comment is pretty much

406
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,810
the a nice nothing is done

407
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:40,640
fault wrong for example I S E which is
one of the company that produces the ACP

408
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,420
version 604 %uh support the stuff or
they they supported out on the release

409
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,530
if you lost me whether that means that
they are going to implement it

410
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:54,190
I just don't know well

411
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:58,620
we talk about this already other
documents that are related to the stuff

412
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,840
that we have just described

413
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,080
so us to get off well site common when i
willz

414
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,120
I was describing the four RFC

415
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,700
seventy jewel seventy okay they you know
the mechanism or the %uh Greece import

416
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,510
for but the sea notices for slack

417
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:18,170
when they punish Dundalk a man like
gonna fight by the end of 2011

418
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:21,460
this same document officially the three
things at the time

419
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:25,430
up one of their worst or specify the
ugly from

420
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:28,510
okay I am

421
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:32,270
the other thing was that the local men
was describing the security and privacy

422
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,290
implications of the traditional

423
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:38,830
select other sis on the third one was
that the document will single

424
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:43,130
if you are if you were you know
generating your slack out missus by

425
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:46,220
embed into my car is you should do these
scheme

426
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:50,040
that we are proposing here K specify the
I believe

427
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,430
the algorithm formerly replace the
traditional slack

428
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,850
skim I'd also describe the security and
privacy implications

429
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:02,390
for resold which listen to the
unnecessary no

430
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:06,600
all-share they're really fun working
group but the ATF decided to speed up

431
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,320
the common you

432
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,820
into three different pieces one if's
sheriff's

433
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,830
RFC 7217 which is the one that was
polish

434
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:18,250
the other one is this one others
generation privacy

435
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,510
which essentially described the security
and privacy implications

436
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:24,910
so it just focuses on done I need us in
only

437
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:28,760
focus on the you know on the traditional
I

438
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,510
select scheme that it bears the mark
address but

439
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:35,600
describe the security and privacy
implications of essentially

440
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,250
every city every you know known I'll

441
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:43,130
interface Eddie generation mechanism the
stock a man

442
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:46,720
is like pretty much done so we are
waiting for

443
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,850
the working with chairs the Senate for
publication are you respect

444
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:54,110
and that a it should be polish as an RFC
this year

445
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:57,810
on the other document that we publish on
this topic

446
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:02,340
it is one the fall I A this what this
document does his ex

447
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:06,100
jimmy is simple its ace if you're going
to additional select calluses

448
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:10,520
you should not do that anymore you
should do RFC 7217

449
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,210
if you ask me then we really need a
separate RFC

450
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:18,000
I don't think so but this is what we did

451
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,059
if you want to finery suffer than

452
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:24,460
he's dead at the time that RFC

453
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:28,870
or what was the internet draft version
of RFC 7227 thing was adopted

454
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:32,190
like they're looking good wasn't sure
whether we were

455
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:35,940
whether it will save the right thing to
replace the traditional slack

456
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:40,179
scheme so from my perfect do what I will
love you this i Anna

457
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:43,610
or what you make up your mind whether we
Cup to replace the traditional

458
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:46,990
you know it's like scheme or non okay we
can less a focus

459
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:50,220
on stun device in this game so now we
have a seventy

460
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:54,350
7217 which is like I don't turn out the
way of generating interface Eddie

461
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:57,990
but no one tells you whether you should
do traditional slack

462
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:01,750
or 7217 so these documents actually say
sup

463
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:07,200
I'll I will suspect in this document to
be extremely straightforward and to be

464
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,690
like publishers in RFC

465
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:13,270
extremely quickly I life always
surprises he'll be like they're not the

466
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:13,760
bus

467
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,260
so they're worth like discussion on this
topic for example

468
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,429
there is some assay kind of brief
summary

469
00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:24,470
you have these I social commercially

470
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:27,980
refer to lick was cool six little no pun

471
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,260
which is like I use in ipv6 for a

472
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,409
low-power personal area network a
personal area networks

473
00:27:34,409 --> 00:27:38,940
so these are like barry a less a
constrained devices

474
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,000
on up for a number of reasons

475
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,140
they sort of Neil to use

476
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:48,159
I'll the traditional sly calluses for me

477
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,340
that's something that they shouldn't be
using the shouldn't be doing that but

478
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:51,860
they do

479
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:56,700
so they were essentially we question
asked to relax relax their requirements

480
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,320
a beat for them I wouldn't do that but

481
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,240
is did two possible options was to
continue fighting died 14

482
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,080
a long time or to say okay will do
whatever but you know for the general

483
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,510
case

484
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:11,140
you should do this so this is
essentially one with the with this

485
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,179
document so we say

486
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:16,049
if you're doing sex robot okay well you
can do whatever you want to some extent

487
00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:17,580
but for the general case

488
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,039
you should do 7217

489
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:26,330
yes you where got was in person I

490
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:29,929
thunderstruck yeah yes I

491
00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:35,159
when it comes to 72 17 which for me I
was just about to have like it

492
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:39,830
mental collapse so after going you know
through all the process

493
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:43,580
of you know fighting for the document to
me adopted

494
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,970
and you know been sent for final
publication

495
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:51,090
well it wasn't being are reviewed by the
ice sheet which is a group of area

496
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:51,789
directors

497
00:28:51,789 --> 00:28:55,980
there were guys that had the idea to
polish 7217

498
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:59,400
as information a document which means
that we could have never

499
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,630
made that you know make implementations
implement that because

500
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:06,669
he was an informational document so I
don't even know the resume but you know

501
00:29:06,669 --> 00:29:07,630
I get the planet's

502
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:12,580
were align on you we ended up publish in
the document as a standard track

503
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,600
but we were like these clothes to have
the common

504
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,320
publish us informational so is crazy at
times you say that you went through them

505
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,900
that almost the entire process on you
know everything is done

506
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,490
but there's always you know room for
surprises

507
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:31,549
but basis so like the you know when it
comes to

508
00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:36,110
looks this document I kinda like full
about this will come into conflict

509
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:40,409
personal bottle I personal successful
bottle because I have all the bottles

510
00:29:40,409 --> 00:29:41,909
that were not successful at all

511
00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:45,130
but I'll the fact that we were able you
know

512
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:48,840
other time when I you know when a person
that the stock when for the first time

513
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,240
liking

514
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:54,250
2011 I'll even people that know they
support is the comment will against the

515
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,100
document this document on

516
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,450
I could I don't know if I ever mention
the story but there were for example

517
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:01,280
guys working for

518
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:06,650
I benders of more iPhones that
essentially were a strictly against this

519
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:09,860
and they were asked what they were I
will sing such as well why should you

520
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,330
have privacy normal life all

521
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:15,490
of course they didn't say that on the
microphone

522
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:18,630
but they did say that actually have

523
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:22,740
yeah I but I but I'm sayin yeah

524
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,510
diet that's true but our I mean I'm
makin that sort of argument from me was

525
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,960
like I couldn't believe what I was

526
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,690
no hearing but a yes things happen so
these are

527
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:38,249
again the documents that we have on this
topic %uh this generation privacy and if

528
00:30:38,249 --> 00:30:39,019
ole these

529
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:42,970
both of these should be publish the
sierra you'd expect

530
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:46,940
so some of stuff on basics officially
others

531
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:50,200
there's quite a lot of stuff that I'm
not going to mention here

532
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:56,159
forcible there so I C 70 120 the one
that you know for beats the use of long

533
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,479
ipv6 extension header change that one
was Donna published like more than a

534
00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:01,559
year ago also

535
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:05,539
its all to some extent so I'm going to
describe other stuff

536
00:31:05,539 --> 00:31:08,970
I'll of the cutoff very brief

537
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:12,849
intrusion because the stuff is Raleigh
known by most of you

538
00:31:12,849 --> 00:31:16,009
so this is a structure of a v6 are

539
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:19,489
bucket on you know if you wanted you
could get to the bucket

540
00:31:19,489 --> 00:31:22,549
structure such as these one early have
their fix it Heather

541
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:25,549
a couple of this nation options Heather
on the

542
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:28,799
up earlier particles such as a TCP
segment okay

543
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,349
so in theory %uh you know these
structural 36 buckets

544
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:36,409
leads to increased flexibility and blah
blah blah blah

545
00:31:36,409 --> 00:31:39,840
in practice we know that BC's not that
much the case

546
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,289
I N this is therefore my

547
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:47,710
of package that employ from inpatient us
you really know

548
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:51,700
is from Edition is the six see
implemented by extension heather's

549
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,269
a a supposed to you know just some come
under 30 feels

550
00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:58,609
in the case of ipv4 I

551
00:31:58,609 --> 00:32:02,309
un 0 let's notebook

552
00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:05,309
livid about are so that was the theory

553
00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:08,769
when it comes to things from Heather so
let's talk about the reality of

554
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:09,720
extension headers

555
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,389
so first of all for many many different
reasons

556
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:17,210
you might need to find the upper layer
protocol in a fuckin

557
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:20,429
be this at this early like extremely
painful

558
00:32:20,429 --> 00:32:23,440
this is a case the one that I was
quoting before that

559
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,679
thankfully or fortunately snow but it
anymore is a case in which you have

560
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,669
this additional fuckin a new fragmented
into these two pieces

561
00:32:31,669 --> 00:32:35,269
on as you can see in this case you have
the extension

562
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:38,499
killer chain fragmented based in turn
had a chain itself

563
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:41,680
fragmented into the front pieces so the
first fragment

564
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,060
does not even contain although the
extension headers

565
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:48,160
K RFC 71 twill

566
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,830
if I recall correctly what they want to
forbid this so

567
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:55,150
I mean you shouldn't see these buckets a
anymore

568
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:58,840
if you were seen them or if you see
these buckets you are free to to

569
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,980
you know to drop them but even then even
if you don't see

570
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,670
this kind of bike is like from in the
traffic even these buckets

571
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:09,590
I like PayPal if you come to see if I
will device that means that in order to

572
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,150
be able to look at the port numbers

573
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:15,890
you have to sharm through all of the
extension headers I don't know if you

574
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:18,550
follow us some of their ATF make the
list

575
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:21,600
all right now there's some sort of
interesting discussion

576
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,100
thing they be six OPS a mailing list a

577
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:30,720
their son in to rid of that I co author
day's been discussed on one

578
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,560
you know one of the interesting going
about a red this week

579
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:38,040
um it was from a guy that I know Brian
carpenter

580
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,580
and He wills essentially saying that you
know

581
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:45,140
he have been speaking with people
working on hard-working

582
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:48,310
me like no hardware implementation of
things or or protocols

583
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:51,630
on these structure is essentially
painful

584
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:55,410
and is known to be painful to
implementing how work to end to any guy

585
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,810
doing you know how we're implementation
of stuff

586
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:00,840
I unfortunately

587
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:05,060
this is that the sign that we help a so
there's no much though

588
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:09,100
there's people that are you the we
should prolly the brigade

589
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:13,000
extension hair so together I I

590
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,389
know how much of a a strong opinion on
that but what I

591
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:20,070
or this couple which I do have a strong
opinion is

592
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:23,750
doubt it of you know a deprecated
extension togethers

593
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:27,800
would have like a baby baby baby baby
hard time at the ATF

594
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,390
soul no matter whether that make sense
or not is an idea that in practice

595
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:37,630
into the flight at the idea so I'll

596
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:41,880
so %uh a brief discussion about the you
know the

597
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,580
a the security implications of extension
headers so

598
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,780
if for example you I'll process

599
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:52,260
the extension Heather in sophomore the
use of extension

600
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:56,169
heather's gun lead to denial-of-service
situations I

601
00:34:56,169 --> 00:34:59,880
because you know in maybe CPU intensive
I

602
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,550
way we were having dinner yesterday one
of the guys mentioned that

603
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:06,590
know he shot these router that worse

604
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:10,260
employees in all the time at least 10
percent of CPU

605
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:14,980
under was because I when he was trying
to enforce

606
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,540
ipv6 a ACLs that of enable

607
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:24,370
any ipv6 ACL by itself Coast it I P six
pockets to be processing software

608
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:27,530
okay so again

609
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:30,920
you think I didn't have any ACL at all
the fuck is could be you know

610
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,790
process in horror but that of just you
know in a lil any sort of

611
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:39,890
ACLs on on b6 buckets Co said all the
Pakistani process and so forth what was

612
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:40,600
the end result

613
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,490
assume I expect he disable the ACLs okay

614
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:47,750
for his particular it you know scenario

615
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:51,170
so this is one of the problems that it
you know

616
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:54,310
Exeter killers are known to cause that

617
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:57,950
still processing it is a killer chain is
expensive %uh

618
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:02,620
some another thing that is usually
associated with excision killers in the

619
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,750
particular case with

620
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:07,220
you know the frightening hither is a
fragmentation is is secure

621
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:11,780
on one hand one of the reasons for which
people you know the in fragmentation us

622
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:15,420
your is secure so to speak I'll is
because

623
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,610
fragmentation he said or reassembly in
particular

624
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:22,680
is a staple process see if you are in
old and you receive a fragment you need

625
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,250
to keep that fragment in memory

626
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:27,730
to be able to reassemble the friendly
with other fragments i'd of course

627
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:30,920
appointing would you require a note to
keep something in memory

628
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,060
that means that the %ah to curb gun you
know los en la to prime lens

629
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:37,170
I dole out of the sudden you need to
this I would you go with all of the fry

630
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,270
was that you have in memory

631
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:43,170
sewed up that's one of the reasons up
that a return or

632
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:47,220
you on that topic abiam X exploited for
denial-of-service porpoises

633
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:52,200
the other one which is known for more
than less a fifteen years from that

634
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,120
before will

635
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:58,170
fragmentation you know I can give their
network intrusion detection system heart

636
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:01,390
a hard time because you you know you
fragmented packets in

637
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:04,770
tricky ways and then that means that you
know in

638
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:08,110
system trying to and money to run their
stand the prime lense

639
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:11,430
you know can essentially fail the other
one

640
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:16,850
is that unfortunately even 1b6 from
addition is extremely extremely similar

641
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:17,490
to

642
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:21,180
big for fragmentation I we've had lots
of bugs

643
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:24,960
in you know the ipv4 fragmentation and
reassembly call

644
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,440
I we also have look for Vikes e96

645
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,560
fragmentation and reassembly called so
the thing is that a

646
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,530
even you know a the same a rotors have
been falling

647
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:38,870
to how bart's in this area so many

648
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:42,450
people started to associate
fragmentation

649
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:46,060
with problems that is not necessarily
the case I mean

650
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:49,420
it's not that been there is chill
produce but he called

651
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:52,430
right but in practice it happens

652
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:56,820
so does a reason for which you know a
you will find other

653
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:00,290
many no worse they they just a the sable

654
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:04,120
or throw buckets that improbably a any
fish in heathers

655
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,270
not just you know this Asian options or
the like but eat even

656
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:11,460
fragmentation lol what else

657
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:14,800
I am so

658
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,860
a sorry so love these considerations %uh
what happens is that a

659
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:22,300
many operators sexually fit their
pockets with extension headers

660
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,170
I'll to some extent this is

661
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,800
not very problematic because for the
most part we don't really

662
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,970
rely on extension kit for anything so
there's no really a protocol that for

663
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:34,730
example

664
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:39,220
I realize relies on the use of ipv6
destination options

665
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:43,740
so in practice your looking some sort of
market study practice you don't need

666
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:47,660
the only by guest star are or that could
be problematic

667
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:52,630
East II PC cracked those are pockets the
week I'm proud that

668
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:57,200
at least at some point we might need to
rely on them for example the NS traffic

669
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,200
my resold in ill a fragment the traffic

670
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,380
but steel when it comes to fragment the
traffic

671
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:09,340
many no worse actually feed their those
buckets

672
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:12,540
%uh some so in all the

673
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:16,510
end result of this is that if you employ
basics extension headers

674
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:19,660
that is likely to result in

675
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:22,690
bucket drops %uh we

676
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:26,230
the seems the last two or three years

677
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:30,480
we try to produce a measurements
regarding the extent to which

678
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,970
packet we extension headers are dropped
so this is dead drop rate

679
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:38,150
for bike is that employ this additional
charge

680
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:42,990
Heather of a bites hope I hope options
of eight bytes

681
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:46,680
on this is just fragments of 512 bytes

682
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:51,810
I mean this is something that you could
respect dropping hope I hope officials

683
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:55,620
because these buckets in all generate
the CPU

684
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:59,860
a or or treater CB all use in the
intermediate routers

685
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:03,840
but up this is something that you

686
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:08,180
brody or an aspect an email list this
one so this means that for example given

687
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,190
name servers

688
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:13,840
the field the fragment a nameserver
themself might be needed

689
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:18,540
fragments okay sold to be honest um I
think the first time that I D

690
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,110
some sort of berry rough measurements
which

691
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:25,390
the brawny wash 2012 I think

692
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:30,590
I was kinda like surprises by the result
and then we presented the spirit and

693
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:31,200
soul

694
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,200
when you have an idea of meeting on
Sunday like

695
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,860
formally speaking before the ATF meeting
there's a group that's cool

696
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:41,540
the I reach I E PG I don't even recall
without stands for

697
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:45,400
but let's just say that he said a group
of people that is some moral for

698
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,630
practitioners so those big people with a
more practical Bagram

699
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:51,750
are supposed to just your theory ennui

700
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:56,140
have in all percent that they were sold
their I we saw a lot of interest from

701
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,050
the communique

702
00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:01,480
I'll take it from the community so well
me on a number of other people we ended

703
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,950
up doing more and more measurements on
the topic

704
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:08,009
be so the a slight shows there

705
00:41:08,009 --> 00:41:11,799
so it appears light what we say is well
if you sent buckets

706
00:41:11,799 --> 00:41:16,180
with extension heather's for example in
this case you get a forty percent of

707
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:19,309
bucket drops okay now the question is

708
00:41:19,309 --> 00:41:23,069
well in those cases in with your pockets
are being dropped so we are assuming

709
00:41:23,069 --> 00:41:26,890
already that your pockets are being
dropped so when your pockets are being

710
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:27,209
dropped

711
00:41:27,209 --> 00:41:31,400
are they drop by the you know final
destination like that this nation a yes

712
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,969
or are they drop by some intermediate
Easter so this is what we make sure

713
00:41:35,969 --> 00:41:39,029
%uh this is the drop great

714
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:42,130
by DEFRA no tunnel systems so

715
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:45,940
not there up best in a shelter in the
system

716
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:49,400
but a tricycle total system okay so that
means

717
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,930
one markets R drop so given the packets
are dropped

718
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:56,529
what's there to rate in which you know
packets are dropped by 80 for

719
00:41:56,529 --> 00:42:00,630
yes so you get a well you know from
almost 10 to 50 percent

720
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:05,099
on this is kind of like really ugly why
because is not just there

721
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:09,309
know that this nation of your pockets
that he say no I don't like your pockets

722
00:42:09,309 --> 00:42:12,449
but he sexually the network itself so
it's actually worse

723
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:16,369
so you don't even at times you don't
even get to the destination but

724
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:22,150
in the middle didn't know what is
dropping your pockets I'll

725
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:26,269
so the first couple of life this one on
this one I'll

726
00:42:26,269 --> 00:42:29,579
though we produce these results

727
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:32,930
I for by measuring they

728
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:36,199
early stove web sites that are a polish

729
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:39,839
in there were able to six launched a I
which are not the main size maybe

730
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,299
something like a thousand and then we

731
00:42:42,299 --> 00:42:46,569
the this same sort of measurements but
with the Alex esta 1 medium

732
00:42:46,569 --> 00:42:51,449
a website okay well web sites and also
made service a name servers

733
00:42:51,449 --> 00:42:55,410
if you were yesterday out by polka maybe
six talkin

734
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:59,609
I briefly describe you know whole we
ended up grabbing %uh this is for web

735
00:42:59,609 --> 00:43:00,880
server's name servers

736
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,349
on and main service so you come see that

737
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:08,400
you know why the you know the drop a
race might but it may very likely to be

738
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,900
you kinda like the person dishes is are
the same so

739
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,530
this commission officials are draw but

740
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:18,860
that much then hold back home options
are extremely largely dropped

741
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:23,450
on Friday mints are also largely dropped
to I am

742
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:27,590
when it comes to drops by a different
note animal systems

743
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:30,880
world well the so the stocks that we got

744
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,130
so you can see that i'd I'd even really
like

745
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:38,370
the come up with an explanation a

746
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:42,460
regarding wide East looks like very
different from the east to some extent

747
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,400
so the store kinda like similar

748
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,850
but this one is different II yes

749
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:54,850
yes

750
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:10,490
yes

751
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:14,320
that's true yes

752
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:18,870
alright yes that's a good explanation
yes so what we

753
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:23,430
did for the measurements we a discarded
duplicate other sis

754
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:27,100
but you're right that you could have the
for now this is but belonging to the

755
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:27,800
same as:

756
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:32,890
so the S that's that's very likely there
are other things like nobody Asians have

757
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:33,470
these data

758
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:37,020
you know we could have implemented to
try to you know get different views

759
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,220
such as for example not just filtering
duplicate other sis

760
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:44,800
but filter Orcus either that to others
is that belong to the same

761
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,700
slash 64 are actually duplicates because
if something that goes to less a

762
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,940
a FCC to see local one but no one

763
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:57,440
is fitter well the packet that goes to
the same others but not about to

764
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,540
is going to be fitter to so does her
body asians the

765
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:06,320
yet we could prolly you know implement
yes

766
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,500
yes yes so there were like

767
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:13,490
I think that a in one of the the oh well
the first time that

768
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:16,830
I presented results on the topic I I

769
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:20,120
so I but use measurements

770
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:24,400
this card and obligate other sis on even
not discard in duplicate addresses

771
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,420
if you don't discard duplicate addresses
you get like it some

772
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:30,890
kinda like impatiently waited I results

773
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:34,670
so let's say the ipv6 addresses that are

774
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:39,030
hosting more sites gear like more weight
in their results or

775
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:43,080
be I would say that you know both a
alternative sorry Thorsten

776
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:46,770
they they give you a different
perspective so on the topic but you know

777
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:49,900
bottom line at the end of the day um I
think that what's

778
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,100
in testing from these results is that
you know

779
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:56,250
markets with extension heather's are
dropped and to a lesser extent

780
00:45:56,250 --> 00:46:03,250
yes haha

781
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,510
huh

782
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:25,510
up

783
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:30,809
haha

784
00:46:30,809 --> 00:46:33,640
well I was it the common from Eric what
I can say

785
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:37,770
I also yes whether the his measurement
results were public

786
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:41,720
he said that they were not so I

787
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:46,670
I wasn't able to analyze that so that's
one thing the other thing that you know

788
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:51,279
even if a he also mentioned other the
measurements that he did were

789
00:46:51,279 --> 00:46:54,589
like rather limited that doesn't mean
that he did Commissioner miss harris

790
00:46:54,589 --> 00:46:55,160
also

791
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:58,960
change but they might be limited or by

792
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,140
bias to some extent on the other thing
is that

793
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:05,160
I am let's say we are measuring
different things

794
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:08,770
so what he's measuring is whether
extension cather's

795
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:12,539
work from a server where he knows that
are not feature

796
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:15,599
to a client well as well we r Mishary
here

797
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:19,650
is whether extension cather's work from
a client two servers okay

798
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:23,329
I am so

799
00:47:23,329 --> 00:47:27,760
what I can say from these results is
that a if you try to communicate with

800
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,660
public servers

801
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:31,910
buckets are largely dropped on

802
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:35,920
you know we're young we have a document
I'm going to mention they know they they

803
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,270
the finding like later but a

804
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:44,160
in our interfaith it now we're into the
draft we describe like step-by-step

805
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,880
how you can reproduce teeth result is
not something I can't well you know I

806
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,170
cannot tell you why but I form blah blah

807
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:53,770
so this is something that you can return
your son you know you can find you can

808
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:55,049
be sure that you're so fun

809
00:47:55,049 --> 00:47:58,799
you know drive your own conclusions up

810
00:47:58,799 --> 00:48:01,880
let's just say that um there's I was

811
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,819
seen that there sa right now there's
some discussion going on on the basics

812
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:06,230
ops

813
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:09,339
working good mail in this regard this
and

814
00:48:09,339 --> 00:48:12,490
I am you know many people see you

815
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:15,500
our have seen this sort of measurements
us

816
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:19,529
less a rather controversial there's the
people that are like more

817
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:23,539
thus a conservative are these all like
to hear that something that is supposed

818
00:48:23,539 --> 00:48:24,670
to be a core part of

819
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:29,819
ipv6 doesn't really work a suspected on
there are some for have also mentioned

820
00:48:29,819 --> 00:48:30,510
other

821
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:34,049
forcible Cisco is pushing well what
segment wielding

822
00:48:34,049 --> 00:48:37,720
on segment routing employs extension
headers

823
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,700
so it probably doesn't make much of a
good marketing

824
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:44,049
for them to be employing extension
Heather something aus

825
00:48:44,049 --> 00:48:47,299
coming up and saying you know extension
Gunners don't really work that much

826
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:54,299
%uh

827
00:48:54,609 --> 00:48:57,859
I still need to make sure of the
heathers

828
00:48:57,859 --> 00:49:02,960
I can't say that I you'd expect them to
me drop probably even here more

829
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,319
done any of the only official heather is
that we Misha here

830
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:09,380
Aug just to give you on another example
that

831
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:13,930
is not in the in the middle of is not in
this Lie's but I mention I i wrote I E

832
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:15,859
also measured the extent to which

833
00:49:15,859 --> 00:49:21,430
IP sick packets are dropped I'd be sick
in b6 our extension headers to

834
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:25,250
on the get dropped to so even before
getting

835
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:28,480
we're not talking about of course
probably the final destination or

836
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,880
destinations is that will drop them
because there's no security association

837
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,539
but they are dropped before they get to
the you know to the

838
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:40,640
to the intended destination so I expect
them to be dropped to so what does all

839
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,250
this mean

840
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:44,250
up first of all if you are up

841
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:47,980
if you want to use extension here
there's you will have to be

842
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:51,760
baby lucky I some I

843
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:56,539
up blasier I'll when I publish like an
elevation of a document that I'm going

844
00:49:56,539 --> 00:49:57,349
to describe

845
00:49:57,349 --> 00:50:01,210
now I my recommendation was that any guy

846
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:04,430
ISA producing a protocol

847
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:07,740
that relies on extension headers should
at least

848
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:11,170
ball ideally not really rely on
extension headers

849
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:15,180
buddy for some reason they wanted to
they should provide some sort of backup

850
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:15,880
mechanism

851
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,869
okay because liable because in many
cases extension headers don't work

852
00:50:19,869 --> 00:50:23,579
%uh that generated a lot of discussion

853
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:26,619
or like a flame or if you want at the
ATF

854
00:50:26,619 --> 00:50:29,819
so we essentially have to remove all of
that

855
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:33,420
from the document I still think in
exactly the same way but

856
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:37,859
that's not mission in into in the
document but another

857
00:50:37,859 --> 00:50:41,359
think that you know it's nice to go see
their that is that a know quite a few

858
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:42,150
times

859
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:46,289
%uh you know people consider that a
extension headers

860
00:50:46,289 --> 00:50:49,319
are awesome for up that proposes on

861
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:50,550
if they are dropped

862
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:53,880
mean they are not just throw for
legitimate purposes but also when you're

863
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,380
trying to use them to perform

864
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:58,420
for you know performing at X this means
that

865
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:03,090
in many cases if you try to use
extension heather's to

866
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:06,510
lessee door some evil task or some

867
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:10,230
evil a yes something evil with the
remote system

868
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:13,720
in many cases the use of Exeter killers
by itself

869
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:17,670
will mean that your pockets are brought
before they get you know tulip target

870
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:18,320
destination

871
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:21,340
so if you are not occur well extension
killers

872
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:25,680
can be awesome if they are not dropped
but in many cases the archtop

873
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,970
okay soul rather done you know hoping
you lean

874
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:33,820
you know unless a evading a they want
russian detection system or so on

875
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:37,690
they might also mean that you're
actually you know helping your

876
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:40,780
target near were by you know flight in
your pockets on

877
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:44,740
dropping them I'll so if you are

878
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:47,830
you know again up to doing something
evil you should prolly

879
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:51,120
first of all figure out whether your
pockets are actually getting to the

880
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,540
network you want to attack

881
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:56,440
or penetration this Oh whatever ups

882
00:51:56,440 --> 00:52:00,720
work %uh ongoing work in this area

883
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:05,330
I first of all this is the document that
I was mention

884
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:10,040
I was mission in that house I results
from all these measurements

885
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:13,710
so if you will for this document think
they'll

886
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:16,900
the delay distribution worse a number
co2

887
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:21,300
I you will get like a summary of their
whistles that we got

888
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:24,690
when measuring you know a maid service
will celebrate a son

889
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:28,120
names and name servers on I am

890
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:31,290
dokument also contains like

891
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:35,860
the step-by-step instructions on how to
use the ipv6 toolkit

892
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:38,960
dole ripping use exactly the same
results that we got in the

893
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:43,530
that we polish in the document the
second a comment here

894
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:47,940
he said the comment that I think if my
assessment is correct

895
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:51,470
that has been already adopted by the
OPSEC working group

896
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:54,540
%uh he said ok amend that essentially

897
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:58,150
up relations vice on the field during of
ipv6 extension kit there's

898
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:01,150
unfortunately I'd say that a

899
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:02,810
the document even when I

900
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:07,190
make wall for it doesn't necessarily
reflect exactly what I think

901
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:10,470
I'll so what are you probably the least
drop

902
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:15,510
loss of them on the in this case based
on feedback that we we see from the

903
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:18,150
working group we are trained to really
like

904
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:22,890
less a nicer and trying to our lil us
many a station here so it's possible

905
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:25,980
so that's something that at times
happens

906
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:29,690
you know when you work on documents up
for the idea of

907
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:33,970
the initial version of your documents
reflect 100 percent or close to what you

908
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:34,460
think

909
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:38,370
and then us they become adopted on the
progress

910
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:42,150
in the with the process of being
publisher site of cease you have to what

911
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:45,100
is the comments from many other people
and at times you don't even agree with

912
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,820
the document that you offer yourself

913
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:52,400
but a others the solar document RFC

914
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,420
a 7045 which was published last series
for recall correctly

915
00:53:56,420 --> 00:54:00,200
which essentially I but why is it

916
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,960
i buy so clarification dole ipv6
implementations

917
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,730
regarding what they should be doing with
extension headers

918
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:13,010
this is not operational a vice but
rather advice to the six implementations

919
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:17,570
okay and finally there's this document
that we

920
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:20,570
polish but he's essentially
complimentary

921
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:24,890
to the so the one so these one just
focuses on the extension headers

922
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:29,530
I without talking about ipv6 options
with us our document this one

923
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:33,210
focuses on a basic such ipv6 options

924
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:37,030
I'll

925
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:41,490
some comments about the front when
Heather itself so this is the syntax of

926
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:42,600
the fragment Heather

927
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:46,410
we're not going to you know this crime
reach of the feel see here

928
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:50,700
but a you know I when it comes to the
discussion though we're going to have

929
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:54,850
right now where we are interested in is
the identification

930
00:54:54,850 --> 00:54:58,490
feel this is the same thing that you had
in before

931
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:02,250
uneven deficient number is used to
identify fragments that belong to the

932
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:05,790
or that identify the same buckets %uh

933
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:08,960
from the ipv4 wall already win

934
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:13,490
air we know all that a if you use
predictable from any indication but use

935
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:17,000
you know that leads to you know
different security implications

936
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,319
the possibility of the night of service
at the council on

937
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:25,109
simplest example be that a if I'm
sending him like I P six fragments

938
00:55:25,109 --> 00:55:28,390
on the from anybody that I'm using are
predictable

939
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:32,140
for example he could send the school
fragments that coli

940
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:36,069
with mine so now he gets like lot a
fragment with the same fraternity and he

941
00:55:36,069 --> 00:55:38,770
doesn't know which of the fragments
elegy to me than which

942
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:43,930
on the front lines are not when a look
at least for the first time I say well

943
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:44,940
in all of these

944
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:48,040
implications were no from the beef or
wall so

945
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:51,550
prolly they are not I implemented in the
six

946
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:54,630
so these are some of the results that I
go to the time

947
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:58,890
I recently measured %uh Cisco I US I

948
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:03,220
because saw there were arguments and
Emilys I will all you know

949
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:07,140
the yeah it's true that some
implementations where Boehner able to

950
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:07,900
the stuff

951
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:11,819
but does but that was only like all
implementations

952
00:56:11,819 --> 00:56:14,839
on then I said okay let's take a look at
you know

953
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:18,640
some other implementations likes Cisco
US as he call us:

954
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:23,140
us far as I have checked they use
predictable up front when 80s

955
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:28,180
ugh they use a global conder initialize
to see running committed by one for each

956
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:31,940
I'll go in front when which he said all
we have seen the worst possible

957
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:36,589
skin okay up on the other side

958
00:56:36,589 --> 00:56:40,220
assign some nice things if you won

959
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:43,490
ugly so that s a Linux they a

960
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:47,520
they've watch their fragmented
degeneration in response to the

961
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,670
internet-draft that we polish these
worst fucking

962
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:53,839
2011 for recall correctly I

963
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:57,700
that's something that is nice I am of
the idea that a no politician no

964
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:58,359
comments

965
00:56:58,359 --> 00:57:02,619
up Tynes can be nice if you have some
sort of idea that the serbs it

966
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:06,790
but I'll you know a things done we work
on paper

967
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:09,910
soul what I personally enjoy is when

968
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:13,089
something that you know that you
publishing it took a minute

969
00:57:13,089 --> 00:57:16,630
eventually gets into and implementation
so for me that of

970
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:19,710
no politician a document if anything is
this a

971
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:22,330
fifty percent of the work that needs to
be done the other 50

972
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:26,380
percent is getting that implemented so
usually when

973
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:29,840
you know I publish documents I tried to
socialize them with

974
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,940
a.m. developers from open-source
operating systems

975
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:37,360
on that they're you know they're they're
let's say the benefits from that east of

976
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:37,810
all

977
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:40,990
all like an you get feedback and maybe
the

978
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:44,480
might catch errors of loss in this game
that you are proposing

979
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:48,470
I or even if they are not like 100
percent ross

980
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:52,810
they might help you improve the stuff
that you did on the other thing is that

981
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:55,760
if the really like the stuff that you
propose then you know they might

982
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,830
implement that and the

983
00:57:57,830 --> 00:58:01,510
for example I use Linux so I only get to
know

984
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:05,120
I only get to know this stuff that I D
sign so to speak

985
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:09,300
if these guys from the nose get to
implement it well

986
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:12,900
so that's something that is a nice early
not-so-nice at least budget this

987
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:17,050
I I had novel no luck at all we Windows

988
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:20,080
I'll other time we up

989
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:23,920
saw the time I was working on this stuff
I was working for them

990
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,960
defence organisation in the UK or was
doing work for them

991
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:31,720
and so they come like required me to you
know the

992
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:34,860
this irresponsible discuss your process
some blah blah blah

993
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:38,570
um at least my experience at the time
was that

994
00:58:38,570 --> 00:58:42,100
you know talking with some of these
companies was like a total waste of time

995
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:46,220
I you'll end up exchanges like 10-15
emails

996
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:49,340
on you will see any changes at all

997
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:52,430
I'll let us on the other hand I am

998
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:55,740
I you say that about talking with the
open sewer

999
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:59,240
with developer from open-source
operating systems I

1000
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:03,250
you know get you a completely different
experience so typically you good morning

1001
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:05,780
they pursue fully understand what
they're talking about which is already

1002
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:06,450
like

1003
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:10,370
we good thing %uh you usually get label
free but

1004
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:14,610
on not just that I mean usually up you
finally get the stuff implemented

1005
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:18,600
I think that he took the Linux folks
like no more than two weeks to get this

1006
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:19,300
implemented

1007
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:22,550
same thing for a for OpenSolaris okay

1008
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:28,690
up there stood tall in the sixth or get
that a Los you

1009
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:32,920
dole I Asus the fragment a

1010
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:36,880
air identification policy at the knoll
so if you run

1011
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:41,820
products Frank 6 in this way so the
Options privacy policy

1012
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:45,020
and then a he use the feel some

1013
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:48,150
sort of this initial system I

1014
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:51,790
the door will inform you you know what

1015
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:56,240
the let's say they all agree some that
some implementation niece

1016
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:00,470
a its employing I'm not going to run the
door right now because I'm not

1017
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:03,730
sure how we are in you know with the
time but

1018
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:07,570
if we you know get to the questions
section on you know we see have enough

1019
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:08,000
time

1020
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,720
I can run the stalls but this you know
extreme NEC just

1021
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:15,420
if you have like a United terminal
opened just replace

1022
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:18,760
the saudis which whatever out if you
want to test

1023
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:22,130
on what the door will go East it will

1024
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:27,180
try to infer whether for example the
fragmented the generation i go to them

1025
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:31,880
for the UCS like run the mightiest or
for this is some sort of predictable

1026
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:35,850
seconds when you boss said the meanest
be option

1027
01:00:35,850 --> 01:00:39,460
you also get like a dump of the a

1028
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:44,200
of the fragment maybe some balls that it
all takes okay so even if they don't got

1029
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,470
not really figure out

1030
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:50,610
whether there is some sort of Potter for
the from anybody who's

1031
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:54,090
you could be able to your journal to
infer that yourself

1032
01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:57,360
%uh I'm going

1033
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:01,210
or skip this %uh but you know what are
the implications of

1034
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:06,570
I of predictable from 90s East other
implementation of

1035
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:10,510
I those gun about the yes he implemented
the I those companies

1036
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:14,060
committed to an MUP so he essentially

1037
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:18,000
a implemented for em up I'll exactly
these

1038
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,490
stuff that I am describing here which is
essentially are you my recall from

1039
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:25,510
the ipv4 wall I don't recall what it was
I this gun

1040
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:29,560
call I'll which essentially means that
you gun ports come

1041
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:32,880
is system without actually sending any
pockets

1042
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:37,480
to that system itself %uh just going
extremely quickly

1043
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:40,690
so we could I very quickly

1044
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:44,130
%uh describe how the idols gun works so

1045
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:45,840
%uh let's say that

1046
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,990
if you are not occur and you wanted to
do lunch I those gun

1047
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:53,240
let's say that this is this on the
system this is the victim the one that

1048
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:53,990
you want to

1049
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:57,080
you know to scan what you do is first of
all

1050
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:00,390
you some poor the core I of course all
of these

1051
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:03,550
assuming that a there you know this some
BS

1052
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:07,890
a implementing predictable from an 80's
so would you do

1053
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:11,520
is you what some people the current for
a fragmented the value

1054
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:15,640
so in this case is 45,000 that you send
the same bucket

1055
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:19,870
to the victim on if they're correspond
import is open

1056
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:24,550
then you'll get us to respond the scene
ok on their recent bucket

1057
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:28,510
a from the some then when you some pool

1058
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:31,800
the franklin et de again sees the
something send

1059
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:36,090
a pocket here the frame in a deal the
45,000

1060
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:39,510
and two okay because it different from
when I D issues for

1061
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:44,510
age outgoing packet on the other hand if
you have this scenario

1062
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:49,020
in which you have a close poor you first
of all sample the car in front when I D

1063
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:53,590
if these for a 45,000 then you send the
same bucket the here

1064
01:02:53,590 --> 01:02:57,510
as his support disclose the victim was
false

1065
01:02:57,510 --> 01:03:00,780
within their a with every sip now you

1066
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:04,510
says you don't need to respond to resets
this only here

1067
01:03:04,510 --> 01:03:09,010
is no going to send any pocket okay so
now would you some people

1068
01:03:09,010 --> 01:03:14,550
the fragment ID again the car in front
when it is going to be 45,000

1069
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:17,890
1 okay so essentially you know if

1070
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:21,980
and implementation uses predictable from
many these you are able to till

1071
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:26,490
whether that implementation sent any
pockets any fragmented packets

1072
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:29,620
between any of your proves okay so

1073
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:33,160
we send it pro here then weekend

1074
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:37,010
see that the the song be sending a
pocket something with some believe in

1075
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:38,780
the franklin et d'un week until

1076
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:43,400
by their frontman anybody's that this on
be sent pocketing between

1077
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:47,470
in this but in this all the case with
the same thing

1078
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:50,860
with sample the fragment ID then we send
our per packet

1079
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:54,610
on one with some pull the franklin et
the again week until that there were no

1080
01:03:54,610 --> 01:03:56,090
pockets and in between

1081
01:03:56,090 --> 01:03:59,720
because the you know the two from when I
decide consecutive

1082
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:02,970
so of course one of the way still meet
the 80s other

1083
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:06,260
is officially not to employ predictable
from Manny's

1084
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:10,039
okay so we published these

1085
01:04:10,039 --> 01:04:15,250
book a man like care while all we see
thirty-year so yes thirty-year cycle

1086
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:18,740
I other time

1087
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:22,930
these local man was thunderstruck so
essentially among other things

1088
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:26,180
what he described the problem described
the security implications

1089
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:29,569
on also require all basics
implementations

1090
01:04:29,569 --> 01:04:33,630
dole you know employees numb predictable
from when I the values

1091
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:37,650
then there were complaints in the
working world so we changed the truck of

1092
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:39,279
this document to informational

1093
01:04:39,279 --> 01:04:42,299
okay on a full

1094
01:04:42,299 --> 01:04:46,329
you know us know what we should have
done but you know if that go if that

1095
01:04:46,329 --> 01:04:49,529
we load of the bombers had no comment so
be it

1096
01:04:49,529 --> 01:04:54,619
by the you know this document was
recently revealed by their work in

1097
01:04:54,619 --> 01:04:55,369
wheelchairs

1098
01:04:55,369 --> 01:04:58,950
and they are are doing that these
documents shouldn't be published at all

1099
01:04:58,950 --> 01:05:03,170
for me the Sun extremely but idea but
I'll

1100
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:06,309
it is what it is okay up thanks

1101
01:05:06,309 --> 01:05:09,400
you know went to the woman was just
under is thunderstruck

1102
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:12,690
I'll a big concern from many people

1103
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:16,519
is that a I when we publish stunned the
stack

1104
01:05:16,519 --> 01:05:19,880
documents I those documents give the

1105
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:23,009
the audience the public the idea that

1106
01:05:23,009 --> 01:05:26,619
r.i.p sixty 60 in the works which is
true

1107
01:05:26,619 --> 01:05:31,529
some extent but let's say the just don't
want people to realize about

1108
01:05:31,529 --> 01:05:35,579
her but its quota for today I mean what
unfortunately this that

1109
01:05:35,579 --> 01:05:39,390
you're supposed to me though in
engineering on you end up doing some

1110
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:39,880
sort of

1111
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:43,539
marketing because if you are book
publishing or not publishing documents

1112
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:48,029
I depending on what people is going to
think about those 0 comments or what

1113
01:05:48,029 --> 01:05:49,049
they are going to infer

1114
01:05:49,049 --> 01:05:52,990
that from my perspective know the way to
go but it's something that happens

1115
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:57,690
I am some comments on

1116
01:05:57,690 --> 01:06:02,730
%uh talks about employ ipv6 official
Heather I'm not going to talk about

1117
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:06,400
are order either does when are they shot
or gonna live in

1118
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:10,190
we have does so much all the stuff that
you know I k to you and have to mention

1119
01:06:10,190 --> 01:06:11,390
this

1120
01:06:11,390 --> 01:06:15,210
up but there s I'll another out that big
door

1121
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:18,740
that I ended up a

1122
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:22,680
coming up like by chance so this is my

1123
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:26,329
my resigning other tight a so

1124
01:06:26,329 --> 01:06:29,470
we were saying before we repair before
getting into the details

1125
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:33,329
we were saying before that buckets that
employ

1126
01:06:33,329 --> 01:06:36,730
I ipv6 extension headers are

1127
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:41,000
a filter to a large extent on the public
ipv6 Internet

1128
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,480
okay so again that means that if a
bucket emplois

1129
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,930
extension heather's churches are that
those buckets

1130
01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:51,390
are going to be drop okay so

1131
01:06:51,390 --> 01:06:55,329
my reasoning on the time los wat if I'm
not occur

1132
01:06:55,329 --> 01:06:58,760
court calls a pocket to

1133
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:01,760
employ extension headers okay so

1134
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:05,930
brother done the other Korean the source
of those pockets what i'm saying is this

1135
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:06,440
a that

1136
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:09,780
I have an old hymn here communicating
with the southern old

1137
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:13,630
and somehow I can cause the park is that
the snow the sending

1138
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:17,079
to employ extension helps if the network
itself

1139
01:07:17,079 --> 01:07:21,230
feet there's pockets with extension
headers then bite 3 hearing the use of

1140
01:07:21,230 --> 01:07:22,200
extension Heather

1141
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:26,549
I'm essentially course in and out of
service okay so

1142
01:07:26,549 --> 01:07:30,710
up first of all you might wonder how can
you possibly calls

1143
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:34,450
a system to employ ipv6 attention
heather's

1144
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:38,099
wall because they're at least the
current specifications

1145
01:07:38,099 --> 01:07:41,170
stayed that if you receive air

1146
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:45,160
fuck an ICMP packet to the message
claiming a name to you

1147
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:49,299
smolder done before some 280 you have to
prove the use what we call

1148
01:07:49,299 --> 01:07:52,530
ipv6 atomic fragments which means that
you'll for

1149
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:56,670
a if fragmentation Heather each of the
pockets that you sent

1150
01:07:56,670 --> 01:08:00,250
so that's a very

1151
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:04,510
in all clear easy way to actually
three-year the use of extension headers

1152
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:10,260
so now let's go see their the scenario
so let's just say that we have these

1153
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:11,260
cost here

1154
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:14,559
for example downloading something from
the server

1155
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:17,859
I let's just assume but we know

1156
01:08:17,859 --> 01:08:21,250
that the internet some Holly here its
filtering

1157
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:24,299
out every pocket that employees some
sort of exit

1158
01:08:24,299 --> 01:08:27,440
Heather so what could happen is that

1159
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:31,339
I'm not occur here in some part of the
network he sends

1160
01:08:31,339 --> 01:08:35,400
and ICMP packet doing with payment and
them to use water them

1161
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:39,720
true eighty to the server on right after
that

1162
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:43,390
the server will start sending atomic
fragments to the client

1163
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:47,380
no If Then There Were data fields are
those packets

1164
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:51,880
to some extent that's fine but if the
network bus filled their pockets with

1165
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:52,859
extension cather's

1166
01:08:52,859 --> 01:08:57,900
then all of these packets will be
dropped okay I have these

1167
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:01,380
up a you know sample this case

1168
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:05,310
which I guess it's a good thing it
doesn't work anymore

1169
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:08,900
hustle these ways that these guys have I
guess improve

1170
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:12,109
their network to some extent on the idea
was simple:

1171
01:09:12,109 --> 01:09:17,040
I what they want to do in a of in
awesome sample scenario for you too

1172
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:20,770
you note that this I E I am I have fun
out

1173
01:09:20,770 --> 01:09:25,250
that if you connected to WWW dot care
mil-dot

1174
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:29,450
or up on the way old on anyway I any bus

1175
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:34,000
so we're stuck awww look at the or
market with extension headers

1176
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,540
were dropped so there's some personnel
you that I can make the audience status

1177
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:39,489
by themself

1178
01:09:39,489 --> 01:09:42,750
what's this first of all telnet

1179
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:46,890
to the ipv6 address of Canada or

1180
01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:51,130
of course without extension credit a
subtle so

1181
01:09:51,130 --> 01:09:54,630
as a result of these your be able to
establish a connection

1182
01:09:54,630 --> 01:09:58,720
okay so they all of these first step

1183
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:02,530
we're still just double check that you
know communication with

1184
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:06,270
that site was working properly then the
second step

1185
01:10:06,270 --> 01:10:11,220
were still sport on ICMP packet to the
message claiming an empty use more done

1186
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:15,570
1,280 this is the ipv6 address

1187
01:10:15,570 --> 01:10:20,010
of www that can handle or and the should
be

1188
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:24,410
your own AP six others okay so if you
are if you want to try this

1189
01:10:24,410 --> 01:10:28,750
on your all system you should you know
though if $config or whatever to learn

1190
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:30,130
year-round ipv6 address

1191
01:10:30,130 --> 01:10:34,239
unusual replace the one in bill with
your own ipv6 address

1192
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,140
why because the itis

1193
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:40,040
that you're going to attack to some
extent in your connection

1194
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:43,350
we'd WWW dot Canada or I mean

1195
01:10:43,350 --> 01:10:47,720
you could I think any connection but
since we the the the goal here was

1196
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:50,900
for you too to easily Mischer that these
other

1197
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:55,900
Waris works we just wanted to thank your
own connection I'll stop possible to

1198
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:57,160
someone else's connection

1199
01:10:57,160 --> 01:11:00,690
on them after sending this pocket

1200
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:04,330
you'll try the same thing again I mean
this is the same command

1201
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:07,750
that you had executed here now the thing
is that a

1202
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:12,910
if these were killed a suspected in
response police but good that you just

1203
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:16,500
sent then after dot kill adult or

1204
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:19,770
Watson you every single pocket with done
a

1205
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:24,330
with a fragment Heather okay assist in
there was free during fragment the

1206
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:24,960
traffic

1207
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,550
you'll never be able to connect to
Canada

1208
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:31,860
orkut or not never in a only after

1209
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:35,770
lissy about 10 minutes because in for 10
minutes

1210
01:11:35,770 --> 01:11:40,010
the in the the information that from
addition needs to be used for

1211
01:11:40,010 --> 01:11:44,830
that communications does East like cash
I

1212
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:48,000
like this that this yesterday on

1213
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,290
I beasts other or dental work anymore

1214
01:11:51,290 --> 01:11:54,400
I you to see on out there are two

1215
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:59,080
possibilities I guess that one of them
is that there is some sort of filtering

1216
01:11:59,080 --> 01:11:59,820
device

1217
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:03,990
that field there's the ICMP bucket to
the messages

1218
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:08,850
that claim an empty or smaller done
1,208 in this case we were claiming an

1219
01:12:08,850 --> 01:12:09,430
empty of

1220
01:12:09,430 --> 01:12:13,750
1 post right so the so the ICMP packets

1221
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:16,800
that through your day use a
fragmentation so I guess that in

1222
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:17,710
response to

1223
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:21,130
you know this this that we did I am

1224
01:12:21,130 --> 01:12:24,270
you know someone a

1225
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:28,460
setup some sort of entering their but

1226
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:32,740
you could possibly in of I mean this is
just one example you could possibly fine

1227
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:36,390
you know all other yeah let's say public
web servers

1228
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:40,020
I'll what house on the way to the web
server I

1229
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:43,450
then they will feed their spy case with
you know of a friend when Heather

1230
01:12:43,450 --> 01:12:50,450
so the same attack work yes

1231
01:12:53,170 --> 01:12:55,920
yes they committed to change the less
than a month ago

1232
01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:02,090
yes oh yes that could be the

1233
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:05,480
cleary said yes I am so I

1234
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:08,890
I don't know if it's Los mission its
mission later

1235
01:13:08,890 --> 01:13:12,430
but I I also run internet-draft on this
topic

1236
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:16,850
unofficially awarded of face is that you
should never generate a

1237
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:20,920
atomic fragments so if you get an ICMP
packet claim in an empty was smaller

1238
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:21,250
than

1239
01:13:21,250 --> 01:13:27,000
1,280 just drop it Eileen of the
implemented uncommitted

1240
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,190
you know this change I like i think im
also go or so

1241
01:13:30,190 --> 01:13:33,880
so if you are running their current
governor it to the people who were able

1242
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:35,260
to the stuff anymore

1243
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:38,330
but you know you're right what you're
saying I mean you respect colonel

1244
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:41,430
book or to run that late this gonna but
at the same time

1245
01:13:41,430 --> 01:13:46,540
you know sometimes you know I you have
those servers being operated by people

1246
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:50,160
that are not necessarily closely related
with a developer so

1247
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:57,160
yes that's by that could be one of the
explanation for that yes

1248
01:14:08,150 --> 01:14:14,340
up

1249
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:18,060
not a police us fight as a specification
Loesch

1250
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:21,650
I when you receive a i pocket to the
message

1251
01:14:21,650 --> 01:14:26,440
I'll use in atomic fragment but just for
communications that involve the Droid be

1252
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:27,420
60 this is

1253
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:30,630
reporting the error message no

1254
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:35,219
I mean got a call to be I mean if you
ask me I mean I'm just thinkin old

1255
01:14:35,219 --> 01:14:38,600
you could think of that us una pinga
station

1256
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:42,890
because if I had to note on the same
Tyler chances are that the party is

1257
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:43,880
going to be the same

1258
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:47,560
but other lisa's father specific issues
goal I

1259
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:52,219
the ever miss ish just affects the
communication between two specific ipv6

1260
01:14:52,219 --> 01:14:53,010
addresses

1261
01:14:53,010 --> 01:14:58,480
some one thing that is interesting here
is that in order to perform the sadat

1262
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:03,060
you only need to know the to ipv6
addresses him more

1263
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:07,320
nothing more than that you don't need
second number issued on Newport numbers

1264
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:08,730
you don't need any other thing

1265
01:15:08,730 --> 01:15:12,200
like that the reason being that I

1266
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:16,809
many implementations they've done do any
kind of Buddy they should check out all

1267
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:21,040
on the ICMP error messages so for
somebody and they be four case

1268
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:24,630
they use to check for example that this
would be sick a slumber us 01

1269
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:27,660
but in the in April 26 case

1270
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:30,900
I most of them they don't check anything
in the

1271
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:34,110
in the ever message know there's another

1272
01:15:34,110 --> 01:15:37,710
um scenario which I honestly the then

1273
01:15:37,710 --> 01:15:43,250
check in practice but um for many it
well if I have tested this in practice I

1274
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:43,990
you then say it

1275
01:15:43,990 --> 01:15:49,150
anyway to be honest but list just goes
here this an idealist just say that you

1276
01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:49,860
have dole

1277
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:55,090
we should be Pierce okay on list say
that for security reasons

1278
01:15:55,090 --> 01:15:59,270
this don't be shibi wilder's are up
dropping

1279
01:15:59,270 --> 01:16:02,730
ipv6 fragment that's not uncommon policy

1280
01:16:02,730 --> 01:16:06,090
I mean usually fragmentation is seen us
you know evil

1281
01:16:06,090 --> 01:16:10,320
here so is not unusual for be should be
wilder's

1282
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:14,050
to drop I I P six fragments so

1283
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:17,640
let's just assume that again the
realtors feet throughout

1284
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:21,100
ipv6 fragments but they still owe

1285
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:24,780
ICMP error messages so you have the
Adobe should be

1286
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:29,820
beers here use POF ICMP packets to both
of them or one of them

1287
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:34,310
now they start employing ipv6 atomic
fragments

1288
01:16:34,310 --> 01:16:38,130
but since they dropped buckets that
employees from limitation

1289
01:16:38,130 --> 01:16:41,980
now they are being a performing at the
Nile service they are

1290
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:46,620
the OS ng themselves okay now you might
wonder wall but you know the shooting

1291
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:47,030
war

1292
01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:52,390
because I they my the employees in TCP
and if I option or they might be

1293
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:55,510
employee i'd be sick no really because

1294
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:59,980
I P Cyg PCB a.m. defy and everything all
that works

1295
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:03,110
a bowl the fragmentation layer okay

1296
01:17:03,110 --> 01:17:06,940
so these or calls buckets to be
discarded

1297
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:10,130
even you know for air you know I P sick

1298
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:13,800
or TCP and if I get into that into the
game

1299
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:18,720
%uh of course the implications of that
should be straightforward

1300
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:21,930
if you were able to essentially you know

1301
01:17:21,930 --> 01:17:25,260
cost the connection between tools we
should be

1302
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:25,720
pierced

1303
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:29,920
fail essentially coupe you could go so
the mail service to the whole network

1304
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:34,350
I I didn't this these myself if you

1305
01:17:34,350 --> 01:17:38,070
i dont operator on are renal running
ABCP

1306
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:41,170
router you should probably try this I

1307
01:17:41,170 --> 01:17:48,140
idea okay so how could you possibly meet
a gay this issue's

1308
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:52,900
wall %uh the stock a man essentially our
meeting is these issues by

1309
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:56,460
update in the corresponding
specifications by saying

1310
01:17:56,460 --> 01:18:00,560
you should never generate ipv6 atomic
fragments the your body a

1311
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:04,620
thats that's all but you can say about
that

1312
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:07,630
%uh so the so common for Bates

1313
01:18:07,630 --> 01:18:11,090
the generation of atomic fragments I did
also updates

1314
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:14,950
a seat see this like be it be six before
translation

1315
01:18:14,950 --> 01:18:18,080
so that seed dusan rely

1316
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:22,680
autumn these atomic fragments anymore
%uh

1317
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:26,060
us we were measured in already discuss
already been adopted

1318
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:29,970
by a Billy Knox colonel its

1319
01:18:29,970 --> 01:18:33,650
interesting because there was some at
the time there was some resistance

1320
01:18:33,650 --> 01:18:37,930
in the idea in old to policy adopt this
document

1321
01:18:37,930 --> 01:18:42,810
on I for me was like whatever I mean
Italy Knox already

1322
01:18:42,810 --> 01:18:46,820
sold that's you know another benefit of
social licence stuff

1323
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:51,130
with you know the developers I me no
matter what for example the ATF ends up

1324
01:18:51,130 --> 01:18:51,660
doing

1325
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:55,590
I mean Linux know they suck us like a
lurch market share if you want

1326
01:18:55,590 --> 01:18:58,950
so if there's something that you told us
in work for Linux

1327
01:18:58,950 --> 01:19:02,360
that be in on droid on every you know
Linux variant

1328
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:06,300
you know abortion to that is like being
clueless

1329
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:10,550
also you could argue that the sea sabado
that whilst

1330
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:13,890
what already I mean there was some sort
of

1331
01:19:13,890 --> 01:19:17,020
strong opposition other time against the
so common but

1332
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:20,470
mean only knocks implemented this I it's
already in the car

1333
01:19:20,470 --> 01:19:24,870
on the document was adopted this one in
last november to

1334
01:19:24,870 --> 01:19:31,870
yes

1335
01:19:32,370 --> 01:19:32,900
exactly

1336
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:35,930
yes so he added the idea especially sad

1337
01:19:35,930 --> 01:19:39,140
a chronic from assad it but idea so

1338
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:43,400
%uh you know I few years ago when I
rolled I'm not to see

1339
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:47,800
on atomic from its on how you should
process the atomic fragments I so go or

1340
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:49,850
if you're careful enough when you
process them

1341
01:19:49,850 --> 01:19:53,760
it's okay but then you know the more you
look at atomic from whence

1342
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:56,960
the list they make sense so the idea is
that

1343
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:00,020
I mean atomic from inside about idea
stop using them

1344
01:20:00,020 --> 01:20:06,410
up a couple of comments from some
ongoing war good neighbor discovery

1345
01:20:06,410 --> 01:20:10,010
I'll if you look in their discovery
implementations

1346
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:15,240
they are extremely but up you nobody
they didn't neighbor discovery options

1347
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:18,710
I'll X if the simple example

1348
01:20:18,710 --> 01:20:24,580
%uh is the use of I source Ling Li
erotica some targeting layout missus

1349
01:20:24,580 --> 01:20:27,890
options these are the options that a

1350
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:32,890
in court in bed they my car it Michael
its corresponding to some ipv6 address

1351
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:36,110
on one thing that you can do on with
many implementations

1352
01:20:36,110 --> 01:20:40,050
with moss on they were the ones that I
have tested it works you can make

1353
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:43,820
a unique got and a unique us AP six %uh
this MUP

1354
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:47,090
into a broke us or more the GUS Lingle
your address

1355
01:20:47,090 --> 01:20:50,400
so what are the things that you can
possibly do with that

1356
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:54,330
so one simple case would be this one so
let's just say that

1357
01:20:54,330 --> 01:20:58,220
you are on a switch in network a new one
person if traffic

1358
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:01,890
the fuck is that are being sent between
two different systems

1359
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:06,520
one of the possible ways from the way
you do it in the ipv4 wall

1360
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:10,540
will lead to spot for a lot of our
pockets so that you confuse this which

1361
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:14,030
and then the switch in sup bro gusting
the packet to love the note

1362
01:21:14,030 --> 01:21:18,540
mullis a like a more %uh interesting way
of doing that a

1363
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:21,790
East I you play with neighbor discovery

1364
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:26,540
on your perform like a neighbor
discovery cache poisoning attack

1365
01:21:26,540 --> 01:21:30,390
and you make each of the two in ball
ipv6 addresses

1366
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:35,230
MUP to eight more to go topless for some
or even them what broke us onerous

1367
01:21:35,230 --> 01:21:40,469
than me is that a when the system Los to
send packets to the solar system

1368
01:21:40,469 --> 01:21:44,420
the link layer it will use broke up the
other sis so it means that the packets

1369
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:46,989
are going to be sent to all of the notes
on the local network

1370
01:21:46,989 --> 01:21:51,559
okay when I came up with this idea I so
I did this come possibly work

1371
01:21:51,559 --> 01:21:55,030
right i mean that will be completely
stupid why this completely stupid but it

1372
01:21:55,030 --> 01:21:55,739
does work

1373
01:21:55,739 --> 01:21:59,249
okay so if you perform like a neighbor I

1374
01:21:59,249 --> 01:22:02,360
neighbor cache attack like same a doctor
that he

1375
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:05,949
that our well known for years and you

1376
01:22:05,949 --> 01:22:09,979
I rather than you know I using your
money

1377
01:22:09,979 --> 01:22:14,340
obvious you employ like the broadcast
others like all f's or use their

1378
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:20,030
a all knowles Rs life 3333 CO CO CO CO
01

1379
01:22:20,030 --> 01:22:23,130
%uh you will see that it war in

1380
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:27,170
it works of charm on if you tried out
with a switch for example you will be

1381
01:22:27,170 --> 01:22:28,619
able to sniff the traffic

1382
01:22:28,619 --> 01:22:32,499
without having to send like lots of
pockets to confuse this which

1383
01:22:32,499 --> 01:22:37,130
this is like a very less a academic or
clean way of

1384
01:22:37,130 --> 01:22:40,449
sniffing trafficking yeah switch in the
morning in b6

1385
01:22:40,449 --> 01:22:43,949
to be honest um then I wonder II

1386
01:22:43,949 --> 01:22:47,260
never tried whether this works in the
ipv4 well

1387
01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:50,440
because sometimes it's interesting you
know when you have it before I talk to

1388
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:51,929
try to port it to be six

1389
01:22:51,929 --> 01:22:55,349
and when you have something in the six
straight reported to be four I haven't

1390
01:22:55,349 --> 01:22:56,349
checked whether the

1391
01:22:56,349 --> 01:23:00,510
art implementations they performed by an
Asian chicks but this is the stuff that

1392
01:23:00,510 --> 01:23:01,400
that's working

1393
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:06,079
in in b6 at least it works for Linux
Anna Bligh said war for BS these

1394
01:23:06,079 --> 01:23:09,809
I have been you note this that the scene
that many other operating systems

1395
01:23:09,809 --> 01:23:13,159
so we all sort this document

1396
01:23:13,159 --> 01:23:17,210
%uh I don't recall if they the name was
accepted the Souris

1397
01:23:17,210 --> 01:23:20,559
duffy de física month ipv6 in the
operation

1398
01:23:20,559 --> 01:23:23,579
but they finding something like that on

1399
01:23:23,579 --> 01:23:27,889
the local many so I extremely simple
it's just under struck

1400
01:23:27,889 --> 01:23:32,010
document dodd updates RFC 4861

1401
01:23:32,010 --> 01:23:35,389
they are to see a neighbor discovery on
it requires

1402
01:23:35,389 --> 01:23:39,239
by the nation checks to be performed on
neighbor discovery options

1403
01:23:39,239 --> 01:23:42,650
okay so the idea is that I would try to

1404
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:46,699
for money in force requirements so that
you know neighbor discovery

1405
01:23:46,699 --> 01:23:52,660
implementations the Arnold Palmer able
to the sort of attacks

1406
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:56,660
some comments about you know operational
issues I am

1407
01:23:56,660 --> 01:24:02,170
comments on for help secure it I'm not
going to not talk about what other other

1408
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:02,930
freshman guard

1409
01:24:02,930 --> 01:24:07,950
I talked about that already last year I
we publish an odyssey describing how to

1410
01:24:07,950 --> 01:24:08,470
evade

1411
01:24:08,470 --> 01:24:11,760
router advertisement are on with
implementation guidance

1412
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:15,080
on how tall I'll prevent those
additional docs

1413
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:18,560
but added the women that I'm going to
talk about early release

1414
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:22,550
the ACP version 6 she'll this

1415
01:24:22,550 --> 01:24:26,310
like ipv6 version of the ATP snooping or

1416
01:24:26,310 --> 01:24:29,930
if you want to see it in a different way
is like water or does mangar

1417
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:33,410
but for the ATP version 6 they DS

1418
01:24:33,410 --> 01:24:37,860
very simple if you have a switch in here
you gun till this region oh you should

1419
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:40,140
only I know the ATP server pockets

1420
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:43,140
on these specific port now if you get

1421
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:46,480
the SEP server pockets on any of the
other part you should drop them

1422
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:49,770
I mean that way you can prevent you know
the ATP base

1423
01:24:49,770 --> 01:24:54,590
attacks from hopping the tricky part of
course East you know how to prevent the

1424
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:55,370
use of

1425
01:24:55,370 --> 01:24:58,920
extension headers from if they did this
make any sense so

1426
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:03,220
what are the things that the Stockland
us issue no provide like clear rules

1427
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:06,770
on how you should process pockets so
that even if the auditorium

1428
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:10,430
employees extension headers he cannot up
you know if they

1429
01:25:10,430 --> 01:25:14,430
evade your device for me this ok to me
is like

1430
01:25:14,430 --> 01:25:19,330
extremely obvious particularly when is
he really base on router advertisement

1431
01:25:19,330 --> 01:25:19,680
guard

1432
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:22,710
I it will send for the

1433
01:25:22,710 --> 01:25:27,380
to the ASU for publication on the recent
media area ignored that

1434
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:31,860
is still sane that a if a packet
contains I dunno extension Heather you

1435
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:32,970
should let the pocket

1436
01:25:32,970 --> 01:25:36,460
boss the vice no way right

1437
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:40,400
but up dusts hot where the documents a
stock

1438
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:44,410
I mean you should be mean particle by
default

1439
01:25:44,410 --> 01:25:48,270
if you don't understand the pocket you
drop it but they're these area

1440
01:25:48,270 --> 01:25:48,860
directories

1441
01:25:48,860 --> 01:25:52,440
are we the other way sold the stock
america's be late stock

1442
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:55,720
in that place for reseach you must now

1443
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:59,470
the sauce bus what I can say

1444
01:25:59,470 --> 01:26:03,820
but I was talking with my area the
greater the the area the actor from the

1445
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:04,590
operated

1446
01:26:04,590 --> 01:26:08,550
on the operational Syria like saying you
know we are stock in the air

1447
01:26:08,550 --> 01:26:12,429
I mean it to be extremely nonsensical to
oblige to play the change

1448
01:26:12,429 --> 01:26:15,670
that I've been suggested so I have two
options like fighting

1449
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:19,389
you know this bottle or essentially
skewered updates the document all

1450
01:26:19,389 --> 01:26:19,929
together

1451
01:26:19,929 --> 01:26:23,000
like me you know position specification
that from

1452
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,810
by design is broken so that's where we
are at

1453
01:26:26,810 --> 01:26:30,739
a hopefully next week at the idea
meeting we will be able to

1454
01:26:30,739 --> 01:26:37,310
make progress on this %uh they're so
common that we polish on B six firewalls

1455
01:26:37,310 --> 01:26:42,060
up v6 Fi we'll see said topic on which a
person I think that there's lots of work

1456
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:42,719
to be done

1457
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:47,790
for many resource nobody really know
what the FI I B six farwell should do

1458
01:26:47,790 --> 01:26:51,150
I from many different aspects

1459
01:26:51,150 --> 01:26:55,570
so if you try to USA by a v6 Fi will you
don't really know what you should be

1460
01:26:55,570 --> 01:26:56,929
required on the books

1461
01:26:56,929 --> 01:27:00,670
so we publish lease I these
internet-draft

1462
01:27:00,670 --> 01:27:04,280
that try store you know trade or
released

1463
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:07,969
in number of requirements that every
single file should implement

1464
01:27:07,969 --> 01:27:11,020
as you would expect benders are good

1465
01:27:11,020 --> 01:27:15,090
against this document because well if
you have a set of requirements

1466
01:27:15,090 --> 01:27:18,480
they should comply with this requirement
on

1467
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:22,520
a on that will prevent them from you
know shipping crappy

1468
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:26,090
be six finals so they probably want to
keep going

1469
01:27:26,090 --> 01:27:31,090
money with Howard I guess that the stock
room is going to have a hard time

1470
01:27:31,090 --> 01:27:34,320
moving forward %uh

1471
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:37,679
another document that may progress this
is a government that I percent the last

1472
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:38,099
year

1473
01:27:38,099 --> 01:27:43,080
and local men on bpm leakages up they DS
extremely simple

1474
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:47,389
let's just assume that you use open that
you have a Open VPN server doubt home

1475
01:27:47,389 --> 01:27:50,849
on when you travel around the say when
you attend a security conference you run

1476
01:27:50,849 --> 01:27:52,469
Open VPN so the utah real

1477
01:27:52,469 --> 01:27:55,849
or your traffic to gut you know books
that you have a call

1478
01:27:55,849 --> 01:27:59,670
okay %uh this could be and you have like
a very

1479
01:27:59,670 --> 01:28:03,090
nice case here at this conference so
what's the problem

1480
01:28:03,090 --> 01:28:07,030
%uh if you look at many BPN
implementations

1481
01:28:07,030 --> 01:28:10,699
the only support ipv4 now what happens

1482
01:28:10,699 --> 01:28:14,420
you are running for example Open VPN on
US Steel

1483
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:17,030
that all your traffic is being dunno you

1484
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:21,160
cue way to that box that you have at
home in that way you come free then

1485
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:24,130
lists a people from sniffing your
traffic on the local network

1486
01:28:24,130 --> 01:28:27,900
but what happens for example if the
network like this one

1487
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:32,170
support ipv6 well whenever you are
communicating with the site

1488
01:28:32,170 --> 01:28:35,370
that he's tall stock that he's support
before b6

1489
01:28:35,370 --> 01:28:39,000
if you end up employing b6 then

1490
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:43,450
all the traffic goes in the clear why
because your BB and implementation of

1491
01:28:43,450 --> 01:28:45,150
nothing about ipv6

1492
01:28:45,150 --> 01:28:48,170
so it's only able to tunnel before
packets

1493
01:28:48,170 --> 01:28:51,340
but when you send ipv6 traffic they

1494
01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:54,960
BPN implementation doesn't understand
anything about the 60 it says the

1495
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:55,970
traffic in the clear

1496
01:28:55,970 --> 01:28:59,600
so that if this a perfect example in the
snow were these in ago

1497
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:03,400
is tall stock so if you are in Plano for
example open bpm

1498
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:06,660
i rly some session that I was employed
didn't have any

1499
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:11,160
up BC support at all but even if the VPN
implementation house

1500
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:15,090
b6 a4 there are there's lots of tricks
that you could play

1501
01:29:15,090 --> 01:29:19,160
to actually confused a VPN I BP and
implementation

1502
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:22,500
and still have the BB and implementation
Sen they

1503
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:26,710
you'll they be six traffic in the clear
for example you could spell

1504
01:29:26,710 --> 01:29:31,430
you know Sen wrote another Tasman
messages other tyson more specific got

1505
01:29:31,430 --> 01:29:32,850
more specific routes

1506
01:29:32,850 --> 01:29:36,370
so rather than your pockets you know a

1507
01:29:36,370 --> 01:29:39,480
like brother done the packets been

1508
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:43,540
don't know on top of the VPN they are
again send out in the clear

1509
01:29:43,540 --> 01:29:46,570
congo shows

1510
01:29:46,570 --> 01:29:49,570
the so the same from last year

1511
01:29:49,570 --> 01:29:53,830
I if you look at before I B six
essentially fine

1512
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:58,520
this same issues I you never know
whether if it's just that we didn't

1513
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:00,250
learn the lessons from before

1514
01:30:00,250 --> 01:30:04,760
whether their loss different people
working on the 6 under before so

1515
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:08,900
the people he can this problems in b6 is
because they never actually experience

1516
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:10,710
it the same problems in in before

1517
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:15,100
or another option is %uh you know
they've basics implement the the sick

1518
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:17,280
specifications could have been WAY
better

1519
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:20,960
on in that way we could have avoided
many of their me know problems I we are

1520
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:21,600
discussing

1521
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:25,260
my take is that police a combination of
all of these items

1522
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:29,530
I will be the lender list songs from
before this also different people

1523
01:30:29,530 --> 01:30:30,579
working

1524
01:30:30,579 --> 01:30:33,349
me 6 done there were walking before

1525
01:30:33,349 --> 01:30:36,630
if you look for some political meet on
their basic school

1526
01:30:36,630 --> 01:30:40,739
for example when it comes to their BS
these stock it was implemented by people

1527
01:30:40,739 --> 01:30:41,510
from Japan

1528
01:30:41,510 --> 01:30:45,919
we rested the ipv4 stock Mb is the it
was implemented by people in the

1529
01:30:45,919 --> 01:30:47,169
University of California

1530
01:30:47,169 --> 01:30:50,959
so that's a clear example that you know
the from people produce both stocks

1531
01:30:50,959 --> 01:30:54,619
on from my perspective it's also true
that a you know they're

1532
01:30:54,619 --> 01:30:57,909
specifications could be made much better

1533
01:30:57,909 --> 01:31:02,260
on that could help but could have helped
us avoid many of the problems that

1534
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:06,079
we have face %uh questions

1535
01:31:06,079 --> 01:31:13,079
yes

1536
01:31:19,850 --> 01:31:20,370
all

1537
01:31:20,370 --> 01:31:27,370
you know what a

1538
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:34,290
industrial know what I personally think
is that what you're saying is true

1539
01:31:34,290 --> 01:31:37,680
I prolly a yeah I mean

1540
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:41,290
I think truett 2460 bracingly

1541
01:31:41,290 --> 01:31:44,420
a state in like nineteen the 98

1542
01:31:44,420 --> 01:31:47,510
well there's a previous version of it
because that's not the

1543
01:31:47,510 --> 01:31:51,460
on the previous version prodi said
couple of years they tip from a few

1544
01:31:51,460 --> 01:31:52,210
years before

1545
01:31:52,210 --> 01:31:56,020
but I mean even then I'll say that for
example

1546
01:31:56,020 --> 01:31:59,530
even when you think about this a the
year two thousand

1547
01:31:59,530 --> 01:32:03,790
they're worse between all b6 deployment
at all

1548
01:32:03,790 --> 01:32:07,620
so what i'm saying is that even if the
strollers were falling before

1549
01:32:07,620 --> 01:32:10,820
once they've basic score specification
have been published

1550
01:32:10,820 --> 01:32:14,010
there was still time the patch

1551
01:32:14,010 --> 01:32:18,520
the specifications before you know we
got to this point where we are

1552
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:22,990
we are needed we need to deploy v6 on we
find out you know

1553
01:32:22,990 --> 01:32:27,040
this pics still need to be patch
implementation still need to be patch

1554
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:30,080
and so on from my point of view when

1555
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:33,270
you know when I approach should be six
IFE by a loss

1556
01:32:33,270 --> 01:32:37,080
gonna fly curious in the sense that you
know when it comes to

1557
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:41,390
SAP before a protocol such just the
sippy their particles that a

1558
01:32:41,390 --> 01:32:44,670
even if you like them or not they have
been successful

1559
01:32:44,670 --> 01:32:48,590
in the says that everyone uses them a
nobody can mean all say that they have

1560
01:32:48,590 --> 01:32:51,140
not had any impact on society or
whatever

1561
01:32:51,140 --> 01:32:54,630
so you could expect people like the you
know the the bill

1562
01:32:54,630 --> 01:32:58,220
the guys there all day before or that
they should be specifications to be

1563
01:32:58,220 --> 01:33:01,420
jails about their little successful baby

1564
01:33:01,420 --> 01:33:05,130
right but then you have be six which is
so broke all that

1565
01:33:05,130 --> 01:33:08,470
I mean this cuss not been that much use

1566
01:33:08,470 --> 01:33:12,370
on you still find these people that are
generous about their

1567
01:33:12,370 --> 01:33:16,850
unsuccessfully the way you know what I
mean so that's something that I was

1568
01:33:16,850 --> 01:33:17,730
curious about

1569
01:33:17,730 --> 01:33:21,860
are if I was on the other side i would
have taken like a different attitude

1570
01:33:21,860 --> 01:33:25,220
okay let's try to improve the particle
as much as possible so

1571
01:33:25,220 --> 01:33:28,370
eventually we remove as many problems as
possible

1572
01:33:28,370 --> 01:33:32,480
on you know we get like up better
deployment but unfortunately

1573
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:36,490
that has not been the case so all

1574
01:33:36,490 --> 01:33:40,450
if you have any more questions feel free
to you know there'll be ideal or

1575
01:33:40,450 --> 01:33:43,860
you know just our talk to me in the
corridors again

1576
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:47,370
%uh BCS they %uh this of the b6 a hike
at least

1577
01:33:47,370 --> 01:33:50,650
I'll if you are interested I mean I

1578
01:33:50,650 --> 01:33:54,760
this I've never made this common but a I
have the plan to try to

1579
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:58,040
the weird BC sucker congress meeting in
July this year

1580
01:33:58,040 --> 01:34:02,900
are on the a protein product I'll where
the ATF meeting is going to be hell

1581
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:06,460
I I'm not sure if it's easy for people
from

1582
01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:09,890
cured to you know fly there about the

1583
01:34:09,890 --> 01:34:13,870
the single that we have we had their
first ipv6 hackers meeting in Burling

1584
01:34:13,870 --> 01:34:17,220
two years ago so this will be there
second okay

1585
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:17,970
so thank you
