gotta at this the yes perceptible

37
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,190
I you lose no like the I'll evasion

38
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:50,020
before school describe the problem

39
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,310
that Ms and then we'll proceed

40
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,250
with all he's out for

41
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,160
four different I bit provide Google Maps
allows

42
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,340
tipping point and some fire and to open
for fast so

43
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,510
I and more its so

44
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,600
a we were able to remain all

45
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,790
in what the new from the file

46
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:20,200
that the individual meetings and poem
somewhere

47
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,760
I was able maybe more

48
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,920
with me that bro one system

49
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,260
14 on the vendor

50
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,320
be broken again fees developing

51
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,530
so-and-so and that one of them actually
is

52
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,760
himself that problem

53
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,920
yeah and then they're going to discuss

54
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,090
from the game will go out

55
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,760
problem okay

56
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,370
the question is okay what University 'em

57
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,800
of course everybody knows who would have
a space

58
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,710
s you all know this is not the only

59
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:04,070
36 about for one of the many more

60
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:10,380
thing are the so-called season had very

61
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,470
idk about his own the was like to have
that the forehead

62
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,970
the issue here is the fact that this

63
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,380
then by long police the basic but

64
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,170
by in cutting and so

65
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:28,200
the link of it before african Barrick
from

66
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,760
then by season by I

67
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,490
on the other hand the six Maidenhead is

68
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,280
40 bytes long which is bigger than me
for

69
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,720
but its size is called on other

70
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,830
division yards out that in the six men
head

71
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:50,590
15 simplify significantly bodies amid

72
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:56,960
you can see that many feet to here

73
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,759
something have been but anymore or some
other

74
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:05,470
be more the so-called placed us

75
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:09,130
this flout at the apartment

76
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,319
lot would anything

77
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,900
because fragmentation play about big
plays

78
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,330
that that 64 why this was the case in

79
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,750
before whatever then I

80
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,340
however all the men had that

81
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:36,340
by rule because they don't have to
process so much the problem is that

82
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:43,060
this is how that same like and niggas in
here

83
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,690
makes still if these make it looks like
that Monte

84
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:52,479
a again have I think gets there are

85
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,590
by after that a

86
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:59,319
that isn't that december's that thinks
that

87
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:02,680
with at the rain is that that the looks
like

88
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:08,060
or dare you have the main head via you
have a lead for good

89
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,659
yet the Manhattan School is so

90
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:15,490
by with his work but this man had that

91
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,870
can before by now while to

92
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:23,370
3 or more but got no number

93
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,530
of excess had this so more or less

94
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:30,849
moment here and the point is that

95
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:37,050
all this information here is tackle
people

96
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:37,740
this mess

97
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,520
things quite complicated on television
is that

98
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,650
it is indicated must be a multiple a

99
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,710
ok mother who yeah like with the support
would

100
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:52,180
but still this candle

101
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,670
I think it's that obvious they don't go
3

102
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:59,370
problems first before

103
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:04,030
that white fuel-efficient their very
first

104
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,480
IP litigation the so-called 2468

105
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,560
occasion I hope that's okay that was
defiant

106
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,020
routine hit that would be fine

107
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,290
well let me think that the pit that said

108
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:23,470
no from that be there for war while
later

109
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:27,030
somewhat excessive it is what the fuck
black

110
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,720
mobility support had a the possible to
look at that and that level

111
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,870
remove the comment at who knows

112
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,760
model somewhat maybe by this is not an
option and actually

113
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,660
was the case why station that they were

114
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,450
then to allow excessive growth let them

115
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:52,450
a without with an the point is here

116
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,360
the ethical Monday this is the key issue

117
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,340
in making me I that there just become a
day

118
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:06,250
so they don't care before long and so

119
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,570
that is single minded order with more or
less is no wonder

120
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,640
be a here moreover

121
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,140
that is another common basam about it
slow

122
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,750
then so up be a at most plus

123
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:24,499
with exceptional within this month here
that would

124
00:08:24,499 --> 00:08:27,360
that the more well again

125
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,629
no one says that you know more than 150

126
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:35,669
would back little the case the only 26
have actually

127
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:38,699
is is the whole but OK

128
00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:42,289
in the case of the hopeful his own
caseworker that

129
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,910
his that that must be or no one

130
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:49,480
a back pocket and the home I hope to
Mahalo

131
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:56,480
the main had this is the only today

132
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:04,690
now another little ISSN before

133
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,830
by a specified that

134
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:11,080
I any form or know the long

135
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,339
by including about

136
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:18,339
of hidden files so forward the packet

137
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:22,430
goblets a plain exit it the toughest me

138
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:26,330
that this is not pro by roasted

139
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:31,120
and this not don't like it if they did
not know

140
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,060
and it is intended whether of course
they must

141
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:40,100
also recognize that the other at least

142
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,170
all other on

143
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:47,200
within play so

144
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,630
up a no person candle took me to believe

145
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:55,330
begotten the number isn't like this they
know that

146
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,399
and no we see your some

147
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,470
the if I life final then

148
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:08,470
allow the something if the no would
specify

149
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,170
that yet that this not Scott I kits
containing

150
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,529
and organized so

151
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:20,779
problem while have too many things the
way

152
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:25,110
invited but I guess

153
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,520
forget about it I some of them

154
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,110
by Evelyn for example the definition of
his head

155
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:36,910
for the hope I hope it began they can be
from eight but still

156
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:41,140
power by into looking also body

157
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,590
they love it again must have haha K

158
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,900
pass by them her with Heather have a
look at that

159
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:54,440
if the National at the all that well
good muscle but another

160
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,190
good lower okay while finishing up some
scattered

161
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,650
to the by going on me

162
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:05,500
and of course invited

163
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:10,140
up up

164
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:14,570
group

165
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:17,640
IQ yet do to me

166
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:23,709
but no

167
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:25,759
agape soul more or less

168
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,209
I would say that the the basics that the
time looks like

169
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:32,589
a function with several Arab

170
00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:37,459
that this makes that be the sixth at the
time

171
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:44,009
to be a kind of unpredictable problem
number two

172
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:48,089
by midday fragmentation was a problem
itself

173
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:53,529
night before or I'm sorry have read
about them to this number eleven

174
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:54,109
techniques

175
00:11:54,109 --> 00:11:58,089
definitive data what's kinda they were
fixed

176
00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:01,919
at some point but here never sexs to
have

177
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,759
excessive had this the situation is much
more complicated

178
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,019
forest us this is

179
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:16,679
a mi CEL ipv6 that I gotta which needs
to be fragmented will have the

180
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:17,850
unfathomable but

181
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,179
the fragment by death admirable but

182
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:26,379
process of that was x-men head of course
and excess ahead this

183
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:29,730
not must be processed by the mid 80

184
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,769
light the whole but hope gather or they
don't think had

185
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:36,549
all the other excess and had this

186
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:40,169
can be placed on must be placed in the
fat man above pop

187
00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:44,879
or so they can be five min so

188
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,339
if you want to have meant this image so
that I gotta

189
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:53,600
let's say in 35 min it's an obvious but
I'm

190
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,660
we've got a the same

191
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,860
unfathomable but after-the-fact
wonderful but

192
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,850
we put the so-called the five minutes
ahead

193
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:09,230
if I wanted some head there includes
information

194
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:13,910
like the offset the fact that there's an
ID

195
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:18,669
all the more fragments to follow be
woods

196
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:22,100
were included in that area 6 at your
forehead that

197
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:26,259
before and finally after the fact when
he added

198
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:29,789
who have they think basis amenable but

199
00:13:29,789 --> 00:13:35,899
fragment 15 min to

200
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:36,709
of course

201
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:40,850
this brutal sections here

202
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,120
include one or more X is intended

203
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,190
where which is good and bad of course

204
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:54,000
yet

205
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,260
no the added see it recommended that the

206
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,880
all that is a look at this

207
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,060
if they had a part in the Padma double
pot should be in the first five min

208
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,180
including the lead for head that

209
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,510
so s froo would be able to examine

210
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:14,730
even the level-headed but this is very
in New

211
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,370
have seasons one or two years yes
exactly go or not

212
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:22,730
everybody has implemented that and in
exactly and this is only

213
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:26,550
one problem that its itself it says that
or gay

214
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:30,190
the send that must not be glued

215
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:33,800
a Lexus and get to the second five min
but the file or they don't that

216
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,880
made nope if it is not in the first five
min

217
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,320
so there is still some the but bpm that

218
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,430
they don't say they must be a little but

219
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,010
yes after this was a problem where this
was 71

220
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:51,040
well at 27 2012 I'll specify that

221
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,060
all it is and get this bus level-headed
soon

222
00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:01,220
be included in the fast track with what
is actually wouldn't be getting

223
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:01,690
technical

224
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:06,140
most cases problem number for him

225
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,990
the question is how this happened the
6th circuit this had obtained

226
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:13,860
together in under the sole

227
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,870
in it it is intended that is I can't
afford that

228
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:21,310
its point that gold next headed by you

229
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:25,930
points to the next said it together it's
a

230
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:29,790
value it's similar to that known
practical value

231
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,529
with to Houston that before data what I
saw

232
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:39,829
the critical value of the CPC 6 the
political divide your farm

233
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:43,610
ipv6 iOS 4.2.1 the political value of

234
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,700
this little not risque that is sixty

235
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:51,390
so one note Samba here that

236
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:55,020
make it there that message meant that
the includes

237
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,310
a political like a 43 which points to
the intended

238
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:01,630
with forward to make it and the link
itself

239
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,820
includes identify you

240
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,480
with a high of 60 which

241
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,760
points to the dismissal it and of course
is messed up here that includes

242
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,269
into the value of six which points
sleepyhead

243
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:17,490
this is how victim had this

244
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:22,980
are 10 how the state must stand together
so far so would I mean that up

245
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,510
this is live with that make I ready to
follow

246
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:31,490
we just have to find out what the next
to the US number two

247
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:36,160
and if I the next because I had the no
problem into

248
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,690
here the problem

249
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:42,800
comes into place when only 25 man

250
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,389
listings for this task

251
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:50,519
let us to like this is that had
memorable but

252
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:56,010
often ipv6 that I'm with me this is
about the two nites needs to be

253
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:56,649
fragmented

254
00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:01,930
before from additional cover the Senate
office had that

255
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:06,630
with an ex hit the value of 60 but it
supports the Sikhs the next one

256
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:13,630
with the next month PCP it wouldn't have
minded like this

257
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:18,100
will have the method that which both
lived together

258
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,410
as before now this one has tense

259
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,559
not 44 if

260
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,140
go buck note example when was it

261
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:33,820
here

262
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,030
let them said that he had was pauline
Inc

263
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:41,410
260 because that this initiative has
hitherto was following

264
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:46,030
the head now it's pointed 244

265
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:50,130
the goal to have %uh this fragmentation
it is intended

266
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,809
and if I'm pragmatism kiss kiss for 24
so something

267
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:57,640
sensed here but still so far so good

268
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,350
weatherman Heather because every six for
the said they would support the

269
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,000
fragmented

270
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,390
at the and to know will have the fat
mature that itself

271
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:08,750
ok up here article on

272
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,179
over admirable but apart over admirable
but

273
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:16,530
the question is what should be this by

274
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:20,740
here I remember I remind you that

275
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,070
the first now someone the first get this
business I was getting

276
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:28,410
which divides sixty and the next one is
this a peek at them

277
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:32,260
with a virus 6 so whether you think

278
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,290
whether to put here and that's what with
here

279
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:40,059
in order to tame

280
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:47,059
a fragment any suggestions

281
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,200
the first run could be quite

282
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,290
it's a

283
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:59,330
August according to previous example

284
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:03,450
it it should be sixty because what
follows

285
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:10,450
is the definition for Heather the second
one

286
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:14,570
okay let us whom at the fest run

287
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,870
is this in itself is headed and feel for
the typical

288
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:20,950
so the fragment the yep

289
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:25,149
our at a chain about the finished up to
the TTP TTP bellow

290
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:28,450
and be split this into fragments

291
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,620
an offer Speckman lets people here yes
yes

292
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,330
that only the destination up to another
and the part 2

293
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:40,279
we have the TCP this is just an
assumption okay so let us call that the

294
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,240
disputed here

295
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,990
but would you put here 6

296
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,570
IQ any other suggestions

297
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:52,950
not at this a sony Mobile

298
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:56,120
the no idea like it well

299
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,659
this edition actually make sense because
okay

300
00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:03,010
says the tip is going to be here why on
earth would be incomplete

301
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:06,950
here at this very moment addition
however

302
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:10,139
it will be 60 or at Little Miss Sixty

303
00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:13,149
in the and actually it doesn't matter
them

304
00:20:13,149 --> 00:20:17,179
this value the second one on the second
person

305
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:21,029
if I'm it that much and why's that why

306
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:24,600
would do not need to obtain this
fragmented that

307
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,130
with this but here because this

308
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:32,120
said the yet this because it's a he said
from the commitment to said

309
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,940
distant and we're here

310
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,650
so would not need to poop six here

311
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:42,440
according to the NFC this sums to be 62

312
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,410
all the five min excess on head this
South Point

313
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:52,010
to the third successive had that of the
five-member pot

314
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:55,130
I'll a

315
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:59,160
but they sick and the flexibility that I
said this at the okay sis

316
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,490
that's not the anyway wedding to go take

317
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:06,100
is the film has it been admin next to
the value of the

318
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,920
first fragmented into the and not the
other one so this awesome

319
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:15,340
my anyway I that is not we

320
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,280
interviews this case yet is that another
big with the

321
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,080
is interviews and Ubuntu it to explore
the summit would be

322
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:28,480
know that would be made on this device
later on so

323
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,680
to sum up the mess I got things and get
this will get a lot of the types of

324
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,610
nixon had this

325
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,630
they'd ordered the number of occurrences

326
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,670
that size the fields that it had a virus

327
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:42,820
all the time couldn't get this and of
course

328
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:46,900
we're going about her but this what with
the pipeline here there

329
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,340
later on the ups the

330
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,670
it this and of course

331
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:57,160
we can combine compare the

332
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,320
combination

333
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:01,940
on

334
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:05,010
they say kind of law this

335
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:08,370
called the pasta slow I which was so

336
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:12,010
established for the gate to go actually

337
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:15,760
and if it says that the really but I'll

338
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,260
in what you accept because tentative you
want to send

339
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:24,600
I which course event with a protein that
lets see if they're gonna be

340
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,730
from this perspective what's really good
because

341
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:32,250
global said I did what you said so would
not surprise

342
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,820
the other side but min

343
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:40,000
we shouldn't be very strict in what you
up to so

344
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,310
miscibility sold some flexibility

345
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:47,400
which was black

346
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,990
the with the protein in this era but let
the CS

347
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:54,720
there are some it's a movement that set
this up

348
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,490
perhaps this law to be able to that

349
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:01,770
just because this flexibility it
produces some

350
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:04,840
security issues okay

351
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,340
I like the community then

352
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:12,130
the committee gives you a lot of
opportunities but the problem with

353
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,210
having to build this that

354
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:18,480
a investor put some security gonna put a
little bit in order to

355
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,280
I'll been executed and

356
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:29,220
under some specific circumstances and
can lead to a comedy ghosts and I

357
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,820
believe that the accident had this is

358
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:35,370
the most visible example of that the
case and the reason is that

359
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:39,010
but they can accept a compliment a
you're getting the best advice is

360
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:42,340
in the usual as they are

361
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,899
or I

362
00:23:45,899 --> 00:23:50,630
buys more racial again some other
devices for example against ACS

363
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,909
for the release to rate some other

364
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:57,830
mechanisms like I'm sure that you miss
me also about the attic got

365
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:01,480
or the critics got you can break all the
things

366
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,549
the night we discussed it the years some

367
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:07,830
some part of it yeah so

368
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:10,890
no I you can use this exactly the same
techniques

369
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,299
in order to prevent some other a typical
pick someone again

370
00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:17,830
so

371
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:22,690
what can go wrong well more or less a
lot of stuff in our case at the base

372
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:23,409
devices

373
00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:27,899
a usually use a kind of thing that does
not detect malicious traffic

374
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:30,919
the more or less operate like

375
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:35,450
the tape and he lives in if something
like this so if you want somebody clicks

376
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,179
in total:

377
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:39,440
you can make their own and so

378
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,480
with a device I

379
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,210
by breaking that only mean because not
excess and hit the stains in a way that

380
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:54,470
the creativity unexpected I goes well

381
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:57,880
that gramm's not organized by that

382
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:02,019
IDPs device itself everything that

383
00:25:02,019 --> 00:25:05,090
all this is about the only up in it is
not I'll

384
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:08,179
with developed a tool called Cairo

385
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:11,440
on there are some other

386
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,250
to go to tools out there are about I
very good to govern every six

387
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,570
I would say that atlanta to this tune is
that the

388
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:21,669
it more or less allies with two posttype

389
00:25:21,669 --> 00:25:22,480
a

390
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,539
any single ipv6 get it and you can
imagine

391
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:29,049
so you have the power to japan's

392
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:32,549
you can test it you gonna but I

393
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:35,660
and the fight the picnic you can even
use this

394
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:39,220
know that plants your at that a Fourier

395
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,570
by the way wiseman babe also

396
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:45,970
regarding this tool the more of them
were also

397
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:49,210
it will be delivered by I'll and I

398
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:52,970
a which will also include the kind of
situation did so

399
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:56,580
while the talent is actually going to be
to have a ton

400
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:02,799
devices on your own okay

401
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,490
out this is the class SS in the
beginning

402
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:10,309
for the best advice is to open source
too high and permits to last a fire in

403
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:15,200
the to pinpoint inexpensive last at
least 12

404
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,340
you visit the content of them were found
out

405
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,780
or love them you know they when he found
them

406
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,360
all of them were reported the vendors

407
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,620
love them were disclosing this possibly

408
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,990
most of them were patched really
promptly

409
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:36,539
some developer set up 35 in a couple
days

410
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:41,610
some other so fast either way

411
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:44,650
and one on this so

412
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:47,720
solutions on this a better solution
specialist in South

413
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,120
form is guilty but they're going the so
you're too

414
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,159
sadistic and the food to get big Nick

415
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,380
with the fourth pick some for tonight by
the police will protect you for the time

416
00:26:59,380 --> 00:26:59,860
being

417
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:03,490
the first one

418
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:06,559
is going to be a this week at Evesham

419
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:11,110
I'm going to have a lot of her so

420
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:14,270
term the first IDPs ideas

421
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,340
device

422
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:19,430
or IDPs device was as a regatta open
source software

423
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:22,920
and the the kind of the

424
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,680
year the two main open source solution

425
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,880
and for are the best team ice 1

426
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,110
this well-known snort and the others
a.m.

427
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:37,630
quiet a new one and scotteri cutter and

428
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:41,070
we started with version 2.0 2.1

429
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:45,280
and farm from technique to you but
that's

430
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,630
me polec talk directly to the developers

431
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:53,430
saying OK with on some problems here and

432
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:57,450
after few days we got patched looked OK

433
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:00,700
this kind a or the specific

434
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,980
the waist be found was pitched and the

435
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:08,120
we worked a again on some other test
some other combination

436
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,380
and then as they already released

437
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:19,100
our the recommendation page that and so
we continue on wasn't 2.0 point2

438
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,370
and same here we found something

439
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:25,860
say that's to the developers and

440
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:31,260
in this case even we only Co them one
combination befallen them for 1b

441
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:35,080
said okay with give them example and
said okay year

442
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,180
this is one example her but be found
some more

443
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,730
a.m. please sec and their page said

444
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:45,020
and sent us the this was in back

445
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:49,180
and I try it some 16 on third didn't
work anymore

446
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:52,650
and then I A arm

447
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:56,630
go on the presentation free presentation
of all talk

448
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:01,180
and a.m. on the preparation I tested
some other examples

449
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:05,590
and their iPhone another one which works
again in the same

450
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:08,590
combination know any from yes the

451
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:12,060
problem I began writing things and a.m.

452
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,170
all of this it wasn't a six-week phone
are

453
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,710
can reproduce with siren and

454
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:22,030
a I would demonstrates the latest one

455
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:22,960
and

456
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,789
and the mmm this is how it looks like we
have

457
00:29:27,789 --> 00:29:31,169
our ipv6 and fragment

458
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:36,440
so this is the first part a.m. we have
on fragmented the pot with not the

459
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,640
six-man her

460
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,710
and type-0 routing header and

461
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:46,909
and then the fragment Heather comes into
place and of fragmented the pot

462
00:29:46,909 --> 00:29:51,320
is one destination option header and the
TCP payload header

463
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,850
like in our example on on the foot pop

464
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:58,220
the few slides before and just

465
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:01,419
very simple and it is

466
00:30:01,419 --> 00:30:06,899
exactly split like in this example as a
destination up to 100 comes first

467
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:10,260
and the a second fragment we have

468
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,610
are and TCP AR and more

469
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:20,200
editing stuff here is an excerpt from
our the vision that Nick itself a

470
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,440
ok it was just an example that that you
don't with

471
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,270
has indicated someone you were at that X
ok

472
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:31,010
in the morning what was met with that
you know

473
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:34,690
UK you get to go but we found out that

474
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:38,250
still many systems upset

475
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:42,450
together we even at the beginning with
look that's ok other we found out they

476
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,240
have no

477
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,990
rule for type 0 detection we talk to
them and they said oh yes

478
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:50,390
a.m. you forgot about that and their
pets thats

479
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,550
in it and after that we've changed from
type 02

480
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:58,600
any other type eyes and teeth sub 3 tied
one since they are not

481
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,050
a.m. and duplicated and

482
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:05,560
then the 50 header is recognized

483
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,600
but not our a.m. other who were

484
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,680
and to detect the TCP a.m.

485
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,230
had a soap we have to ruin simple

486
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:18,790
setup on every device one route to
detect

487
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:23,840
the simple ICMP b6 ping request and the
second rule is to detect

488
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,890
a simple TCP a.m. poor eighty

489
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:33,060
then request or something on port 80 so

490
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:40,060
you some time for action

491
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:47,690
I hope you can see everything in place
tune

492
00:32:03,549 --> 00:32:06,600
so from for the first

493
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,710
time I was sent us a simple thing week
first

494
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:13,950
to Zurich on a machine and as you can
see you

495
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:20,200
the 70 them words to see that there's
nothing comes through

496
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,609
me in the lot more or less and you can
see year

497
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:26,950
on thing that pic we're just going to go
to

498
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:30,629
when I saw that in out some it doesn't
look that bad

499
00:32:30,629 --> 00:32:33,739
money but for other uses and purposes

500
00:32:33,739 --> 00:32:40,739
that at that moment now so

501
00:32:45,389 --> 00:32:50,470
I'll come on the see years in the first
policy

502
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:53,610
the routing header and taken and the

503
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:57,230
fragment in part will be the this
destination header

504
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:01,850
and if I will send this we see

505
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:06,360
and the lock nothing changed nothing at
all use it with a flammable no loss

506
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,590
and in this part we see the two
fragments

507
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:13,210
the the open this fall

508
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:19,139
can you see

509
00:33:19,139 --> 00:33:24,769
routing header but when her next edition
be the nation up to her

510
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:28,269
is that this nation up to her and then
come I simply 6

511
00:33:28,269 --> 00:33:32,450
so just very simple combinations is

512
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:36,850
this combination can appear in your
network or in the Internet

513
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:40,549
and suit be detected game can you send

514
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:44,590
simple pink again yes bingaman so the
locks again that

515
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:50,340
but not with pat on

516
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:53,409
a out using big data secure the same

517
00:33:53,409 --> 00:33:56,419
nor that he moved a what he did here

518
00:33:56,419 --> 00:34:01,009
didn't have been gone mad but he moved a
aka months that the torrent was

519
00:34:01,009 --> 00:34:05,379
to this isn't also missing bumping
beginner let this

520
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:12,379
any questions at No

521
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,290
0 so coming back

522
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:19,460
this both well

523
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:23,110
through Cotto and version 2.05

524
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:27,190
a.m. we hope or we think their pets
every the

525
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,909
of our findings um I've test that some

526
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:34,790
other combination work very well even
though they told us that

527
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:38,370
say and that another pets as so

528
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:41,900
it should be no working better and

529
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:46,780
a.m. there were very um kind and

530
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:50,550
very interested in ipv6 oh they ask if
not that's the

531
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:54,320
you have any recommendations on how they
can handle up missing extension ETA and

532
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:54,650
so

533
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:58,010
there are very interested in that and
move

534
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:01,200
so the nexts on the vice

535
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,700
the or in this case we haven't device
that tho is

536
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,980
from HP a tipping point and

537
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,430
a we started a.m. last year

538
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:15,420
before troopers s exactly what he s in
February

539
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:19,570
yes a in through both 2014

540
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:24,200
during the summit we are now by the
founders you know they

541
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,500
against the point in to quit headed from
the vendor but would not disclose in the

542
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,080
day

543
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:33,240
by this time because we will still be so
it goes

544
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:37,320
martin ever have 2000 the yeah and

545
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,580
soem how does look the only way Jim the
first phone

546
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:45,130
it was awesome as we describe before
with the fragmentation

547
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:48,670
and the next had a value in the fragment
header and

548
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:52,640
with personally think about that km what
could possibly go wrong

549
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,830
if we just changed one number

550
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:59,150
in the second fragment so let's assume
we have

551
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:03,150
a destination up to anticipate a lower
part as described

552
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:07,440
few sites before and we changed in the

553
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,090
second fragment we send and the fragment
head to the next lol you to TCP

554
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:16,840
K %uh device should recognize TCP

555
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,140
and we want that that's were

556
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:23,130
even Brock TCP traffic so

557
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:26,460
mmm we send that and to reside was

558
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:30,650
quite interesting things even why a
shock has some problems with this

559
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:34,790
and as you can see here offers fragment

560
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:37,870
next header destination option header

561
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:41,700
and this is our second fragment we now
see is OK

562
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,580
recognize TCP is next part but

563
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:50,540
it as the some interesting information
about

564
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:55,930
what port it were reads and the
destination ports in the TCP pot

565
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:59,150
is according to what shocks

566
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:04,490
resembling 256 this is wrong with send
it to poor eighty

567
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:09,050
like her and it this because

568
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:13,180
on wesat the phone believe that here

569
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:16,210
that it area this it be

570
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:19,340
had that so a this

571
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:23,050
a 0100 according to our

572
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:27,830
the people the cynicism port what's
available 156 but

573
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:32,390
that he had said that is you know one
and give it to get fifty

574
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:37,010
in 650 this money this is an important

575
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:40,650
said and not this one here so

576
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:44,290
was like making less awk looks

577
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:49,300
at the fragment header CEO k'nex bought
this an extender should be TCP

578
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,440
so everything coming next in the

579
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,740
reassembling process is interpret as TCP

580
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:01,310
and that is what we think it's the same
which is tipping point doing

581
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:04,580
so we have no a.m. look at the sauce
called or

582
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:08,450
Howard really works but we assume that
this is

583
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:12,150
the kind of um why it's didn't come thru

584
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:15,550
or better it come through but it didn't

585
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:20,560
on so up and our lock so

586
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,510
really a.m. reported the through the
reported that

587
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,780
to the 10 and they or before that

588
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,380
we even tested some love

589
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:32,660
be tested if blocking HTTP traffic

590
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,890
and then we additionally test that okay
let's

591
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:39,660
youth the real a.m. signature rule

592
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:44,380
in from to pinpoint itself on with the
cross site scripting

593
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:48,180
and we wrote a little packet which has
some

594
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:51,800
texas ass in it and you try did with
this as well

595
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,870
and me get know a lot absolutely yet

596
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:59,210
your question no

597
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:03,830
no had no problem because the
seven-course on blood with Jesse

598
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:07,750
that if you think that with an exam
initiative I feel the first

599
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:11,280
I'm has been that Iran mother so the

600
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,490
before them so the host is just exactly
go to all the

601
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:19,710
collect every fragments and looks in the
first back when her

602
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:23,630
looks at the next to evaluate the first
record header and just looks and the

603
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,740
other fragment header

604
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:28,160
just the offsets so to get the right
order

605
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,900
the of the picket and doesn't look at
the next head away is so

606
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,350
it doesn't matter yes

607
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:38,910
it should be but and and my psych I
think

608
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:42,030
the think this is a that they

609
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:46,250
reassembled every packet for itself so
that did not collect

610
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,370
the the whole fragment saying so the

611
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:54,290
could be some but yes and should be the
same it would also signal morton peeping

612
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:54,850
porn

613
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:58,720
gotten no pretty protection there was
also the

614
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,720
so-called paranoid more correct yes
getting

615
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,359
we can I see them again that so-called
more

616
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,640
if he will so very aggressive

617
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,520
all the northern routes on and
everything nothing comes through

618
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,240
and nobody use the in his environments
and

619
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,430
then you have server issues on

620
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:23,530
product if traffic as well and

621
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:26,880
so okay I am yet we

622
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,329
reported that to HPV and they

623
00:40:30,329 --> 00:40:34,339
send us the patch or they were released
pets

624
00:40:34,339 --> 00:40:37,920
and only said okay let's see

625
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:43,450
if it works and retested oakmont and I
everything fun so

626
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:47,069
firm thats then I started with mighty
Zeus

627
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:51,730
re thoughts and a.m. I looked at tipping
point itself again

628
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:55,640
and that some more research on that and

629
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,349
we thought Okan their pets turds but

630
00:40:59,349 --> 00:41:02,760
something looks nods

631
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,980
ride so a.m. what've

632
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:09,930
sore is that the first fragment comes

633
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:14,240
every time come through so the only pic
it which is blocked

634
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,829
is the second fragment so we sent the
command to see the first fragment comes

635
00:41:18,829 --> 00:41:19,299
through

636
00:41:19,299 --> 00:41:22,890
and then the second fragment doesn't
come through

637
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:26,650
so we started was some variation

638
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:30,849
that change here the next set of
wastewaters if you changing that

639
00:41:30,849 --> 00:41:34,000
or here are some other values or

640
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,290
okay let's shayna's 23 fragments and

641
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:42,390
firm finally we thought came what is

642
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:46,349
if we just sends the second fragment

643
00:41:46,349 --> 00:41:50,579
again life twice the what happened so

644
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:54,720
what could be hatin if we send the
second fragment

645
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,819
two times expect Lee is the same packets

646
00:41:57,819 --> 00:42:03,000
two times and we was quite surprised
second time it comes through

647
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,160
so the same problem in the first time

648
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,119
look but when we send it again become

649
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,119
and even though it doesn't matter

650
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:17,839
if the second fragment in the first
fragment a or in the

651
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:22,559
the fragment which is blocked if her
next lol you sixty

652
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:26,730
real all six but if we send it again

653
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:29,859
the next lol you should be six or

654
00:42:29,859 --> 00:42:33,740
must be six to get through could be add
every a.m.

655
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:39,059
other well use other than sixty so

656
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:43,109
are to show you what a and

657
00:42:43,109 --> 00:42:46,259
an interesting thing about this division
between against the pinpoint

658
00:42:46,259 --> 00:42:49,849
that this technique I'll its effective

659
00:42:49,849 --> 00:42:53,059
even when 7112 Mindy

660
00:42:53,059 --> 00:42:58,249
i mean that that we do not care more the
airport had that in the second five min

661
00:42:58,249 --> 00:43:02,839
mother to be very it can be the first
time so if this one of the cases

662
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:07,660
the sickening worsen the one where that
I see that people make that they thought

663
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,259
that this would be the first time

664
00:43:09,259 --> 00:43:12,859
is not perfect this is why you see that
the

665
00:43:12,859 --> 00:43:16,239
this has made it wouldn't be its
implication

666
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:21,980
me by it is not that I feel am

667
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:25,779
for the D more we were so the old
erosion tisch nixon

668
00:43:25,779 --> 00:43:30,480
I have to restore the old image falsity
F for tomorrow

669
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,499
but if we have time tomorrow I can pet
sit doing professional

670
00:43:34,499 --> 00:43:37,549
and I can so a.m. the new or

671
00:43:37,549 --> 00:43:40,589
the latest Iranian tisch nixon's

672
00:43:40,589 --> 00:43:43,809
this is pets as well the

673
00:43:43,809 --> 00:43:47,900
but is that you can see okay first
fragment is blocked them then second

674
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:48,809
fragment come through

675
00:43:48,809 --> 00:43:53,190
a.m. I would show you how the packet
will look and buy such as well but

676
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:56,569
in this case we will see that both
buttons work continues case

677
00:43:56,569 --> 00:43:59,720
up but that is not a bad film a scene
it's my life

678
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,989
over this and tipping point is for you

679
00:44:02,989 --> 00:44:06,839
the broker it's not that destination
collectible

680
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:11,220
up

681
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:16,140
so from 70

682
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:20,420
77 I think I am

683
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:24,510
so first the following so that I can
reach the target over I simply

684
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:28,750
as getting thing reply back

685
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:32,250
so I won't know try it too rigid over
Port eighty

686
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:36,660
at: then tipping point to school be
lookin out some want to block

687
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:41,430
8 before before eighty and I'm

688
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:44,990
work seven mile up with my when

689
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:48,460
get that bike at the scene by it will
respond with a set

690
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:52,960
I so ICANN fee I sent my zine packet

691
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,400
and nothing comebacks and

692
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,430
and of course I'll have another or it
was a on

693
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:03,280
for the tipping point on no no 203 got a
haircut and

694
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,410
this can be cool so hmm

695
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:13,410
the next one as I will launch my

696
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:26,270
like a month the world first this is
where the fine the next to the values

697
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:33,270
60 comments 6

698
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,570
and you see that will send the same bike
it

699
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:39,050
and would get buck it he said but over
there

700
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:42,220
which means that the packet bathroom
anyway

701
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:45,220
but it back in the back at this point be

702
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:48,850
with like and

703
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:52,580
a.m. to show you off his upper after
they play at had stood

704
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:56,680
no to commanders looking

705
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,840
more or less similar

706
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,960
and

707
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,240
on my left the PC first freshman

708
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:11,470
the second fragment which no is
reassembled already in Wausau

709
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:14,510
but a on the target machine be

710
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:18,580
would see this rachman so the first
freshman year

711
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:22,740
would be blocked from tipping point and
second fragments

712
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:25,780
would become through think that the same
packet

713
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:29,300
the and then we get on with the back

714
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:32,770
we also see and the tipping point since
the youth and

715
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:36,520
um unblock rule which rise no alert

716
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,970
so we only see a block counter we even
see that

717
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:42,970
they block one package but only one so
I'm not

718
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:46,580
twice so the first one is blocked and
the second comes

719
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:53,580
any questions about

720
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:57,369
okay so winds continue burns

721
00:46:57,369 --> 00:47:03,250
and no and this one and

722
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:09,349
can't good thing over this

723
00:47:09,349 --> 00:47:13,130
so

724
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:16,590
K

725
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:17,750
be looked at to pinpoint

726
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:20,960
and I'm not but not knees

727
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,580
we look at without was lost and

728
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:27,650
the at the end we also had an

729
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:30,920
assaults by appliances way liver and

730
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:35,420
sense of buyer youth a kind of stuff or
they

731
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:38,610
the use once not wasn't and develop

732
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:42,120
they own a.m. headsets for that so

733
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:46,210
amid worth more or less quite the same
slot was long but some

734
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:51,120
improvements from Cisco sauce fired said
and the other was the public available

735
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:54,510
actually want to start its north was
better than supply itself

736
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:58,900
yes the wall what it missed all evasion
techniques against a fire

737
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:02,680
investment they won against more i think
im in them reporting them

738
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:06,120
Sourcefire wooden bats the wise nor
still

739
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:10,580
we're able to this um

740
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:15,760
the communication with not and fast
while laws not that well

741
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,220
as was tipping point and Zoe Qatar same

742
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:22,970
we me we do we're we the

743
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:25,600
up yes a

744
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:29,670
and no respawn directly

745
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:32,950
after some time and slot that okay yes

746
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:37,010
we were think about that be here we'll
have that in mind but

747
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:42,090
it not that important and from Cisco
software

748
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:46,240
a.m. there was even which kind of

749
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:51,190
is Sourcefire know the into the store
good one that with the customer support

750
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:54,640
with automotive with that have you here
you have an issue

751
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,360
don't tell us because we've got a poor
will be interested in this stuff

752
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:02,680
we've we think that this is because
Cisco book source file and they have

753
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,110
some

754
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:06,260
I'm and structure and

755
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:10,290
but went not that well so we decided

756
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:14,110
after some time to publicly is closest

757
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:18,070
and a one was still is it a day
sometimes

758
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:21,300
disclosing up something helps

759
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:25,470
the post and also fix them and

760
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:29,790
the mmm latest not was no comes with
some

761
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:33,990
kind of mitigation taste Nick we think
the thing not

762
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:38,990
and respawn on our the evasion

763
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:42,330
or a of finding but even

764
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:45,800
it will help a little bit dick Campbell
this phone well

765
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:49,090
out it was common black yes yes well say
that

766
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:53,000
I'll am minimizing the number of
competitors

767
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,190
located with the effective approach
nowadays yes

768
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:59,370
I more or less would not fit saying head

769
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:02,900
that but in ATL stratum

770
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:06,580
it's not the best it's a way to handle
it I mean that with find the proper

771
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:07,370
technical

772
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:11,310
wouldn't think that that just don't ever
think that

773
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:16,230
we will come to this a.m. letter later
so

774
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:19,720
mmm and the meantime Sourcefire silently

775
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,020
we didn't hear anything from them

776
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:26,810
and a in February I look for new
versions since

777
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:30,970
prepare Asian forward our talk here
troopers and psalms

778
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:34,670
some pets is and I applied all of

779
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:39,000
all of them and the then I start the
test again dance

780
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,940
some with things going on we have to
look at it

781
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:46,250
again some deeper a.m. but for now

782
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:49,480
a.m. at the moment a.m. of finding

783
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,900
both pitched so

784
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:56,680
mmm be firm we will now come

785
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,720
for demonstration fourth of fire

786
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:06,380
again

787
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:07,770
we should also tell you without

788
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:11,630
there are several rules both acts of
violence nor

789
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:16,920
without not the network by for if you do
not enable them on goal

790
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:21,809
you visit is going to be even easier
really

791
00:51:21,809 --> 00:51:25,040
I known to be let a frappe against the
true that

792
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,480
missus ok red miss that but now with
that I

793
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,260
to I enable everything rule

794
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:35,260
which compared to the pics on of that
Act

795
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:39,170
as well guess me through the moped take
to get any for her

796
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:42,859
and so on whenever all the specific at
the basics

797
00:51:42,859 --> 00:51:49,119
rules

798
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:56,119
you know

799
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:04,089
so again you don't have the I'm taking
some personal

800
00:52:04,089 --> 00:52:07,730
your source for suffocate it so funny so
cool

801
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:12,290
the block with so the cs4 his being
invaded

802
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:15,829
so first the followers and thing again

803
00:52:15,829 --> 00:52:22,829
to see K and this one is OK okay

804
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:29,640
who yes

805
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:33,810
seemed like it was block and the

806
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:37,750
missus not isn't it over the

807
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:40,970
and knows together since it has its own
custom

808
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:45,589
was not not but mother see anything

809
00:52:45,589 --> 00:52:52,589
love how he a good think not klaas so
have the same bike at the

810
00:52:52,599 --> 00:52:56,490
with no response and

811
00:52:56,490 --> 00:53:03,490
mmm No

812
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:15,150
are or the begins wrong

813
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:19,900
Swiss thing can go to clear the way for

814
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:26,900
cool yes show

815
00:53:28,369 --> 00:53:35,369
p.m.

816
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,450
take a little bit longer to for the
tipping

817
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:46,599
for the device to to them

818
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:51,089
takes after that lead true hopefully

819
00:53:51,089 --> 00:53:58,089
about it he said

820
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:09,460
getting through here

821
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:25,530
or uncontrolled years wouldn't know
would

822
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:30,720
over try your phone some other
combination so what was the Swan

823
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:37,720
see if this is work

824
00:54:40,659 --> 00:54:42,720
it

825
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:49,720
you bring the pipe by I hope not signal

826
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:59,700
or the you don't threaten them will come
with it with no

827
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:06,700
try very first 1

828
00:55:12,089 --> 00:55:19,089
hormones wall

829
00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:25,199
okay kittens a.m.

830
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:32,199
hello so tell your

831
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:38,810
or is even with out fragmentation this
one

832
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:42,730
I'm and a.m. year

833
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:47,460
a.m. as you can see in the come on the
bar we just sent to them the

834
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:50,650
to pee request and we did

835
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:55,540
kind of 9 destination up dinner in a row
between this

836
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:58,970
so we have no ipv6 header 9

837
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:02,040
that the nation up to her in a row with
empty so

838
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,680
nothing in it and then the tcp/ip and

839
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,780
a.m. so even

840
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:12,720
without fragmentation 'em we can get

841
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,190
through it think this one

842
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:19,410
should not be appearing the wired oil is

843
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:23,680
even a.m. according to have CE not
recommended

844
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,000
but it's not there's a lot month so

845
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,099
it can be some cases that you need nine

846
00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:34,650
destination option had a but problems
got that the

847
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:38,390
that if they say that there should be a
while this would be cool but

848
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:42,210
game that can be more than one to factor

849
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:46,080
so in this case that one night basic
stuff is up

850
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:50,690
the packet transform hmm

851
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:54,070
and so we know ok woods

852
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:58,010
Sourcefire to the slot synthesis

853
00:56:58,010 --> 00:57:02,270
again a virtual machine on my to on my
laptop

854
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:09,270
with just send

855
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:16,620
just simple TCP recovered you can see in
the locker Bob

856
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:20,080
DC has me the activity so

857
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:23,300
something appears Camille

858
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:29,870
we should

859
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:33,730
even your on word don't know why why the

860
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:37,330
nuns on both i'm concerned.

861
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:44,330
simple from

862
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:50,870
but for demonstration purposes you see
this

863
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:57,870
something appear in the lock and

864
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:07,590
I know

865
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:14,910
well

866
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:17,870
the same command as I used fourth of

867
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:21,220
well which not work there

868
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:28,050
the and

869
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:31,110
knowledge nothing in the law be sure

870
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:34,920
and time a pink package

871
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:41,920
I can send it as well as all its GDP

872
00:58:49,869 --> 00:58:50,580
so

873
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:54,240
first fragment like want the even though
on

874
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,540
nothing more in the lock pool

875
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:01,560
soul no

876
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:06,340
this is how

877
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:09,580
a the festive Asian picnic against

878
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:13,140
so 50 I have had multiple pop you could
use

879
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:17,150
33 dismissals Heather and after that

880
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:21,170
the first fragment who had this message
was headed to the second I can quit

881
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:25,160
another businessman has had a blast
therefore

882
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:28,680
this case initiative I use when the
quake 1

883
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:33,000
on the didn't have to when his mcveigh

884
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,610
for fire this is how the packet through
like with

885
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:42,930
with the dismissal shipping traffic
mandible part the fragment gather their

886
00:59:42,930 --> 00:59:46,380
to fragment again then two more

887
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:50,110
it so by with national

888
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:54,320
a

889
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:59,370
and got in the late it's not that simple
point 9.7

890
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:03,070
that was in the mall %uh we have
installed the latest not what this was

891
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:03,510
the more

892
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:08,940
still effective essential and as I said
to make it even more difficult

893
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:13,110
enabled this additional its I'm not
enabled by default

894
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:17,040
without enabling this rules

895
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:20,490
you even see less if you're starting we
started

896
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:23,720
playing around this fragmentation and
and

897
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:27,360
had a chains and decided wide do we see
nothing

898
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:30,630
inslaw and on some time something pops
up

899
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:34,330
but after we enable this roots and we
got

900
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:37,840
a little bit more information about
extension header if they are

901
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:42,670
chained in the ride or in the
recommended order or not

902
01:00:42,670 --> 01:00:46,160
or even if there are too many extension
header

903
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,600
but was out these additional routes and
neighborhood

904
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:53,210
you will see kind of nothing

905
01:00:53,210 --> 01:00:57,119
and they dislike will summarize what we
did not do

906
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:01,249
neighborhoods and schools because it's
not real

907
01:01:01,249 --> 01:01:04,319
to be honest are so

908
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:07,680
you have to read that's not gonna file
you have to

909
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:11,630
on command aloud whether the proposal
regarding the decor the rules

910
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:14,910
I in

911
01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:18,900
is that and a then you have to enable
some facility

912
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:23,119
ip66 is look at the Rose I'll

913
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:27,970
of course you can also enable some loans
would say give warning were

914
01:01:27,970 --> 01:01:31,349
atom I'm I'll are

915
01:01:31,349 --> 01:01:35,680
that that them for that matter the last
a was so upset this equal to zero and

916
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:36,670
the same time

917
01:01:36,670 --> 01:01:42,099
that more fragments 240 like associate
with little which means that this is

918
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:46,119
the faith in the same time about five
min so more or less

919
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:49,700
this scandal for comet this will carpool
it a car

920
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:53,549
then no know that that how might that

921
01:01:53,549 --> 01:01:58,970
want to give some more the getting the
drinks later this is how

922
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:02,089
the snorting valium look like in this
case Bengals

923
01:02:02,089 --> 01:02:05,279
good business not the Heather but
welcome back hope

924
01:02:05,279 --> 01:02:08,430
Wilding Heather one that's not true
altogether

925
01:02:08,430 --> 01:02:11,690
and then another one by this is

926
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:14,759
if we needed to make traffic according
to that see

927
01:02:14,759 --> 01:02:19,650
than 460 because we don't have more than
that or maybe

928
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:25,299
number and like it again an active
lifestyle

929
01:02:25,299 --> 01:02:30,519
acquittal what Cape I'll when discussion
with the

930
01:02:30,519 --> 01:02:34,160
limit was up north sometime ago in the
summer and the

931
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:39,230
in the end at some point in the real
issue 02 two points 9.7

932
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:42,989
I'll with he was really thought about
that

933
01:02:42,989 --> 01:02:43,849
open

934
01:02:43,849 --> 01:02:47,979
on for them in October we found out that
the head I did

935
01:02:47,979 --> 01:02:51,199
this new config option a

936
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:55,519
so-called marks 86 extensions which was
kind of reaction to us

937
01:02:55,519 --> 01:03:00,589
but for another issue so now you have
the ability to

938
01:03:00,589 --> 01:03:04,519
I define the maximum amount that

939
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:10,670
fixation had affected by small self nada
to do this it's very simple

940
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:14,479
this is capital men than that I couldn't
find somewhere

941
01:03:14,479 --> 01:03:17,479
from the release notes and died on my
own

942
01:03:17,479 --> 01:03:21,170
to find out how between walls a

943
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:24,630
so if you want to the team meet again
because i think is a

944
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:29,670
nor and taking a look out that would not
expect percent against the is intended

945
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:34,039
the real war a you can I said this
configuration ok so for example you can

946
01:03:34,039 --> 01:03:36,569
set this will take months at basic
simple one

947
01:03:36,569 --> 01:03:39,789
which means that in this case you would
expect

948
01:03:39,789 --> 01:03:44,119
you will except by kids whether have
just wanted to compare

949
01:03:44,119 --> 01:03:47,289
Portugal said re here

950
01:03:47,289 --> 01:03:51,729
University 0 this case you will actually

951
01:03:51,729 --> 01:03:55,170
effort between here fragment

952
01:03:55,170 --> 01:03:58,519
and it said disconnected sources

953
01:03:58,519 --> 01:04:02,440
this is a cantor it's a weekend at the

954
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:06,579
the getting picnic against no I

955
01:04:06,579 --> 01:04:10,309
which supports what bacall so as I said

956
01:04:10,309 --> 01:04:13,619
we do not expect to see any contacts and
get this normally or

957
01:04:13,619 --> 01:04:16,650
at least look amazing on bike however

958
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:21,799
the willingness to I wouldn't believe
that this is the best approach until

959
01:04:21,799 --> 01:04:26,729
from the engineering perspective because
would not deal with the problem said

960
01:04:26,729 --> 01:04:29,900
the public would not be detect that but

961
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:36,420
investor the something gets into the
void that

962
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:40,060
this is Allen yet way to configure this
open

963
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:46,280
by before this line he said mine so

964
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:49,730
I'll up to nine it is intended you know

965
01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:52,980
get another but when they are more than
I'm

966
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:56,110
the you get on that

967
01:04:56,110 --> 01:04:59,520
the forces to as i said this so so not
enable

968
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:03,760
by the four okay

969
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:08,140
now let's get some with the gay some
techniques a

970
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:11,660
in our opinion on okay with this in
their

971
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:14,790
bixby growth and the this approach to
for

972
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:20,020
be liberating what cool said however it
seems that in some cases

973
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:23,630
II Texas would be more strict if
possible

974
01:05:23,630 --> 01:05:26,830
I mean that this would be fine exactly
made with it

975
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:32,420
the main said that would not send it a
more than three this newspaper said

976
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:36,110
why so why not putting st.

977
01:05:36,110 --> 01:05:39,810
definitional their defines

978
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:43,130
that's the shouldn't be more than
mythical cool

979
01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:47,140
what this Heather I this can be while
croat

980
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:50,430
because the specification is that in

981
01:05:50,430 --> 01:05:54,700
because this and big with this also
India

982
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:59,790
you by at like it of course no other
comps

983
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:02,800
some vendors all muscle them make

984
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:06,520
that but thats fully compliant with that
is

985
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:10,020
I waste as to what we saw with the big
boy

986
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:13,420
it was a kind of problem addition issue
and at 25 °c

987
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:17,690
it was about that a

988
01:06:17,690 --> 01:06:20,910
they North next to the value the second
said that

989
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:24,940
which made they visible so

990
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:28,250
it's not on the cat tend to fly to seize

991
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:31,570
fault but also look at the in addition
whether

992
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:35,420
perspective something congregations

993
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:39,290
I'll very good approach school

994
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:43,670
stop most of this about sex of course
have an additional five seasons 1-

995
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:48,600
well by novels here up for this

996
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:51,930
I am a pro two when applied spokesman
that

997
01:06:51,930 --> 01:06:55,340
not to love them as we saw recent pic 1

998
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:59,190
it can be evaded even when

999
01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:02,390
this show is supplied by the Cleethorpes
with that

1000
01:07:02,390 --> 01:07:06,020
so the store did not advance here

1001
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:09,490
and the forefront them being you can
configure your

1002
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:12,880
502 devices your DBAs

1003
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:17,290
to drop an excessively take some head
this

1004
01:07:17,290 --> 01:07:23,310
more than one removable between people
and the environment all

1005
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:27,030
if possible to try to sanitize it cannot
be before the TPS

1006
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:31,220
a true this is have some vendors

1007
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:35,550
it's a a they couldn't wish that I some

1008
01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:40,510
I this approach they make so difficult
that they don't because and get this

1009
01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:43,670
by before and another to give you the
permissible

1010
01:07:43,670 --> 01:07:49,119
I'll to allow them to have to

1011
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:52,329
aided the very very specific file which
will be done by

1012
01:07:52,329 --> 01:07:55,990
medical let what that means only in
cases where the

1013
01:07:55,990 --> 01:08:02,309
know exactly what they want to do
missing several

1014
01:08:02,309 --> 01:08:05,569
Friday system discovered that I think

1015
01:08:05,569 --> 01:08:09,650
what I said before then the TPS so you
can

1016
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:15,190
it okay

1017
01:08:15,190 --> 01:08:18,980
I'll the most important than the typical
way from my perspective regarding this

1018
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:20,210
dog is out the

1019
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:24,000
it seems that the there are some big
great day out as

1020
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,738
United just so I love them it's the
so-called

1021
01:08:27,739 --> 01:08:32,199
isn't good with that can be used to
evade

1022
01:08:32,199 --> 01:08:36,980
devices like I países access lists it
at a

1023
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:40,080
or mechanised like I got into is

1024
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:44,009
6 I of course there are some other day I
dress morning

1025
01:08:44,009 --> 01:08:47,710
gonna be & Co MLB woods

1026
01:08:47,710 --> 01:08:50,750
downs renamed at the bottom

1027
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:56,139
NBA I'm several security at that

1028
01:08:56,139 --> 01:08:59,719
the force today said mystical they were

1029
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:03,339
this no penis a better environment where
they can

1030
01:09:03,339 --> 01:09:08,130
up if good organizational out know that
this is the last thing

1031
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:12,609
effective diplomats correctly or not
that's is what's possible or not

1032
01:09:12,609 --> 01:09:15,900
and of course the sooner you know about
bin

1033
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:19,870
the betsy is except for you already here

1034
01:09:19,870 --> 01:09:24,089
and Jens funny would there's a big
discussion

1035
01:09:24,089 --> 01:09:27,630
about K we need extension errors

1036
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:31,359
or do we not need them and

1037
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:34,040
our opinion and it's like okay

1038
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:37,089
for the moment if you don't or

1039
01:09:37,089 --> 01:09:41,190
evaluate do you need in your life in in
your environment

1040
01:09:41,190 --> 01:09:45,170
or from outside any kind of

1041
01:09:45,170 --> 01:09:48,500
extension letter like fragmentation is

1042
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:52,250
needed in your in my mentor for your
company and if you say okay

1043
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:55,760
at the moment we have no need for them
or we don't expect them

1044
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:59,150
so let block them for the moment but

1045
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:03,420
we don't know what's coming the near
future they're coming cool features

1046
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:06,420
which we only can realize with extension
headers

1047
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:09,990
so model let's say

1048
01:10:09,990 --> 01:10:13,460
don't or let's block them for the moment

1049
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:17,090
and see what will come in future and
then we can

1050
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:21,060
say okay this extension is a real need
for all environments

1051
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:26,180
because of this and that feature and
then we will allow words

1052
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:30,250
or use it buds a.m. to

1053
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:34,440
minimize um the problems with ipv6

1054
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:38,550
on devices and something like that could
be a good approach

1055
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:41,580
to from the security point of view

1056
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:45,090
to block them at the moment when people
look more then

1057
01:10:45,090 --> 01:10:48,140
you may need admit this mother know it
that I've

1058
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:51,150
some specific applications on this
nation option but

1059
01:10:51,150 --> 01:10:52,829
yeah for silicon

1060
01:10:52,829 --> 01:10:55,940
blockbuster

1061
01:10:55,940 --> 01:11:00,590
yeah so with this new penalty it is
about

1062
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:04,070
made and vision to be

1063
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:07,099
okay no

1064
01:11:07,099 --> 01:11:14,099
any questions any ideas

1065
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:18,969
what's can IDPs devise or

1066
01:11:18,969 --> 01:11:22,150
any devices to about ip66 tensioners

1067
01:11:22,150 --> 01:11:25,199
from your site or some mitigation
techniques you

1068
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:28,770
you in your mind a.m. what

1069
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:35,020
could help to minimize his problems from
you

1070
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:39,579
you our responsibility for the political
convention of accepting with a specific

1071
01:11:39,579 --> 01:11:40,550
tactical

1072
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:44,159
and that no American and

1073
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:51,159
welcome policy began here

1074
01:12:02,849 --> 01:12:06,489
but does your proximity accept our and

1075
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:09,809
for having have anything like this
explanation

1076
01:12:09,809 --> 01:12:16,809
your and even wanted

1077
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:37,040
okay

1078
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:40,430
and the other home

1079
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:45,920
implementation something okay

1080
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:52,920
good

1081
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:04,300
yes moon yes

1082
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:09,150
I

1083
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:13,060
it's not possible but the you mean
pertains this one

1084
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:17,430
to see it contains if s1

1085
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:20,720
got going to chains a actually

1086
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:24,360
even your real or regional I'm the end
machine

1087
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:28,540
will not I S 10 the exact same thing

1088
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:33,110
here because is going to interpret s
dissipated

1089
01:13:33,110 --> 01:13:37,430
so the your picnic B-fifty with but if
two goals

1090
01:13:37,430 --> 01:13:40,500
you have to panic at all the device

1091
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:45,180
but in the same time no not again must
be able to understand what you're saying

1092
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:50,010
if you then this to be /c let's assume
that mean

1093
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:54,200
be able to live with my but don't target
will not that the senate traffic because

1094
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,510
what follows here

1095
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:59,250
going to be this now being submitted

1096
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:03,230
so that will misinterpret it up but so
even if in

1097
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:07,370
but it still wouldn't get bumping the
only school

1098
01:14:07,370 --> 01:14:10,660
may be nice there in between device

1099
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:14,290
but didn't Exley

1100
01:14:14,290 --> 01:14:17,350
a.m. with tests that the

1101
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:20,860
all of our combination was fragmentation
a.m.

1102
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:24,550
before we go to reside a bit or if even
if we find some

1103
01:14:24,550 --> 01:14:29,400
which go through that EPS if it works
against common operating system work

1104
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:29,890
hours

1105
01:14:29,890 --> 01:14:33,510
business reacting house freebies to
raping I was the Knicks reacting

1106
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:36,910
and to see it even there its variation
yeah

1107
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:40,130
some of them react different to
fragmentation their noses

1108
01:14:40,130 --> 01:14:43,770
and there's a good buy paper from
interest about that it was

1109
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:47,670
presented on get a go through those well
2000

1110
01:14:47,670 --> 01:14:50,190
I mean that it easy to find that way

1111
01:14:50,190 --> 01:14:54,510
to pass through traffic that let city
the difficulties to

1112
01:14:54,510 --> 01:14:59,539
for this message traffic to get and as
for for the bag as it would be fun

1113
01:14:59,539 --> 01:15:04,099
many possible ways to get through it.
PST bus but did ya get

1114
01:15:04,099 --> 01:15:07,949
on the other side don't respond yet so
that he was doesn't help us

1115
01:15:07,949 --> 01:15:11,389
but

1116
01:15:11,389 --> 01:15:14,739
maybe for cover channel or something
like that if you have

1117
01:15:14,739 --> 01:15:17,889
yeah I think the what if I really are
that

1118
01:15:17,889 --> 01:15:20,889
yes it is this could be a and the New
Earth option

1119
01:15:20,889 --> 01:15:25,269
yes although for some other purpose
covered under

1120
01:15:25,269 --> 01:15:32,269
and a question yet

1121
01:15:34,110 --> 01:15:38,370
yes them

1122
01:15:38,370 --> 01:15:41,140
no we don't know any device yeah

1123
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:44,710
no doesn't have my remarks I think firm
the only I

1124
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:47,790
work yet the only idea mmm

1125
01:15:47,790 --> 01:15:51,390
more ike the I think

1126
01:15:51,390 --> 01:15:54,600
at the moment works is with ip67 you

1127
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:57,830
can a.m. drop

1128
01:15:57,830 --> 01:16:02,040
ipv6 extension her if I think if you're
playing

1129
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:05,930
or you have very good detailed
information how you have to configure it

1130
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:06,250
to you

1131
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:10,150
can even tried to get the extension
header

1132
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:13,340
out of that the but this would be you

1133
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:16,390
actually you you USA the point here on

1134
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:20,600
at at the moment but a couple of months
ago I was having a great

1135
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:23,930
hardening got forming season gonna

1136
01:16:23,930 --> 01:16:29,100
6 and the weather was taking it will
send

1137
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:33,110
that no iPhone total up when was that

1138
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:37,760
a I think they've been I P six tables to
drop from today some

1139
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:41,920
by the rules are rules I'll this section
is not the case

1140
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:46,719
and the upon that with the developers
and that it

1141
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:51,719
even a about their and the response was
that at some point the teens they pull

1142
01:16:51,719 --> 01:16:56,179
and now before forwarding the packet
BDSM the biker

1143
01:16:56,179 --> 01:17:01,300
and they had me thinkin asleep while so
they more or less appear

1144
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:04,510
more or less a who this on their own a
fourth

1145
01:17:04,510 --> 01:17:08,460
they'd look at who's this for saying
this but with but some others I think

1146
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:12,380
it wasn't about to be fine up but the
unicycle

1147
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:16,889
a on the other hand the now

1148
01:17:16,889 --> 01:17:21,159
would be okay according to that it sees
in the mediate

1149
01:17:21,159 --> 01:17:25,030
brutality should not be a symbol in
there in five min

1150
01:17:25,030 --> 01:17:30,380
biking addition the take place and along
the path so physically this not the

1151
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:32,000
committee approved but

1152
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,780
in the end yes in the used this false
purposes and business from

1153
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:40,850
a pro so that's the only thing

1154
01:17:40,850 --> 01:17:43,980
no or or you can use a proxy

1155
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:47,170
but then you will terminate the session

1156
01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:52,280
at this and will make another so tooth
no

1157
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:55,989
their most of them drop extension
headers

1158
01:17:55,989 --> 01:17:59,500
butts so if you're sending traffic with
them

1159
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:02,900
they were don't let it through but a
they don't and

1160
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:07,110
that Mia on ok with the product here the
so-called this product in

1161
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:10,449
someone this is a firewall gotten this
exact same techniques

1162
01:18:10,449 --> 01:18:13,710
and the or the five hours yet

1163
01:18:13,710 --> 01:18:19,640
now all the hard work okay

1164
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:24,230
a all the hard work a pretty face the
same issues i mean that

1165
01:18:24,230 --> 01:18:28,050
they suffer from the same is pretty good
at it and get this what it say

1166
01:18:28,050 --> 01:18:32,449
it if I want from this is that that
wasn't fireworks will have orson

1167
01:18:32,449 --> 01:18:35,860
have before allowed on the N so if not I

1168
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:39,510
before the night yes before midnight
exactly

1169
01:18:39,510 --> 01:18:42,540
so when they do not understand that but
I think they don't be

1170
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:47,260
a which is of course what it seems that
the game

1171
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:50,280
yet getting files

1172
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:53,780
while in the best I think with nothing
when

1173
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:57,260
they figure if it if you think that the
reason why

1174
01:18:57,260 --> 01:19:04,260
I think this device can be rated while
if I will cannot be

1175
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:17,760
yes

1176
01:19:20,979 --> 01:19:27,979
well mmm

1177
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:35,400
good

1178
01:19:38,590 --> 01:19:38,970
well

1179
01:19:38,970 --> 01:19:42,960
a nasa now depends usually on the
personal blog

1180
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:46,680
I mean that you were going to get
different assets from different people

1181
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:50,800
I that in that group policy here you
want system

1182
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:53,830
no the policies Oracle e-business

1183
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:57,810
don't believe him had this been

1184
01:19:57,810 --> 01:20:01,760
a from my perspective what they

1185
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:06,240
you can allow from a good

1186
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:09,920
but that this because on its own

1187
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:13,380
it doesn't have to mean that it's not is
it too

1188
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:16,680
if it's something different with and I

1189
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:21,140
but it's not dust allowing or
disallowing something to this it's also

1190
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:25,290
some minor details like putting stuff
last year when it if the fireworks and

1191
01:20:25,290 --> 01:20:26,940
found that the sum up this impetus

1192
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:30,350
what don't think that you don't think it
would have been dedicated

1193
01:20:30,350 --> 01:20:34,100
even when mabel moving papers which will

1194
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:37,480
because that little is the cake

1195
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:41,550
so even if you never with intent me even
if you want to keep it is a new one

1196
01:20:41,550 --> 01:20:45,270
for it's going to be specified a

1197
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:49,870
you will not allow the same time that 0
some other firewalls

1198
01:20:49,870 --> 01:20:53,760
would not not pretty good only I mean
that the

1199
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,330
it's not only a question of which last I
want to be neighbors up but those are

1200
01:20:57,330 --> 01:20:58,230
some minor repairs

1201
01:20:58,230 --> 01:21:01,750
that but that in the end a

1202
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:06,890
yes the to do ability and goodness with
a convertible

1203
01:21:06,890 --> 01:21:10,270
I'll if not all then

1204
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:15,180
a we should allow it the most with a
firm header

1205
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:18,690
unless the environment that is a very
specific application

1206
01:21:18,690 --> 01:21:25,690
wait a minute the one or the other I
think this is the case you don't know

1207
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:29,090
the same nation option errors

1208
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:32,310
used in some or -ism

1209
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:36,840
the the one which is I would used in
some special cases

1210
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:39,970
own protocol the business on the hope I
hope I i

1211
01:21:39,970 --> 01:21:44,130
I'm gonna the Homer about all this some
movies US its allies

1212
01:21:44,130 --> 01:21:47,920
it where some of its with a decided I
think a

1213
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:51,730
know Palin yet but it sounds the movie
circumspect the morning

1214
01:21:51,730 --> 01:21:55,750
the Tyler Thompson the Hokies you but
this is at the lock-in

1215
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:59,420
so even if you have my because I think
we still

1216
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:02,890
not need with rival

1217
01:22:02,890 --> 01:22:07,900
on it for and I hope I hope that this
also used in some other purpose

1218
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:11,080
I I did so

1219
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:14,210
yes there are some cases a

1220
01:22:14,210 --> 01:22:19,490
but very special case yes and you know
these cases are more

1221
01:22:19,490 --> 01:22:22,550
in tests and development then

1222
01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:26,780
in real-world and and everything about
the hope that that is that the

1223
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:30,020
it's the only very specific case whether
sees

1224
01:22:30,020 --> 01:22:34,290
3 that it must be the first one

1225
01:22:34,290 --> 01:22:38,730
and it must be that while at the most
other than the full movies

1226
01:22:38,730 --> 01:22:43,510
3 with the recommendation so when when
the political battle kidder

1227
01:22:43,510 --> 01:22:47,130
I many that gets wet and

1228
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:50,510
responsive if for example you move to
overhaul kit that

1229
01:22:50,510 --> 01:22:55,530
the end only there were more than one

1230
01:22:55,530 --> 01:22:57,900
which is also good for router sends

1231
01:22:57,900 --> 01:23:02,120
every router could in toe print or have
to analyze

1232
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:05,130
packard which includes the hopper hope
so

1233
01:23:05,130 --> 01:23:09,570
one possible scenario first come in mind
okay let's put many of the operator in

1234
01:23:09,570 --> 01:23:09,940
its

1235
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:14,570
sentence two routers to rather to rota
and all of them have to reassemble them

1236
01:23:14,570 --> 01:23:15,000
and

1237
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:19,290
have to take then and so coming so many
packets would be like a boss

1238
01:23:19,290 --> 01:23:23,100
but many of them

1239
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:28,420
just discarded there are more than one p

1240
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:35,420
and the other question a common with a

1241
01:23:35,730 --> 01:23:37,429
thinking thanks but I'm
