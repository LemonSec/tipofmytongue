1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,230
and Iran

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,240
and actually

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,570
while had been speaking to many people
during the last two days

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,090
the basically came to mind that

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,340
the not many people know about service
provider networks too many people over

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,490
campus networks are they

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,900
center networks but so is providing that
proxies largely on No and for example we

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:23,800
had a discussion

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,930
last night and in some ways to says oh
you use MPLS

10
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,539
so isn't like MPLS that duplicated or
the annual review them pls

11
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:34,590
so needs that on No most of the time

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,040
but the icon promised on the dot com so
we are

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,610
their largest operator in there and then
we ought to fix

14
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,260
access and well to do more by and I'm
kind of like network architect type of

15
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,489
guy but I also

16
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,110
what I want to be hands-on so I rations
of deployment and

17
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:57,260
at basically my like that project is
getting like the sixty play and I'm

18
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:01,050
this is actually the situation of
Estonia on ipv6 stack

19
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,180
eight months ago I know this light is
not broken

20
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,490
this is sad and this is totally white
because they're basically was no ipv6

21
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,299
deployment in Estonia whatsoever

22
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:14,640
eight months ago and suddenly this
happen

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,070
and down you can observe that

24
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,150
that we may still reached at six percent

25
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,610
that deployment in the contract with
talking or netbook but it's totally you

26
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,180
in the country and and this happened
about

27
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,630
in about four weeks and not many people
will understand that how is that

28
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,409
possible for how did we deploy ipv6 for
all customers before we can all you can

29
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:37,310
do it then we

30
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:41,820
by we had some people funny and then
they also going to describe

31
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,000
what basic lessons mix of lecture okay
so how did we do it

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,439
and and mix of how did we secure it and
and and basically to give you an idea as

33
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,210
that maybe you can do anything or
networks and I will

34
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,600
but this dole will be largely our own
BNG

35
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,270
so we would go into the BNG part then
but the injection of because the BNG

36
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,090
itself is also a large on known for

37
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,710
for many people but that this is what we
need

38
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,369
I 6 percent is not that bad when you
look at the map of Europe

39
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:13,700
by then we basically joining the city

40
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,470
global countries which are

41
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,010
which have ipv6 deploying and have
reached five percent bring in more

42
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:23,550
so that's just on the off their and
we're not at like Norway's level

43
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:28,150
or or or let's say france also Proteas
have read on this picture

44
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,400
for some reason rate indicates that
there are some be lazy

45
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,330
introduced by ipv6 bout therefore OB
countries as well

46
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,500
I'm to thats something that's measured
by

47
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,940
who def basically gives an overview that
not many countries in the euro

48
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,660
actually have reasonable I P six
deployments and

49
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,590
but this is happening now so and
actually what we need is we have been

50
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,209
working

51
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:56,850
on these for more than three years I but
actively working of course we have been

52
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,100
planning like this except

53
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,480
thinking about ipv6 even more about that
who actually beat this

54
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,860
during the last three years and but
unfortunately

55
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,540
that there is no way he to make a
business case

56
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,080
are all ipv6 deployment so I tried a try
to make a business case show that there

57
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,250
is someone in mall

58
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,319
but all I could come up with are cost

59
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,640
and course everywhere but no money
involved so

60
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,609
I we basically had trade-off that we had
to make

61
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:29,690
to all your get by BB 6 deploying

62
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:33,690
like youth I boutiques are the worst
rapid deployment or any kind of on the

63
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,000
link

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,060
environment or just wait for a white

65
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,340
and we chose the second one so because
we had to be injured but for replacement

66
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,920
coming up and more about to be enjoyed

67
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,650
later coming up anyway so we thought
that okay we went to a

68
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,810
basically makes this site was texting
into the IB engine replacement project

69
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,450
and still do it properly

70
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,510
so we waited a bit and indeed property
to the wouldn't want to do the ipv6

71
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,329
twice

72
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:02,069
who didn't want to do it on the link and
then the proper solution to wanted to

73
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:03,400
donate the bike 26

74
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,510
from the day 0 to there wouldn't be any

75
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,370
additional costs involved because
engineering operations everything cost

76
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:15,019
and also in lecture with when that group
that's what typically not the case

77
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:16,549
collecting data center or

78
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:20,289
or even some capital 48 there are large
campus network in the world

79
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:24,990
about that there only to a few I the
service provider network footprint these

80
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:25,580
huge

81
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,680
so its caller ring like the whole
country

82
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,650
we have tens of thousands of access
devices and even if we would

83
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,870
basically the site that yes we will
replace

84
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,420
everything at be any when they're good
money for it

85
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,490
and pull equipment they're still isn't

86
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,040
the well it takes a lot of men are worse
replace all this equipment

87
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,350
because we cannot do it we have direct
line maintenance

88
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,630
a or related to weather with some pasta
rice and so on and so on

89
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:56,670
so this is the actual problem though at
replacing the exit network

90
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:00,390
takes time and it takes a lot of time
don't say that

91
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:04,040
if we would want to replace all of our
accident at their people problem 8.26

92
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,560
yes

93
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,660
when we have I like

94
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:12,430
7 8 types of access equipment from
multiple technologies right now

95
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,860
and to her generation some of them on
your some of them are owner

96
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,340
basically everything he's gradually
getting replaced but it will take some

97
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:19,760
time

98
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,320
but then again when we deploy ipv6
wouldn't want to

99
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,470
wouldn't want to do have any tradeoffs
in security they wanted to do it like

100
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,430
properly make you might be sick sick
you're

101
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,200
so it would work and we will not be on
slight somewhere

102
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,710
showing that that these are on secure IP
six operators in the world and so when

103
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,240
they are doing

104
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,470
walking routes were so security
important for us

105
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,740
I also we got

106
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,300
into the next generation CBF to actual
Ethernet or the essential mission do I

107
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,270
set the Buffalo

108
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,460
the customer premises equipment that
it's called I

109
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,320
we use do you say bf workspace device

110
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,070
back then now we are using Linux based
device with actually modified opened yet

111
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,720
the inside

112
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,190
this means that we can also run our own
code in there

113
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,440
we can modify the code base people want
to and lectured to run some all

114
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,600
of the world calling their also

115
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,940
I'll because type bb sixties well
because we can control our network we

116
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,090
can control everything wanted to see p
but then

117
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,340
discussed bottom line and we can
reconnect the we cannot control the cost

118
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,180
to my home network

119
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:29,040
as a that's why it's very important for
us that we would will not break anything

120
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,940
for the customer

121
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,620
and unhappy eyeballs that's a movement
or lack bypolls protocol itself

122
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:40,250
at which is and method to do ipv6 and
ipv4 connections to that was a web

123
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,270
server

124
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,860
and if I P six connection doesn't
succeed before back to bite before

125
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,960
leaping catch this information will not
retry AP Physics anymore tho

126
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,490
but he's really important for us even if
we break ipv6 in some

127
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:55,620
of the considerations for the customers
idea was that the costume should not

128
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,110
notice

129
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,570
and we also got three of the PPP Louis

130
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,800
in our network so at least a little more
than that but we do

131
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,139
as a back have some a team-based netbook
got left as a doctor and having I 26

132
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:07,620
August

133
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,960
I and that no I tried to describe a
little bit hollow netbook looks like

134
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,090
and I we go into more detail on the next
lights but

135
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:19,280
damn let's try to understand the weekly
and Dan

136
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,289
we can make because this information
later on the physical topology up here

137
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:26,320
that the people the policy so we the
scan the

138
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,490
access network each summit many reasons
are on

139
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,830
and this is strictly tree topology

140
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,110
so there is no it results in both those
three to

141
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:41,220
and then we get into MPLS network we
have in kismet rhetoric and then kills

142
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,229
cornet book they

143
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:46,320
can be arranged 10k beamish miss network
so that pretty good the porch itself is

144
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,199
not important

145
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,550
because when we look at the actual
service so we with you

146
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,630
we don't use like me long to cost a mere
we'll servicemen's

147
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:58,300
so or the into customers attacks know
that put into the same deal on

148
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,470
and we use these congresspeople rise on
ambulance

149
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,990
I just watched in private the lens
although when this column

150
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,120
and different things but the idea here
is that yes you have shared the UN

151
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,530
but the gust customers else in Pakistan
record which color

152
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:16,039
so there's only like one opening port
with a pension packets to

153
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:19,199
and basically we connect all the string
at their

154
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,460
into our a.m. pls age where we have

155
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,550
well basically may have generated to be
pls sorcery speed and some nice to be

156
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:29,020
going to seem to be less which is due to
speak or item

157
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,039
between all these critical export and
then using Cialis

158
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,099
so the wires which on the Olympus Metro
all it took to get this

159
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:40,570
eternity it to get the service be
learned from this region

160
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:44,980
in told Beng boxes and his youth on
using it to the west and

161
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,220
with your shadow box a system for
basically we have to be in she stepped

162
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,800
out to graphically different places

163
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,290
so we need to have failure in one you
got the place we

164
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:57,410
you have another BNG device some rights
and all that

165
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:02,209
why perot thing actually happens at the
BNG and their old many many things

166
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:05,250
that happen here so basically the dad
before

167
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,040
eight before the cost them a TB that
sits there East the PNG device that

168
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,010
there is no routing

169
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:13,370
is just strictly into two main I

170
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,600
there's a rock in both I week each
subscriber state air

171
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,970
would you rate notification I we do the
8gb version for invasion 600 sitting

172
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:21,320
here

173
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,820
we do rpf check so loose ball pink and
this actually threatened or fifth but

174
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,380
even more detail I would what books are
for ipv4

175
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,860
and which one of the stories so it's all
happening into PNG

176
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,959
them dollars anyone at this point

177
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:39,779
have any questions about that 0

178
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,880
do at least on the stand this concept
soho

179
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,279
over its done to because otherwise there

180
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,310
following don't be so quick pointless
but

181
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,839
that's how we do it and the tricky
released at

182
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,839
that we have small Ethernet that domain

183
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,010
that's three without redundancy and then
get to MPLS network

184
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,300
we were basically get there late to read
online cheap or free

185
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,149
because everything is carried using
intellectual West reply to MPLS

186
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:12,850
and it but these are the neighbors for
us

187
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,870
so set you get the free later to reality

188
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:20,190
I with the at 10:02 a.m. place so we
don't have to worry about that

189
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:24,339
there actual to Pollachi in the metro
network because for you eaten at the

190
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:25,490
university to be learned

191
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:30,209
it's just point to point point to ensure
the wire while it can be taken over like

192
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:30,800
mission at

193
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,029
work sorry wrote that to other links if
necessary and so on that's

194
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:39,230
very important for us and actually we
constantly tried to push them pin is

195
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,440
closer to the cost or

196
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,660
so ideally we would like to start them
to the silhouette directly from Texas

197
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,000
note

198
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,410
and look have anytime that but what so
ever lot

199
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:53,490
that to really stick today by probably
in five years then of course the new or

200
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,699
network we use at 6p

201
00:10:55,699 --> 00:10:58,740
2k carry or ipv6 traffic overall ranking
score

202
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,579
that's totally boring part dot and
that's what we were hacked and luckily

203
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:06,310
day LDP version 6 and 2nd row think are
getting

204
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:09,760
deployed or windows are actually no
shipping code at least two major when

205
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,160
they saw no shipping code for

206
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,660
for the control thing and at least one
when Norris shipping cost for the Libya

207
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,290
mission takes

208
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,530
I not end at BNG part

209
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:22,020
which is super important for us that

210
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,030
other when this call it that the program
management there where there are many

211
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,250
many different names for that

212
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,490
but I did a release that you have aid
each

213
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:33,280
be or or ProQuest that actually will
shape the subscriber Gration

214
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,290
and it did you do with an indication
that stuff about that but you have some

215
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,080
with the state that

216
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,750
this meant to address from the sporty to
subscribe rate has a name has a point to

217
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,780
serve his profile

218
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:45,320
it might have an access list and so what
do and do many of these

219
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,050
on top of a single physical interface or
that a single IP interface

220
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:53,590
at and we have the a centralized
subprime state

221
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:58,070
so that's important for us at the
sleepies not distribute that

222
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:01,220
to the HS so that way H port
configuration

223
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,690
at accessed and the trip is actually
quite simple there is no cost them a

224
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:06,380
specific

225
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:10,960
guy rate-limiting what's over there that
is just some security features and and

226
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,710
in the forties neighbors and that's
about it

227
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:16,520
for the think that configures to port
when the new customers during the peace

228
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,730
it's quite stupid and everything else
happens at the NG

229
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:23,670
at for that St in part to what

230
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,990
I get to mention Sdn because STN main
that means

231
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:30,850
don't believe everything in that
threaten know this ISO

232
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,090
when you know you can actually implement
their own RADIUS server and put their

233
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,190
own good hold in there

234
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,340
and do what every one thing to read the
server you can call it this the end and

235
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,550
it without a fight but there we have
implemented our own Vegas over

236
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,610
more about that later on I then

237
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:50,130
with PNG you immediately get that due to
the radio edit the cation

238
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,670
because every to pry the creation
deletion his style basically there is

239
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,100
for 39 station

240
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,190
and then there's accounting as well so
get that day

241
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:01,420
I P like to be six prefix and I address
you teach

242
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,500
in theory this database so you don't
have to do with from it should be.

243
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,130
service

244
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,589
and very importantly for us piece that

245
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:14,530
that weekend implement the so I could be
six unique cost order to adjustment act

246
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:18,460
I which bill which actually becomes
really important

247
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,400
a leader later don't think they ship

248
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,810
again this big prize on or the private
the lung the super important for us

249
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:30,820
a its controversial topic many people
say that

250
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,820
beats not easy to manage and I E agree
that sees go with private freelance

251
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,300
makes it quite hard to manage and it's
quite horrible

252
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,180
other windows make it that some with the
ZR there are windows

253
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:47,180
but basically on switch can say that
that this is a mock Skype

254
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,730
the UN just one line of consecration and
it means that

255
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,120
any of the ports on the beat and cans in
traffic to each other and then you have

256
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,550
to designate the specific up important
say that

257
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:00,150
the stack shopping for the new contract
that so if you will

258
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:04,160
as grew up twenty racin and that this
kind of thing we work

259
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,300
so you will know immediately other than
no

260
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,790
swing up to integration and he's Cohen
hoping it will work but actually there's

261
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,460
better ways I'm not working at back at
something between the possible

262
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,270
so depends on on at between the two men
two bases

263
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:20,730
but I would say it is doable of course
you need

264
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:24,420
that the little more to lose you have to
make sure that their devices are going

265
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,430
to work correctly

266
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,950
pick up the phone to a shit what you
have to have read everything and you

267
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:32,210
must make sure that their configurations
deploy correctly this is that mean he

268
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,110
vetoes phelan

269
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:36,370
if you have been costamare it makes it
where

270
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:40,940
that much easier but the impact us to
marry many situations not just scaleable

271
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:45,610
I no even if you have BNG

272
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,470
that does all the fine to me if the
stock does all the rate-limiting

273
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,630
at does all that was both thing checks
and so on you still have to protect the

274
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,390
slave to the main

275
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:58,310
and there are basically two things that
can affect you and

276
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,580
dat these will happen because the
costumers somehow we figure out how to

277
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,380
make the loop

278
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,850
at the home network so if you buy are
providing

279
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:11,500
yes sir based access its somewhat the
harder to do because you need the SMTP

280
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,580
and that they brought in a proper take
the SMTP from us use that

281
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:19,150
than there will not be an option ball I
but they also

282
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:23,210
of a detroit-based access which means to
customers can connect which has wrote

283
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:25,610
this whatever they want to the Ethernet
port we give them

284
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:29,810
and they would make lockstep so you
basically want to make sure that if

285
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:30,720
there is any loop

286
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,720
at the costumer

287
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,740
but basically don't both ring from the
cost to abort

288
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,879
you first want to catch that looks on
all Apple tamper with 23

289
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,749
I or that up right there look defection
minutes away level

290
00:15:42,749 --> 00:15:46,759
you want to make sure that out there you
don't learn too many Mac addresses from

291
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:47,899
the sex is not for

292
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:53,019
so we limit our access notes for ethnic
diversity a costly for example if there

293
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:55,819
are more than eight michael is a a
costume that we just jumped on the board

294
00:15:55,819 --> 00:16:00,499
so there must be something wrong because
we limit cost to our for our

295
00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:04,110
four active while I P I P sessions so
there'll

296
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:07,279
in a reasonable way they couldn't be
more than for mac Address is

297
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,910
who allow some extra if the bottom is we
just do I something like that

298
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,610
but if there are more than eight there
must be something wrong and jumped on

299
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,040
the board

300
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,579
and that I think there is that

301
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:21,220
even if you have no protection the loop
detection might be

302
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:25,149
might not be Austin of so at the frames
that

303
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:28,329
the if her pink that are coming from the
PNG to watch the costumer

304
00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:31,709
get look back and sent to that network
again

305
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:36,120
and peace will make your Ethernet access
learned that begins the mac address from

306
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,029
the cost to report

307
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:40,269
and of course that would break with the
connectivity

308
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:43,399
broad customers in that segment because
the BNG Mac will

309
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:46,809
southerly point though she endorsed the
costumers so

310
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:51,110
you must because and it then again yes
through protection we take care of that

311
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,910
but the protection not fast enough so
there might be one two frames that

312
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:59,250
the kindly before little protection
kicks in so

313
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,339
you have to make sure that the be
inching back to assist at

314
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:05,909
cannot be learned from Mexico ports
there are depending on when they're

315
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:07,020
there are needed to do that

316
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,159
it would help if you can actually or
code Mac addresses

317
00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:15,630
to your BNG so you select the neck
address and stick with it on used just

318
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,000
need to look at this is only

319
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,569
yet like be that also is our PBR be a
topic that but

320
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:23,679
danced in my pool the need for a picnic
addresses and

321
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,399
that both of these PNG if you have
redundancy sent back at if you don't

322
00:17:27,399 --> 00:17:28,149
have redundancy

323
00:17:28,149 --> 00:17:32,850
and have not the only one being did you
write it becomes that much easier and of

324
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,100
course you want to limit

325
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:38,169
that down the unit cost I'm what you got
and broadcast frames

326
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:41,179
a actually we didn't drop by with a gust

327
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:44,659
I in our previous text book corporation

328
00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:47,769
because unlike before only worth
wouldn't have any

329
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:50,869
use case for the multicast each other
frames whatsoever

330
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:54,830
so we just drop them now we had the way
if I want to raise some taxes net

331
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,230
thereof

332
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:59,869
go along with the cast at some
reasonable rates but you have to

333
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:03,279
at least make them to some reverberate
otherwise UK again

334
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,340
if there is a loop there's some packets
that the being sent and

335
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:10,450
you well might that that might get hit
no

336
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,830
I'll we've ipv4 because in
discontinuation you have

337
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:19,080
a big submit that's a look at the two
this later on with the play to the maint

338
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,480
and customer IP addresses are just in
that segment

339
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,320
and the customer see peace he put up
with if

340
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,639
after eight months in fact about to be
unveiling the same IP subnet

341
00:18:29,639 --> 00:18:32,999
obviously what will happen is that the
CP we do a lot of request

342
00:18:32,999 --> 00:18:37,090
because it's directly connected summit I
or use a lot but West

343
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:41,039
we'll never reached other costume at a
cost effective only be sent to watch the

344
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:41,559
BNG

345
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:45,909
and then you with because customers for
example you want it we can we get

346
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:50,210
problems because stock his customers get
like static IP addresses they become too

347
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:54,499
to some port forwarding and your ad
domains are quite large you might have

348
00:18:54,499 --> 00:18:55,149
problems that

349
00:18:55,149 --> 00:18:58,779
that but also on the front of the case
with the sector that's how was that

350
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:02,759
customer had a lack of connection and
home connection and they both the unit

351
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:03,990
that the same into tonight

352
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:08,119
and costume I want that from home to
connect to his VPN

353
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:11,499
that the sport for mothers at SBS
connection at the office

354
00:19:11,499 --> 00:19:15,340
dorsey's lands on land use but he
wouldn't do that because we didn't

355
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,710
at by it they buying to the course like
when we deployed to be an issue for ipv4

356
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:22,840
like five six years ago wouldn't have
brought shot but that by

357
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,909
to that point with work and always at
work of the complete so that would help

358
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:30,889
that would happen to you you if you do
it so you need to have brought you up so

359
00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:31,879
if the costumer

360
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:35,369
corpse for a second IP address at the
same layer to the main

361
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:38,919
corporate waste will reach PNG and BMP
will check okay

362
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:42,610
this orbit with for someone that's well
at the same interface

363
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,129
that we should do something about it it
will check the firehouse subscriber for

364
00:19:46,129 --> 00:19:46,470
it

365
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:50,109
see okay we have the prior information
for that the freemen's acting so what

366
00:19:50,109 --> 00:19:51,530
because the mac address

367
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,360
and because I pitas and basically fake
can do

368
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,370
Corp response saying that yes the site
beast directed to make that the same

369
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,230
traffic police make arrest but the mac
Address

370
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:04,340
would actually be to be in Jamaica's for
the cost to the customer traffic gets

371
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,210
into the BNG

372
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:08,940
and then back to the reverse the way but
the pro shop we just make it

373
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,910
that possible other ways to see people
just thought for that this nation and

374
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:18,780
they will not not be in your purse both
I would ipv6 because ipv6 césar

375
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,260
the prefix for the customer is always
wrote that but what CB

376
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,450
so decide to be for thing if you have a
retro

377
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:28,669
the prefix S and the C peter out that
there is no not involved

378
00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:33,150
which is way unrealistic today I then
you wouldn't also had that problem

379
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:36,299
but because there's nothing bored and
want to connect the top-ranking the face

380
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:37,059
you will have this

381
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:41,940
ipv4 problem by BB seeks I because
everyone i'm talking to the devices that

382
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,840
are behind the costumer alter

383
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,160
for this data connectivity kit will get
wrote the Joe through the PNG anyway

384
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,570
because the cost to own as the Ford
wrote before drop points to be in Chi

385
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,040
traffic is sent to the BNG and then back
to unsubscribe

386
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,330
thats how we go to the six for too long
for including the axe

387
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:03,950
you will X group B six acts aim proxy up
technology for ipv6 should you

388
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:08,070
want to deploy ipv6 NAT for example I
don't the white but

389
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:13,280
if you would want to do that then you
would need a

390
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,059
then hold a boot up actually looks like
internet also that again maybe try to

391
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:18,669
explain

392
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:21,770
so you can fully understand what's
happening I

393
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:26,169
first before the see people top it sends
out that it should be version for

394
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:26,809
discovery

395
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:30,270
the and is this caller really just

396
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:34,140
to access device access to a satin
Schertz TX

397
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,890
option 82 add to the chip request and in
the state ship request consent to that

398
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:39,590
PNG

399
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:43,380
an option 82 while there are actually to
follow options there

400
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,429
there is a circuit ID and then there's
the remote valley and access no dings or

401
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:48,640
its information about

402
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,780
itself to this basically inserts I
inclined to identify your both access

403
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,520
note so the beauty can know that

404
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,120
this request came from this access no
and then also insurance information

405
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,710
about tech support

406
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:04,830
so to be in GR No that this request came
from that access no

407
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:08,409
support that he could fight for example
and then

408
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:11,220
this is actually information will you
still need to get the cost a muscle

409
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,370
injury just database

410
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:16,149
we have basically hanging tree that that
the sex is the white sand beach port

411
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:17,559
number means this customer

412
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:21,120
if this record is not fall because the
result that indicate that

413
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,679
and we will not allow any internet
access that's how it's done and then

414
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:25,220
there is

415
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:29,250
below might be it should be the before
exchange to the attributes over

416
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,419
I we used it to preserve it that the
hosted by Rick that the BNG

417
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:36,600
you don't have to you can use it in a
ditch observer a

418
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,880
and then when the region indication
succeeds we create the subscriber

419
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,179
and be four parties working in the CP
obviously with or 44 Kb engine

420
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:49,299
repressed on and ipv4 will

421
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:53,850
flow know for ipv6 party becomes even
interesting because Sat naturally you

422
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:57,450
would want to do exactly the same thing
for ipv6 but unfortunately you couldn't

423
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:01,600
do today I'm great the things that have
been great for ipv6

424
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,250
so you have to we talked to some tax I

425
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,840
so and a problem with ipv6 East that
that you cannot carry it before drug

426
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,559
information on the HP six

427
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:16,419
I web SABC's have

428
00:23:16,419 --> 00:23:19,570
well being considered is cause that buy
it if bout

429
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:24,950
the today you can't do that so you have
to have a role to rate this meant stare

430
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:28,340
for uncertainty for drug information to
the CP

431
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:33,549
20 we hope that we have done it the stat
when dad be four subscriber is great

432
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:33,899
that

433
00:23:33,899 --> 00:23:37,179
the BNG start singing more more

434
00:23:37,179 --> 00:23:40,440
unsolicited I wrote that what this meant
the CP

435
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,370
but it doesn't send them to the
multi-ethnic terrorists like it should

436
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:44,639
amino money that

437
00:23:44,639 --> 00:23:47,710
wrote the same started what this meant
that we got naked receiving

438
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:51,799
once in a while and you can have there's
a little bit that request from the TP

439
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:55,399
but here at actually wrote the
advertisements are sent

440
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:58,870
para per subscriber so

441
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:02,559
when before the private it's great that
the PNG starts generating wrote that

442
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:03,700
what this meant for

443
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,830
that specific mac Address and start
sending them out

444
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:10,250
and DC's only their

445
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,950
to inject the default route wrote so
there are no

446
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:17,210
only graphics information that ought to
do it this meant so

447
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,119
the 30 P

448
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:22,119
have a pickup any IP configuration from
there there's only managed it said

449
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:25,369
that's necessary for some of the CPC
will shape future

450
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:28,909
SEP 6 I and

451
00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:33,709
basic that's about it as an next top by
mac Address we used to get on meet the

452
00:24:33,709 --> 00:24:34,039
press.

453
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:37,539
and we use your charla link local
address forty-six

454
00:24:37,539 --> 00:24:42,299
to because we have the injury on Etsy if
we chill shift traffic from one be in

455
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:43,439
juneau lobby in G

456
00:24:43,439 --> 00:24:47,039
want to make sure that that their link
local address for the people brought

457
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:47,859
would not change

458
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:51,079
so we use a bit or link local address
their

459
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:55,459
thats being hard cold I think that a BNG
configuration and

460
00:24:55,459 --> 00:24:59,689
that obviously the CP doesn't know
anything about this hack

461
00:24:59,689 --> 00:25:04,249
Scotti peace descends peace neighbor
discovery request

462
00:25:04,249 --> 00:25:07,559
them with US address but because the
mood to guest cannot reach

463
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:11,349
anything else than the BNG because
everything gets his bid for item

464
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:15,839
love other customers at the segment can
receive it so these neighbor discovery

465
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:17,329
requests are sent to the

466
00:25:17,329 --> 00:25:20,769
BNG only and PNG most because everything
if you

467
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:24,879
the would want to do so. it was both the
role to its midst thereof

468
00:25:24,879 --> 00:25:28,319
sport gets a bit version 6 over the BNG
would not care

469
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:32,069
because all these packets we get dropped
and all of all the customers will be

470
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:33,999
impacted because this report before
rising

471
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:37,299
to unfortunate that the Seas require

472
00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:41,239
and you might also that okay but what's
wrong with sending all

473
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:44,909
that altered but this meant for the
whole segment but we do not want

474
00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:48,209
that the CPE stopped or not authorized

475
00:25:48,209 --> 00:25:51,569
to pick up typing the 64 drop because
they might feel

476
00:25:51,569 --> 00:25:54,929
the HEB version 6 I'll indication in the
next step

477
00:25:54,929 --> 00:26:00,009
so we want to own authorized see peace
to pick up the phone book information so

478
00:26:00,009 --> 00:26:03,569
basically when this EP he starting then
we will send out of the right this

479
00:26:03,569 --> 00:26:04,779
minute and then be swayed

480
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:09,119
people talk will be installed that would
be horrible in some way but then again

481
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:13,279
this is not something that's been
limited by us winners have implemented

482
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,349
it and when does have

483
00:26:14,349 --> 00:26:17,989
basically implemented it because there
are too many months so

484
00:26:17,989 --> 00:26:21,419
you know that your appointment books you
cannot just boating or II PC people

485
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:22,349
doctor and

486
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:26,499
just inject St Port Authority piece you
want to have some control over it to

487
00:26:26,499 --> 00:26:30,160
it would be super ideal if that would
not be needed

488
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,110
and to get basically forced Dec TP to
start the chat bb6 immediately

489
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:38,010
and then you would inject the default
route it should be six but no

490
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:41,990
to date you cannot do that and

491
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:45,250
as a next step the there is an almost

492
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:49,170
it should be sick sick change the in
taking part I

493
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:52,270
its in all cases delayed so we have put

494
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:55,530
some coding to the CPU so the CP we'll
wait then till

495
00:26:55,530 --> 00:27:00,680
the CP has the SUPV for lease it will
not start yet to be six before

496
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,480
all the teepees we wait for the throat
words but managed it

497
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,890
30 my speed is not set they will not
start yet to be successful

498
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:13,100
it might be banned from TP TP and what
we do we stay that will use the youth

499
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,020
British delegation

500
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:17,820
only so there is no network address so
that actual CB

501
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,840
up blinking the face only has link local
address

502
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,800
so there is no global address a polite
BBC cast their there is only just one

503
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,360
single

504
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,520
prefix delegation prefix pretty be
that's how we do it

505
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,000
do this and then holding able to score
information

506
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,760
learned by that BNG basic could be into
chicks that where the steepest

507
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,160
issue bb6 requesting from and then check
the mac address and basically

508
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,980
that way the neighbor's car information
learn and

509
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:49,220
unfortunately we don't have the
lightweight

510
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:53,650
the chip inlay support no access notes
to like with your shipping delays

511
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:57,290
basically there option 82 equivalent and
ipv6 or

512
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:00,870
the not or a forex is not supported

513
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:04,060
we have some that do but because we
because

514
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,460
look all of them support that we have
not chosen not to use it at this point

515
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,910
to a basically waiting until or 4 X's
nose can support it

516
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:14,320
and this means that we have to do some
kind of

517
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,020
they're grown Act two actual indicate
dollar forty six sessions

518
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:21,610
but because we are working on these
kinda

519
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:25,720
we know that you can't say went and in
the region request will know that these

520
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,610
that a request came from the specific
the third segment newly which

521
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:35,040
the NDP's we know which to make the race
it was to what we do with wood tick

522
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,300
if we have a record based on to be four

523
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,760
session so we have information that
there is a B four sessions that's what

524
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,490
indicate that

525
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:43,500
in DC 30

526
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,090
went with this mac Address so it can
only be that same custom

527
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:50,270
because obviously you cannot have to
make address at the same Ethernet

528
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:50,740
segment

529
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,980
that are to different customers who only
have meant that this conflict and people

530
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:58,950
in the people who don't work anyway to
this basically two key for key thing for

531
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:59,310
us

532
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:03,630
so we do the scenery just and each way
we can match

533
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:08,230
the v6 me sick succession to be four
session and basically authenticate the

534
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,580
six using before data

535
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,790
and if we don't find a

536
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:16,540
before they show I we just reject the
rededication

537
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:20,230
I he supposed to be I love to respect
her because

538
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:24,040
if I will not start the fourth edition
just starting checked thing

539
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,170
that they should be be 60 it'd make it
seem to the wire that they were great

540
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:28,520
trip

541
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,120
read request sent out via the BNG great
response and it basically we know we're

542
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,150
no the BNG and great at some point bout

543
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:39,360
again the windows have done quite a good
job on that so they are heavily a

544
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,790
rate-limiting these things they are
cashing two point several or platforms

545
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:47,350
I their great day if the Raiders request
is sent out

546
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:51,640
that the basically cash their ages
request and the cash the response

547
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,260
I'm if this if there is a senior at
Westwood watching exactly the same

548
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:55,790
request

549
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:59,970
that these need to be sent out of that
that don't just all information from the

550
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,180
cash they will not send

551
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:05,150
big they would send out only one reads a
quest for 10 seconds

552
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:08,610
for the same paper they are having a
rate-limiting

553
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:12,420
that's how they how to do that and
that's why this is not the problem for

554
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:12,730
us

555
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:16,180
so we thought that it would be a problem
but then withdrew this thing we just

556
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,570
found out that the actually

557
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:22,830
but so nice actually thought about I'm
be fixed and

558
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:26,750
that this means that because we are we
have one set the PNG's

559
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:30,560
4674 and we shared he's been a
subscriber

560
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,520
and you can also share a fish action
shapers so for us to a point if you

561
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,810
don't matter if he

562
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:40,520
does he you to be there watching were be
four v6 customer still gets the meat

563
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,720
that the whatever package

564
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:46,280
he has bought and there is also a quite
the show with that jury suspect in there

565
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:46,920
so we pride

566
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,350
nice way to write the date are according
to data for example

567
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,770
and to end the fighting will

568
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:56,679
too heavy ipv6 Facebook my way to write
B will not be

569
00:30:56,679 --> 00:30:59,910
I think that and

570
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:03,850
obviously we need to provide a ipv6 DNS
information some well as well

571
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:08,750
I don't strictly have to have like the
16s but we thought that took a while we

572
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,280
are at it

573
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:13,280
why not so that B-sixteen this
information is sent via

574
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,590
you should be b6 so the CP actually has
a

575
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:19,970
before said before the in a service and
set the p6 yessir

576
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:23,950
any

577
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:30,950
questions so for

578
00:31:32,509 --> 00:31:38,559
it's going I so what does it look like
from the CP perspective is that we have

579
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,090
slashed 5256

580
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:43,440
per customer so this is allocated using

581
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,580
reticulation at to make

582
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:50,210
go causing that the six were you have a
problem where

583
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:53,269
this prefix and the subsequent the
prefixes

584
00:31:53,269 --> 00:31:57,759
or basically delegate that to your look
wearing a tutu costume home

585
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:02,249
devices because it addresses the eye to
pick up their before trout

586
00:32:02,249 --> 00:32:05,629
a you don't want to change the prefix

587
00:32:05,629 --> 00:32:08,929
when there is that's a a short
interruption of things are connected

588
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:12,019
so yes there RT piece that can

589
00:32:12,019 --> 00:32:15,440
handled correctly said the same way they
can handle

590
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,149
there ought to go to sleep I was in
position for example but then that I see

591
00:32:19,149 --> 00:32:20,450
peace that couldn't do that

592
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:25,980
so we chose to actually dash Fairley's
information for up to 24 hours

593
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:29,529
so what they were cost them a DOS if
there is a shortened adoption of

594
00:32:29,529 --> 00:32:31,450
interconnectivity police finds out

595
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,470
actual that it should be six over yeah

596
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:37,980
keeps a record that the customer at the
sad prefix

597
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:41,200
for the best customers technically have
stats tactic

598
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,779
adhesive prefixes at the reviews can
only change of the 24 hours

599
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:50,269
lots all basically we don't want to
change the costumer

600
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:53,899
land prefix if not required at all

601
00:32:53,899 --> 00:32:58,530
go ahead

602
00:32:58,530 --> 00:32:59,600
yes yes

603
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,920
yes we don't find any problems with that
so we don't give you any promises

604
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,700
so we will actually have static Gabby 6
prefix away level

605
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:11,730
but we look to improve promises but to
make it easier for everyone

606
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:14,770
and to make it actually workload at
different scenarios

607
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:19,030
this is actually a good thing to have
and it's not like you

608
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:23,340
are short of addresses in the six anyway
so but we a problem

609
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:27,060
and if I'm a synchronization is also

610
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:31,380
quite interesting because for example
you have a role to adjustment

611
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:35,350
that says that the 1234 salty food for
all of an hour

612
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:40,530
I you don't want to injector altered
what this meant into the local area

613
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,410
networks think that

614
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:44,820
that before trout told us the CP look
will take from this EP

615
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:49,500
is good for one hour so that correct see
peace tweet in a way that

616
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,430
they actually propagate wrote the
advertisement only minutes from topping

617
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,110
think they're faced with an interface

618
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:59,210
so the second helping interface they are
on the right this minute by minute runs

619
00:33:59,210 --> 00:33:59,610
out

620
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:03,320
and people talking removed the second
actually told that the white at the

621
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,000
costume home

622
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,620
also remove the ipv6 before prop and
they actually do the same for this to be

623
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,300
sex life

624
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,040
though again this is Trey cannot
necessarily need it

625
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,590
but me make people actually make
everyone's life easier if

626
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:20,050
if it if it goes correctly and there was
actually a

627
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:23,750
TR 126 or something like that

628
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:27,490
that are on the Internet from their
proper forum that

629
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:31,560
actually describes how the CP should be
hey and vicinity are one

630
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:36,420
I think it does TR 126 so that's in
there as well so that it's basically a

631
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,270
long list of

632
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:41,540
requirements for ipv6 EP so even if you
want to do that

633
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:44,560
at some point and take a look that are
proper informed documents available and

634
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:51,560
they're actually quite good

635
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:53,830
yet

636
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:58,640
Yale your own good so yet so and how do
we divide the special 56 of peace that

637
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,930
that nowadays we have only good use for
the 30 of the sexes

638
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:06,710
64th of the that 255 I

639
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:10,630
would basically a pic got first of them
the the session to force

640
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:15,690
for data interface because we don't have
any ipv6 prefix shopping interface want

641
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:18,580
to have staged a brief that we can use
for the city management

642
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:22,240
as I would pick that one for the apec
the second one

643
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,750
for that cost to local area networks at
the same who same interface where

644
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:28,410
normally or private ipv4 the C span

645
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:32,390
that's getting at the doorstep internet
and in Deira

646
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:35,710
we actually do to be car norm or ipv6

647
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:39,120
I don't know what this meant that I can
only on link graphics information

648
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:39,720
available

649
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,170
the states that please do what they want
the relation with the prefix I

650
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:47,390
we also in zip inject that DNS
information get to know that what this

651
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:47,770
meant

652
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:51,330
and that we also inject a who beat

653
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:55,090
which is the other population we never
beat in order its mint

654
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:59,270
dash shoot actual in your device know
how to do stateless

655
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:02,610
it's a position 6 he can only do also do

656
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:06,120
state this teacher mission 6 and get the
information that way

657
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:10,710
so which better ways to get the
misinformation and the third one we used

658
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,920
to put the public wifi

659
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,360
which is that which is think that the
customer can enable

660
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,990
obviously right before there as well but
there's a firewall in place with no

661
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:19,720
customer

662
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,620
traffic can go between the local area
network and the wifi for their

663
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:27,550
IP for Bart there is just second that
private byte the range there

664
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:31,690
for ipv6 we don't see any reason why
they shouldn't be a second

665
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:35,020
that 64 that to death something that's
not

666
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:38,300
died that enabled by default but it cost
to a once a public wifi

667
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,480
we can go to the hostel TB weapon be
able to face and just

668
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,520
depicting a public wifi and think
there's a Scythian whatsoever

669
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,600
and you get basically lost that public
wifi as well

670
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:51,640
I according to calculations are that was
something that's

671
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,830
obviously was brought up by or like help
this kind of people

672
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:58,900
in the company when they heard about
died 26 warm weather like in the public

673
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,060
eye business have a home I caught this
guy before

674
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:06,150
so that's why we will we actually
implement that the US firewall there

675
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,740
because to be four is protected by that
not

676
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:12,760
firewall as a we need something for the
six

677
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,819
so actually we have 18 grisly 6 firewall
that

678
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:20,140
that by the Four Tops all in both TCP
for example but this it opened some

679
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,030
think the costume again going to the CPU

680
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:25,819
the we went to face and configure so we
don't die maybe we say that you are

681
00:37:25,819 --> 00:37:26,450
protected

682
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:30,970
if you want to make an offer to buy a
four-piece go ahead and also regarding

683
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:32,520
the coat that we're on the CB

684
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:36,760
I we actually implemented a neighbor
discovery locking because I'm

685
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,390
we have well our internal it's a hope
this tools are

686
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:43,780
I would say excellent compared to other
operators

687
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:47,910
and we there we have a feature that you
can see there

688
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:51,079
actually time be four a or Pinterest

689
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:54,450
you can see with CBS which ports the RX
a.m.

690
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:57,710
actually connected to what's their neck
when you're in so went on to make

691
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:01,730
at the stripe easier for example if that
got a recording and say is that I have a

692
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,010
problem with my set the box

693
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:06,020
day let this guy can me to check that
Woods

694
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:09,960
CP port action at the box connected to
and so on would be six people in the

695
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,589
prolific because the neighbors Korean
trees by mall

696
00:38:12,589 --> 00:38:16,849
with a rapidly and you fun do actually
release these entries into we would

697
00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:21,270
be open to their neighbor discovery
extortion affects so we implemented a

698
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,359
neighbor discovery logging

699
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:25,520
to actually pick up any of that well

700
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,170
we when we keep that we always thought
the case with a to actually I include

701
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:30,000
the poor as well

702
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,540
it would be cop any arpa neighbor
discovery requests and we actually

703
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,619
least into that Linux kernel II me

704
00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:40,109
Barnett think patience is will pick up
the information from there

705
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:44,089
and we basically keep their only offer
of 205 55 entries

706
00:38:44,089 --> 00:38:49,440
to actually no lost 255 or penne able to
call reign three so we have like white

707
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,770
bed rest and we have mac Address

708
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:55,520
and then you can use you with this which
make a stable because like the CPS for

709
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,290
Ethan that land ports and that's
actually cheap been tight there which is

710
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:59,339
a pipe or switch

711
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:03,369
and we can get methodist David from
there so with that way we can basically

712
00:39:03,369 --> 00:39:06,630
show for at this key information about
the okayed their

713
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:12,359
for sport SBC BCS this be 4i left BCS
has had these VC telesis

714
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:15,960
saw your privacy address and what so
ever Indiglo but we just like to show up

715
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:22,790
in there

716
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:25,050
I don't know because we don't really

717
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:28,250
with at 8 actually yet at they have used
it

718
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:31,349
you have a couple friends were playing
with it so yet

719
00:39:31,349 --> 00:39:35,150
but that the same same thing with this
so I

720
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:39,040
neighbor discovery logging East that die
we do not actively

721
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,430
extract information from TB to we don't
like confronted upon this information

722
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:46,770
we don't want to have that information
but will it put this information when

723
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:48,310
they have cost them a call and

724
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:51,410
at this Chris opens to support the
information system and then the

725
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:54,520
information gets bored the same way we
don't want a boy like the valuable

726
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,480
information to 12 there might be like

727
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,170
but there are no but there might be some
other people say that there are privacy

728
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:01,109
shouldn't whatsoever

729
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:06,600
go ahead

730
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,520
yes at the moment we allow only our
seabees I would come to that

731
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,470
that in a second but wishin

732
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:17,110
that may have lost the state can you do
separate b6 PNG

733
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:20,590
to have a separate box I don't want to
open it would be in G&A the separate yes

734
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,410
you can do that

735
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:25,660
at you obviously cannot share your v6
importantly 6 a purse

736
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:30,070
about that because you're obviously
would want to share a just database you

737
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:30,680
can still

738
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,830
do this kind of the seeks to be 4i
beaming

739
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:38,160
having a radius unique and different
PNG's you have to do you carry around

740
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,670
not being so we know that

741
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:44,710
these PNG DC interface on the four BNG
use the same ether segment that's this

742
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:48,170
interface on the 6 pins you have to have
these been mapping table but if you have

743
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:50,430
it then you can do it I

744
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:53,640
and you always have to protect two sets
up in Jamaica dresses

745
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,070
I'll and the BNG itself

746
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:01,540
East again this is said controversial
thing many people say that

747
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:05,120
know there's different ways PNG
shouldn't be down although I protein

748
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,240
should be distributed today H&H the way
should play it through

749
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,470
me three rotor into 101 so there are
many favors how you can engineer network

750
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:16,010
I so being he's not for everyone to that

751
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:19,820
that way I wouldn't recommend mixing
kinda typically for all

752
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:23,600
thing and then just try to carry your v6
back at some way to the BNG you

753
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:30,070
just when that's both a mess just don't
do that and know the four weeks part

754
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:33,360
a that's being

755
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,790
alt quite frequently I how do you do
that in four weeks

756
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:41,900
I'm well actually we do it because the
teeth and address for the boy told ABC

757
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,720
corporation to be in GR

758
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:48,420
when we change to be ng's or six months
but then

759
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:52,180
we obviously pics to motivate the should
access network pressure would I would

760
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:52,430
look

761
00:41:52,369 --> 00:41:57,230
actually doing one day with perfect I
but we introduced the

762
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:01,039
Ethernet day heated eternity to type a
speaker at the BNG

763
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:04,950
to basically we think that all all
traffic with IPCC the pipe

764
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:09,390
to know ipv6 traffic with bass wide
action punctuation was dan

765
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:14,329
at BNG in with text I would basically
waited for like another six months to

766
00:42:14,329 --> 00:42:15,869
get all the CP box fixed

767
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:20,140
and which there were many and when you
for all

768
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:23,140
finally done then we basically replace
the filter

769
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:28,039
and dime way and we go

770
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:31,769
back here that's basically

771
00:42:31,769 --> 00:42:35,740
don't believe in that how to move people
from some think the faces here and then

772
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:39,069
here and in the thought okay let's do
some more than that in here and in the

773
00:42:39,069 --> 00:42:40,380
mood here and here and here

774
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:43,880
so that's actually just only remove the
filter and everything thought the

775
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,400
grouping

776
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,380
magically to wouldn't do any report
ERATION changes there

777
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:52,700
and obviously we had the morning to that
one

778
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:57,910
carefully so will you stand at
prohibition 10 like to fix for that we

779
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:58,710
use some

780
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:02,519
mirroring from Mexican places as well
just to see what's happening

781
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:06,269
and interesting part the stat that were
the last

782
00:43:06,269 --> 00:43:09,789
done with the plot thickens I we have
had exactly

783
00:43:09,789 --> 00:43:12,829
0 customer facing problems so

784
00:43:12,829 --> 00:43:16,339
your customers have call us and said
that they had a problem with the

785
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:18,640
interconnectivity dollar-something we
look for up

786
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,140
and we have action being don't like b6
we have not see Robert I would say that

787
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,230
the happy eyeballs probably takes care

788
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:29,220
about most of the problems because most
of type using content it should be

789
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,140
anyway know this

790
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:34,140
so I will encourage everyone to do that
because

791
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:37,779
would have enabled quite the lot of
places customers

792
00:43:37,779 --> 00:43:41,430
and we actually actually I promise you
we had zero problems

793
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:44,980
we have had a lot of the people I'm
since topic that we have figured out

794
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:48,920
previous in the lab we have had some TP
wrong thing production

795
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:52,599
but that was just mean that like b6
brief information is not propagated to

796
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:53,640
the customers and it will

797
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:57,910
Software Pvt be successful and so on as
you want actual problems

798
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:00,430
not

799
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:03,190
so what the plan to do the

800
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:07,230
woodland to support the party piece so
nowadays we only

801
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:10,619
allow 30 piece basically we feed on base
to make the best

802
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:15,470
and the reason for that the stat that of
the must-have

803
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:18,480
crapload of different EP's and

804
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,460
they have well interesting
configurations some tea peace

805
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:26,609
send us a hundred that they should be
six missions as per second for example

806
00:44:26,609 --> 00:44:28,480
so

807
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,520
and because you can't really control the
CP at all to do it this meant beats

808
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,369
telephone curation available in
management duration: available

809
00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:39,030
don't really tend to cost them a TP
should it do a

810
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:43,220
I A PV the British delegation also need
to network address or should it to both

811
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:43,800
of them

812
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,890
so don't really tell them so that I see
peace that actually

813
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:50,420
get prefix delegation but still Amaro
disparate began to caress

814
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:54,970
requests and this is again something
that's being debated that diet tips to

815
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:55,310
shout

816
00:44:55,310 --> 00:45:00,830
whole should be was all this there is no
reasonable solution at this point so

817
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:06,570
just to between with customer experience
is number one priority priority for us

818
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:10,220
so we don't want to break Internet
connectivity for these costumes by

819
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:11,460
injecting some

820
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:15,000
IBC corporation that would go up there
but local and provincial

821
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:22,000
that salary in

822
00:45:28,289 --> 00:45:29,890
yet we're

823
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:33,960
yet because the movie are from that make
range so we plan to fix this

824
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,100
but there are certain operational
problems are on track to work closely

825
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:41,850
by but if you look closely monitoring
the situation and I plan to do some work

826
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:45,680
in second of this year to some extent
were the figure out which are there like

827
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,030
most duty peas and what should we do
about them

828
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:51,770
obviously we want to support the static
guy v6 prefix

829
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:55,130
to that something that's gets sent from
the radius for this will not be sent

830
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:55,780
today

831
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:59,230
the six th do at all for this
information be gone from radio so that's

832
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:00,230
just purely

833
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:04,520
over own internal IP development stop we
want to support

834
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,720
that the ipv6 wrote saying the land to

835
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:11,280
because and the part that we need at
this hint that's not there yet

836
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,190
because the cost to ABC's prefix can
change and they want to break the static

837
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:17,350
route that states that they want to
route they say

838
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:21,540
seeks of this last 64 store what some
link local address in the land cannot do

839
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,790
that today because

840
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:27,190
you can unique and or cool 36 address
but you would want to have the same

841
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:30,770
that's a stat to what youth the sixth
these I 64

842
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:35,400
from which have a prefix you get the
look at it we would love to do hierarchy

843
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,610
call a British delegation

844
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:40,900
so the customer can actually that's the
second router between the sad for us all

845
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:41,220
to

846
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:45,800
behind the first author and get again
get that is less sixty four delegate

847
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,960
let's not automatically so that's
something that's not there today yet

848
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:54,580
I we will want to push our voice over IP
and IPTV to be six

849
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:59,840
we would have a warrant or content as
well and we actually are starting all

850
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,840
somewhere alarm open letter I

851
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,920
and actually i'm happy to say that
always so we're at.

852
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:11,450
the but product on time the product but
the was 280 that will enable us to carry

853
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:15,850
Voice over IP traffic or a weighty
network at this is not the

854
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:19,570
launched yet I saw the secret but he's
not launched yet

855
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:24,290
but its at native ipv6 only so there is
no the foreign-born

856
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:27,860
in any way that we have engineered as
the 60 each other

857
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:31,250
all the session for the gateways at the
head and all them basically you're in

858
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:34,180
point to a pin in point that the mobile
phones or need to be six

859
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:41,180
and nothing else and actually does work
and it works really really well

860
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:48,920
roaming is problematic roaming the
serious diplomatic I because

861
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,769
sigh when you set up their own session
so where does your ex

862
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:56,709
I you can initiate but basically tend to
that busy

863
00:47:56,709 --> 00:48:00,259
the at hit the net looking at that the
information that the PDP context should

864
00:48:00,259 --> 00:48:00,839
be

865
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:04,089
like me for only be 60 New York Knicks
the 46

866
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:08,459
but that makes the 46 and eight the
Sikhs were introduced in there

867
00:48:08,459 --> 00:48:13,819
hair latest pop saying that lost
three-year a set of the GPB release the

868
00:48:13,819 --> 00:48:14,289
force

869
00:48:14,289 --> 00:48:17,289
that came out three years ago this is
only the

870
00:48:17,289 --> 00:48:21,009
released that where this was implemented
and if they're

871
00:48:21,009 --> 00:48:24,439
visit the Network some wearing on da for
example I'm sorry if there are any

872
00:48:24,439 --> 00:48:25,479
people on the air

873
00:48:25,479 --> 00:48:28,519
at into one dollar that runs up the

874
00:48:28,519 --> 00:48:31,660
who they are GBP release which totally

875
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:35,699
to become repeat okay so they would not
understand despair PDP context to

876
00:48:35,699 --> 00:48:36,410
publish its

877
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:41,119
and we have our own problems so for that
they think that pussy that

878
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,619
a roomie will remain for ipv4 only for
who knows

879
00:48:44,619 --> 00:48:51,619
a long time

880
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:01,000
mmm I think that you couldn't at this
point at this point people

881
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,830
and to some stats so

882
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:08,640
I we have what did mention it that start
but we have

883
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,660
250,000 subscribers in on a trip

884
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:15,840
well it a bit more I have no effect this
morning

885
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:19,849
that we have the but there were thirty
eight thousand will be six in a with the

886
00:49:19,849 --> 00:49:20,400
Primus

887
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,740
and two important numbers

888
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:27,770
is that eighty-one percent of these that
the date them into fibers

889
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:31,740
actually had 86k per device thats you
that was b6

890
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:36,349
in the land today then again eighty one
might song that I low number

891
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:41,380
to be quite which devices are there but
that because we have customers that only

892
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:45,380
use style where I pity product for
example or only use our way so I P

893
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:50,210
but from ipv6 perspective we don't care
we just the role of ipv6 for all the of

894
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:51,000
TCP's

895
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,750
so it's quite realistic that we have
quite a number of customers will just

896
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:58,170
tell you have all support for example
knows that the box at this point doesn't

897
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:58,930
support BC

898
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:03,670
and actually twenty percent of the size
of crimes have more than one like a

899
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:04,619
straight guys

900
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:07,680
and because we have chosen not to do it
this meant

901
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,410
and wound up basically to play or how to
inject the DNS information

908
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:39,420

six for most of the day posts there

909
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:42,920
for the support the basically on the
local market the six

910
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,960
obviously we see at what about the pool
YouTube and will run into traffic

911
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,130
so we'll Analytics is also important

915
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,390

916
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:07,980
obviously all the CBN's for the meet
against this report the six and we see

917
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:08,760
traffic on the

918
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:13,549

919
00:51:13,549 --> 00:51:17,900
Russian website between the russian
Russia Facebook and some Russian

920
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:21,339
searching search engine that's also
getting used to the six

921
00:51:21,339 --> 00:51:26,089
and we see parental worry 6 thought some
other European operators
