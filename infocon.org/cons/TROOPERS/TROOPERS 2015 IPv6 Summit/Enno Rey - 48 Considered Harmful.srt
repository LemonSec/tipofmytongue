1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,720
on actually the stalking going to

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,010
given now is sent update of a talk I
gave it the right

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,290
69 meeting in London one of the reasons

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,450
of giving it again

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,020
it's not just there were some slightly
update at

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,990
the statistics and statistics are an
important part of this talk

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,300
but the to write a van Ness

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:31,230
of a certain type of problem a

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,820
that right now lost since some time
cause us

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,600
in sought the soccer that's a lot of
debate there is not an either/or you

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,260
wish there was a lucien for this

12
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,090
um

13
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:48,350
but the at least if you own enterprise
organization

14
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,790
you must be over there are we think
about this type of problem

15
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,410
it's a problem of strict filtering which
is

16
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:01,390
particularly interesting as the guy who
stopped as the inventor

17
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:06,200
inventor a suite for the reason the room
no on

18
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,210
I mean he's increase maybe not the
inventor but that the one who

19
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,440
documented it in the first a structured
way

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,050
and not everybody are as happy he did

21
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,090
on he

22
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,800
apparently he arm

23
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,700
how do you say to a toast for he seems
unaffected by me telling this

24
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,340
he's looking at his computer but the I
okay did

25
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,660
you don't mind me every time I get this
talk I some he's in the room

26
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:41,560
I i do some reference to him a so you
don't mind me doing this again

27
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,780
to you yeah

28
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,880
huh so that s that s it that that that
man is called his much

29
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,460
cooler than I am doing the so silly
jokes of loaded with him

30
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:58,400
%uh all the time yeah let's let's just
get into it

31
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,120
the that the stuff I am I going to do to
discuss some

32
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,800
while I'm the present up this actually
there's a lot of ways such behind this

33
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,540
which was done by to a guy s all looking
for 'em

34
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,980
and IT organization what are the get a
digital systems

35
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,990
on the

36
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,790
so it's a over a lot of like the credits
and

37
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:27,160
and stuff to them yet again that the
agenda pretty simple I lay out a certain

38
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,330
type of problem

39
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,540
after that

40
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,810
I am rule lay out how we

41
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,250
which means mostly to the other guys I
did

42
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,840
the assembly and i did some mom a

43
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,100
like formulating a recess question and
stuff between

44
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,430
a whole we how we tackled finding out
the

45
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,670
Badar ball we ality and what

46
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,340
odd these data from reality and

47
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:00,400
I will propose love you provide like a
conclusion and some some proposition

48
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,850
their wrists this

49
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,610
in white space the ripest

50
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:11,100
officially it's our Retro City
organization are I R

51
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,790
which in the first place means a

52
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:21,070
their role as a to provide its think
that we saw sis

53
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,239
address allocations are and are
autonomous

54
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,160
autonomous system numbers stuff like
this to solve us

55
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,780
a whatcha say for this stuff but they
have more also in the interim

56
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,519
actually it's some the understanding yes
I Drive is a

57
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:38,220
a

58
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,659
member organization which puts out like
policy is created by those men must

59
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:47,230
on some they have an agenda

60
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,330
like all organizations have another know
I will maybe

61
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:55,260
get to this at a later point in any case
there are so

62
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,920
more or less well-known document from
right that documents on

63
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,000
month in the Sun scheme I'll for someone
else to write pop up for that with which

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,319
was actually of up to

65
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:08,690
bye and bye America and and stuff on

66
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:13,120
and again ross a.m. right 532

67
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,419
which s from the iraqi working group
which

68
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:20,340
to the vessel you wanna up should
address many longer

69
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,470
you want to chapter of the market will
done here a

70
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,490
know you addressing yeah I always get
this wrong

71
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:33,139
but up

72
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:37,789
yeah um but up

73
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:42,320
um there's this document

74
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,440
on like

75
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,110
a certain aspect of routing policies and
this document states

76
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,110
there are occasional requirements

77
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,669
for the advertisement of Mah specific
routes

78
00:04:55,669 --> 00:05:00,110
I with getting a second to what is this
from live in a location

79
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,990
if if you I is peace currently
furthering at a minimum PA location

80
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,210
within the relevant address range
justice can cause significant

81
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,610
difficulties for netbooks wishing to
deploy ipv6

82
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,680
what does this mean if you're not from

83
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,020
up provide a space

84
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,919
actually you one seal US and

85
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,349
figure you on and the price organization
and

86
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:27,960
the you decide okay we want to do that
he thinks we need address space

87
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,940
all

88
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,240
they're worth Toolman approach us

89
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,370
one this let's imagine

90
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,460
there a CR I R the organization

91
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:44,530
responsible for this locating at first
base and

92
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,699
southern part of the Walt sure if this
is going

93
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:50,740
be a good idea like this on

94
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,270
I have to impression it's not

95
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:59,389
maybe like this well

96
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:05,919
white stripe

97
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,090
artist so okay

98
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:13,389
thanks for this

99
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:17,169
know them seems much better simple
technology

100
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:20,210
thank you okay

101
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,629
um there was a a global organization
taking care of %ah

102
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:27,669
myspace the location and distributed in

103
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:31,280
and now st. regional organizations the

104
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,590
RI are switching million turnover
mysteries those five of them in drivers

105
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:36,150
10

106
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,150
lawls now here is an organization

107
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,629
and this organization needs to address
space

108
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:46,009
%uh decir freemen approach us

109
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:49,599
1s go to your provider

110
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,530
source provider and

111
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:56,699
actually use a pause in of the address
space

112
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:01,009
which has been I located at Susa correct
Tom

113
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:06,199
like this got a piece of this address
place a and use it for deer

114
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:10,500
molestation um a second approach s

115
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:17,500
goal die would be too right

116
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,169
and tell them all I don't so I don't
want to some

117
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:26,840
be dependent on on a service provider

118
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,530
when it comes to address space I need my
own address space

119
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:35,160
which dan is called a so-called provider
independent

120
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,810
address space PI address space um

121
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:43,380
in theory you and to you

122
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,960
for this for the purpose of to stalk
mean some and the press organization

123
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,389
you can do that's and practice

124
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:54,669
arrive doesn't want to a hand the

125
00:07:54,669 --> 00:08:00,060
a number of for like home organizations
building casa whatever our

126
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,360
a approaching them directly so

127
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,620
in reality here one has to

128
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,720
if one wants to perform this the type of
procedure

129
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,669
one has to go through a so-called spawns
are weighing

130
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:19,210
LIRR organizations at this level the
South provide us are called

131
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,449
a ligase local internet registries a

132
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:25,919
to perform this 1/2 still go through
damn

133
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,190
do some paper Walker pay some fee %uh

134
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,969
to get some a independent address space

135
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:35,990
there is a third option

136
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,289
and the thought of chin is actually the
one that

137
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:43,789
most organization said we do cowardly
perform

138
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:47,910
that s act

139
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,670
as to provide up I

140
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,500
and get address space from ripe

141
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:01,029
lemme asa provide up

142
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:04,459
and this address space

143
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:08,839
a so-called I'll provide aggregate a
full address space

144
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:12,650
and it's called in a location soul

145
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,750
in the so usually provide us get our
locations

146
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,200
a from the rival would you then

147
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,190
the handout suffered assignments so that
customers

148
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,740
there was in the section funders rule
which just that this procedure

149
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,380
but most parts of the addresses the
actually use to some

150
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:34,240
I'll provide aggregate double-spaced
which as and locate that

151
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,230
from ripe to provide us this

152
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:42,970
types of address us audit the rain ships
use for this address s

153
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:46,360
are on a different

154
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,300
the right now this is usually

155
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,580
distributed from I think it's a to a

156
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:59,110
know them get its we saw the media

157
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:03,950
I think I even here I think I have a
slight on this

158
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:08,880
a second well maybe not in this one

159
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,480
no I don't have it this one on its it to
a see well

160
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,120
something and then

161
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,820
thing leads it might not be correct but
it's not on there were going anyway it's

162
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,940
easy to find out to

163
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:27,430
a something flesh at 12 everest some

164
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:30,710
these address us from 2001

165
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:34,740
I think it's sect the 67

166
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,510
a its a slash 29

167
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:43,870
on this will be important for the later
part of the talk about

168
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:47,530
addresses from this type of course each
of

169
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:51,770
by can be distinguished from addresses
from

170
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:58,320
this type of procedure and now the point
about this statement this

171
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,840
up there isa sa

172
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,570
been expectation that organizations
which

173
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:09,150
act on this level which were considered
to be provided us

174
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:12,650
organizations providing that box office
s

175
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:16,530
in the me be that

176
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,860
a well once they get in a location

177
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,940
get a piece of address space from from
this one

178
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,320
once a noun set on a routing level

179
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,870
they announce our full address space

180
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:34,950
and not just part of that announcing the

181
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,060
full address a location is called

182
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,440
TR aggregate there s

183
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,750
announcing parts of that is so

184
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,570
what is called I think the terms on and
then there are

185
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:52,400
I'll or what ma specifics a

186
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,820
so if you have 'em a chunk of address
space and on a BTP level

187
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:01,890
you announce a full trunk well you were
relocated at

188
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:06,030
by dr. I R that's the covering aggregate

189
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:10,500
the IRS announcing just small pieces of
that

190
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,540
those are caught more specifics but both
times

191
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:18,430
all usually mostly applied to

192
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:23,210
this part of the Walt forget about this
for the rest of to talk

193
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,510
um looking clothes off

194
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:32,280
at this statement of it mentions them

195
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,610
my we while that might be case s

196
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:38,990
there might be a location a week while
man's

197
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:43,330
where it could make sense to announce
so-called most pacific's

198
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,680
and some

199
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,200
there might be a few eyes peas whoever
they are

200
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,710
which actually fail to I'll

201
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,960
fall a reason we will lay out in the and
and and some minutes

202
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,750
which might failed ID's announcement of
more specifics

203
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,140
actually the unfortunately

204
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,410
her sorry for that some America the

205
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:12,500
for the fatalist that America had on on
one on the slides

206
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,680
I want to write something the in

207
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,970
no which is a very common like for the
list for provide a space

208
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:25,000
implements that exact problem ever
approach as we will see

209
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,800
the so there might be a problem it

210
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,520
price at fault for the moment home dust
something can go wrong

211
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,890
most of you will not have given you are
not from provide a space

212
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:40,580
not have a clear understanding what can
go wrong but that this

213
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,020
II whale latest up the question is now

214
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,370
what are these requirements and

215
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:51,600
is it just a few eyes peas filtering
such address space announcements are %ah

216
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,280
this is a common practice

217
00:13:53,280 --> 00:14:00,280
and what is the impact fogging is a ship
actually wanting to deploy ipv6

218
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,079
I'll to understand that the problem
space

219
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:06,879
one it have so

220
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:11,579
understand the current developments and
momentum

221
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:14,720
in from in this

222
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,790
basil right just race and to understand
the sudden approach which is called a

223
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,750
strike filtering

224
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:25,449
first let's have a look at the what's
going on in the

225
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:29,639
arm aggress location and righteously

226
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:33,480
space right now in the old days

227
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,819
these organizations

228
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:39,819
getting direkt

229
00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:44,139
locations from ripe were supposed to be
provide us

230
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:48,829
organizations transporting network
traffic they had bizarre models

231
00:14:48,829 --> 00:14:53,069
which we are around like a connectivity
traffic transport

232
00:14:53,069 --> 00:14:57,689
are they had many custom us the
Montebello usually

233
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,870
of Defense but the in general on

234
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:04,720
the more customers to more revenue to
bed up and

235
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,420
the they had the networks that the
expectation was

236
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:13,459
like the netbooks with several entry
point so I X appoint some

237
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:17,199
depending a perspective up with a
consistent backbone

238
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,259
so are the like connected to other
networks

239
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:25,300
acting as a entity as a whole

240
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,259
on the Rod Laver and being able if
traffic Leafs

241
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:33,290
their network on one side and delete on
traffic in

242
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:37,570
comes in from another site you to
Internet routing

243
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:41,590
mechanisms the to be able to handle such
a situation

244
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:46,010
let's call those organizations for the
purpose of the pocket transit and I aus

245
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:49,970
but since some yes

246
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:54,340
I'll as i sat many organizations which
are not

247
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:58,050
summers provide us which bill costs are
all chemicals

248
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:02,230
arm up will produce a machine some
manufacture something

249
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:06,050
have realized all what makes our life

250
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:10,070
much more easier in a in a number of and

251
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,830
perspectives I if from

252
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:17,400
we I'll approach

253
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,400
ripe for a dress by to location as
opposed to going for this procedure

254
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,140
not this for no reason that

255
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:30,800
here on that side of the things you
usually get a slash forty eight

256
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,140
and ipv6 the times barris here

257
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:38,680
you get usually on Lisa slash I the two

258
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,270
a common practice by right right now is
set to al Qaeda slash 29

259
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:48,560
so it gives much more flexibility much
most basic and better-armed distribute

260
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,520
does address us

261
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,860
for a number of reasons it makes much
sense

262
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:57,020
and all of our customers all that given
the chance to be bought for:

263
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:01,150
a half on that on this approach it makes
a sense to

264
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:04,579
a act as a polite no but

265
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:07,959
arm there was a big like mom

266
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:11,730
cavett which sexo world popping off to
talk

267
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,740
to in to underline this

268
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,740
are this development services number of

269
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,900
LA arm organization some

270
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,910
I'll which have for the

271
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,350
received and ipv6 a location in

272
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:32,840
in drive twosome was like I I think this
was given and was also warm body year

273
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,450
goal

274
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,080
these numbers are published the
interesting thing is:

275
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,710
even met him and I of the volatile if
ipv6

276
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:45,440
at the added number of dollars I mean
some

277
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,669
an 2015 there's many many mall
organizations

278
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:54,309
the from the Cesaire et organizations

279
00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:59,110
as have been there and the like January
Arjun that 2013

280
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:04,690
and this is not because there are so
many many many new provide us out there

281
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:07,750
the it's it's even the opposite

282
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,090
on provide us basis not an easy market

283
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:16,840
so they are providers disappearing up
buddy all other numbers hi all which

284
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,679
means

285
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,289
which is actually executed to large
enterprise organizations

286
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:26,799
are playing to provide a gay but

287
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,880
a terrorists the as we will see this
expectation

288
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,299
there are certain assumptions as to
provide a net walks which lead to sudden

289
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:35,559
behaviour on

290
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:38,820
I'm going to discuss Nalu

291
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:44,740
from you might ask a why do does so why
do day lol

292
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:48,460
why does so some I'll

293
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,870
a 5k employee organization I'll

294
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,510
from automotive what is their incentive

295
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,650
to act as a provider s just the

296
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:02,600
doing the green thing as I mentioned the
green thing as a

297
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,800
at might be tedious as people walk come

298
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,290
its a doesn't provide much flexibility

299
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:14,290
and for example and and and the

300
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:17,970
budgeted a calm space so they tell you
if yeah if you can do that

301
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:22,360
up but the the overall cost us the the

302
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,950
like him 1,600 euros

303
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:29,600
various the to cost for for for doing
this

304
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,450
this there's an initial fee of $2 K
euros and there's a yearly fee of $2 K

305
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:36,870
euros the so you're so so um

306
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:41,110
here it's just less forty-eight for 1600

307
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:44,950
and here it's a a slush at 29

308
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:49,580
I'll for all on the the initial two kN a
lot of 2k

309
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:54,200
a sudden demise of and to this is even I
i have undergone both procedures this is

310
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,160
even easier

311
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,100
to do so there's a strong centre find
the rights organizations

312
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,410
doing this aunt what is interesting

313
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:06,080
um I mean all these enterprise
organizations

314
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,520
a new member us of the aisle and

315
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:14,360
the Wesley upon our eye off

316
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,280
was striving to New to rent new office
space

317
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:23,700
and I'm saddam and to employ people and
to have political weights

318
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,740
it's so it may be a nice thing

319
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,050
to its better to have fifty came emboss
instead of having

320
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:33,070
post-game emboss like a some years ago

321
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:36,790
again I'm typing on somebody's

322
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:41,110
feet but missus

323
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:46,710
like what happens in that space right
now and I think we should know a to

324
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,740
understand the

325
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,740
the topic of to stalk is that there is
an approach on which is called

326
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,580
district filtering um

327
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:59,290
this is a initially described %uh bye
bye get some yes a goal

328
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,850
I'll which essentially goes along the
lines

329
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:07,200
we as provide us

330
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,740
to protect our investment in our

331
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,680
like road infrastructure which past
limited memory

332
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,650
and it's expensive mentally it's to
commemorate on the call you my sis

333
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:22,270
um we don't want

334
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:25,670
%uh to provide us a

335
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:31,610
to club to all our road up memory with
although if like more specifics but he

336
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:35,000
a number of smaller all its if

337
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,550
the other guy is are we gonna provide us
they have a consistent backbone

338
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:43,900
and so they can I

339
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,450
announce a for the covering agua gets

340
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:52,450
of there are um of the address space
they have been an OK tat

341
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,720
by ripe so essentially it's about

342
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,910
route filtering at the

343
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,180
transit points along the lines of K

344
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,510
if you are not a provider I expect you

345
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:09,760
to come up with you cover me echo $get
and not with more specific routes

346
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,200
which s in the

347
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,420
in the technical realities easy to do

348
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:19,920
as some this but the right space can

349
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,690
can be identified easy so if there are
some aurat

350
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:28,720
turning up from in a in a BTP exchange

351
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,390
all which is from this space one can
easily say like 0

352
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:35,780
this must be a man a route to of
Headley's

353
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,900
the 32 my arm

354
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,780
bit prefix and model longer Wong

355
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:46,670
ass if it's a longer one its it's not
the full aggregate but

356
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:49,700
like a more specific route that if the

357
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,460
thinking of this us recruit during
approach what some

358
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,910
does good reasons to do so was
essentially along the line so

359
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:01,700
the the

360
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,250
with a novel you suffer

361
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:08,590
hardware investment and there might be
an altar in the night thinking of like

362
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,730
keeping a routing table its

363
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:14,110
a tidy and clean and the

364
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:17,500
a small and have some like hierarchical
routing

365
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,820
which means even if one provider has
many customers

366
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:25,570
the this but some well oil once the
there with this

367
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,480
transit point to the Internet arm

368
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,730
well we don't want the those a small
routes the

369
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:36,230
to AP about to have a hierarchy of the

370
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:40,880
LodgeNet walks which then go to small on
that walks but the smaller netbooks are

371
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,050
not visible on the

372
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:46,380
the internet 11 that estimate approach

373
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:50,360
the thing yes the that the question

374
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,600
that we were %ah skiing when we started
we such with

375
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,620
which is the basis for this talk loss

376
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,740
khomeini

377
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:04,170
providers actually do this so close
right for the ring

378
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:09,590
is that many if it just is it just a few
as said he ate the

379
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,730
arm that arrive 5532

380
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:17,030
document seems to imply and what is the
impacts

381
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:21,740
on actual enterprise-level ipv6
deployment

382
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:25,980
and the the reason why we are asking
this

383
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,030
was mainly because some

384
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:33,080
II with quickly percent to two case
studies profile

385
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,160
customer so far so both have authorized
in Britain %uh

386
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,540
that we we can use them as examples

387
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:45,490
us this is a hot topic and it's an
important topic other Force 1s in this a

388
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,940
media organization

389
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:50,630
arm that's it its huge organization

390
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:54,090
that's the only reason why a provides
numb us this is not like this at the

391
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,100
small

392
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:59,330
shop somewhere in the in the middle of
no well I'll

393
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:02,510
the produce in what

394
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:05,790
whatever I'll so it to you something as
Asian and

395
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:09,360
they've a thriving to the to bring your
own

396
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,180
to perform a transition to ipv6 those
guys

397
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:17,740
HBM they have free may not they to send
us and POF

398
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:22,720
throughout Germany I'll all that they're
on the puck infrastructure with their

399
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,630
own

400
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:26,640
uplink a and saw today arm

401
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,220
good an experience like citizens Cindy
and the

402
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:35,400
a it did Walt pops it's an enterprise
organization

403
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,800
and as pretty much every enterprise
organization they have stateful

404
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,730
firewalls

405
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:43,210
and you might already see where this is
going

406
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:47,700
it's a media organization so for them
ipv6 is important

407
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:52,510
and some days started our committee s

408
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:56,940
early quickly faced a question doesn't
make too

409
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:01,330
which of those POF actually to take and
they decided to go this route

410
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:05,960
s pretty much assess at all
organizations at least in the this place

411
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,240
that we work to do

412
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,360
so they got an address space allocation
they became lol

413
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,480
a at the time on this was before

414
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,520
arrive was handing out to is less 29
some so they they

415
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,530
got us less likely to and given they
have free more or less independent data

416
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,880
centers in part for Germany they split
it

417
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,020
this last 32

418
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:34,490
in false lash I'm 30 foster full

419
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:37,460
from the address set plan

420
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,210
exercise a

421
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:43,520
sold assess what India the

422
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,750
times I early age would use is called a
more specific if

423
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:51,500
form one of the Fox they announce this
last 30 far-out

424
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,970
instead of tea author less 32 the whole
address space

425
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:59,150
it's called the most Pacific and I

426
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:02,360
boom that's exactly what happened a

427
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:07,580
in them unique data center not there are
still in turn it up playing some

428
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:11,790
from one our German tr1

429
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:16,390
provide ID is: from a I'll

430
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:20,290
boissiere the Munich local

431
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:23,970
like a city provide out but that they
have a number of fun

432
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:28,260
the custom us hold a well known and A&M
uni Gary L

433
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:32,300
and one say I saw that there is less
likely fall

434
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:37,460
a boom it was felt that on the uplink
for the exact the problem

435
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:41,090
apparently the uplink come provide our

436
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:44,670
had to implement its rich history arm

437
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,980
now day they could solve this by phone
call

438
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:52,110
I V Day a customer and given that I saw
was the day I would cost a lot

439
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:56,360
so it was like loci cell why do you love
feat Errol

440
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:01,610
my route announcement and then yeah I
okay we love we understand you need this

441
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,290
so we we will be will

442
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:07,720
from the to resource the situation

443
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,770
but this still does left the

444
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:15,180
a very bad feeling like okay now we
could solve it by phone call as we had a

445
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,520
dire a custom us

446
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:22,040
%uh this provide what about the next one
in the chain

447
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,340
are well we are not die a custom us
while we had a customer so another for a

448
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:25,780
wide

449
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:31,050
if they perform sick filtering I'll

450
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:35,220
we won't be able to reach it obviously
want to which will

451
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,280
from certain part of the Internet and

452
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:43,380
the as we all know I mean it's a and and
and the price base a an interface that

453
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,860
too but it's it's all about business and
a

454
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:50,860
their main concern was what happens if
one of our sea level a sec assists

455
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:54,130
apostle says summer holiday somewhere

456
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:57,810
it's a part of love your up and

457
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:01,070
a is an able to access the he saw the
emails

458
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:05,650
ass on local provide I N say booed up
ashlar about this

459
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:09,410
a provided as is actually performers for
territory

460
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:13,830
soul that didn't exactly leave the

461
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:17,780
good aftertaste the other arm case study
is

462
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:23,310
a I wanna come so it's all the sole or
whatever and they're so that's ok I am

463
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,480
which was involved in this

464
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,060
some at the other 26 summit I want to
kiss the usual innovation

465
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,340
it's a chemical that they have been at
iasis with 15

466
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,440
they even have like 10 the

467
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,559
a service organization a father which is
a legal entity in itself

468
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,920
for providing IT services as number of
by without organizations actually half

469
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,870
and what they did they have from

470
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:52,850
to you main European data send us
actually it's

471
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:56,340
Franklin St this is not like Andy a
cover up to

472
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:59,660
to information and they start at

473
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:03,480
there are 36 efforts early to the

474
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,750
serious at Fox and Beck unlike 2013

475
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:10,059
and came up with a friend um address the
sign

476
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:13,740
with going well for global address space

477
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:18,280
only if throughout the whole
organization don't use you'll us

478
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,740
that is our approach and I've member I'm
pretty much favor of that approach i

479
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,970
think is a very good approach

480
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:28,169
as it simplifies the the

481
00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:30,720
nothing so and it the white says

482
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,919
address selection a problem to the best
possible the way to hafez few addresses

483
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:35,740
as possible

484
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,770
the only thing was wait a second

485
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:42,700
chemical industry but they have like ICS
systems

486
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,270
they don't want those systems to be
which were from the internet

487
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:51,539
so how would you prevent that if you
have a globally which will address is 40

488
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:52,020
out

489
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:56,419
your whole organization there are three
main approach us fastest restoring

490
00:30:56,419 --> 00:30:59,830
at every at Shelagh filled the certain

491
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:04,279
like identified assigned a certain %uh
the sudden addresses to

492
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:08,309
um ICS systems and felt that does

493
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:13,429
at all your network bought us um a

494
00:31:13,429 --> 00:31:17,140
by the way this is not a a very long
talk I will be done like in 15 minutes

495
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:17,590
some

496
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:21,309
are a

497
00:31:21,309 --> 00:31:26,279
trade that also dress s

498
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:29,429
all on eroding level it's much

499
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:32,620
smocked are then idola why

500
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:36,649
announce a full address space for the
outside world just pick some

501
00:31:36,649 --> 00:31:41,059
some less like slash forty eight spot
the empty net walks and announce dose

502
00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:44,809
you don't want to be a new you don't
want to hold that but we we trouble

503
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:50,029
another approach um which we see it
calmly discuss the surface of my routing

504
00:31:50,029 --> 00:31:56,470
identify your ICS networks assign a
sudden address President on it he does

505
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:59,500
and some

506
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,549
then another all-out

507
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:06,130
this address space and all your boss so
it's it's a

508
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:09,710
a while it so you announce see full
address space still once a

509
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:13,620
traffic comes in %uh the on the running
never drop it

510
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:17,990
I'll when entering a network and a
decided for this

511
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:22,039
the approach that we call the selective
announcement

512
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:25,510
just-announced pot sa VIN that walks

513
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,760
routing Weiss problem you can already
see what is going

514
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,390
that till main carry us

515
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:35,450
which %uh ball far

516
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:37,610
I'll one that one is in European

517
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:41,660
tl1 the ATO is some a very large German

518
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:45,020
arm carry a expect Epps

519
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,560
them to announce a full Agra gets

520
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:52,220
as opposed to like that just sayin set
of

521
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:56,640
a routing Weiss announces less
forty-eight announce a slush 22

522
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,020
which meant it could happy

523
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:04,030
traffic leaving from Frank prompt coming
back for a lesson

524
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:08,040
weights I mean they have fatal fire was
everybody has a profile was

525
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:12,090
which would cause a problem in that case
it was like him

526
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:15,100
they somebody with the worry a clutch

527
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,730
there we solve this they had an MPLS
layup be fought a play a waltz

528
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:23,000
so on that MPs layup but they could to

529
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,490
like road traffic from left to the to
ride the

530
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:29,740
those awful Frankfurt 2s nor the other
way

531
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,910
the only problem was well one side

532
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:36,090
the again I'm in in the %uh

533
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:40,600
space are not violating a NDA someone
side I was assessed as quiet sauce

534
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,080
on the other side I was a Cisco 27

535
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,350
the 72 2006 11:09 p.m.

536
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:53,740
g1 and now you have to implement an
additional routing

537
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:57,040
lay are they are running OSPF arm

538
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,820
get might know what is going on always
PF for

539
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:05,000
the barf have are always PS we free

540
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,579
i doing always PF in a VRF

541
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:12,250
is not fully supported in Cisco space in
our platform

542
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,790
on the seventy the

543
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:19,430
2006 it's not which means

544
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:22,660
they had to come up with a clutch some
doing

545
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,399
the

546
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:27,089
citing routing on one site on a Monday
to send the setting writing which they

547
00:34:27,089 --> 00:34:28,440
had to we distribute

548
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,089
and this leave work that that's not what
you want

549
00:34:32,089 --> 00:34:36,629
but they couldn't replace like they had
a budget at fighting replacing dollars a

550
00:34:36,629 --> 00:34:37,539
72

551
00:34:37,539 --> 00:34:41,519
all six or so adjust for the ipv6
transition project

552
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:45,559
and they had expected these problems
there where we had like I mean really if

553
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:49,769
they are customer who are so so we had
discussions Mb we said don't know to be

554
00:34:49,769 --> 00:34:50,889
very careful

555
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:54,309
I'll talk to you provide us Foshan

556
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:58,319
and whatever actually in the interim be
at the checklist well which we

557
00:34:58,319 --> 00:35:02,430
from I'm willing to shot this by the way
that that checklist civil

558
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:05,819
what law school football for wider and
one of the

559
00:35:05,819 --> 00:35:09,450
when doing ipv6 a a

560
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:13,750
the which net for properties and stuff
to ask law and

561
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:17,150
this is one a high priority question in
that

562
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:21,369
question now but in the end of today it
meant to

563
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:25,059
have the addition the on operations I
fought

564
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:28,930
and a klutzy network configuration just
because

565
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:32,440
they arm those the

566
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,700
to entry let up provide us the didn't
accept our slash forty eight's

567
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,980
sold their ressa potential problem

568
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:43,880
and those of you from other enterprise
organizations you must keep this

569
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,519
potential problem in mind

570
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:48,849
the question then but that you are
asking was

571
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:52,930
is this just anecdotal evidence was it
just padlock

572
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:56,250
that the first to customers that we
actually at the at the St NW

573
00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:00,319
that we have at the in the early days
early ipv6

574
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:03,880
days like last year and the year before
going to the

575
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:09,480
a a internet if ipv6 s enterprise
organizations they stumbled into this

576
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:14,759
some trap but that's why we the army

577
00:36:14,759 --> 00:36:18,549
actively looking at routing data

578
00:36:18,549 --> 00:36:22,829
which is made available i right from
several years

579
00:36:22,829 --> 00:36:27,140
and actually the a analyze routing data
from mom

580
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:31,210
five major European I access internet
exchange point some

581
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:34,940
with respect them across a you up to
have a good to like your geographical

582
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,890
distribution

583
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:41,539
and not to have like phenomenon which
only apply like to germany out to

584
00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:45,930
to some pot of Germany pot above europe
and

585
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:50,470
what we actually did this a but the
clinton

586
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:53,640
should be get although all the routes
from

587
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,749
dollar-some in the elections points and
those are made publicly available by

588
00:36:56,749 --> 00:36:57,089
right

589
00:36:57,089 --> 00:37:01,249
it just routes it's a it's a it's not to
like home

590
00:37:01,249 --> 00:37:04,479
lenny is here information it's it's the
stuff you could see with a looking glass

591
00:37:04,479 --> 00:37:05,380
also

592
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:10,579
it's just some aggregate I look just at

593
00:37:10,579 --> 00:37:12,220
these some

594
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:15,359
space us and have a look

595
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:19,569
khomeini what is the number of prefix s
I

596
00:37:19,569 --> 00:37:24,099
prefix length that we see is a very
common

597
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:27,309
that alone is less like a 32 whose a

598
00:37:27,309 --> 00:37:31,609
are actually a routing why some with the
berlin use

599
00:37:31,609 --> 00:37:35,309
arm always that up

600
00:37:35,309 --> 00:37:38,869
as a common that likes less for forty
eight from the space

601
00:37:38,869 --> 00:37:43,390
more specifics can be seen and I would
quickly cover

602
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:48,029
color that we saw this looking at the
distribution

603
00:37:48,029 --> 00:37:52,010
of prefix lengths and this aside given

604
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:56,039
hear you one usually receives at least
as much I did too

605
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:59,400
this but can be considered like
aggregate routes

606
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,680
various everything on that and the 33

607
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:08,849
can be considered at more specific about
I'll what I can see he already year us

608
00:38:08,849 --> 00:38:12,180
the amount of my specific rots is
growing

609
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:16,500
so it seems law specifics

610
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,720
on at least they don't have the overall
VAD like him

611
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,840
aggregate routes but still arm

612
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,690
they're rolling there was some

613
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:31,570
some on %uh must assess oblivion the
space of Mah specifics

614
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:35,359
flesh 48 is the most common one I

615
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,950
and yet i want to slash forty for
reasons I might lay out

616
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:44,010
the later on all the other sonically the
other and then

617
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:47,240
I will skip this as this one is much
more

618
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:51,040
more interesting about what a
relationship

619
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,510
of are

620
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:59,130
aggregate routes which had a blue ones
and more specific routes

621
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:02,290
which are the a read once

622
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:09,170
if weekend of stuff a transfer what's
more specific routes it seems

623
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:13,660
that there are a number of provide us
accepting more specifics

624
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:18,810
the IRS if this was like increasing this
would give an indication okay it's

625
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:21,480
common practice that's right for the
ring takes place

626
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:26,770
the main question for us while was some
district retiring common practice

627
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:30,990
as then many address

628
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:34,380
assignment exercise of organizations
some

629
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:38,330
have to deal with this they have to take
this into account

630
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:42,250
they have to abandon the adjust their
like security concepts and stuff

631
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:46,070
or a half these two cases where I was in
Waltham

632
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:50,470
just been a about locking actually what
one can see

633
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:53,710
is there is some I

634
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:56,930
in the interim the number of from

635
00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:00,100
I already at the at the weights

636
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:03,480
number one that said this is not
absolute numbers

637
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,940
this is wat with a numb i do. was based
off routes

638
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:11,480
a there was a very strong trend

639
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,230
some and at this will slide is Neil I
just updated as a

640
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:18,370
last week us we have fun you a number so
right now

641
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:22,240
there is so much a higher growth rates

642
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,900
of farm ma specific routes as

643
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:30,870
oppose to I aggregate louts soul

644
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:34,200
from that angle it seems

645
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,650
there was a trend to what most Pacific
routes

646
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:41,230
which from the needs of and the price
basis

647
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:45,080
%uh the Swans like those automotive
supply us

648
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:49,620
up with stateful firewall splitting
their address place which they have for

649
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,510
their address allocation which a half or

650
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:55,050
with you from right from daring go this
is a good term

651
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:58,300
a like trent well for them

652
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:03,120
it said they didn't do not necessarily
like it as it means so carrying more all

653
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,610
its mean so

654
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:09,670
having more memory in a row to us I and
they don't get extra money for this

655
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:13,700
I mean there was a set as legitimate
reasons for provide a paper to perform

656
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,180
trick for the week well we have a

657
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:23,180
obviously a conflict of interest here
all

658
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,670
yeah

659
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:45,100
whatcha which yes and yeah it's in the
in the Long Tom be might have for like a

660
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:49,020
Tragedy of the Commons everybody just
looking at the own benefit

661
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:52,150
and overseeing that the

662
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:55,850
just looking at the on benefit and
destroy some benefit

663
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:59,830
log creates at that this ad 1 just
bought him a job for the community as a

664
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:00,420
whole

665
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:07,420
up yep

666
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,569
exactly but he actually D at the

667
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:14,339
some I would be done like and and and
and and five minutes some

668
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:18,099
at: the Papas of why I brought this

669
00:42:18,099 --> 00:42:21,940
too ripe was some I wanted to wait have
an ass

670
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:27,069
I'll for this type of problem as we had
the impression it some

671
00:42:27,069 --> 00:42:31,880
its underwriter at as for the visibility
and and provide a space

672
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:36,180
on the right community but there is no
easy solution

673
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:40,420
all weekend just so I mean we will you

674
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:43,700
well like okay let's let's have a look
what are the actual number us

675
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,710
without having statistical data an
actual number us

676
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:50,599
most discussions are a bit waken that
don't make sense

677
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:55,210
funnily enough after the after I
presentation you might we call this that

678
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:56,150
was on the

679
00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:01,999
on a in there will know there was a the
main scientist from that they could

680
00:43:01,999 --> 00:43:04,150
shove use neighborhood so prolific

681
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:08,289
guy when it comes to overall the routing

682
00:43:08,289 --> 00:43:11,390
Internet routing statistics and
developments the South

683
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:15,210
a and he is a a bit bluntly set

684
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:18,730
well that problem that you're describing

685
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:23,089
that's not a problem the market will
solve this so money with salt us

686
00:43:23,089 --> 00:43:26,190
level one source enterprise
organizations so willing to pay

687
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:30,579
arm I'll which have as a commercial
relationship

688
00:43:30,579 --> 00:43:34,150
with that provide us so to provide us
are willing to accept whatever types of

689
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:34,690
routes

690
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:39,829
not to lose a customer in the end of the
day it will be like a

691
00:43:39,829 --> 00:43:42,270
distribution and we will c e-mail

692
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:45,470
many the more specifics

693
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:52,470
as some money makes the world go round

694
00:43:58,099 --> 00:44:05,099
yeah

695
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:22,630
yeah

696
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:15,680
yeah

697
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:27,470
yeah

698
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:36,540
yeah rocking slot let's call it a about
all

699
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:43,540
annual

700
00:45:59,509 --> 00:46:06,509
1

701
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:13,720
me

702
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:19,940
people

703
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:26,940
here

704
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:53,290
yeah

705
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,790
yet but how would you with the why would
you do that

706
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:12,790
now it's not a not easily

707
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:52,060
all

708
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:58,820
up

709
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:04,869
you

710
00:48:04,869 --> 00:48:11,869
all

711
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:23,750
for yeah it's as some

712
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:28,570
it's a it's a complicated problem space
arm

713
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:32,560
I won't the going to the like positions

714
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:36,540
and reasons and so on as this is a huge
debate in itself

715
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:41,710
which has been going on for a long time
I we conclude that talk here

716
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:45,490
well with a simple I am

717
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:50,810
summary that goes like if you on
enterprise organization

718
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:53,810
which decide at

719
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:57,170
for this way of

720
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:00,690
by getting an IP the six address space
allocation

721
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:04,450
you must be a fairer up to potential
problem

722
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:09,240
which could arise from for territory the
problem

723
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:14,400
its their excess we have the impression

724
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,119
that there was the

725
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:22,299
every quarter of when we look at a date
are it's less provide us doing its

726
00:49:22,299 --> 00:49:26,529
so the problem seems to go away it seem
so

727
00:49:26,529 --> 00:49:29,880
go along the lines of job you send the
market where we South this

728
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,829
we will see more specifics as to
customers demand for this

729
00:49:33,829 --> 00:49:38,339
as still the interesting thing I said
get us some

730
00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:42,440
cautious here the we have them the SCN
ball for this is some

731
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:47,109
another innovation which has apparently
stops rate filtering

732
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:50,740
a in the mid of 2014 until then

733
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:57,329
I they had to approve a very fuel more
specifics probably die like us most of

734
00:49:57,329 --> 00:49:57,910
them

735
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:02,450
and from one day to the other side I
mean we only looked at the quarter data

736
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:07,010
a they had lots of ma specifics of all
types

737
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:11,260
a so that they apparently a um change
the policy

738
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:15,500
we have in another example unfortunately
from

739
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,670
a a mile on a

740
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:23,009
Milan and Exchange I I won't give you
the ASTM I don't have in my head anyway

741
00:50:23,009 --> 00:50:26,490
but that doesn't these guys apparently a
look at this

742
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:30,390
until a end of 2014 arm

743
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:33,769
in there was a number of more specifics
and

744
00:50:33,769 --> 00:50:38,039
especially in the high number for forty
eight's and they went back

745
00:50:38,039 --> 00:50:41,500
apparently this so seems to indicate
that they applies for

746
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:45,200
you doing up from one day to the other I
have no idea why

747
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:50,410
on that be let out there might be a
problem

748
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:54,480
that must be taking into account and

749
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:59,349
the there was no easy solution what we
strongly we comments

750
00:50:59,349 --> 00:51:02,430
is set to things to end up prices

751
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:05,859
fast the discuss this with your

752
00:51:05,859 --> 00:51:10,859
a carry us in advance do not want to
into the situation

753
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:13,980
a run into a situation like him and 1a
going into

754
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:18,619
that they had a certain well-thought-out
address concept and at some point in

755
00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:19,480
time now to

756
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:23,059
reality doesn't allow this awesome fast

757
00:51:23,059 --> 00:51:26,560
do your homework this is some we the

758
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:31,480
the like a check list so we we developed
in 10 for our custom environment some

759
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,510
it's all intellectual property I can
chat this

760
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:36,680
just open a menu with that this I

761
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:41,040
which I asked a number of questions the
like him not just that

762
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:45,750
okay DOD of linker you tell us you
support I V six nice

763
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:49,420
but to tell us about the properties of
the after solace

764
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:53,620
that we will get from you and here was a
like there was a high priority question

765
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:58,520
I providers willing to accept ipv6
prefix advertisements from

766
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:03,000
PA space up to slash forty eight about
covering aggravate provided to their

767
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:03,760
with the

768
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,950
the former week why a man which has to
be there the appropriate so-called

769
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:08,580
erotic subject this

770
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:13,140
again as a yes or no end to it has the
highest weight a soft this some

771
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:16,960
thing %uh do this whole walk

772
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,050
and we'd in general weary commands

773
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:26,450
if you can that at that the right
meeting I didn't really get to that

774
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:27,520
point some

775
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:32,080
as: I had limited speaking time there in
that was so quite some discussion in the

776
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:32,500
end

777
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:35,810
I we have wanted to propose

778
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:38,880
a.k.a a a compromise between those

779
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:43,410
guys wanting to consult their autumn
Emily and those guys wanting to announce

780
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,300
more specifics

781
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,730
a potential compromise could be well

782
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:52,480
