1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,280
one to everyone armies to another long

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,609
and I will be presenting a new features
in a SA-six networks

3
00:00:07,609 --> 00:00:11,540
a I 36 a talkin a

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,330
ascendant about myself won't security

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,670
for SA-six networks I'm like a very
active that the ATF

6
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,000
a working on this standardization of the
number protocols

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,859
but focusing a lot on ipv6 I have a

8
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:30,580
quite a few like TV Internet Draft there
and summary system

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,910
a I'm the author of the still get the

10
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:38,489
about which I'm going to present new
features I'm also the

11
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:41,800
list that me in the six helpers mean is
that you're prolly

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,760
subscribe to I'll their

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,570
more and publications

14
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,739
one in my website dislike very they did

15
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,340
so to speak the

16
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,900
mmm so what is this presentation a lot
it's about

17
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,390
reasonable that a from get them some

18
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,970
I which for me kinda like describes a

19
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,610
sum up their presentations that I do but
at times you get to spend a lot of time

20
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,170
on

21
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,830
on on different things it could be like
a standard tool or something

22
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,670
and at times it's nice to you know to
explain what you need to

23
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,750
colleagues I am something to show the
reasons

24
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,310
it working a

25
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,960
official or trying to explain 1 million
what you need

26
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,369
but also the same time because usually
you can you know get feedback from

27
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:34,290
colleagues

28
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,399
and that kills you know improve your
improve your work

29
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:40,580
so the stock is essentially about new
features

30
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:45,960
in the SA-six no worse ipv6 talkin stuff
that will not be called weren't

31
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,630
vision is anything related to the World
Cup I'm from Argentina

32
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:53,180
it was like a very sad the year next
year a

33
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,289
I already got jokes from a No when I
heard

34
00:01:56,289 --> 00:01:57,280
here

35
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,440
so I'm not going to talk about will in
the whole week

36
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,740
it was already very sad your last year
so forget

37
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:08,869
a you will like it soul

38
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:13,180
%uh I think I know introduction assay
said before

39
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,430
the season presentation about new
features in the ipv6 token

40
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,290
as a brief history or of it us a brief
description of this token

41
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,000
Anna this book it was originally
produced as part of Prussia

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,420
know they was working on for the
undergoing

43
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,780
defence organisation in the UK many
years ago I

44
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,370
and maintenance an extension was taken
over my

45
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,920
me for SA-six network on a funny story

46
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,420
regard in that book and what's that it
worse wall

47
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,680
it originally was intended to be
formally released a net loss

48
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,209
I will house I was once talking with
your colleague and his colleague told me

49
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:53,360
will but it will get his

50
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,600
publicly available as you know we never
released it yes

51
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,280
eights public no it's not this its
public no it's not and apparently some

52
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,640
company decided they like it will give
them the post it online

53
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,269
so pass away in that have been released
which

54
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:10,610
I am on one hand they say where that was
some pork late

55
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,980
but I'll on the other side of things the
no that'll keep

56
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,530
leaked out a honey what really somehow
already

57
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,630
than I gave me the chance to actually
take

58
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,209
what was supposed to be like a like it
private Russian

59
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:28,180
and a you know make improvements and be
able to release

60
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,280
those improvements but that's like a
funny story of somehow how the first

61
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,160
version of the

62
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,860
all of the building was really so we
didn't release did the first version of

63
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,420
the talking wasn't released by us

64
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,990
so to speak I

65
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,010
I'm us the business

66
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,640
channel they'll also be so dokie it's
essentially to get

67
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,810
for security analysis and
troubleshooting of ipv6 networks and

68
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:51,660
implementations

69
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,800
is not really a not that Tolkien so you
can use this tool kit for many other

70
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,270
things

71
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:01,080
other than a docs like for example
problem should be network I

72
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,170
among the goals was to have green pool
table and secure goal

73
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,860
to the extent that I that was possible
and that's not because a

74
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,210
really wanted that to be the case but a
since these wheels dawn

75
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,220
as part of your project for that
organization

76
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,270
we couldn't really like you know she
crop corn

77
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:21,049
that doesn't mean that the code is as
good as it should be but let's say we we

78
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:22,500
intended to go to the

79
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,540
miss a the decent to some extent

80
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,830
on there are some things that we need
for example which I i

81
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,210
think nice the bills for example the
tools for many things they need like

82
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,690
superuser privileges but the release
those super usurping Malaysia's

83
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,180
as soon as they are not needed anymore
and that's something that you know what

84
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,610
I was exploring security tools he's got
like

85
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,460
a Missy ironic but ma security to the
our security tools

86
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,870
by the times they are in all accordion
music you ways solo so they've

87
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,340
security do that you're prolly are using
every day the run

88
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,790
us rule for their know for the whole
life even when the only that

89
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,800
so that someone you know the the bills
that we were playing pay attention to

90
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,870
I am also we try to produce good
documentation

91
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,370
boy the most boring and PD sparkle

92
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,440
working on the book in is writing the
documentation

93
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,310
even more snowfall the you know the
first month in patients were like that

94
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:22,390
txt your PDF documents and then when we
tried to know

95
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,430
produce like a package we'd had to
compare that to the

96
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:29,070
drawl for groff or whatever you want to
call it them on page 41

97
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:33,670
we cheese for me from not then I think
to spend my time on

98
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,979
but a

99
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:38,380
when I look at them on patient on a
special pic

100
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,470
where the share of time on the Monon
preciso please with them

101
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,250
look for the 10 patients themselves one
because we spent a lot of time on that

102
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:51,270
I am continuing with the introduction of
the token

103
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,350
I'll we originally tried to support at
least

104
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:57,389
all their BS these are the most popular
be as the Sun Linux

105
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:01,300
then we incorporate in Mac OS I mean
these last release

106
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:06,440
we incorporated now OpenSolaris probably
if you have not been calling

107
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,340
late lately same love that these guys
talking crap I mean these are all a

108
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,680
unix-like systems

109
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,130
is probably like a piece of case do this
it should

110
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:19,229
but in practice is it's not so when you
are calling the toll sometimes you have

111
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:21,849
to you know reorder the way in which
include the

112
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:25,669
know like the include files there are
some functions that are supported by one

113
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:27,740
operating system by not buy another

114
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,780
it with my co s first of all I don't
pick up in mock

115
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,410
myself so that means that they have to
have someone else try to compile the

116
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:36,430
balls and run them

117
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,680
and the report errors he and I try to
fix the errors we know we don't even

118
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,889
been able to trade at myself but my by
from Uppal do

119
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:49,289
you know funny things like they have
berchenall it's a 1.4 which supports

120
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:49,800
something

121
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,960
bushel 1.5 then removed that's a poor
Vishal 1.6

122
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,990
the include that support again so it's
like a plane

123
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:02,039
a it's a pain and support in open
Solaris was a little bit of pain to

124
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:05,690
and the but you know to some extent that
up

125
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,949
support multiple operating systems I
think that you know they

126
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:11,970
helps too nor improve the improve the
call

127
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,740
I I wish which that's the case at least
I

128
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,780
the license of this book is its GPO is
free software

129
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,569
there's a git repository for the docket
and the

130
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:27,990
yeah so that the combination to git
repository I am

131
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:32,199
some comments how well you know what
that they the idea behind it again

132
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:35,400
usually people you know when be done a
little kid

133
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,889
and they try to run some to land the see
that you know that boo

134
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:42,830
things will you have not supplied these
are that information and they get

135
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,949
extremely frustrated 'em up

136
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:48,990
to some extent thats intended so

137
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,220
this book it is not meant for you to
just run some command

138
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,449
and you know how did tools perform some
sort of attack that you don't understand

139
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:59,659
but direct but actually it's kinda like
meant to be

140
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:02,639
I need to freeze between you want in an
hour or so if you know what you're doing

141
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,550
the duke it is going to be helpful

142
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,940
if you have no clue about what you're
doing and try to run the tools

143
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,250
prolly with most of them you're not
going to be able to do much

144
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,400
okay I at some point we

145
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,860
and unfortunately you know when you
spend time on or on on called

146
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,030
I mean it's always nice to have people
you said

147
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:25,300
so we have been having like an internal
debate are regarding whether we should

148
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,659
include some sort of

149
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:31,620
a robbers I like you know Asquith Katie
versions of the tools I with the

150
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,729
less a more popular commands so I am

151
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:38,570
so far we haven't but I I mean
eventually we would prolly do that

152
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:43,360
some what else so when it comes to the

153
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,029
tools the survey tools that are
currently supported by the

154
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:50,520
but it will give with many of the
schools they are tools

155
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,890
that you know it's actually a lil you do
send specific

156
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:57,370
pockets so for example if you take a
look at PCB

157
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:02,649
6 would its obviously it all that I love
you too thin 93 TCP segments

158
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:05,760
a on top of ipv6 packets so

159
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,360
in Essex is for neighbor solicitations
in my 64 never other ties mens

160
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,680
and so on and there are a few other two
we'd probably perform like a more

161
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,370
complete

162
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:19,060
complex it does or you could think of
them more of a

163
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,800
us applications examples got six is
another risk under

164
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,290
I am on their own like

165
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:30,520
policies he said tool for analyzing ipv6
addresses and so on

166
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,589
I'll be so the the other tools

167
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:36,900
that the toolkit has and

168
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,589
I'm going to press and you know what

169
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:43,920
we have incorporated mean version 2.0 of
the dog in

170
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,790
actually decide only any I using but
another she's

171
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:53,260
version 2.0 could be like I if you like
guns and roses

172
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,850
this could be like Chinese Democracy
soul which means that the

173
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:01,660
it was the day for a long time on prolly
should come more stuff that he fasts

174
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,949
but whatever it is what it is so you
could find like in the same way that the

175
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:05,959
Chinese Democracy

176
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:09,709
gun ball if I like a couple songs that
are okay well the same thing here

177
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:13,000
we have a couple of you feature that
okay the other ones

178
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,730
well whatever I am overview

179
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,210
so what's new

180
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,270
in this new version first the fall

181
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:25,780
lot of bug fixes so this is the kind of
thing that I don't know if your pro

182
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,420
to say because if you fix it a lot of
stuff that means that hot stuff was

183
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:29,980
broken

184
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,730
but a through these that lot of stuff
was fixin

185
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,920
its extremely like painful to

186
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,550
you know work on tools that some a

187
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,860
let's say that are able to deal with a
b-tree

188
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,040
ipv6 packets and the reason for that is
that

189
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,650
you need to operate update letelier
essentially so for example if I wanted

190
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:55,160
if I want to be little that since the
lissy and ICMP packet

191
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,170
in practice what they need to do is bill
everything from the league player

192
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:03,950
up to that ICMP layer so I need to be
able to hold the packets nope

193
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:07,260
need I need to know on which interface
to send the packet and so on

194
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,700
for many reasons one of them is that the
you know in

195
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,700
the support that BC us for raw sockets I
it's kinda like cropping for example you

196
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,220
cannot

197
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,320
of ipv6 addresses unreasonable table way

198
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,340
so if you want to support ipv6 addresses

199
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,820
you have to produce a legally or pocket
and that means that

200
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:30,440
essentially you have to you know that
essentially called an entire ipv6

201
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,760
a stock inside your tool soul

202
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,310
eventually will thinking well I already
the neighbor discovery I already did

203
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,800
this should be a really

204
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,190
you know the their routine par so I
prolly could like

205
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:47,190
no start my my embedded operating system
or something that I would be six

206
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,830
it's not that I like it but I it was
painful I'm not to mention of course

207
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:51,180
that

208
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:55,850
scenes usually I have to deal with the
internals of the phone operating systems

209
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:59,560
obviously every operating system the
things in a different way

210
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,680
up so they will so many of the fixes
have to do with that

211
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,200
I

212
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,579
we also included support for OpenSolaris

213
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:14,260
if you ask me I I don't think I could
provide like a good result for support

214
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,980
in OpenSSL Heights Justin

215
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,600
I I guess that probably the only
motivation is to make the call more

216
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,370
portable

217
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:25,480
and that's it I balls that are new in
this version of the tool kit

218
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,500
as critics black hole 6

219
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,500
unit b6 I think for 6 that I'm going to
presently there is new to

220
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,519
and there are new features in different
tools such a scene will there was a TCP

221
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,050
62

222
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:42,170
for playing with the b-segment because
additional features on

223
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:46,010
that's also the case for its gone six I

224
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:50,999
okay so let's start with others coming I

225
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:54,689
Bali if you got this gun seeks scanner
that we have in these

226
00:12:54,689 --> 00:12:59,279
in the stupid you the most comprehensive
others can hear that you will find

227
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,850
probably not because I mean we'd be the
next really good job but actually

228
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,769
because when you look at all the area
other

229
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:09,399
you know all this coming tools the
Arnold the so much

230
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:12,649
elaborated I am previous versions of

231
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:15,870
scum six cool ready for example you
could build into

232
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:19,370
arm exploit like its specific Potter you
know this is

233
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:23,470
on the tool will do that and what we
need in this version of the police

234
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,519
a you know incorporating like a feature
that us out the mother goddess cunning

235
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,040
so what they told us is if for example
if you provide

236
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,189
I am the door with a domain name

237
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:37,649
on an ipv6 address they do without them
I think we analyze that

238
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:40,990
others and will try to infer what the
potter

239
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:44,600
that is being used by that iris I'm not
only target that I miss Potter

240
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,689
okay I some

241
00:13:47,689 --> 00:13:51,449
so this is the way in which you could
run the ball

242
00:13:51,449 --> 00:13:54,639
for use in the out of money a smart
scanning

243
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,709
essentially just provide a domain name
on

244
00:13:57,709 --> 00:14:01,279
by specifying slash 64 that means that
you want to target

245
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,499
were are you gonna just specify an ipv6
address

246
00:14:04,499 --> 00:14:11,240
on ya specified that he's a slash 64 the

247
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,959
as I said before if you that

248
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,620
they we target their specific

249
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:22,680
Respir being employed but that site
let's see if we can make the swine

250
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:29,680
here

251
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:40,630
I'll

252
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,260
been so for example if everything works
fine

253
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,560
we could do something like some

254
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:21,560
saying

255
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,900
so for example what I did I didn't know
that I stop the tool

256
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,920
you know me one I Anne no use

257
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,620
let me try to explain the so that its
easier to see

258
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,780
okay I'll

259
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:43,280
so lazy they specify the miss this again

260
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:50,280
some ok

261
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,650
so I just elected some domain name okay

262
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:58,480
the or and indeed all automatically
analyzes the other spider

263
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,800
that you know that the main thing us and
then only

264
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,270
targets that part of the other space so
in this case you can see that

265
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:10,980
I on the top these try and I we call
small white out missus

266
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,190
which means that it twice number seen on
the last couple

267
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,630
is 16 beat worse grace small numbers

268
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:23,610
if you go to list saying let's try
something else

269
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:30,370
say

270
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:37,370
ok

271
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,130
so if you don't hear you good you know
the

272
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:51,490
pattern that at least right now there
the okay

273
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,500
and that's the case essentially with
every domain that you've been a worse a

274
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:55,950
little bit

275
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:00,680
for my connection to the system is a
little bit slow but essentially

276
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:07,680
no the bottom line

277
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:12,880
the bottom line is that you know by
specifying a domain name

278
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,720
or an ipv6 address on this last 64 they
do can automatically detect

279
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,010
what what the other is pattern that he
should target in previous versions

280
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:26,699
we headed to other six we'd good help
you to identify the other spider

281
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:29,960
but you had to I listed

282
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,000
that you have to specify the other spot
in yourself so you have to grab the iris

283
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,280
run out 621 allies the address and then
you know

284
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,780
in with the appropriate information
blues classics so with these version of

285
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,840
it all you don't even need to do that
they told us

286
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,170
that monthly of course what they told us
he's gonna like we use the code

287
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:53,039
that we use for the other two logistics
I

288
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,049
port scanning his version of little kid
we

289
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:59,250
I did some where we incorporated some
you know basic

290
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:04,309
a.m. the CBN you to be forthcoming so if
you employ these

291
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:09,230
a option what can you can select for
example whether you want this gun PCP

292
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:09,649
for

293
00:18:09,649 --> 00:18:12,960
or you sleepy port on the ADA's simple

294
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,019
you can specify lol the protocol on a
you know a poor range

295
00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:21,679
are you can also specify it bc in the
case of the CB DSO

296
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,240
you can specify the PCB scum by okay

297
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,129
I us a brief remindful he said you an
example

298
00:18:29,129 --> 00:18:32,590
right in this case we have the we are 55

299
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:36,649
that we want for PCB boards on the range
from 1

300
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:40,750
21 full Sun 24 understand type is going
to be late C

301
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:45,029
it seems that wayne's this donation
they're not doing the full thing we can

302
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:45,470
shake

303
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:49,029
but just sentencing packets I'm waiting
for the for the response

304
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:52,269
I think I know overview because I'll

305
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:55,500
is going to be useful for some more than
a few slight

306
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,149
the cease TCP connection establishment
in in New chill

307
00:18:59,149 --> 00:19:02,860
so to speak so if the city halls you
want to scan

308
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,809
when it connects Chinese its you know
when police opened and you're able to

309
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:07,919
establish a connection

310
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:14,919
what happens is that them this year

311
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,790
the senate seen packing Hyundai you be
serious enough bucket

312
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:25,130
from the target system the BB typically

313
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,400
few I am see if you do with traditional
connects them

314
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,910
that you want to you don't perform the
full three when can shake

315
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:35,490
which is still so usually would you will
do is just

316
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:39,150
his first two buckets and that it was
cool it seems can

317
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,210
which means you see you said seen
packing to the target

318
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:46,360
this cost you wait for their response
you may see this enough which is this

319
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:46,830
market

320
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:51,549
that means that the port is open any
feel but you see the reset

321
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:55,280
them is that the parties close I

322
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,990
when it comes to the clinics can which
means use in the fall three-way

323
00:19:58,990 --> 00:19:59,710
handshake

324
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,970
that you know port scanning technique
these

325
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:07,760
snow I because he'd requires you you
know two exchanged all three packets

326
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,570
and at the same time it's also to
something on this are able

327
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:14,809
because since you establish the full
connection that means that the

328
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:16,270
application on the other in

329
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:20,010
gets to know that you try to connect to
it so we didn't actually

330
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:24,210
you implement this in its gone six so I
don't think there's like it but in

331
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,980
recent for which you use a pool

332
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:30,210
a connects can there this is gone

333
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:33,720
which is the one that I was mentioning
before I which is quite simple

334
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,929
use anything but good shown here and the
way for the response

335
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:41,970
if you get a snack it means the port is
open you get it

336
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:45,470
and every said that means the police
close he's fast

337
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:49,230
I in icing is that he doesn't dietary
sources

338
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:52,840
on your N and the reason for that is
that we are supporting the packets

339
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,110
so that means that whenever we send a
scene packet to the other in

340
00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:01,120
I we are not buying any resources on a
worm on local system so we could be like

341
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,110
no scanning like also love those on some
or to the same point in time

342
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:09,960
and that doesn't I resources a million
little on this is something that we

343
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,790
implement the

344
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:15,100
this concept there is also always call
the female

345
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,600
No

346
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,000
and no Christmas scans I these

347
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,510
the techniques the dawn and they don't
require you to

348
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:26,300
you know perform the full the weekend
shake I

349
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:30,020
essentially they doin send the packet
without the akc

350
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:33,530
beats it one day specifications say

351
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,980
is that the forties close it you're
going to we see the reset

352
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,040
honey the police open you're not going
to receive anything

353
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,630
and there's going to be a timeout okay I

354
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,630
is rather slow because he knows is one
of the options

355
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:50,950
is that you're going to get a time out I
you need to wait for some period of time

356
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:54,280
a supposed to just been able to no react
to any response

357
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,370
in the case of this scene attack in the
case of this seems gun

358
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:01,320
you get this not or you get it i reset
so one way or another wrestler who

359
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,700
received a package you know whether the
police open or close

360
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,950
use case you the if you don't receive
anything

361
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:10,580
you still need to wait a we have
implemented

362
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:15,390
these a all these discuss the Knicks if
you wonder why

363
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:18,770
you know it's cold feet no Christmas
scans

364
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,790
all the sexually they are actually the
same thing his

365
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:26,840
not very much documented so years ago
when I was trained to look a lot of

366
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,720
things related to

367
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,550
the CB I had to dig into this the time I
expected that these things were totally

368
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,300
different but they

369
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,720
idea these freeze current techniques

370
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,260
is that the %ah the ok be is not ted he
feels gun

371
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:47,150
the FB is not set but you send be in the
case of the North gun

372
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:51,140
there's no wheat said on the quiz master

373
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:54,570
gun would you said teammates on

374
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:58,310
there was some other beat it but there
could be other options like for example

375
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:02,280
I sitting beats that are related with
ECan

376
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,430
like explicit congestion notification
which

377
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:09,200
don't have like a specific name but
daily variations of

378
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,470
of the same scanning techniques I'll

379
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:20,470
this scene

380
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:35,320
some

381
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,020
so in this case a man running the you
know the port scanner

382
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:11,990
on at the time they were that they have
in my computer be so their results that

383
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,430
you get like pretty similar to what you
getting

384
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:17,640
ima okay so far the only

385
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,750
can be when it comes to

386
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,009
the use of course cunning in this
context all

387
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:26,539
is that right now at this point in time
it supports cunning

388
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:30,039
a single ipv6 address okay so that means
that

389
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:34,029
you should write if you want to list the
poor scan of a lot of systems

390
00:24:34,029 --> 00:24:37,899
you should first runs can six for
finding the ally not

391
00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:42,059
and then you should find another usual
run another instance of gone six

392
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:45,659
to oppose gun all each of those ipv6
address

393
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:48,840
in the next version my idea is to

394
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:53,169
I am no be able to support its gonna
warn people

395
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:56,330
your sis doing a post gonna what people
see them at the same time

396
00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:00,419
the only tricky part is that if you are
scanning a local sequencing bottle

397
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:04,120
you kind of need to reorder the response
is that you get

398
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,490
a because you're scanning everything in
violent but of course when you bring the

399
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:09,330
three souls

400
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:12,480
on the screen you want them to the order
okay

401
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,340
so that's the tricky part I ball such
just in my

402
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:20,470
us want to recall what they do is they
consume quite a lot of memory

403
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:24,379
because for each system that they are
scanning be we see our resources on the

404
00:25:24,379 --> 00:25:25,190
local system

405
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:29,450
and that's exactly what I don't want to
do okay not because it but but actually

406
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,210
because it requires a lot of memory

407
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:34,570
so where they are you really like kinda
like sketch

408
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:37,500
the the way in which and you know I'm
going to implement the these but the

409
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,399
idea is that

410
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:43,429
a you shouldn't the this coming boo
shouldn't you know what I lot of memory

411
00:25:43,429 --> 00:25:46,120
on your side when you're spending a lot
of systems in part on

412
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,200
but in any case up what do you do

413
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,789
so far yes you know again run this
context cool fine did NOL

414
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:56,179
that are alive and then you run a
different for a

415
00:25:56,179 --> 00:26:00,360
you know for doing the port scan

416
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:05,080
ok all other tools

417
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:10,340
I so there is the stalled peace would be
six which was

418
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,580
prison earlier versions of the book it
already

419
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:17,830
as far as I recall on the people will
believe you know the love

420
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:22,560
out of frustration at some point in time
when I was playing with a 60 said well

421
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,450
where the where where he say

422
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,730
is seen through their for b6 which is an
extremely revealed all

423
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:31,950
there wasn't any okay something last
three losses seen through their

424
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:36,150
I was symbolic publicly available mark
also offer

425
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:39,530
you note the Etsy heat and
implementation of a seen through there

426
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:39,880
too

427
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,040
another time when I was working on these
I thing he cannot publish

428
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:49,450
he simple yet soul that's how I started
working on PCP 6

429
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:53,560
but they really were also gonna like
invisible so to speak

430
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,900
because a years ago when I got involved
in

431
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,050
you know protocol an idea stuff I am

432
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:04,180
most of the world that I D that the time
will focus on the TCP protocol

433
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,760
and there were many things that are the
damn I wanted to test but you didn't

434
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,780
really have like

435
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,780
you know useful tools to be able to
check that if you

436
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:16,370
know a little bit about this should be
for example there are things like

437
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:20,640
the CBC budget opens and if you want to
check for example whether I see them

438
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,390
supporting

439
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,900
dance opens there's not really a way to
do that a

440
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,810
because there's not all that allows you
to do that easily so I ended up

441
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:32,650
longer bring in lots of features to
these PCB a 6-2

442
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:36,650
not just for being able to perform
attacks but also to note this

443
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:41,390
things that at that point in time I was
unable to death unearthing the Los

444
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:45,780
up why did their thing on my side what's
that like almost miss a

445
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:50,210
five or six or ten years ago I had
publish these documents PCB security

446
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,730
with different ways in which you could
at that

447
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:56,200
it DCP implementation but at the time I
had in polish

448
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,770
any the BC people's based on ipv4

449
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:03,780
to perform those at and in many cases
there were no publicly available tools

450
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,120
to perform those attacks so essentially
I did all that was

451
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,620
the now can you know performed all
subjects that i described eight-year

452
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,180
cycle

453
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,570
for the ipv4 will but that in many cases
they have not been

454
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:18,380
exploited or for which you didn't really
how like it publicly available

455
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,460
exploit them so before

456
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:25,600
I know the scribe the some other things
that you can do with PCP

457
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,930
a6 I'm going to have a like a couple of
lights with %uh

458
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:34,090
some PCB fundamentals so that if you're
not that used to the

459
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:37,140
that the TB internals you can follow the
rest of his life were:

460
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,280
for performed Thursday what is called it
the CB three-way handshake

461
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:45,800
so the idea is that he had two systems
the world to transfer information by

462
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,910
means of PCP

463
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:50,230
you have to perform what is called a
three-way handshake which involves

464
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:50,800
exchange

465
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,050
usually three segments: so this is the
boss

466
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:57,580
a that he's hoping the connection it
since it seems like it

467
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:01,060
the cosby census enough parking I'm
final

468
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:05,820
a these acknowledgement pocket so the
idea is that once those three things

469
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,750
have been

470
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:10,030
you know exchanged the connection is
established

471
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:14,820
on both sites of of the network just for
the time being

472
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,340
I mean before we actually before he
actually describe these with with dole's

473
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:22,870
I one of the things that you good body
think of

474
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:27,400
he saying we'll you know you for you
just told me that when you start wishing

475
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,310
connection

476
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,830
you exchange be the pockets and then

477
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,610
you get the connection established a
here here

478
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:37,090
bother you could say well what do you I
will settle was HH

479
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:40,179
lost lots and lots and lots and lots of
connections right

480
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:44,200
of course you know in order to keep a
connection alive you have to keep state

481
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,130
on your system

482
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:48,160
in order to keep state you need to use

483
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,140
memory of some sort I scenes you know
memories if you need resource

484
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:55,490
eventually you will consume all the
memory no

485
00:29:55,490 --> 00:30:00,400
then let's see them if you were to play
to perform these attacking the most real

486
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:00,850
way

487
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:04,380
you the broader employees like the
sockets API

488
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,270
like the comic function you know you
many connection request

489
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:13,490
on the side doing all create many many
connections not the problem in that case

490
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:16,919
is that if you are really also keep in
state

491
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:21,419
on your side then the effect of your
suffering the effects of the attack

492
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:22,040
yourself

493
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,480
I mean you're so she did not have
connections with the target system

494
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,010
now yes we see them now has to have the
lot of connections

495
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:32,540
but you're going to have the both all
those questions yourself so probably

496
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,690
would kill yourself

497
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:36,809
earlier than you December okay so

498
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:39,830
the idea here is how could you possibly

499
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:43,640
you know if Darvish lot of connections
here without having

500
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,870
die your own resources on your site okay

501
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:51,030
so in that case it doesn't cost you much
who studies the connections by you

502
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:57,150
lot of resources up there a December so
that's something that these the CP 6 to

503
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,270
mute allow you to do

504
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:03,059
a and then now a couple of common so
what if the

505
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:06,419
it would we first what is typically
referred to as the connection

506
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:07,440
termination

507
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,160
face so let's say that you have
established a connection

508
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:15,350
you have exchanged data over the
connection and eventually you're done

509
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,030
with that connections he want to close
it

510
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:20,500
okay so the way would you do that this
system that

511
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,590
you know first tries to close the
connection which in this case should be

512
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,380
this one

513
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:29,230
sent feedback it next thing you know I
want to close my side of the connection

514
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,720
on the other side

515
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,950
response night with the sock which means
okay

516
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:38,059
so this should be connections are bi
directional so if I'm transferring in

517
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:38,349
from

518
00:31:38,349 --> 00:31:42,119
so if I'm going to do a different system
I had to close my outside of the

519
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:44,239
connection by sending sigh of a
connection

520
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:48,080
on the other in custody accepted the
same thing so these means

521
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,190
one way to interpret these I'm not going
to see you any more information

522
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:56,359
him okay and eventually some point later
buffet

523
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:59,690
you see them says you know what I'm not
going to sit in any more information

524
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:00,210
either

525
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:04,690
I say here you know okay so what you
exchange those packets

526
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:08,479
the TCP connections on each side he
supposed to

527
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:12,460
from stations through the first eight
okay this is in the PCB specification

528
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,409
there's nothing that I

529
00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:17,909
been here now some things that you
should gonna see their

530
00:32:17,909 --> 00:32:20,970
which I think having the reviews

531
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:25,190
in the next slide is that there's some
listen to you if you're going

532
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:29,049
an application there are states that are
typically come

533
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:32,070
handed handed by an obligation like the

534
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:36,200
sunny state usually when a connection
some say it's there there's an

535
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,099
application day and the front fairing

536
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:43,409
are or sending or reading data but in
other states so I just feel way to work

537
00:32:43,409 --> 00:32:44,119
Tom Wade

538
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:48,710
is not the obligation itself that
handles the connection buddy the sticker

539
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:52,529
okay so your obligation is done with the
connection

540
00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:57,139
up but the it but it is the underlying
current they won handing the connections

541
00:32:57,139 --> 00:33:00,690
so nobody won the World Wide should make
it about these away the you mention

542
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:01,039
these

543
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:05,299
because there are certain implications
when you want to use these for attacks

544
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:08,470
so let's start with a very simple
scenario this either

545
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:13,090
I had some server here on a for example
say well you know I'm going to perform

546
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,669
like a connection to the attack

547
00:33:14,669 --> 00:33:18,179
I'm going to establish many many
connections with that server without

548
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:19,659
forcing other tests or anything

549
00:33:19,659 --> 00:33:22,669
right just using my real honest a

550
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:25,879
if I am perform like a proper connection
true that may keep

551
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:30,929
all the connections say if then the
application at December

552
00:33:30,929 --> 00:33:34,929
we we r we aware about all the
connection that they have established

553
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:35,649
within

554
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:37,990
so for example at the application layer

555
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:41,790
your they that out that's ever could
implement medications and say you know

556
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:42,410
I'm

557
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:45,780
for example only going to except their

558
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:49,910
thing connections Arabia miss for
example and you can't do that

559
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:54,510
at the application layer so the
application can see all the connection

560
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:57,600
that are the at some point in time now
when we come

561
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,860
States so just being willing to work
that way these are not 100 but the

562
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,860
application itself

563
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:06,360
their hand by the can by the kernel so
that means that if you call an

564
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,230
application on you try to mediate the
sort of attacks

565
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:12,720
generally you can know noble anything

566
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,520
I love connection through but played to
exploit the state's

567
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,460
so connection through that point to get
connection

568
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:24,030
thing going to wait and so on can only
be mediated

569
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:27,369
at the operating system okay that's like

570
00:34:27,369 --> 00:34:31,389
in the like yet like in new that an
important difference important

571
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:31,869
difference

572
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:36,270
there are cases in which you have you
know several implementations could be

573
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:39,649
web servers could be the in a sober
units overs

574
00:34:39,649 --> 00:34:42,770
where they do implement mediation for
connection feelings

575
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:46,600
but be gone all you know mediate
conditions that are you

576
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:50,618
the state now if you get to somehow will
both connections

577
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:54,050
your the state's then you are bypassing

578
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:59,119
any protection that those applications
have implement a

579
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,050
so this is what I just set some states
are typically handled by the

580
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:07,530
by the kernel others by the I'm by the
obligation

581
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:10,650
on again benefits who

582
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,760
in that target system can implement
litigation whether

583
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,470
that's the application whether that's
the current so some features

584
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:22,060
in the in the PCB textile so the CBC's

585
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,319
has some I

586
00:35:24,319 --> 00:35:26,800
and open mold a option

587
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,470
but essentially I loath you do sell it a
hollow the three-way handshake

588
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:35,210
is going to be performed so you can
build it all that you wanted to blow

589
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:39,480
asset connections you until they do that
you want to do to open connections in

590
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,339
the normal way

591
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:43,420
but you can also build it will for
example I want to

592
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:46,839
I I want the ball

593
00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:50,900
to force like it seemed tenuous open
scenario that's a scenario for example

594
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,490
that doesn't really happen in practice

595
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:56,420
but you can get the ball to do that a

596
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,710
this is of course how you select the
mall and of course you have to use

597
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:02,760
any what's you they had to use

598
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,920
any of these be worse know next to be
open more

599
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,030
option there's also

600
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:12,490
a close mode option which is more useful
for

601
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:16,160
you know from the attackers point of
view i would tell you

602
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,530
tall sailing well first of all to build
it all that you want to close

603
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:20,250
connections

604
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:23,630
but you can also build it all in which
state

605
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:26,640
you want the targeted connections

606
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,109
to be in so for example you can cause
they

607
00:36:30,109 --> 00:36:34,150
you know they're your money issues
connections to remain in the last week

608
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:34,809
the last

609
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:39,930
up say the way to state I'm so one I
mean that some really mater

610
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:43,609
if you don't understand that he does all
the differences between all of the

611
00:36:43,609 --> 00:36:44,400
state's

612
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,319
but what's important here is that would
be still you can cause

613
00:36:48,319 --> 00:36:52,290
a you can through its target system with
many as many connections I

614
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:55,549
us you 1 but also I'll

615
00:36:55,549 --> 00:37:00,260
post both malicious connections to
Wheaton any specific PCB state that you

616
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:00,730
won

617
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:04,030
typically with you know the tools that
you will find out there

618
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:08,059
you can only you know through
connections or north of the connections

619
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,730
and put them in this stylish they state
with the stall you can

620
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:15,700
you know make if you love connection and
make them for example we may

621
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,000
if we can stay thing once they last arc
or whatever

622
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,510
again why don't you use for example the
state's

623
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:26,940
I suppose to this study state because no
a

624
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:30,240
depending on the particular state that
those connections remain in

625
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,990
I gonna implement company the occasions
my or my not apply and you obligation

626
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:36,980
medications might

627
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,210
on my not apply they win you

628
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:43,280
the way in which you select the clothes
movies with a close one option

629
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,670
so use this you specified Hills Mall

630
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:49,710
and then what any of these keyworth

631
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:53,550
after that I also

632
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:57,240
let's try to use the the should be six
ball for contextual

633
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,319
you know that's so I'll

634
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:04,670
among the possible options the the city
and most will know

635
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:09,309
if you want to perform a scene through
they deal with the scene through this

636
00:38:09,309 --> 00:38:10,520
essentially that

637
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:14,119
you're going to create lots of
connections in this scene we see

638
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:17,420
state at the target system I am

639
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:21,349
they kinda prouder that you have to
specify this is that they were in the

640
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:21,829
face

641
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:25,319
this is the source prefix so the dude is
going to

642
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:29,339
sport lot of ipv6 addresses or if you
wanted company I mean

643
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:33,920
a can spoof lot of ipv6 addresses misses
the target system

644
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,200
on the the destination port for

645
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,520
seen through that that's they for that
boorda the target system needs to be

646
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,160
open

647
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,200
so a quality picture with her murder you
prolly

648
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,250
target poor 80 here but daddy again is
that

649
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:51,869
us to correspond to the board that is
open and the

650
00:38:51,869 --> 00:38:55,770
some be all the parameters that you
might get about

651
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:59,010
I'll these one yeah on said

652
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:03,180
%uh specify essentially there right at
which you establish connections

653
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:06,819
so this means that every single you
establish

654
00:39:06,819 --> 00:39:10,230
handed connections so indirectly it
specifies the rate

655
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:13,270
okay that means that every single yours
establishing

656
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:17,250
100 connections so let's see if we can

657
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:24,250
get this to work

658
00:39:31,309 --> 00:39:35,869
so the cease the like a.m. connection
table

659
00:39:35,869 --> 00:39:39,109
%uh this is than that I'm going to
attack okay

660
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:42,679
%uh they are just open walls

661
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:46,419
you can see here important to might be
in a number of Port

662
00:39:46,419 --> 00:39:50,349
by there are no connection seen you know
any other state police in

663
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:53,499
on if things work as expected

664
00:39:53,499 --> 00:39:59,230
and

665
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:06,230
this

666
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,220
you think

667
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:15,660
this this

668
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,160
so what here is lots of connections

669
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,340
Missy we see state okay

670
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:24,350
this is a truly shine in this nothing
you

671
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:29,820
here other done it's an ipv6 based
attacked the so that's our from 1997

672
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:34,290
so to speak okay the only been no
specific thing here

673
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:37,890
its is that it's an ipv6 implementation

674
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:41,230
of the attacks that where you know
perform other time

675
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:45,150
on ipv4 a

676
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:50,960
all Pielke so

677
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,840
those aren't seeing fields but then
there are gone

678
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,240
other kind of connection so for example
i willz

679
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,800
a same before that I could for example
great news

680
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,830
get it right to through it targets
system

681
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:08,870
with lot of connections in this stylish
state okay

682
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:12,810
in the case of this year we seem state
are conditions that have not yet been

683
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:19,599
you know properly establish so we could
try to do that

684
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:26,599
stay in

685
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:41,830
ok

686
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:11,670
the story with us they have issues with
them

687
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,880
they will

688
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,859
you see on the senate semistate I
connections that I'm

689
00:42:42,859 --> 00:42:47,009
spoofing right now I'm going to run this
again

690
00:42:47,009 --> 00:42:52,870
Oaks

691
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,950
the sewer connection from the previous
attack right

692
00:42:54,950 --> 00:43:00,100
on these are connections that are in
this study state

693
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:04,540
that I'm creating know if I if you look
at my own sees them

694
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:08,180
because you might say okay well but
you're creating connections in this

695
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:08,980
study state

696
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:12,940
at the target system but what about your
own system maybe your pain resources on

697
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:13,980
your own system to

698
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:20,980
now if you look here

699
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,020
you can see that I don't have those
donations at all

700
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:30,420
these are all all these are all your
connection but I don't have connections

701
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,540
in this publish date:

702
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:34,950
on my system the reason for ways that
happens is that a

703
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:39,590
if I were to I you know establish the
other connections

704
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:42,850
with the kernel now using the you know
sockets API

705
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:46,140
of course feel a connection from my own
system to but I

706
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:49,190
I am astonishing those connections by
sporting the packets

707
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:52,890
so my own care mill never gets to know
about the connections that I'm

708
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:53,610
establishing

709
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:56,640
okay so they know the the

710
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,670
benefit of these or or the benefit of

711
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:03,900
you like here looting at Target with
this kind of dollar suppose

712
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:07,020
with you know like a normal application
on your system

713
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:10,020
is that you don't die any resources on
your own system

714
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:15,100
you only their resources on the target
system and then you can also do all

715
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:15,820
those things

716
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:22,820
such us policy if this works

717
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:45,050
so what are the here if you look at the
common

718
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:49,970
that I'm running I specified that a
one-day connection

719
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:53,240
to leave the last last cock state

720
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:58,400
okay so I'm not just feeling that target
but I'm saying all those connections

721
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:58,819
that I'm

722
00:44:58,819 --> 00:45:02,380
you know that thing a that including
that target win

723
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:06,119
I want them to remain in a specific he
should be state which is less ac

724
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:11,290
and if I go out the target system you
see that the connections are in the last

725
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:11,980
Oct state

726
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:15,020
this is something that I've not seen any
other tool

727
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:18,010
on the scene that easily extremely also
but it's something that had not

728
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:18,910
implemented

729
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:24,089
okay the nice thing again if you have
some obligation agree with a similar

730
00:45:24,089 --> 00:45:27,800
but you know day cares about more cable
connection from the same prefix or the

731
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,369
same ipv6 address

732
00:45:29,369 --> 00:45:32,410
or be it will probably not be able to
enforce the

733
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:35,650
mediations because when a connection is
in the lot in the last

734
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:39,960
Oct estate is the kernel come in the
connection and on the application

735
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,960
okay I of course the cease

736
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,319
you know if you love connections in last
cock but you go through

737
00:45:47,319 --> 00:45:50,660
the you know that target with connection
seen

738
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:53,920
literally any state that you won you
just need to

739
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,089
specified they a

740
00:45:57,089 --> 00:46:00,089
the clothes mall in his way so I can

741
00:46:00,089 --> 00:46:03,140
north but if I feel way to thing way one
what everyone

742
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:06,819
I all the things that

743
00:46:06,819 --> 00:46:09,980
know the story implements I actually
implements

744
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:13,930
more attacks but I a I'm just running
just a few of them

745
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:17,030
%uh many your soul there was a

746
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:21,990
guy calls Pakistani love John channel
which described like a very cool at act

747
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:23,150
that you could perform

748
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:26,359
again said DC the bus based service

749
00:46:26,359 --> 00:46:30,980
and the idea is pretty simple so let's
say that they had a web server there

750
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:35,319
I I miss you mean that you know that you
know the basics of TCP flow control so

751
00:46:35,319 --> 00:46:35,819
to speak

752
00:46:35,819 --> 00:46:40,309
policy that they have it was over there
I'm 9 the article here

753
00:46:40,309 --> 00:46:43,640
one thing that I could do is request
like if I'll

754
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:47,740
to that server okay on right after I
send the request

755
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:51,119
I other Thais a window of seal

756
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,130
if you don't know what at the CP window
is it's essential

757
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:58,950
a way of you know doing flow control so
you're able to build the other side of

758
00:46:58,950 --> 00:46:59,769
the connection

759
00:46:59,769 --> 00:47:04,420
how many bytes you are expected to
receive now what happens in that case

760
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:07,700
if I went with the file that system will
you know star

761
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:11,029
or we try to boost arson in the fire
they felt the same time

762
00:47:11,029 --> 00:47:14,619
I advertise the wheel of cereal this
system will not be able to send me

763
00:47:14,619 --> 00:47:15,200
anything

764
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,529
now what happens in that case East that
if you feel

765
00:47:18,529 --> 00:47:22,640
this if you do that but with many many
multiple connections now you are not

766
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,049
only

767
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:26,210
dying a lot of resources on the
connection themselves

768
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:29,430
but also on December 1st so now the
server

769
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:33,660
not only cuz lot of connections but now
has a lot of offers with a doubt that he

770
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:34,670
was to send you

771
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:37,700
but he can't because of you know that we
know that you are ties

772
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:41,589
I will not getting to the needle so
these

773
00:47:41,589 --> 00:47:44,769
but just described that this is the way
in which you gun

774
00:47:44,769 --> 00:47:48,059
implement the attack a so

775
00:47:48,059 --> 00:47:51,170
if you look at the connelly's believe
very sealer

776
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:54,289
a to the ones that we use for the
previous at that

777
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:59,460
the only difference is that in this case
you specify with that option

778
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:03,160
if they don't and in this case as you
probably know the Sisson

779
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:06,859
HTTP request so that means that for
every connection

780
00:48:06,859 --> 00:48:10,259
than we are offering where also sending

781
00:48:10,259 --> 00:48:14,680
an application request again this
doesn't die

782
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:18,609
any resources on our local system is no
though we are you seeing their sockets

783
00:48:18,609 --> 00:48:19,289
API

784
00:48:19,289 --> 00:48:22,380
it's all spoke with pockets okay so it's
extremely

785
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:26,119
like lightweight for us to perform this
attack now

786
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:30,059
if you perform the setback against some
sort of server a

787
00:48:30,059 --> 00:48:33,799
you will see that you know only end up
with a lot a lot of connections but if

788
00:48:33,799 --> 00:48:34,990
you check for example

789
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:39,039
if you use that means in option in
netstat you will see that there's lots

790
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:39,380
of

791
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:45,290
you know memory employees for their
sockets and buffers I

792
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:48,640
okay so what needed

793
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:53,400
this should be stuff I mean I usually
think of the PCBs a portable that

794
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,000
usually people that a

795
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,920
focuses on the this should be stuff
doesn't work on anything else

796
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,670
if you follow the CP related stuff
there's even people that just people to

797
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:03,630
congestion control

798
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:07,880
for example so that's like a very
laissez godlike complex on specific

799
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:08,480
protocol

800
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,570
a so rather than you know

801
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:14,820
continuing with possible objects that
you cool

802
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:17,859
perform with the stall I will just
provide these

803
00:49:17,859 --> 00:49:22,660
wonder the ceasar not really a paper
like it did make a report that I

804
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:28,550
polish in 2009 I would just say shiny
colours like being truly every

805
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:32,700
the I think technique but you can think
of for the PCB case

806
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:36,960
now the nice plane now is that other
don't publish this

807
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,040
you didn't really have the epic tools to
reproduce the attacks

808
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:44,089
so we came up with the attacks but we
need new tools to actually be able to

809
00:49:44,089 --> 00:49:44,890
perform them

810
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:47,940
now you daily idea of this document

811
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:52,170
on you try and you implement them with
their you know with the CB balls

812
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:55,640
then you can reproduce the ethics that
we are talking about

813
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:59,520
a okay is precision go steal

814
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:03,300
fight 25 yes perfect I

815
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,460
okay um up somewhat in Burma

816
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:10,190
okay there's a PCB seeks at all but what
about

817
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:13,960
you to be so essentially release are you
the basic storm

818
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:18,760
which consider between packets for
example you can use extension heather's

819
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:22,359
you can send more people packets to a
specific

820
00:50:22,359 --> 00:50:26,550
you know this nation let's see what I
want to sell lots of packets do that

821
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:27,720
with DNS server

822
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:31,010
up

823
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:34,450
you can use lots of interest that
something that every to love the still

824
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:35,280
get support

825
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:39,620
soul for example you can see why you
only want to respond to packets that

826
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:43,540
come from the sort that all their system
I only want to respond back is not use

827
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:44,840
these are not all their poor

828
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:48,750
so you it's very easy to customize what
you

829
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:52,070
a respond to or not I'm

830
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:55,510
the storm also have had that option a
which

831
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:59,480
allows you to send spacey freakin or I
think payloads to

832
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:04,260
your target I this issue in this version
of the dog

833
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:05,290
I

834
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:08,840
don't really cover like the mall for the
issue to be

835
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,850
a six-goal I the explanation that I can
be for that is that a

836
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:16,150
you know I try to perform like you might
recall the

837
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:17,560
a cool a

838
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:21,600
what was it like they chargin on a cool
attacks where you can

839
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:25,410
cost like packets to ball from you know
from one important to another

840
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:28,890
so useful for packet to the echo service
and

841
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:31,900
that but that service automatically
respond with a ghost

842
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:36,130
now when I try to not only the previous
the notes and so on

843
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:40,980
they all implement mediations so I don't
know if there's like a way to circumvent

844
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:41,530
the

845
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:45,970
like Paul this service arises run on the
front porch but eventually it has been

846
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:48,810
like more than an hour trying to lie
down I say okay

847
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:53,520
forget it but if you can come up with
some idea that you say well I need to

848
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,970
send you to be packets to

849
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:58,700
you know the so that season this is the
tool that will allow you to

850
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:02,210
I am

851
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:07,160
okie dokie then they are

852
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,460
other tools the your don't really know
who

853
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:15,020
any fancy stuff but that implements
stuff that at the end of the day you

854
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:16,270
usually need to do

855
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:20,190
so for example up some point in time

856
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:23,270
I wash meaning to you know do miss your
mints

857
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:26,280
are we different kind of the since I'm
going to describe the specific

858
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,330
measurements that it wasn't going to do

859
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:32,430
so I was facing a situation in which I
wanted to

860
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:37,020
you know obtain the least of the area or
I had like a lease the domain names

861
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:41,250
and I wanted to you know get the a ipv6
addresses

862
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:45,430
correspondent to that Lisa domain names
I mean not something that is

863
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:49,360
policy really simple you haven't quite
like a txt file

864
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:53,950
one domain name per line and you want to
convert that to find the house 1 p-6 r

865
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:54,570
is for like

866
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:57,800
you could probably do that with
scripting actually you have to do that

867
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,250
were you

868
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:01,730
can like the script in but seems that
something done

869
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:04,990
is very likely that you will need to we
included

870
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:08,670
a.m. is great in the docking itself so
that you don't need to implement this

871
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:09,450
with your cell

872
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:12,750
so this cryptic stall can

873
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:16,270
I they do but processing but processing
of

874
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:19,840
dominance on ABC services so for example

875
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:24,500
if we have like if I am Doug Kass arm
for example

876
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,960
multiple domain names by using this
grade 6 tall

877
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:32,660
you can mop those domain names to
anything that you want I'll

878
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:35,890
one simple example could be same

879
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:42,890
yes

880
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:59,560
so let's just say that they have these I
have this fight

881
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:03,660
okay

882
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:07,320
and let's just say that I want to obtain
their

883
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,570
be 60 this is 40 juggle or those domain
names

884
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:17,570
so what you do is said

885
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:28,630
that's funny and good

886
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:30,330
the the S

887
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:33,740
you're right and what about the other
one

888
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:40,740
if anything with them was that you do on
the place that he knew were

889
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:45,170
in an order one idea there are

890
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:52,170
a it could be way there's probably some
fucked up there

891
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:59,130
well what happens with the idea that's a
very good question

892
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:04,220
we'll have the story about Exim yeah

893
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:11,220
work

894
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:36,070
well I'm doing something wrong there
which I don't know what it is but

895
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:40,920
officially the idea is that for each
line that you have each domain that you

896
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,460
have in the

897
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:46,000
your file a you get us every soul

898
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,110
this kind of opal okay where you get the
domain name with a common

899
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:56,160
all of the other tools in the tool kit
will ignore lines that have a dash

900
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,470
and at the inn in so that means that

901
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:03,180
you can use the same file for you for
any other

902
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:06,210
any of the other tools of the talking
the

903
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:09,660
get like for example

904
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:13,600
to ipv6 addresses of the domains that
you had their now

905
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:18,260
let's say that you all you had that
lease of domain names

906
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:21,270
but you now want to obtain the name
servers

907
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:24,360
for those domain names so what you could
do

908
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:31,360
is do something like this okay

909
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:34,570
so what I did yes I know

910
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:41,570
must sell

911
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:51,520
so will the bowl bid here these for
regional

912
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,790
Egypt the domain names that he cut in
their file

913
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:59,900
you don't think the MX records okay now
let's say that

914
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:03,660
usually you just you just don't want the
domain names but he won the ipv6

915
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:04,650
addresses

916
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:07,950
of date mainstay of the mail servers

917
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:11,040
so what you do is you combine you bite

918
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:18,040
the dolls in this way so what we're
doing is

919
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:21,940
we start with the domain names with this
girl

920
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:25,530
we get the MX records like then names of
the main servers

921
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:29,010
and they will be gonna you get the
corresponding

922
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:36,010
ipv6 services

923
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:44,410
sold it also with the dolls are doing
their is start with domain names

924
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:48,790
then give them a three-course and once
they had a mixed record the obtained a

925
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:52,590
AIDC services you can do the same thing

926
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:55,920
for I'll they NS recourse

927
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:02,920
which is the name servers okay

928
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:10,030
I mean there's no much ink here's just
like a script that takes you know

929
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:13,140
each line and then tries to obtain
specific

930
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:17,730
you know the NS resolve recourse now if
I wanted

931
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:21,110
to you know obtain they ipv6 addresses

932
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:24,710
of the name servers of those domains
again I do the same thing

933
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:27,790
up screen 6 get

934
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:32,550
quite a okay

935
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:36,670
so the reason for which I needed this

936
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:40,090
I was because I was doing measurements a

937
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:44,240
actually what I did was I downloaded
INXS to 1 million sites

938
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:47,820
list so I had the least of domain names
their

939
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:52,000
I say what I want to measure different
kinds of systems web server so one-sided

940
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,240
so that means just opinion the quite the
recourse then measuring

941
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:59,450
name servers which means get the in his
records then be quite a record

942
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:02,670
on Michelle I am May 7th

943
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:05,950
get the MX and then from the mix the
quite a

944
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:12,950
nothing week here but it's something
that probably

945
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:16,840
if it is here you know if it was
implemented in the door you have to

946
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:17,720
implement yourself

947
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:21,350
I okay with this

948
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:25,730
with this all our stuff

949
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:29,640
arm eventually when we were doing you
know measurements

950
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:33,110
a wooded to find out

951
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:36,490
what was the out animals system
corresponding

952
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:37,970
to I

953
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:42,430
a specific ipv6 address that something
that you got something mean

954
00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:45,579
you know like will be you or whatever
you want but

955
00:59:45,579 --> 00:59:49,369
we implemented it all which you can be
like her

956
00:59:49,369 --> 00:59:53,140
ipv6 address on the ball can't give you
either

957
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:56,519
what everyone like just they AL to
normalcy the number

958
00:59:56,519 --> 01:00:00,480
or not just the autonomous system number
but all the other corresponding

959
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:01,200
formation

960
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:06,200
so let's just say that iron at school

961
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:13,200
clear and

962
01:00:35,850 --> 01:00:38,780
so let's just say that wheel

963
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:45,780
say so some just something and you know
who like the 60 S

964
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:50,710
or one of them so if I want to know

965
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:55,530
what's the out on the whole system
number corresponding to that address

966
01:00:55,530 --> 01:01:02,530
this is what I do and it will just tell
you that the other animals with another

967
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:07,240
is 15,000 land is 69 now

968
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:10,530
you can get more information with
because just

969
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:15,420
that just the autonomous is the number
but they don't get like the full thing

970
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:18,750
sorry

971
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:21,910
things not just done what is the number
but what

972
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:26,030
the prefix that to which that up be on
I'll look today

973
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:29,550
reared that actually handed that part of
the others face

974
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:34,170
and what the organization the which that
part of the outer space belongs

975
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:37,190
okay again

976
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:41,450
this nothing like crazy here bodies
something that is useful

977
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:44,710
and I don't recall having like a know
something's

978
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:48,539
rifle whereas this the

979
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:53,569
I'm nails

980
01:01:53,569 --> 01:01:58,509
this boobs all our stuff

981
01:01:58,509 --> 01:02:02,109
I am of course you have probably use

982
01:02:02,109 --> 01:02:05,439
a like an ABC version of frayed rope

983
01:02:05,439 --> 01:02:09,169
are the only problem no limitation with
the

984
01:02:09,169 --> 01:02:13,119
did trees with implementations that you
probably have on your operating system

985
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:16,259
is that they don't support extension
headers okay

986
01:02:16,259 --> 01:02:19,359
so you can probably use like be for
improved markets

987
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:22,599
but if you want to try you know you if
you want to the

988
01:02:22,599 --> 01:02:26,739
with trays with but employing extension
headers you won't be able to do that

989
01:02:26,739 --> 01:02:30,279
so we implemented bar 6 tall

990
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:33,739
we check I'll owes you to do what race
ru

991
01:02:33,739 --> 01:02:37,049
but in you seen extension headers if you
want

992
01:02:37,049 --> 01:02:40,499
but so us an example

993
01:02:40,499 --> 01:02:43,890
so let's first right it raise route

994
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:47,619
without extension headers

995
01:02:47,619 --> 01:02:54,619
okay

996
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:59,850
now we can I think these

997
01:02:59,850 --> 01:03:05,410
us screen if you specify for example

998
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:10,370
their me knows you option that means

999
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:13,740
in this nation options hither of a light
okay

1000
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:17,080
I need it is the nation also here
there's is just going to have like

1001
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:17,990
buying options

1002
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:21,460
this just nor ok bye in space but not
carrying anything

1003
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:28,460
special so that prolly means that

1004
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:36,640
they are being dropped somehow ups

1005
01:03:39,390 --> 01:03:41,790
so that you can tell the difference that
in the previous case

1006
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:46,300
without extension headers we'll be able
to get to the final destination

1007
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:50,640
whereas in this case you can't again if
I run the tool again without the mean

1008
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:51,050
moose

1009
01:03:51,050 --> 01:03:58,050
means you option you do get to the
destination

1010
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:05,880
okay I you can also use or extension
here there's like

1011
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:10,210
a for example you could use it's not
going to work of course because even

1012
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:11,330
when one doesn't work

1013
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:15,340
but you can use to destination up from
Canada one after the other

1014
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:20,520
same thing

1015
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:24,330
the stall

1016
01:04:24,330 --> 01:04:27,460
of 6 also I know if you do

1017
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:30,900
I'll send different kind of brew buckets

1018
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:34,940
so other than sending ICMP echo request
messages

1019
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:38,970
you can send PCB segments to be that the
grounds there are like multiple options

1020
01:04:38,970 --> 01:04:40,660
that you can use for the book back its

1021
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:45,330
you can said the payload are you can for
example fragment the PRU buckets

1022
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:50,750
there's like is extremely flexible I am

1023
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:55,880
their son another tool that a I britain
said it I'm so many of the school that i

1024
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,740
described like India in the last few
slides

1025
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:02,240
up had to do with a goal that we had of

1026
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:06,270
mission you need a ride in the public
Internet the extent to which

1027
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:10,710
you could use extension headers okay so
what we wanted it was to ground like a

1028
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:12,170
list of public servers

1029
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:15,170
from for example and access to 1 million
sites

1030
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:18,470
and we wanted to make sure the extent to
which you could

1031
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:23,700
send packets with extension headers to
those systems classes there wasn't a

1032
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:24,330
trade group

1033
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:27,830
that support an extension here there's
we had to implement all this but

1034
01:05:27,830 --> 01:05:31,260
a.m. they all eventually was not again
to measure

1035
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:35,930
extent to which extension headers with
supported now let's just say for example

1036
01:05:35,930 --> 01:05:39,380
died you know other use in buckets

1037
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:42,580
with extension hey there's to connect to
some system or

1038
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:45,490
either because you want to have been
aggression this team because you're

1039
01:05:45,490 --> 01:05:46,330
measuring that

1040
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:48,710
I'll or whatever

1041
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:52,070
and you find that your pockets don't get
to the final destination

1042
01:05:52,070 --> 01:05:55,070
okay so for example you connect to
Google

1043
01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:58,830
with other extension headers and
everything works of charm now

1044
01:05:58,830 --> 01:06:01,950
you also in blowing this a this nation
options

1045
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:05,790
on your pockets don't get there so what
you probably want to know

1046
01:06:05,790 --> 01:06:09,430
is wearing the network your pockets are
being dropped this is not

1047
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:12,980
ball not really a security thing but
more of a troubleshooting thing

1048
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:15,980
okay I so what we did

1049
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:19,490
is implement it all that is cool black
hole 6 which

1050
01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:23,250
essentially twice before I know where in
the network

1051
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:27,080
your pockets with a special here there's
are being dropped okay

1052
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:30,590
Paso

1053
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:33,990
before actually getting to the
expiration on on

1054
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:38,300
a regarding hold it all works list right
to use it so that you can

1055
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:45,300
get a feeling of all you know what the
police about

1056
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:52,839
up

1057
01:07:57,530 --> 01:08:04,530
Annes on this story this and see if it
works

1058
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:14,790
soul and rental here East to I'll find
out

1059
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:18,400
whether buckets we'll

1060
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,550
this the nation optional hither of a
bite

1061
01:08:21,550 --> 01:08:24,820
work or worse the system

1062
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:29,040
but you know your hopes www

1063
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,610
got the want gumbel are okay

1064
01:08:32,610 --> 01:08:36,720
I in this particular case what the
police show in

1065
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:43,720
this from this again want to do is show
in

1066
01:08:44,050 --> 01:08:48,560
is that there are no bucket drops so
that these the toll twice per cent

1067
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,230
bucket with extension headers

1068
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:53,730
everything works perfectly they need
right to do the same thing

1069
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:57,180
with extension headers and everything's
the work perfectly

1070
01:08:57,180 --> 01:09:00,370
okay so what it says is that we need

1071
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:04,070
a we are trying to connect with these a
destination system

1072
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:07,960
this is the O'Donnell system which that
is beyond

1073
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:10,980
now when oh we employ

1074
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:15,100
no extension headers at all this is the
last season to respond which is that

1075
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:19,490
I the actual target when we employ this
the nation of shapiro

1076
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:22,640
eight bytes a the lassies do with Paul

1077
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:26,030
if the target that we were trying to get
which means there are no packet drops at

1078
01:09:26,030 --> 01:09:26,400
all

1079
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:30,680
everything worked perfectly well now
let's try for example the same thing

1080
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:37,680
but with a different system

1081
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:47,670
board

1082
01:09:50,029 --> 01:09:53,119
I obviously the recent for which I am
trying Google

1083
01:09:53,119 --> 01:09:57,280
is because goal is well known to drop
every single ipv6 packet that employs

1084
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,159
extension headers

1085
01:09:58,159 --> 01:10:01,349
okay so in this case you are going to
see packet drops

1086
01:10:01,349 --> 01:10:04,769
now you got your boat here

1087
01:10:04,769 --> 01:10:07,909
which is this bar

1088
01:10:07,909 --> 01:10:12,780
okay what you see is that we are trying
to get

1089
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:16,300
police I V six hours normalcy

1090
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:22,469
who will the last nope to respond we
don't employ an extension headers

1091
01:10:22,469 --> 01:10:25,820
you that target itself which means that
our pockets

1092
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:30,559
are getting there when we London police
station head but now

1093
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:33,590
when we employ a destination options
hither

1094
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:38,269
of eight bytes the last season to
respond is this one which is not the one

1095
01:10:38,269 --> 01:10:39,449
that we're trying to get to

1096
01:10:39,449 --> 01:10:44,030
okay now a hold of that system beyond to

1097
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:47,030
wall what you think when you drink too
much on iris

1098
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:50,639
into an outlet for most systems things
can be likely to be I mean what

1099
01:10:50,639 --> 01:10:54,199
so to speak so they don't bills you two
different options

1100
01:10:54,199 --> 01:10:57,840
in what are the possibilities their
settled on a system that it cannot

1101
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:58,599
identify

1102
01:10:58,599 --> 01:11:02,630
so that's why it's a unknown here in the
other possible case

1103
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:06,059
equal of course I know that in this case

1104
01:11:06,059 --> 01:11:09,769
its cool itself that is drop in the
bucket us %uh soon as packets get

1105
01:11:09,769 --> 01:11:13,340
into walls network on the border they
are dropped okay

1106
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:16,690
I am

1107
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:20,090
I think I

1108
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:23,789
not sure but I think that government
book or have the same problem

1109
01:11:23,789 --> 01:11:27,960
what problem

1110
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:34,960
we can try and

1111
01:11:43,959 --> 01:11:48,400
so in this case no packet drops things
are fine lissy

1112
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:55,400
with fragments

1113
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:05,270
so in this case is fine I will try from
here

1114
01:12:05,270 --> 01:12:08,290
because I seem to recall that came in
the or was

1115
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:15,290
field during this kind of thing

1116
01:12:35,130 --> 01:12:36,270
not

1117
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:40,180
in this case is fine I at least some
time ago

1118
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:43,260
can the or some men were the worst a I
know

1119
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:46,990
like right before calendar or was
dropping fragments I don't know if they

1120
01:12:46,990 --> 01:12:48,180
change it out on what

1121
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:51,230
but again the phone with the store was
not its

1122
01:12:51,230 --> 01:12:55,640
dunno if you do I not easily identify

1123
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:59,070
what then nobody's rope in your pockets

1124
01:12:59,070 --> 01:13:02,850
with extension headers and it also gives
you information

1125
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:06,400
about you know they'll tunnel system was
the organization that that system

1126
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:07,620
belongs to one so one

1127
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:10,620
I when he comes

1128
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:14,350
you might wonder will hold of the stall
I get to know

1129
01:13:14,350 --> 01:13:17,540
you know what's the system that is
dropping the packets it's easier this is

1130
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:18,250
not that

1131
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:22,050
so this should be like the your
explanation so what they told us

1132
01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:25,610
is first of all in runs like a normal
tree's root

1133
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:29,340
with open if they should have this at
all so that'll be like the Opel

1134
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:33,570
on the list okay they will be told us

1135
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:37,540
East runs a gay three who but now with
extension headers

1136
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:40,830
and it gets the so there'll now

1137
01:13:40,830 --> 01:13:44,080
a human that pockets follow the same by
which who

1138
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:48,630
ok will not be the case but usually do
this if we find that the last

1139
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:52,590
respondent No when we sent back in the
extension headers if this one

1140
01:13:52,590 --> 01:13:55,750
wall did usually system drop in the
pockets

1141
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:58,950
is the next one okay

1142
01:13:58,950 --> 01:14:02,300
so this is what they told us I mean when
you run like all six

1143
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:05,680
it for a run traceroute in these weight
with no extension headers

1144
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:09,380
didn't it once a.m. trade with extension
headers

1145
01:14:09,380 --> 01:14:12,410
find that this is the last system to
respond

1146
01:14:12,410 --> 01:14:15,990
then comes to be so that players will
looks up

1147
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:20,050
you know this same entry these one but
here

1148
01:14:20,050 --> 01:14:23,230
and then assumes that the system drop in
the bucket

1149
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:26,460
is in a East the next one in the list
okay

1150
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:29,740
of course the idea is that it does that
out of the four you

1151
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:33,170
you could do it you know my know anybody
does that automatically for you

1152
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:36,720
on of course once identifies

1153
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:40,470
the system he does things they'll to
normal system right

1154
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:44,610
information and so on a

1155
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:47,820
there are a number of things that are
not that easy

1156
01:14:47,820 --> 01:14:50,890
%uh for example up

1157
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:55,090
the door was informing a what was built
on wall system

1158
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:58,570
to which the drop in all belongs to okay

1159
01:14:58,570 --> 01:15:02,140
now looking up there tunnel system

1160
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:06,380
is not part okay now the problem is that
you have different scenarios so for

1161
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:08,310
example you could have to order normalcy

1162
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:14,110
like in this case where the other is
phase that it's been employed for the be

1163
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:15,000
in session

1164
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,950
you been provided by the solar panel
system now you have

1165
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:22,940
the so in case in which the outer space
is being provided

1166
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:26,350
by these other autonomous system are you
could also have a case in which the

1167
01:15:26,350 --> 01:15:28,500
other space has been provided but
someone else

1168
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:31,750
okay that's why the only someone be
witty

1169
01:15:31,750 --> 01:15:35,540
when a you know black hole seeks informs
you of their results

1170
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:39,920
in many cases the toll will bill you
will go tunnel system could be this one

1171
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:44,210
all these other one but you not is there
some beauty that comes from BS

1172
01:15:44,210 --> 01:15:47,940
a in not in all of the cases

1173
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:51,640
the to continue on you know I'm 100
percent sure that the autonomous system

1174
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:53,010
that is drop in the bucket is

1175
01:15:53,010 --> 01:15:57,350
be so that other one I'll with the

1176
01:15:57,350 --> 01:16:00,370
these one already the let's see

1177
01:16:00,370 --> 01:16:03,580
so I'll

1178
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:06,660
much of or no Lisa

1179
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:09,850
things that they have described like you
know implementing it with will

1180
01:16:09,850 --> 01:16:13,890
that's a poor succession hey there's are
trying to find out what this system that

1181
01:16:13,890 --> 01:16:15,080
is dropping the pockets

1182
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:18,440
again again again %uh we

1183
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:22,490
implemented because we wanted to measure
on the public internet

1184
01:16:22,490 --> 01:16:25,850
the extent to which packets extension
headers work supported

1185
01:16:25,850 --> 01:16:29,380
so I be used for the presentation

1186
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:32,910
will describe you know what's the
process or what are the tools

1187
01:16:32,910 --> 01:16:34,910
that we employed to actually me

1188
01:16:34,910 --> 01:16:38,290
make measurements out they kinda like
large scale

1189
01:16:38,290 --> 01:16:41,960
all

1190
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:45,210
okay soul daddy again

1191
01:16:45,210 --> 01:16:48,750
were still are grab like a list of
domain names

1192
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:53,480
on try to figure out the extent to which
bike is we extension hey there's

1193
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:56,850
could get to those domain names these
are some of the tools

1194
01:16:56,850 --> 01:17:01,780
that we had to use or implement in order
to be able to perform those measurements

1195
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:05,770
well first of all but 6 because he said
I'm

1196
01:17:05,770 --> 01:17:09,410
AAA predrilled implementation which
supports extension headers

1197
01:17:09,410 --> 01:17:12,530
that was necessary these

1198
01:17:12,530 --> 01:17:16,750
grid that were needed due process are
they an excess

1199
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:19,810
but one meal site first of all these one
if

1200
01:17:19,810 --> 01:17:23,620
simple but the thing is that when you
download the file from the LX aside

1201
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:27,880
is not really stop domain names but he's
a comma-separated values

1202
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:31,620
file so the custom drunk a coma and then

1203
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:35,500
you know that dominates the nominee
itself so we need a script to justice

1204
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:35,920
truck

1205
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:39,440
they don't then these

1206
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:42,700
a speech here to obtained it

1207
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:47,360
hey i'd BBC services the ABC services
correspondent two name servers and mail

1208
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,500
servers as a lot

1209
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:52,510
then we also employ the other six cool

1210
01:17:52,510 --> 01:17:55,620
isn't all that is not really new in this
version of the talk it but it's

1211
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:56,780
necessary for this

1212
01:17:56,780 --> 01:18:01,520
iris 6 I'll you do do like B-twenty
everything that you could possibly want

1213
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,100
to do with an ipv6 address

1214
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:07,840
for example if you have like a list of
RSS you can build it all War II

1215
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:12,200
only one or I want it all to feed their
out any others is that are not

1216
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:15,790
blowout in the Gulf other it is for
example or if you have like a list of

1217
01:18:15,790 --> 01:18:17,070
ipv6 addresses

1218
01:18:17,070 --> 01:18:20,390
you can tell they don't do we move area
this is that is a duplicate

1219
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:24,210
so I you can come up with the file

1220
01:18:24,210 --> 01:18:27,220
that house you know not so far this is
some are duplicates

1221
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:30,230
some could be more because local and so
on

1222
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:33,790
a new gun feeder out all of the others
is that you wouldn't want and just keep

1223
01:18:33,790 --> 01:18:34,280
those

1224
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:38,290
but you like to the measurements then we

1225
01:18:38,290 --> 01:18:42,690
up real the school or these common of
this group file

1226
01:18:42,690 --> 01:18:47,430
which essentially what Indus dust
something

1227
01:18:47,430 --> 01:18:50,790
very similar to what the black hole 6
tall the in

1228
01:18:50,790 --> 01:18:54,170
buddy near buddy provides opal in a way
that is

1229
01:18:54,170 --> 01:18:57,490
easy to script okay so with black 06

1230
01:18:57,490 --> 01:19:01,310
it provides you know all what that is
useful for human being so big

1231
01:19:01,310 --> 01:19:04,870
but in this case we wanted it all do
provide

1232
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:08,630
open for many many different
destinations on for that 0.2 mi

1233
01:19:08,630 --> 01:19:13,250
ec2 a process with a script I'm finally

1234
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:16,700
with the stall get

1235
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:20,639
Tracy stuff what he does he's based on
these results

1236
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:23,680
it brings statistics okay

1237
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:27,130
so

1238
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:31,270
this is what we did I'll first of all
your pain the least of

1239
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:34,580
you know the I'll accept the 1 million
sites a file

1240
01:19:34,580 --> 01:19:40,540
we obtained a quietly ABC services for
web servers for main server son four

1241
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:41,370
name servers

1242
01:19:41,370 --> 01:19:44,810
so now we have for example 3d from files

1243
01:19:44,810 --> 01:19:49,730
which have a bunch of ipv6 services but
some of them could be like duplicate

1244
01:19:49,730 --> 01:19:54,450
very likely but I R you also find that
there's people that bob publishes

1245
01:19:54,450 --> 01:19:58,630
more big us RSS for web servers I mean
nonsensical of course

1246
01:19:58,630 --> 01:20:02,750
but you find the kind of thing in the
DNS there's people that publishes

1247
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:07,240
local out this is on the DNS an offer we
want to feed their all those addresses

1248
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:10,500
I'll a

1249
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:14,450
this is how you peter out all of those
addresses

1250
01:20:14,450 --> 01:20:17,960
essentially you by the least of others

1251
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:22,560
who the other six tall I the school and
essentially say that you want to split

1252
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:23,420
more because

1253
01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:26,620
RSS and just give the la uni Gus RSS

1254
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:30,680
I mean just canceled them on a base for
the tool but if you just

1255
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:33,710
use these girl that means remote

1256
01:20:33,710 --> 01:20:37,080
any duplicates remove any special other
sis

1257
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:40,390
and just keep the lower unit got others
is so

1258
01:20:40,390 --> 01:20:44,930
essentially while knowing how like a
clean file that just have

1259
01:20:44,930 --> 01:20:48,270
but just cast number obligate lower unit
cost %uh this is

1260
01:20:48,270 --> 01:20:51,280
so we done we don't want for example to

1261
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:54,570
the Michaux the same iris multiple times
for example

1262
01:20:54,570 --> 01:20:58,390
okay alone

1263
01:20:58,390 --> 01:21:02,330
what we have like eight clearly stuff
ipv6 services

1264
01:21:02,330 --> 01:21:05,990
what we want the store up for each of
those ipv6 outages

1265
01:21:05,990 --> 01:21:09,370
do something similar to what black hole
62

1266
01:21:09,370 --> 01:21:13,140
was no it so send packets without
extension heather's

1267
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:16,770
send packets with extension headers and
then try to find out

1268
01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:19,860
you know where in the network the
packets drops are happening

1269
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:23,230
I'll I'll once

1270
01:21:23,230 --> 01:21:27,180
know we get all those measurements want
to produce but the stakes

1271
01:21:27,180 --> 01:21:30,960
on this is a common that we can use
brilliant if thats

1272
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:34,570
I think that try

1273
01:21:34,570 --> 01:21:38,150
arm Google there with a very very small
point

1274
01:21:38,150 --> 01:21:40,000
a

1275
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:46,710
we ca so the so they domains

1276
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:53,710
so let's just say any

1277
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:04,500
so now

1278
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:11,500
and they really did have a few more in

1279
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:21,320
room

1280
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:32,710
ok

1281
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:41,960
ok

1282
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:48,960
10 things

1283
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:55,680
what

1284
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:58,730
I S yes you're right yet

1285
01:22:58,730 --> 01:23:02,620
miss Julia so now we have more at ISIS

1286
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:08,590
solar this doing this be broadcast
duplicate out Asus

1287
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:12,280
but I mean what I one used to see you
know how to produce the results

1288
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:17,960
so we are not going to feed their to
duplicate or you know incorrect alice is

1289
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:18,480
here

1290
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:22,230
that something that you do in practice
so if you look at these file

1291
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:25,600
would help at least

1292
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:29,090
some least of ipv6 addresses right now

1293
01:23:29,090 --> 01:23:32,170
given that list of RSS

1294
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:39,170
and ca

1295
01:23:43,110 --> 01:23:46,200
if we buy the SDO a

1296
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:53,200
on

1297
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:02,200
we're going to you know now start loving
if I but I want you to see

1298
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:05,680
both the local that come on a will

1299
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:09,380
so

1300
01:24:09,380 --> 01:24:12,620
the cease the target ipv6 address

1301
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:16,110
this is the last system to respond

1302
01:24:16,110 --> 01:24:19,110
without you see an extension headers

1303
01:24:19,110 --> 01:24:22,320
this is the number of hops that system

1304
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:26,950
okay this is the last season to respond
with extension hey there's

1305
01:24:26,950 --> 01:24:31,910
number to hopes to that system this is
the drop in no

1306
01:24:31,910 --> 01:24:36,000
which is rabino I saw one okay so the
idea is that

1307
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,440
we in every single line or for each
target other is

1308
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:44,010
we are measuring you know a number of
things such as what these the last

1309
01:24:44,010 --> 01:24:47,420
system to respond with or without
extension hey there some so one

1310
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:50,760
no we're going to store the Dean

1311
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:57,760
less a DOM trace those txt

1312
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:04,239
because the idea is that we want to have
a file that contains the results of the

1313
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:05,100
measurements

1314
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:11,250
to all of those systems okay while we
have that

1315
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:14,330
once we have the five we don't have the
result for all the target systems

1316
01:25:14,330 --> 01:25:18,560
we're going to run a different common
which we grapple with souls

1317
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:25,560
I will produce statistics

1318
01:26:08,819 --> 01:26:11,619
or one thing to note is that when you
run

1319
01:26:11,619 --> 01:26:14,839
again tracy's you can specify

1320
01:26:14,839 --> 01:26:18,429
not only can I think they should have
anyone to trial

1321
01:26:18,429 --> 01:26:23,300
but also the kind of packing okay so you
can say I want to try this donation

1322
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:23,849
options

1323
01:26:23,849 --> 01:26:26,969
in this case a bite and everybody's
going to be

1324
01:26:26,969 --> 01:26:30,809
ICMP echo but you can also say you know
I will fragmentation

1325
01:26:30,809 --> 01:26:34,010
I one fragments all 500 bytes on a long

1326
01:26:34,010 --> 01:26:37,249
goodbye kiss to the b2b segment for the
dole supports

1327
01:26:37,249 --> 01:26:41,889
it more people extension Heather died
difference i sis the from prototypes and

1328
01:26:41,889 --> 01:26:42,760
so on

1329
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:49,760
so if we look at the this file you see
that it contains

1330
01:26:51,389 --> 01:26:54,619
yes

1331
01:26:54,619 --> 01:26:58,589
on the soles for each other dirty things
that we tried

1332
01:26:58,589 --> 01:27:01,969
okay now we weep i/b/e/s

1333
01:27:01,969 --> 01:27:08,969
the

1334
01:27:13,870 --> 01:27:17,020
now with the ball is doing is that for
each of these lines

1335
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:20,370
is going to try to find out for example
I

1336
01:27:20,370 --> 01:27:24,880
seen such as: what is there optimal
system that is dropping the pockets

1337
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:28,720
it also tries to measure for example the
entity that is dropping the packet

1338
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:32,800
is the final destination so for example
when you send back at school with

1339
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:33,790
extension headers

1340
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:37,470
you want to know if it's cool itself the
I'll tunnel system

1341
01:27:37,470 --> 01:27:41,220
drop in the bucket or some other one so
the so the

1342
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:44,700
stocks that we got I you got who

1343
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:48,080
so we have for monied interests

1344
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:54,240
interest that could be processed I

1345
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:58,560
you know 100 percent of the cases

1346
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:02,980
in was their final destination the
system drop in the bucket

1347
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:06,790
so it was in some intermediate O'Donnell
system but actually the final

1348
01:28:06,790 --> 01:28:09,920
Alberta mostly from the one drop in the
bucket with extension headers

1349
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:12,980
article also bills you

1350
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:17,790
this case on the worst-case a scenario
because as I said before there are

1351
01:28:17,790 --> 01:28:21,510
your there's some be would be when it
comes to you know that that thing

1352
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:25,960
the autonomous system and it also
billion

1353
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:29,020
still see what the ok tone will see them
that is dropping the packets

1354
01:28:29,020 --> 01:28:33,590
I with extension headers okay I am

1355
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:37,740
tomorrow when I precedent will I would
be present in

1356
01:28:37,740 --> 01:28:41,650
know some of the world that you know has
be happening at the ATF

1357
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:44,650
when it comes to a BBC security bottled
up

1358
01:28:44,650 --> 01:28:48,530
we'll include results of measurements of
the sort

1359
01:28:48,530 --> 01:28:53,010
I'll when performed two release of and
it's %uh stop 1 million sites

1360
01:28:53,010 --> 01:28:57,370
okay what I tried to show here East
whatever the Dolce on worries the

1361
01:28:57,370 --> 01:28:58,960
process you that we follow

1362
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:02,220
in order to produce the results that I'm
going to

1363
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:07,160
to I am 2 percent tomorrow but the idea
here or what what a

1364
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:10,139
wispy you to get from you know from

1365
01:29:10,139 --> 01:29:12,710
from the old boulder police that these
things is that

1366
01:29:12,710 --> 01:29:16,230
started from a list of domain names
which is publicly available also just

1367
01:29:16,230 --> 01:29:17,969
Alex esta 1 million side

1368
01:29:17,969 --> 01:29:21,850
you can use all that also part of the
balls that are in this toolkit

1369
01:29:21,850 --> 01:29:25,780
I to produce a Leeds a list of target
ipv6 addresses

1370
01:29:25,780 --> 01:29:29,350
and then with the tools that are
included in that okay you gun

1371
01:29:29,350 --> 01:29:32,820
perform your own measurements when it
comes to the extent to which extension

1372
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:33,940
headers are supported

1373
01:29:33,940 --> 01:29:36,949
in in the real world I

1374
01:29:36,949 --> 01:29:40,389
you follow the a b6 ops police

1375
01:29:40,389 --> 01:29:44,330
on the idea there is currently some
discussion going on

1376
01:29:44,330 --> 01:29:47,670
exactly about this so there's a document
that we publish

1377
01:29:47,670 --> 01:29:51,300
that essentially summarizes these
results

1378
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:55,230
and I the ATF is officially discussion
that

1379
01:29:55,230 --> 01:29:58,750
so some conclusions than actually not

1380
01:29:58,750 --> 01:30:02,460
that many conclusions that you can write
from this I am

1381
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:06,050
one of them which wash my personal
conclusions

1382
01:30:06,050 --> 01:30:09,369
is that I when working on balls thats

1383
01:30:09,369 --> 01:30:12,980
that'll be like my computer for working
or working on this version of the book

1384
01:30:12,980 --> 01:30:13,380
it

1385
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:16,429
I for EE these way harder

1386
01:30:16,429 --> 01:30:20,369
done it should be you're done I expected
my soul another thing

1387
01:30:20,369 --> 01:30:24,150
which is nice funny thing is that you
know the more you use

1388
01:30:24,150 --> 01:30:27,230
a talkin the more bucks

1389
01:30:27,230 --> 01:30:32,050
W fine and the more you can improve you
know the quality of your call

1390
01:30:32,050 --> 01:30:35,300
so well up I

1391
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:38,800
for myself you know you should also know
to whom measurements will repay you

1392
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:39,900
cannot access along

1393
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:43,540
and that's it essentially wouldn't too
many of the improvements that you will

1394
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:44,590
see these version

1395
01:30:44,590 --> 01:30:48,030
ya think a there's not

1396
01:30:48,030 --> 01:30:51,380
to it to learn through practice thats
nothing you

1397
01:30:51,380 --> 01:30:55,389
but when he goes to such as for example
the extension header stuff that is

1398
01:30:55,389 --> 01:30:59,060
stuff that we were discussing in the
last few slides I am

1399
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:04,590
I got less overall nothing was like
quite a surprise to me when I started

1400
01:31:04,590 --> 01:31:06,460
doing measurements on this kind of stuff

1401
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:10,010
because for example I expected extension
headers two-goal more

1402
01:31:10,010 --> 01:31:13,880
easily on the interment and then for
example I ended up finding that

1403
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:18,429
there was a quite high property when it
came to extension kit

1404
01:31:18,429 --> 01:31:21,809
I also when it comes to you not
discussions that you have been there

1405
01:31:21,809 --> 01:31:23,710
particularly community many times

1406
01:31:23,710 --> 01:31:28,570
know people respecting the a to be able
to use

1407
01:31:28,570 --> 01:31:31,880
extension headers know for invading
security controls

1408
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:35,210
but trolleys that I in practice if you
are

1409
01:31:35,210 --> 01:31:38,429
if you try to list the another great
penetration best

1410
01:31:38,429 --> 01:31:41,840
of a remote site I usually

1411
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:45,800
a is not useful for you are not a cure
to employees extension headers

1412
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:48,909
because since the other extreme drawl on
the Internet

1413
01:31:48,909 --> 01:31:52,239
that means that you're up at back
packets would prolly not even get to

1414
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:53,110
this nation

1415
01:31:53,110 --> 01:31:57,659
so I'm all of the things that I hear
myself was that a

1416
01:31:57,659 --> 01:32:00,929
even for minor doctors point of view
extension fitness arnold at night

1417
01:32:00,929 --> 01:32:04,999
yes if you could use them you could
listening evade and they were in

1418
01:32:04,999 --> 01:32:06,849
Prussian detection systems and so on

1419
01:32:06,849 --> 01:32:10,979
buying practices with many sites your
pockets get dropped way

1420
01:32:10,979 --> 01:32:16,699
earlier done the gate to the you know to
your target if you use the dog it

1421
01:32:16,699 --> 01:32:20,210
police report to us I whether that's

1422
01:32:20,210 --> 01:32:23,449
box whether that's missing features

1423
01:32:23,449 --> 01:32:26,800
lines things such as we know it
Brightbill you know perform the song

1424
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,119
nothing with it all good bud

1425
01:32:28,119 --> 01:32:31,269
I didn't find a way to do it or the
feature race missing

1426
01:32:31,269 --> 01:32:34,999
I also if you that we that will probably
lead to

1427
01:32:34,999 --> 01:32:40,030
improvements I don't know if there are
any questions not

1428
01:32:40,030 --> 01:32:44,420
well if you have them I well first of
all that notice men sigh

1429
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:47,610
this was incomplete to all their
troopers cue

1430
01:32:47,610 --> 01:32:51,760
I'll for taking care of like a lot of
things

1431
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:55,719
I particularly probably tried to I mean
without the intention but a

1432
01:32:55,719 --> 01:33:00,749
a was like completely by that response
times up by that be truly everything

1433
01:33:00,749 --> 01:33:03,760
on even then the the a they

1434
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:08,160
not to care of I like everything from
getting me from the airport to

1435
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:11,680
to the city and so on if you have
questions feel free to

1436
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:15,360
either talk to me on the corridor sorry
you know in the

1437
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:18,760
the that's why even notice

1438
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:22,440
and if you're not ok right their son
ipv6 hackers mailing list

1439
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:26,640
many if not most of the people that work
on basic security are

1440
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:30,600
right there so nice like like a nice
place

1441
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:34,910
%uh to share basic security or obese a
alright BBC low level stuff

1442
01:33:34,910 --> 01:33:35,850
so thank you
