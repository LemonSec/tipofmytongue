1
00:00:01,579 --> 00:00:03,510
yet on good morning everyone

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,930
welcome to Las Vegas and already set
your welcome to the basic attack

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,260
mitigation strategies

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,700
on presentation from of a lil Mia all
before we saw just a couple bronson

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,090
on our site yeah we are well we are just

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:21,590
onto networking geeks or working for
young W on we have a passion for ipv6

7
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,289
and so on I'm working with ipv6 for the
last

8
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:29,980
I think six or seven years so I'm not

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,540
another long as I know because it's just
all than me so on when he started

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,809
working on ipv6

11
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:38,670
I had other interests all that ipv6
butts

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,050
on since a couple of years on

13
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,770
I'm doing basically and nothing else

14
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,690
besides ipv6 yeah I wanna come to do. a
basic attack mitigation

15
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,370
on presentation with me yes Rafael

16
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,440
on he was a long time in my team

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,730
now switched on but army is also
responsible 526 that your W

18
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:09,189
moment so we're doing the presentation
on together solve on without further ado

19
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:10,330
let's just start

20
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,510
when this thing works now

21
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,790
foreign so well

22
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,350
on this presentation split in three
parts on the first part

23
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:24,600
at least um maybe a little bit boring
I'm fully aware of that

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,610
it's just a little ipv6 refresher on on

25
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:32,070
well I think we all should know ipv6
work up just to make sure that that

26
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,570
everyone is on the same boat

27
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,579
we're just going up very quick ipv6 on

28
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:41,060
introduction I'm just to make sure we
are on the same page

29
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,500
sodom dunno we're have a look okay

30
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,210
arm YS ipv6 security actually so hearts
and

31
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:53,490
what are the actual problems in a part
20 we are looking at specific

32
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,549
on the tax on on the you on local links
on the local Inc and then we'll have a

33
00:01:58,549 --> 00:01:59,280
look okay

34
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,350
whole weekend mitigate dole's or

35
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:06,030
attacks and part 3 yes well I'm covering
which is

36
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,270
which has ruffled doing on about
scanning and reconnaissance

37
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,590
and a special attack called made by cash
on exhaustion

38
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,430
salt on as I said just a quick refresher

39
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,690
I I'm fully aware that it might be a
little bit boring abuts

40
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,700
on we will do it anyway so

41
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,280
but why isn't this working as expected
come on

42
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,900
so yahoo.com if you haven't done

43
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:37,730
done any work in ipv6 you might come to
the conclusion yeah I do you think's

44
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,400
I mean it's 2050 the press are seeing on

45
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,560
before I do you think's was dated back
in December 1995

46
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,640
from Saul we have this day our 20th
anniversary for

47
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,030
long I view 6 and you may come to the
conclusion well

48
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,850
I do you think there's a well-defined
set of Bob standards

49
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,180
um completed standards but

50
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,490
as soon as you love take but a little
bit deeper into the ipv6

51
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:09,240
on topic you will see you well that's
not necessarily the case

52
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,459
on they're out still quite some debates
about

53
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:16,130
fundamental functionality of ipv6 and

54
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,870
on we are attending quite a couple of my
gf meetings

55
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:25,950
ants inside these ipv6 related working
group they are spending quite a lot of

56
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:26,940
time station

57
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,470
discussing okay how can we modify it
some

58
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,810
on protocol behavior for example
neighbor discovery

59
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:38,760
on I wealth the less I TF media was
attending was last year in London

60
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,970
and stay hats a one-hour slots and
forty-five minutes they were nothing

61
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,410
not they were talking about just the
kale him in what if I on neighbor

62
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,100
discovery

63
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,310
up so that it works better at more
functionality

64
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,400
and so and so. there are quite a lot of
RCS

65
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,459
both understand its track informational
on floating around in the IT Espace

66
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:01,690
which doesn't make it any easier from a
security point of you

67
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,700
because I'm you do not have any
predictable behavior of a

68
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:10,320
certain type 26 section on any given on
or any given entity

69
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,370
and on depending on the bend or you are
a

70
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:18,109
using some stuff maybe im implement its
completely

71
00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:21,410
differently and this makes its on even
hotter

72
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,270
for on

73
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:27,389
security impasse at least Albany terms
of security you want to have

74
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:28,389
predictability

75
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:31,690
so that you can predict how device
behaves

76
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,710
when it's for example received the
specific packet

77
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,060
which unfortunately is necessarily the
case

78
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,060
bomb nowadays and

79
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:45,440
on doing to mid 90s on there was a
complete different thinking of

80
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,090
networking and security alarm

81
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:55,210
in general but um I view 6 was developed
under simes specific design paradigm

82
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:59,960
or wonder makeshift is I'm design
paradigm was the end to end

83
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,130
principal not for transparency I

84
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,750
network address translation it was never
planned and there's still

85
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,930
a big debates inside EITF working group

86
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,599
do we need network address translation
in the IP six world or not

87
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:17,509
all of them I think no we don't on get
rid of gnats

88
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:22,389
on yet I know it's a necessity in the IP
four worlds but the only reason we use

89
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:22,960
it because

90
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,280
I'm we have just I'm not enough ipv4
address this and so on

91
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,319
we have this issue in the ipv6 were also
all

92
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,099
why should we use such sorry a crappy

93
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:38,270
mmm technology in the ipv6 will just get
rid of its

94
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:42,740
and I love you think possible sorry
supposed to be used on a large scale

95
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,080
on sorry for the passwords on the
Internet of Things

96
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,800
all on things connect the two DE I'm
into that this doesn't work home with

97
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,190
ipv4 and we have to rely on ipv6 which
is a good thing

98
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:59,490
ants I view 6 is supposed to be used by
the by the snot running in well

99
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,000
manage that works what does this mean
well arm even

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,960
I view 6 should work even without a
network administrator

101
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,630
so when I plug in my up system into it
into any given up reports

102
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:15,090
Obama just the should configure
completely automatically

103
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,460
and then I should be good to go and

104
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,529
I do you think Steve I suppose may be
limited for processing and configuration

105
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:23,509
capabilities

106
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:27,500
you are just some examples Smarties
those preachers

107
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,050
alum send those well whatever somebody
for some

108
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,580
important design paradigm switch you
should keep in mind to just two

109
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,770
on get a better understanding why some
things

110
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,279
where developed holiday are on today

111
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:45,639
salt then we have of course

112
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,889
all our normal of my peers six other

113
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:52,139
their summer difference as to the ipv4

114
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:55,969
on petr on for example it is on

115
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:59,930
the sizes 40 bytes not twenty but like
in the IP for world's

116
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:03,389
on there are some fields which are not
present in the ipv6 header which

117
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:06,639
where India on my before the but um

118
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,180
be sites that we all four we have all
Russian we have our traffic laws which

119
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,629
is useful quality of service

120
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:17,090
we have our flow label which is induced
blog today by any application I know of

121
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:21,009
but maybe a bomb in the future we have
our a payload length

122
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:24,979
we have of course all help limit which
is the equivalent to teach TTL field

123
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:28,509
and we have of course these the source
address and destination address

124
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:32,089
which is on not 32 bits like in the IP
four worlds but

125
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:35,599
wanna 128 bits arm

126
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,639
in the ipv6 whirls soul

127
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,349
I that they sought well when you develop
type you six-year well

128
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:46,000
may be a good idea and to just put the
necessary

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,270
on header information India actual ipv6

130
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,979
on petr and everything else Aug just put
it

131
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:57,469
in optional extension headers so let's
say for example

132
00:07:57,469 --> 00:08:00,479
when I need fragmentation a a mess we
can see you

133
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,539
here

134
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:09,349
all we do not have any info on the
fields in the in mobile ipv6 that a

135
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:12,529
on in regard to fragmentation a because
said well

136
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:15,539
bomb fragmentation optional are many
ipv6 world

137
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:18,800
and so well when I when fragmentation is
needed

138
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,289
just well we put this all the
information Indies

139
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:26,370
arm extension headers and then on when
the packets get pregnant at

140
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:31,009
a fragment header is placed before on
the actual ipv6 Adam

141
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:34,709
so that all affected related information
as stored in death

142
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:38,969
on extension had a in Syria this sounds

143
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:43,930
goods in practice and from a security
point of you

144
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,770
it's just a mess on because the

145
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:52,230
RC youth failed up to specify an upper
limit of how many extension has can be

146
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:56,240
on a given I ipv6 packets so from the
standpoint of you

147
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,710
on and ipv6 packet with for example 100
essentially this is totally ballots

148
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,120
up but of course these days in any I use
case

149
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,230
arm for that the second thing is

150
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:12,430
on the year there is a recommended are
recommended order

151
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,940
how do you extension at us shoots II

152
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,480
RC technology Taman terminology should
appear

153
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,060
inside on the packets but every

154
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,700
holst hat has two process

155
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,850
on the packets home even dole arm

156
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,260
the year recommended order on water

157
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,690
with on for extension had a which are
not in the recommended order

158
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:40,480
and on we we have done quite a lot

159
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,840
quite a lot of research in regards to
extension header and the processing of

160
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,580
intermediate devices routers firewalls
IDPs devices

161
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,960
holiday behave well with packets well
with many arm extension at us

162
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,440
in different combinations we won't cover
on these topics

163
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,140
arm in this workshop but if you
interesting in the stuff be here

164
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,330
are many of the new owner of it on Tonys
will give you on an introduction at you

165
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,670
how you can debate II DPS devices

166
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:10,930
in the IP six world with the clever use
of extension headers but from a security

167
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:11,780
point of view

168
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,350
these extension is just arm are just the
mess

169
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:19,780
but from a theoretical point of view
it's sound it's

170
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:23,250
good at a first glance so

171
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:27,190
yes we've might all known I do you think
there's a 10 to 20 at-bats

172
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,480
a mattress in though India exit small

173
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,570
digits on old of decimal on

174
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,930
aunt 10 20

175
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,110
eight bits so it makes its quite hard

176
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,840
on to reach us by the human eye on ants

177
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,150
we do not have any or all of them subnet
mask anymore we just have to you

178
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:51,490
are sedimentation class in the domain
routing

179
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:55,540
on as we can see here and this just
specify okay

180
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,130
on this is just a forty bit

181
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:00,700
on prefix just to make it more readable
for

182
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,560
on the human I am we have some
deprivations which we can use

183
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,390
onto compress an ipv6 on address on

184
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:11,960
because nowadays there are quite usually
many zeros

185
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,000
inside the ipv6 address and there are
some ibu every ations

186
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,160
on allowance on to compress this ipv6

187
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:24,240
address so the first

188
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,430
simplification which you can do with
love you just can't calm its

189
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,940
the leading zeros in each

190
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,460
compaq's combinational sold on here in
the US

191
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,570
on 16-bit but weren't we have I'll

192
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:42,450
omitted 2-for-3 on zeros to

193
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:46,480
are make it more readable from the
beginning from disciple music's

194
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,500
address to this one

195
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,230
and the next operation which we can

196
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,490
on useless that we can summarize or

197
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,810
replace I'm consecutive zeros

198
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:03,160
like the three 16-bit words can be

199
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,780
summarized to on column column

200
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,120
so that we'll starting from dis

201
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,200
ipv6 address alarm India and we have
this one

202
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,610
which makes it more readable on forty
you when I

203
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,910
but all three you all of these on
examples

204
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:27,530
are on ballots a ballots textual
representation of an ipv6 address

205
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:31,910
which on where now we have to next
problem

206
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:35,270
how tough your security wise whatever

207
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:39,020
store an ipv6 address for example in a
locked file

208
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:43,110
on does that youth on this notation it
doesn't use this notation a

209
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:49,750
or doesn't use on dislocation

210
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,470
well on that depends on you have to
double check well I'm so

211
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:57,330
it's not as easy a bomb like any IP for
world when you have a lot of other just

212
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,870
make a crap over to find an ipv4 address
in the ipv6 world

213
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:04,250
you have to something about a que or hot

214
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,250
how does the ipv6 address gets re
present herbs and you have to cover

215
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,550
alton teeth on

216
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:13,440
possible ways to you represents an ipv6

217
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,170
address soul on to cover all these

218
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:20,330
well cases you have to use a little
script or to find

219
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:24,800
the ipv6 on address this depending on
how do you actually buys

220
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,830
on this repertoires using them insights

221
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:31,550
arm the lot fights which is unfortunate
but

222
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,960
on we have to deal with the situation on

223
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,240
yeah I jeff is also where all of that
and the release

224
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,990
RC 59-52 which just give some

225
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,080
I a recommendation to hollow and I Q six

226
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,600
at Earth or should be represent its

227
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,770
in the lock files or in general text
sorry presentational

228
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:55,860
the problem is FERC already the

229
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,220
has in his name it's a recommendation to
on I mean it's in the

230
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,540
standards track but on whether or not

231
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,510
and bender implements this
recommendation up it's totally up to the

232
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,050
vendor

233
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:10,280
sold on when the when the vendor

234
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,810
on is a good one then

235
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:17,310
he will obeyed 2 D's rules but he had

236
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:23,210
but he doesn't have to so coming to the
outer space

237
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:27,570
we have a couple of on different at this
basis we have to to solving Collin

238
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:30,010
College last three upon which is just
you on

239
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:33,510
global unique cast arm address space

240
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,530
we have so-called unique local

241
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:40,430
a unique ass at a switch are more or
less the equivalent

242
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:44,590
to a private IP four on address this
sold a DS

243
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,730
addresses should not be router its

244
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:52,290
in the global ipv6 Internet but as the
name already implies

245
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:56,800
even though lemme they are you thatthe
private IP you v6 addresses inside York

246
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,890
organization up

247
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:03,210
they should be here unique so you so
that you do not run into problems we

248
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,820
happen the IP for world

249
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,660
when you have fallen for example mergers
and acquisitions you bought a company

250
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,230
that you have to connect the other

251
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,320
IT departments and they're using both
the same IP before

252
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,120
um subnet so you have to rely on network
address translation to so that they can

253
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,360
communicate with each other

254
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,570
um in the ipv6 well even if you using
Uniqlo communicate the dust

255
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:27,070
shouldn't be you the case ideally if
this

256
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,610
turns out to be true on this has to be
proof on

257
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:34,570
so but up but this was the intention of
the unique local unique ass addresses

258
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,740
even though that they are

259
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,940
private IP is exactly as a stay should
be unique

260
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,380
but there's an algorithm which

261
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,730
on generate so specific prefix on

262
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,760
and butts nobody in the issue

263
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,500
to use just the unique local prefix
witchu assigns

264
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,120
on by yourself sold this there may be a

265
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,270
I'm circumstances where on

266
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:04,340
you have overlapping unique local bomb
address but I haven't seen any

267
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,080
environment

268
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,720
always happens on just because on the
deployment of

269
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,590
Uniqlo communiques address this on this
very low at the moment

270
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:17,080
but we'll see artists but it turns out
India

271
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:22,040
on in the future Sol on the not address
space which we have to solve

272
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,530
link local unit cast on address us on s
the name already implies

273
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,630
on every ipv6 army Naples on

274
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:33,700
system generates on this link low
communicate you

275
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,780
link local unit cath address on by on
default

276
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:40,320
and this address can be used to
communicate

277
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,160
with ipv6 hosts which reside

278
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,750
him on the same sup Nets led to two main
the lawn

279
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:52,020
but whatever soul up even though you do
not have my view 6 deployed in a

280
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:55,240
corporate environment for example as
soon as the ipv6 sec

281
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:00,820
arm is activated on and to ipv6 enabled
clients are residing on the same subnet

282
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,890
they are able to communicate over this
on

283
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:08,170
linked local on address and

284
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,329
on the the Force 1s are multicast

285
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:16,339
as you may know poem I view 6 heavily
relies on August based

286
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:19,709
on traffic soul there are no broadcast
address those

287
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:23,360
anymore like in the ipv4 world on

288
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,949
there is this especial multicast address
which is more or less a broadcast

289
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:28,640
address and with

290
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,800
in disguise its arm FF on 02

291
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,159
column column 1 which is just idea

292
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,530
it's called the link local all notes
multicast address

293
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:43,160
column column 1

294
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,850
think local all all holes on notes

295
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:51,480
which as a set is just a broadcast that
was in the skies

296
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,880
on because s the name already implies
every ipv6 into

297
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,770
I enabled host has to join up dis link
low commodity costs group and if I send

298
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:00,350
the packet

299
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:03,460
up to do this on multicast group the

300
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,830
system receiving the packets has to at
least process

301
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:10,620
this packets sold from a technical point
of you

302
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,090
it is a multicast up address but on

303
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:21,030
it is a broadcast in this guy from my
point of view at least yeah

304
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:25,510
then we have on has already set some
addresses and their scope

305
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:29,630
we have a note local scope we of course
a loopback address are many I P six were

306
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,340
also in the IP for what it was

307
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,730
represented by 127.0.0.1 typically

308
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:38,490
on in the ipv6 walls it's just column
column 1

309
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:43,000
we have our link local address those
then we had for a long time something

310
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,480
called

311
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,480
height local address the city's fight
loca actresses

312
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,080
are but are on deprecated as of now and
to the successor to tease

313
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,450
onsite local addresses are do you need
local Atlas

314
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:58,210
then we up

315
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:03,780
um yeah are you need local at recess and
we have of course all global

316
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:07,670
on at Asus globally routed unreachable
ads

317
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:11,640
they are more or less equivalent to the
public ipv4 addresses

318
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,520
which we know on from legacy product all
so

319
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,090
arm typically do you

320
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:25,770
standards a collar prefix I source up
its size and ipv6 world

321
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,620
is on 64bits sold the first on

322
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,080
64bits Rd network at nt fire and

323
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,480
the last 64bits Rd upon interface

324
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,260
um identify a there are a couple of ways
how does interface um identify gets

325
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,700
of configure its you can of course
configure you i've you think that rests

326
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,230
on your

327
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:48,660
on your system static like in the ipv4
world

328
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,560
or on you some automatic

329
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,300
mechanisms implemented in ipv6 the first
mechanism

330
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,270
walls the UI is 64 which stands for
extended unique

331
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:02,850
on identify our basically im on what
this done

332
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:06,210
alum the host takes is 48

333
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:09,420
on bit mac Address and fills up

334
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:13,250
well 16 bits to get Steve are 64bits

335
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:17,440
arm so that a yes on the 64 bits for the
interface identify a

336
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,670
I'm too and then army has won a 28

337
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:24,820
its address box you can of course we'll
I'll disappear with six as well

338
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,830
on same procedure more or less

339
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:31,600
ass in the IP four worlds with wonder I

340
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,270
exceptional in the DHCP before world we
were able to

341
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:39,610
poem to distribute default route
information

342
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:43,120
to clients which isn't the case

343
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,140
in the dhcpv6 world you are not able to
distribute any default route information

344
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,750
over the CPB 6

345
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:53,130
you have to rely on other mechanism so
that the clients get there

346
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:56,680
on before gateway which will cover
enough people

347
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:01,060
a couple of minutes but from an address
assignment point of view

348
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:05,450
you can use dhcpv6 like in the ipv4 then

349
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:09,440
um then we have the so-called privacy
extensions

350
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,840
of privacy extensions where on developed

351
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:19,220
couple of years ago as the on
improvement you I 64

352
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:23,260
because when you're using you I 64 you
half the problem

353
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:28,400
that's regardless in which ipv6 network
you i connect confer connect that

354
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:34,220
you will up half the same interface
identify every time because the clyde is

355
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:38,370
just you think the 48-bit mac Address
which typically does not change

356
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:41,490
on besides you are on switching your all

357
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:45,100
network interface card soul arm

358
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,320
they said well yeah hmm that's not that
good

359
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,530
because we could maybe up get tracked
because we have

360
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,040
regardless of the IIPs six that ok we
are in no we

361
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:00,630
will use diem the same interfaith
identify am so dits came up with another

362
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:04,840
approach to configure this on interface
identify up

363
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,950
which is called privacy fence shins
basically

364
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:12,460
on the interface identify is not derive
2 I'm from the mac address

365
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:16,690
but the special algorithm which is
specified

366
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:20,050
in the RC you is used to on

367
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:23,830
to generate a random interface identify
a

368
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:28,500
and in addition to that some the EU
client using privacy extensions

369
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,250
issue obvious generating a second
address this second battle Steve

370
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,020
so-called temporary address

371
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,080
and this temporary address will be used
for

372
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,890
every im communication up initiated by
my client

373
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:45,360
so and this temporary address has a
short

374
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,590
bomb lifetime so that this address gets
changed

375
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:53,250
problem I think this the default value
our one day or seven days I'm not 100

376
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,130
percent sure

377
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:57,980
Saudi intentions okay when my client
initiates a connection at you

378
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:01,100
any given system he is using the
temporary address

379
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,970
and of the one day or one week or
whatever on time frame

380
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:09,160
he will generate new temporary address
which you will use

381
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,290
for every communication which is
initiated by on

382
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:16,080
at this client in Syrian to Songz

383
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,850
good and addresses these privacy related
issues

384
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:23,150
arm which you I 64 brings with it

385
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,480
but from an enterprise for corporate
Pointe a few

386
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,800
on its more or less a pain in the ass

387
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,840
I'm sorry for that but because on

388
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,350
when you think about filtering you will
have a hard time

389
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:42,210
implements of ACLs or firewall rules

390
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:46,610
for clients which article on which are
everyday

391
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:49,880
which are generating and you address
which are using fault going

392
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,780
communication a

393
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:54,880
on every day and just that you get an
idea

394
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,180
on how does looks like as we are
fearfully

395
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:04,030
or dual stack network

396
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:06,710
as you can see here that's just my wife
alive on

397
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:10,610
interface and long as you can see here
my

398
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:13,770
well Windows 7 client has generated

399
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:17,630
to on at missus to ipv6 address from a
given

400
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:21,080
on prefix the you

401
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,360
I would call it the public or standard
ipv6

402
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,890
on address and then the second address
the temporary address

403
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:32,080
and as we can see here a up until the
forty

404
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,660
on that's the ad network ID and
everything after the fortieth the

405
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:39,610
on interface identify up and

406
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:42,809
my client will use this temporary
address

407
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:46,200
s source address for every communication
the client

408
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,429
on initiates so let's say for example
when I issue a ping

409
00:24:50,429 --> 00:24:54,780
which I should already have running we
should just

410
00:24:54,780 --> 00:25:01,780
just have to file Wireshark very quickly

411
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:11,570
so as you can see here I'm thinking some
ipv6

412
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:14,629
on systems which is just arm Google

413
00:25:14,629 --> 00:25:21,629
ants I just opted for a minute so as we
can see here at this also does my client

414
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:27,589
is using is steel

415
00:25:27,589 --> 00:25:30,859
on 23 year or two or three on p1

416
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:34,159
having a look back to do. on interface

417
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,269
on configuration oh we see now on that

418
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:40,409
the 23:01 is my temporary address

419
00:25:40,409 --> 00:25:44,940
at this address on has a shorter
lifetime

420
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,079
then the on ipv6 address here

421
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:51,379
which we can see it when we issue a
specific

422
00:25:51,379 --> 00:25:58,379
ants

423
00:25:59,149 --> 00:26:03,509
yeah as we can see here we out the
you'll ever on all the public address

424
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:06,830
and we have our temporary address and we
as we can see here

425
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:11,499
the public on address has now a ballad
lifetime of 30 days

426
00:26:11,499 --> 00:26:15,369
which is just the year which are
adjusted default values from arm

427
00:26:15,369 --> 00:26:19,169
youths well on the Cisco routers for a
lifetime when they're sending

428
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:20,419
ratatisements

429
00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:24,610
and we have to you temperature address
in this case it was

430
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:28,590
form seven days and after

431
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:32,609
the seven days room the client's
generates a new temporary address

432
00:26:32,609 --> 00:26:35,899
which he then will use

433
00:26:35,899 --> 00:26:39,759
as a source on my p6 address for every
communication

434
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:43,830
all for every outpolled communication to
but

435
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:47,009
love my climes of course reachable over
both

436
00:26:47,009 --> 00:26:50,399
on at recess on the public as well as
the temporary

437
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:53,999
so all if I would have to death aged
over

438
00:26:53,999 --> 00:26:57,529
active I could youth both addresses to

439
00:26:57,529 --> 00:27:00,899
on initiate to you SSH connection to

440
00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:05,220
but for every outgoing connection with
people always Houston temporary address

441
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:12,220
as a source

442
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:21,080
new

443
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,990
yeah and then the on to: last approach

444
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:29,460
on in regards to mom interface the
degeneration a

445
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:33,300
src 72 on 17 yr

446
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,560
on defied or developed by

447
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,800
on foot on the ground who is also here
at the ipv6 security summit

448
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,150
um basically im RC 72

449
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:47,390
17 a on describes the so-called stable

450
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:50,410
of privacy addresses soul

451
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:54,170
on the basic principle is or thats the
client

452
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:57,800
want to join Selina and I view 6 that
broke its configures

453
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,370
a random generated interface identify
I'll

454
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:04,940
but this random interface that and if I
O if

455
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:08,930
stable as long as the clyde is connected
to this ipv6

456
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:13,210
network so if I leave the not broken
join another join another route network

457
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:16,220
he will generate on and another

458
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,810
interface identify up but as long as I
will be a

459
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:23,370
part of a specific network this
interface identify out

460
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:27,030
will not change so that I have a stable

461
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:30,110
I view 6 address inside a given ipv6

462
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:34,760
on network I and thats my client is not
generating

463
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,040
on a new address every months seven days
bus

464
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,990
I'm not aware of any a operating system
which already

465
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:47,860
or implemented these of privacy or just
a beloved on privacy at Russell's

466
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,790
what at least from my understanding its
should be just a matter of time

467
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:55,240
until this happens but I haven't seen on

468
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,970
an operating system if you know more on
I would be happy to hear it

469
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,980
but on DSR the

470
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,320
different mechanisms which can be used
to you

471
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,540
on generate the interface identify

472
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:12,890
yeah this up we already have spoken
about

473
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:17,400
DUI 64 and the random generator value
privacy extensions

474
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,670
meant to combat a scanning and hiding
the identity

475
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:24,110
and is the default on every a
windows-based

476
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:27,370
operating system starting with Windows
Vista

477
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:30,470
ants on depending on the

478
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:33,350
actual Linux version A

479
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:35,480
it is nowadays

480
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,130
I think that the fog at least four 12
and some other couple of

481
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:43,460
on arm Linux systems where they also use
the

482
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:46,880
privacy extension as the default
mechanism to generate the interface

483
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:53,880
identify

484
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,900
come on midas wanna do %um

485
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,900
work shoots so

486
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,690
arm that's about it you ipv6 address

487
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:07,240
or interface on ID generational

488
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,990
so the next important product Colless

489
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:15,810
ICP v6 India legacy product called for
ipv4

490
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:19,850
technically it we could survive for IP
four would function without

491
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:24,010
arm ICM p.m. but it was an important
part a call on the specially for

492
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:25,190
troubleshooting purposes

493
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:28,630
on just to verify connectivity im to on

494
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:33,010
or to communicate ara conditions onto
into receiving host

495
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:37,500
this has fundamentally changed in the
ice in PB six world without

496
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,620
ICMP v6 ipv6 is not working at all

497
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:46,210
I one reason for that this India ipv4
world we had a separate product call

498
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:50,400
which was responsible for the resolution
of and mac address to a given IP IP

499
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,070
address

500
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:56,000
which was of address resolution protocol
in the ipv6 what we do and have of it

501
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,190
anymore and the functionality of of job
loss

502
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,720
integrated into ice in p6 sold their
house to you

503
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,190
special ICP v6 on

504
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:09,460
message us which are just responsible
for

505
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:12,860
the on so-called neighbor on discovery

506
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:16,280
which we will on which will show you on

507
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:20,200
in a minute and on they include its

508
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,600
some other form functions into ICP v6

509
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,210
up for example when you're doing well
the house based routing you had in the

510
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:31,090
IQ for what up my supper public a light
sheen p.m.

511
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:34,390
I which was used by climbs to

512
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:38,600
to tell the rattle your alter are I want
to receive

513
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,520
on them article space traffic for group
X or Y

514
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,710
and dysfunctionality was also no
implemented into ICP b6

515
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:50,490
are based on on modu Martha Custis the
discovery

516
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:55,020
essentially on it is working ass in the
IP for world but it's not a separate

517
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:55,870
public all

518
00:31:55,870 --> 00:32:00,840
on anymore it is realized rising people
sick scientists but a special case

519
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,830
on over the

520
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:05,850
modern health discovery of protocol yeah

521
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:09,250
ants as a set ICP six is an integral
part

522
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:12,370
and without ICP 6 ipv6 just us

523
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:19,370
work so yes just the

524
00:32:20,179 --> 00:32:23,409
quick list of some main I simply be six
type

525
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:27,130
on some of them which will cover all
later on

526
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:31,169
we of course some destination
unreachable same behavior as an

527
00:32:31,169 --> 00:32:34,820
in the ipv4 world then we have to you
packet to peak

528
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,100
on ICMP v6 message which

529
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,980
at least or from my point of US one of
the

530
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:45,299
form most important I i'm i simply v6

531
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:48,649
of messages why on because as a

532
00:32:48,649 --> 00:32:52,190
set a couple of minutes ago
fragmentation is only optional

533
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:55,630
in the ipv6 world and on

534
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:58,809
what does happen in the ipv4 world when
Iran to get the packets

535
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:02,210
I at the packet as bigger then dnt u

536
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:05,799
where the up that way to pack it has to
be transmitted wassup what does the

537
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:06,380
route to do

538
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,399
yeah

539
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:13,120
fragments packets soul I in the IP six
world

540
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,159
a router well never fragments a packet

541
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,340
when fragmentation is needed the source

542
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:22,649
on has to fragment the packet and
destination

543
00:33:22,649 --> 00:33:25,990
has to reassemble these fragments

544
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:29,070
but arm a rather we'll never

545
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:32,110
fragments any given on my view 6 packets

546
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:35,470
when it on in the ipv6 world

547
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:40,769
so but what happens now when the robber
receive an ipv6 packets and the packet

548
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:41,690
is larger than the

549
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:44,919
that then the end to use ice of the link
here

550
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:48,169
discards the packet and sent in error
message back

551
00:33:48,169 --> 00:33:52,549
to the source indicating well army said
I received the packet from you

552
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:56,500
but the Packers to bake please
fragmented and this is real life

553
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,100
over the bob packwood to peak on message

554
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,919
soul you should on always

555
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,340
allow this ice in PB 6 message

556
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,929
if you have up security policy in the
ipv4 world

557
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:14,950
which just the nice every on my CPU

558
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:15,429
on

559
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:20,260
education you shoots on think about it
in the ipv6 role

560
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:23,429
at least you should a you have to allow

561
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:27,179
on the package peak a message just to
make sure that ipv6

562
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:31,069
office work 'em working otherwise on you
could

563
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,510
Ron into connectivity issues because
when the client

564
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:38,409
does not know that he has two fragments
up the packets because the because the

565
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,419
packet filtered

566
00:34:39,419 --> 00:34:42,730
armpits the connection to the
destination up on

567
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:47,500
can't just beautiful established yeah

568
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,799
then we have our on echo request like a
reply

569
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:54,250
same thing as any I before world we have

570
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:59,160
$1.3 M A D related on packets the crime
rate the report and the done message

571
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,150
the crow the query messages sent out by
the router

572
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:07,210
on to find arm klein's connected to a
local Inc

573
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:10,400
arm which remember of any given on

574
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,690
want to cast group I'm when a client
receives up McCrary message he answers

575
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:19,260
with the report message so that the rod
and also OK

576
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:22,440
on this link their clients a member of
mother gospel

577
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,740
X by and see you and then we of the

578
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:29,190
muddy health was not done message
whether when a client wants to leave a

579
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,609
specific multicast group

580
00:35:30,609 --> 00:35:35,250
it's just that the ban message to D are
to our Terms autorad okay

581
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:39,530
there's there's a client wants to leave
are a given what the cat address

582
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:43,030
so then we have to new

583
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:47,480
on ICP 6i per types which we haven't in
the IP four worlds

584
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:52,730
on so-called rather solicitation and
brought advertisements in the ipv6

585
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:56,750
on world's a client's where ipv6 is
enabled

586
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:59,760
tries to find or alter

587
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:06,760
or on

588
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:08,720
in

589
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,390
accuse me

590
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:14,240
him how does he do that

591
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,360
well army just sent the router
solicitation of on just basic

592
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:23,120
put it here so that you can see it
better when we have just

593
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,180
basic setup we have our router we have
our switch

594
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:31,840
and we have to climb connected to it on
the soonest I V six tickets initialize

595
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,460
on the router the clients on configure
this link local address

596
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,150
antitrust fines and arm router

597
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:42,370
on which he tries to find by sending

598
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:49,370
a a router solicitation to he sensed
this

599
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:57,660
rather solicitation to those the special

wear purple to one there thanks

601
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:06,480
and this multicast addresses calls

605
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:19,490
and as the name implies every for
wanting to bias

606
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:22,940
have to join this arm link local routers

607
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,570
up more dick ass after us so that one
declined to set the router

solicitation a distance to do sling
locomotive has address

609
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,590
the rather arm gets a packet

610
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:36,980
processes it's and answers with them

611

center or the solicitation

618
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:12,570
the router said well there may be other
up by pew six clients on this segment

619
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:16,520
which all want to know the information
stored in router advertisement

620
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:20,340
so instead of unique housing on the
packets into the actual source

621
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,550
it he is sending a packet onto the link
local all notes

622
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:27,000
a multicast address sold I'm to ensure a
Kate that

623
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,210
every klein's I'm connected to dissect
meant is receiving and processing the

624
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:38,210
router advertisements

625
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:43,510
soul and this is a

626
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:47,800
process new to the ipv6 on or new to
ipv6

627
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:52,090
and desist on every time a client or

628
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:55,400
the ipv6 at stack gets initialized these

629
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,200
I a router advertisements are sent in
response to receive

630
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,810
rather solicitation up but they're also
sent are ya dick leave

631
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:06,070
in a specific on configurable time on

632
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:10,210
interpol on here in this environment I
have put the

633
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:14,510
on interpol pretty short warm I think it
was four seconds

634
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:17,790
so every four seconds the are router

635
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:20,800
on the sending on the rod advertisement
to disarm

636
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,000
on link local almost unique estabas just
to make sure when new client

637
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,400
I'm connects to the network that he will
receive yet the rod advertisement

638
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,690
are pretty bomb fast so that he can
configure

639
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:35,090
the are ipv6 on address

640
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:42,090
for example and maybe we have luck and
we see that's

641
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,420
no most 11 on

642
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,900
the problem or problem it is the problem

643
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:57,260
but as we can see here we Jones we
haven't seen

644
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:01,490
any router advertisements arm the reason
for that is that

645
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:04,660
the our overall a while a slang
controller on

646
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:08,360
is filtering these periodic are

647
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,640
a route appetizing I could ask yourself
would be wise the filtering thats

648
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,890
because sending a router advertisement
every 63 seconds

649
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:19,730
over the world at the wifi connection to
on to every client

650
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:24,050
way through a lot of airtime so what
what about the WLC do

651
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:27,480
on he has some so-called route that but
I

652
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,480
problem so that he will let pass armor
of advertisement

653
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,600
once at re Bob 30 minutes but when a new
client

654
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,730
joins network in the center of the
solicitation at the climb

655
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,170
and they're all set

656
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:43,990
I gets

657
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:47,180
up its

658
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:51,579
through but sui as we have few or Wyatt

659
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:54,680
connection do we so

660
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,950
well just know alger

661
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:02,380
no its okay from as we have few or

662
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,380
lap network which is not connected to
the on

663
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:10,160
to the National Conference at work but

664
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:16,700
behavior still the same so we should see

665
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:23,300
ideally

666
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:30,300
our advertisements knots interesting

667
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:50,079
so this looks better so Lionsgate
initialize

668
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:57,079
and as we can see here we're we see all
advertisements

669
00:42:04,849 --> 00:42:08,320
prisons

670
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,480
so as we can see here and they are quite
some information stored

671
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,790
Indias arm rod advertisement on

672
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:18,430
on the wild side on the throttle us of
course not

673
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:21,610
on throttle that anyway I'm so when you
ok connected to the

674
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:25,680
wired network you will see the rod
appetizers every 63 seconds

675
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,890
and we can see you on couple of
information

676
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:32,360
which are transported in the AM router
advertisement

677
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:37,160
as we can see here on we have the prefix
information

678
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,590
up but this is the mechanism so that the
Klein nose a que

679
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:44,670
which actual bomb prefix is on that
local subnet

680
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:47,760
and as we can see here its 2802

681
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,610
80 got a I got up but slash 64

682
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:55,290
so on my client on par with this
information

683
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:58,560
and configures and ipv6 address from

684
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,870
dis well prefix based on the

685
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:05,290
privacy extensions which were which we
discussed

686
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:09,520
earlier and as we can see on

687
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:15,090
years now my are wired connection up as
soon as my clients on gets ratatisements

688
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:18,920
army dolls are okay on the network well
identifiers

689
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:23,080
Rd 64bits so I'll continue and configure
mine

690
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,720
interface identify up based on the
privacy extensions

691
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,850
so that my client for that yes on an
ipv6

692
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:34,860
from address and connection up and

693
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:39,740
the year second thing we see now is that
mean all have at the for Gateway

694
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:43,610
FB 80 call in column 1 on

695
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:47,410
and dis default gateway gets installed

696
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:51,510
arm because my client receives rod
advertisement because the logic inside

697
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:52,440
the client as well

698
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,870
well my receive ratatisements soul its

699
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:59,130
should come from a rodham and I should
use them ASM

700
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:04,180
Bob default router so there's no special
optional inside the rod advertisement

701
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:08,350
advertisement was specifies the KP some
thought this router as a default

702
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:11,770
are gateway my client implicitly

703
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:14,940
on configures this love the Global
Address

704
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:21,520
asses on default gateway which

705
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,770
as you can see here

706
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:25,820
this is our ballots on rather

707
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:29,540
he is sending from the sauce at the
eighty call upon the one and

708
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:34,110
on my clients assaulting or is using
this link local address

709
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:41,110
ass his default gateway

710
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:48,980
then we have a couple of other on
information your DNS servers

711
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:55,150
ipv6 a and ipv4 ants

712
00:44:55,150 --> 00:45:00,830
we have actually here does that we have
two mechanisms to provide the client

713
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:01,750
with the DNS

714
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:06,540
on server on the problem this for a long
time of it was impossible to distribute

715
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,310
the US or information over

716
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:12,550
router advertisements arm

717
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:15,900
but this s finally being fix the

718
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:21,170
and so on guy to F release than Ammar
CRC 6106 on

719
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:24,580
which enhanced these ratatisements

720
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:28,170
I'm so that I can on in thirds recursive
DNS

721
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:31,470
on server information up which I have
done or

722
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:35,700
luckily we are using on an up-to-date

723
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:39,240
emission or core alter are which
supports

724
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,880
this feature problem is the

725
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:48,830
ball occurrence or from client operating
system at least 10 and the my personal

726
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:50,040
space do not support

727
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,460
dis on on this information so even
though

728
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:58,130
it is installed on forces it is inside
the router advertisements

729
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:02,150
on at least Windows clients do not
process this information

730
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:05,270
Sol arm in order to get then

731
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:08,480
windows-based client up the DNS server
information we have to

732
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,360
we have to rely on DHCP b6 are which is
called

733
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,650
in dis in this scenario the stateless
arm

734
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:20,540
variant up because we do not distribute
ipv6 addresses all but disappeared six

735
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:22,940
the only reason we are using the CPB
sixes

736
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:27,190
is to distribute Tina serve information
to the client's which are not able to

737
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:31,360
to parse DS obscene a service provided
in your old advertisements

738
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,950
it depends on the f-bomb operating
system

739
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:38,110
whether or not at this on can get
workers

740
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:42,030
option is supported at least in the
window space

741
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:45,480
are it isn't I'm not 100 percent sure
whether Microsoft will

742
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,130
included Windows tender but as far as I
know they won't

743
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:52,360
they say well we have the CPB 6 when you

744
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,680
when your clients want to have

745
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,750
the exit 6 well the S or fis use

746
00:46:56,750 --> 00:47:03,750
well dhcpv6 yeah and then we have to use
of league play at us with just the mac

747
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:07,720
address of the

748
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:11,849
of the router on soul that of an
association between

749
00:47:11,849 --> 00:47:15,349
deal link local address the FCAT kala
kala one anti

750
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:19,420
on sourcing play address on which %uh
stance towards in my

751
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:23,880
neighbor cache and this is the only

752
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,089
a mechanism which can be used to
distribute default route information to

753
00:47:28,089 --> 00:47:28,710
the client's

754
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:32,450
on you do not have has already set any
possibility to

755
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:35,660
on distributes default route information

756
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:39,710
a bar over the ACP b6 there was quite a
lot of discussions

757
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:43,880
a couple of years ago inside the idea of
well ship should be provide some

758
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:47,720
the default route information about the
subpoenas six their walls on

759
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:52,349
a draft were shiner on issued by the
IETF

760
00:47:52,349 --> 00:47:55,390
from abuts form at least for

761
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:58,720
two or three years the no work was done
with this

762
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,000
on draft on the draft already expired so
do not expect

763
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,259
that this option gets implemented into
dhcpv6

764
00:48:06,259 --> 00:48:12,589
in a reasonable time which is quite
unfortunate from I'm on point of your

765
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:17,160
I'm speaking from her corporate network
administrator point of view you now have

766
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,970
to rely on two mechanisms to provide
declines with the flow

767
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:23,390
on configuration and after you have to
rely on DA CPU

768
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:27,559
at least for a DNS server information a
and you have to rely on route at the

769
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:28,490
Titans to

770
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:32,920
provide the prefix information when
you're using on the rod advertising for

771
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:36,900
the prefix Jenna up for the interface
generation up and

772
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,609
on forty on default gateway

773
00:48:40,609 --> 00:48:44,440
which is unfortunate but are we have to
deal with the situation

774
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,619
and I'm not sure that this will change
on

775
00:48:47,619 --> 00:48:54,059
at all

776
00:48:54,059 --> 00:48:58,020
so and then the last two mail
solicitation a bad but I spence

777
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:01,500
that these two packets argues to ICMP

778
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,890
on packets are used for on

779
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:08,660
forty address on resolution other so

780
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:11,890
from chris Sligh yes so basically a

781
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:15,990
on idea a neighbor solicitation well
miss the equivalent

782
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:19,160
to DM on are requests and the

783
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,720
neighbor advertisement is the equivalent
we r reply

784
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:29,720
sup

785
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:33,770
hope

786
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:37,569
them home so I'll

787
00:49:37,569 --> 00:49:41,339
basically on when to quit went to ipv6
lines are connected

788
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:45,299
onto the same link and they want to
communicate without

789
00:49:45,299 --> 00:49:49,000
with each other they of course need to
up the mac address of the of the

790
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,529
on destination so when we FL us

791
00:49:52,529 --> 00:49:58,960
and when you fall what a basic what they
basically do s

792
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:03,069
on I just want to communicate with Paul
on El assess the ipv6 address from Paul

793
00:50:03,069 --> 00:50:06,240
but not the mac address what else is
doing is that sense

794
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,770
naval solicitation to a specific
multicast address

795
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:13,450
ants

796
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:16,730
ball is answering with them

797
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:19,930
neighbor advertisement and this

798
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:23,869
neighbor advertisement close the mac
address of all and so allah says every

799
00:50:23,869 --> 00:50:24,910
information she needs

800
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:28,750
I to on initiating communication up and

801
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:32,440
TN as a solution is

802
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:35,559
done and performed overt is to I simply
be six

803
00:50:35,559 --> 00:50:40,849
bomb types

804
00:50:40,849 --> 00:50:44,109
yeah well the neighbors cover protocol

805
00:50:44,109 --> 00:50:47,390
on which we discussed now as a couple of

806
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:52,290
all tasks rather discovery overall
brought a solicitation or advertisements

807
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:53,400
prefix discovery

808
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:58,430
on address all the configuration a
public address detection Obama's another

809
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:02,380
mechanisms of course when it when I P
six clients on configures

810
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:06,079
I'm an ipv6 address it has to make sure
that this IP six address is unique

811
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:10,740
otherwise I'm you run into issues arm
with

812
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:13,910
on topic and ipv6 madrasas same problem

813
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:18,089
as we have on the IP four World yeah

814
00:51:18,089 --> 00:51:22,190
that the address for the other solution
we have here neighbor felicitation

815
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:25,490
and then neighbor advertisement and

816
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:28,800
when this process are missed on both
both update their

817
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:33,369
so-called neighbor cache the neighbor
cache s moralistic well into the OPP

818
00:51:33,369 --> 00:51:33,920
cash

819
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,420
well more it's a funky up cash more or
less I'm so mad that I have a local

820
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:38,910
cache

821
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:43,220
from where half do you on Association up
to from an

822
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:47,020
given ipv6 address to a given on mac
Address

823
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:50,940
which I can of course form look at any
have a look at

824
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:57,940
as you can see it's not so easy as in
the ipv4 world where just

825
00:51:58,069 --> 00:52:01,619
the to are attache a you have to rely on
that

826
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:05,640
that letters age interface ipv6 a show
or

827
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:10,359
neighbors ants

828
00:52:10,359 --> 00:52:13,660
when we

829
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:16,890
what we see here's on on our on my

830
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:21,210
a wired connection up with a mess we can
see I have a couple of

831
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:24,280
a month ago also address those I'll

832
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:28,180
about the only you other on entry in
this

833
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:31,520
in this cash is for my default router
fkd kala kala 10

834
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,730
on this association to the physical
address which was provided

835
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:38,069
Bob from the router advertisements and
d-type

836
00:52:38,069 --> 00:52:41,619
is in reachable so

837
00:52:41,619 --> 00:52:46,010
on when I'm want to ping FB 80 column
called a 10

838
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:49,550
I do not have to duty upon neighbor
solution up on because I

839
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:56,550
all information I need onto arm
construct a layer to fray

840
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:09,570
yeah naval solicitation goes all out to
a specific multicast address

841
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:12,980
on ball well process the packet

842
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:16,460
answers with the neighbor advertisement
both up that the neighbor cache

843
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:19,990
and them they're all all setting can
communicate with each other

844
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:23,110
soul and on

845
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:27,090
this mechanism is also used forty about
public 8

846
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:33,340
on address detection let me see if

847
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:37,530
we have see you next year yeah

848
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:40,600
here with here we can see if we see a
packet on

849
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:44,740
with a source address up column column
this is the

850
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:48,010
special on address

851
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:52,230
which is used for the topic 8 on address
detection

852
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:56,170
what we see here now is the target
address this is the address

853
00:53:56,170 --> 00:53:59,750
my clients want to configure up for is
interface

854
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:03,090
but before he can use this ipv6 address
on the interface

855
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:06,130
yes to validate that this ipv6 address

856
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:10,290
is unique so we can't use it so an audit
you

857
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:13,380
on ensure a que nobody else has theirs I
P six

858
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:16,980
or link local ipv6 addresses address he
uses the

859
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:20,310
a source address calling column which is
the so-called

860
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:23,620
unspecified address and on

861
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:27,150
the destination to is a special

862
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:30,450
multicast based on address which
corresponds

863
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:34,210
to dis up target address and when my
client

864
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:37,580
does not here on anything or does not
get a reply

865
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:42,210
he sings like a are I am the only one
messes address and then he subsequently

866
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:45,990
is using his address as you can see here
he is waiting

867
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:49,700
not very long warm how much is that

868
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:53,040
but one milliseconds on

869
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,220
he's waiting for an answer doesn't get
an answer

870
00:54:56,220 --> 00:55:00,370
and then you see in the next packet he's
using this on target address

871
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:05,340
essence normal salsa dress because the
duplicate address detection walls

872
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:10,520
successful from the try point of view at
the same of course happens

873
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:15,450
here but as you can see here here it is
40% of global address list as soon as

874
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:16,040
the client

875
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,000
a mercy for auto advertisement and

876
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,330
as the a prefix information optional
process

877
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:24,910
p.m. I'm continues to configure the
interface identify a

878
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:29,220
and of course yes to make sure that this
are my pts Globalive you think this is

879
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:29,810
also

880
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:34,350
oMG unique and he's doing that by the
same

881
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:37,430
mom mechanism up twice

882
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:41,130
because forty public address and forty
temporary address

883
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:44,450
and as we can see here on

884
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:47,830
after that diem to pick it up a

885
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:52,110
address that actual successful or
develop daschle successful

886
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:59,110
and then his using two that rose ASM a
source

887
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:04,610
yet all these information a on what is
association between

888
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:08,770
india Mac Address Andy ipv6 address
assorted neighbor cache

889
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:11,780
and it's a little bit more

890
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:15,520
fancied India our cash in the ipv4 world

891
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:19,180
well in the ipv6 world the year and
trees

892
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:22,980
in the neighbor cache could have can
half Bob different states

893
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:26,190
on the first date is incomplete
incomplete just means a que

894
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:30,470
send out an able solicitation 02 on to
get an

895
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:33,780
to get the mac address of a given ipv6
address but

896
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:37,950
up my client has received an answer yet
salt on reachable

897
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:41,320
as soon as he you on receive an answer

898
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:44,680
the %um the state's goal from
incompletes

899
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:49,170
to about reachable and then the whole
point of teeth

900
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:52,190
other on states this that the entry

901
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:55,640
in the neighbor cache does not timeout
in the IP four World

902
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:59,400
if you do not have up communication with
the endpoint for a bomb

903
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:03,710
but for a couple of minutes the entry
gets removed and address resolution has

904
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:04,240
two people

905
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:09,170
has to be performed when I want to
communicate with again in the ipv6 world

906
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:12,340
they wanted to add okay love we should
use the

907
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:15,880
chatter on for the neighbor discovery

908
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:19,070
sodium neighbor cache entries

909
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:23,750
have just different states so what is
basically boils down to is

910
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:26,980
even though it is to %uh I'm
communication parties are not

911
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,470
communicating with each other

912
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:32,800
on day up trying to reach is up each
other to verify that there are still

913
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:33,490
there

914
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:37,720
and if the if this is the case they
aren't this up this entry here we'll

915
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,720
never timeout

916
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:42,720
and he will are golfer be from reachable
to stay odelay

917
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:46,390
probe and and at the end of the day as
soon as the

918
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:49,790
a the targets reachable a.m. this we are
reachable

919
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:53,110
the year never cash and we will be
unreachable states and

920
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:59,279
not on gets deleted from the neighbor
cache

921
00:57:59,279 --> 00:58:02,119
yeah well we always talked about its on
the

922
00:58:02,119 --> 00:58:05,460
are brought up on Discovery based on the
router solicitation

923
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:08,799
and the router on advertising message us
to get together

924
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:14,190
to probation on declines on

925
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:18,670
based on as based on the link local
address

926
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:21,940
well big locomotive has address on the
router sending its

927
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:25,170
with you think local notes mordechai
address to

928
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:28,829
so that Alice on receives the I get

929
00:58:28,829 --> 00:58:32,819
and configures for on interface identify
by herself

930
00:58:32,819 --> 00:58:36,910
yeah

931
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:40,859
and this we already talked about to pass
on to discovery im

932
00:58:40,859 --> 00:58:45,239
that is in the new mechanism in the IP
on six what we have to say mechanism in

933
00:58:45,239 --> 00:58:48,690
the ipv4 worlds but in the iPad for what
it's just broker

934
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:51,900
because arm many you or

935
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:56,509
intermediate you guys are just plain
filtering on ICMP upon packets

936
00:58:56,509 --> 00:58:59,759
so possums and to discovery at least the
IP forward

937
00:58:59,759 --> 00:59:05,410
never rocks but on in the IP six world
it is necessary argument that it works

938
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:06,809
otherwise you will run into could

939
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:10,549
connectivity issues because on the rod
estimates

940
00:59:10,549 --> 00:59:14,170
fragment the packets on day it's discard
them and

941
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:17,239
send ICMP packet to pick our own message
back to the source

942
00:59:17,239 --> 00:59:20,969
of the packets if the source does not
receive this error message to source

943
00:59:20,969 --> 00:59:22,329
does not know that it has to

944
00:59:22,329 --> 00:59:25,700
has two fragments the packets

945
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:29,519
at the connection to a given and system
does not all cannot be established

946
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:34,619
so you should make sure a that you have
in your file room certainly got side

947
00:59:34,619 --> 00:59:35,849
view 6 you should have

948
00:59:35,849 --> 00:59:39,479
what you must in RC term terminology

949
00:59:39,479 --> 00:59:44,289
you must allow D's packet to pick
message us otherwise to will run

950
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:51,289
into problems arm sooner or later so

951
00:59:52,249 --> 00:59:56,329
buttons

952
00:59:56,329 --> 00:59:58,369
as we have seen there are several types
of

953
00:59:58,369 --> 01:00:01,369
all the configuration on the stateless

954
01:00:01,369 --> 01:00:05,260
by means of the rod appetizers as we
have seen on the router

955
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:09,010
on the rod advertisement has some Puri a
PI all

956
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:12,130
a prefix information optional which we
have seen

957
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:15,280
arm and a sort of my clients on process
this information

958
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:19,780
he starts to configure is interface
identify on I

959
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:23,440
and in the meantime can also distribute
other para para meet us like in são

960
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:23,900
verse

961
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:27,839
at this Barrientos called slack
stateless address

962
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:31,720
up all the configurations so that you do
not have a central disappear observe

963
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,900
report s assignment

964
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:36,310
on the the router just inserts the

965
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:39,430
prefix information into the router
advertisement and declines configure

966
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:41,270
interface identify about itself

967
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:44,510
but of we can of course use arm

968
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:48,569
dhcpv6 for address assignment which is
also possible

969
01:00:48,569 --> 01:00:51,710
or we can use a

970
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:55,270
hybrid modes I would call it or staples
with a CPM

971
01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:58,819
where you for example youth on the rod
advertisement prefix information

972
01:00:58,819 --> 01:00:59,319
optional

973
01:00:59,319 --> 01:01:02,420
so that the kleins configure on their
ipv6

974
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:05,540
arm interface at that identify about
himself and

975
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:08,810
are using DHCP v6 justice a cutie in S

976
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:12,310
on server information to domain search
list

977
01:01:12,310 --> 01:01:15,310
or other DA CPU arm options

978
01:01:15,310 --> 01:01:19,260
which I use for some on specific use
cases

979
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:22,839
like on was a lie P A arm Wireless

980
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:26,650
on networks where you have to rely on
specific case appeal options

981
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:30,130
to a bob get information 2d phones

982
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:33,490
Wayfinder CallManager or in a while a
space

983
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:36,849
where the extra point can find their
while slam trawler

984
01:01:36,849 --> 01:01:40,069
and these are the parents which you can

985
01:01:40,069 --> 01:01:43,720
on use but you always have to rely

986
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:46,760
at least in a corporate environment on

987
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:51,450
both mechanisms ratatisements and dhcpv6
to provide the client with a

988
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:57,450
bomb will on configuration

989
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:59,880
yeah and here we see a I am

990
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:03,760
what can be distributed by which are
mechanisms

991
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,940
at this is Ken are distributed by Rod
advertisements

992
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:10,460
and all before state Superior 6 default
route

993
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:15,369
can only be in distributed by rod
advertisements not by dhcpv6

994
01:02:15,369 --> 01:02:19,500
DNS resolve up in the meantime can be
distributed by both

995
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:23,309
on mechanisms and of course all other DA
CPU

996
01:02:23,309 --> 01:02:27,300
on related options can only be on
unrealized

997
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:31,290
with the use of on dhcpv6 and

998
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:34,730
on to

999
01:02:34,730 --> 01:02:38,940
determine what information the client

1000
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:41,980
should requests from an day CPB 6

1001
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:45,050
server there are actually two flax

1002
01:02:45,050 --> 01:02:48,930
inside the router advertisement one if
the of lack

1003
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:52,339
which stands for other config ERATION
flack which basically tells

1004
01:02:52,339 --> 01:02:55,869
Bob the climbs but declined police

1005
01:02:55,869 --> 01:02:59,190
up go to disappear v6 over and get

1006
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:02,690
arm other configuration information like
DNS server

1007
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:05,829
or on prefix or did a search list

1008
01:03:05,829 --> 01:03:09,109
but not an address if the employer
cassettes

1009
01:03:09,109 --> 01:03:13,540
on this indicates the Clyde decay
declined please go to the dhcpv6 server

1010
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:16,900
on get an ipv6 address at all

1011
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:22,069
other configuration information to which
are on which TD HDCP 6-over

1012
01:03:22,069 --> 01:03:28,750
has to offer and diskettes on or just
realized by

1013
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:32,190
these to flex insides on the router

1014
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:36,329
on advertisements and when we have a
look here in our in our setup

1015
01:03:36,329 --> 01:03:41,630
Fuad Khan Khan one notice should

1016
01:03:41,630 --> 01:03:45,970
be in NOLA slots here we have its

1017
01:03:45,970 --> 01:03:49,760
on this this done here in the flax

1018
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,890
ants as you can see here at the AGM
flack

1019
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:57,299
bamadoro on network key is not set up
because we do not use these two people

1020
01:03:57,299 --> 01:03:58,530
64 address assignment

1021
01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:02,190
we only sets the of lecture just
indicate the cloud security appliance

1022
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:02,970
just on

1023
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:07,109
configure Outlook by urself and go to
the dhcpv6 server

1024
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:11,210
and ask for on T yes over ubdina search
list and so on

1025
01:04:11,210 --> 01:04:14,680
buddies to flex on

1026
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,769
will be used for that to indicate
decline decay

1027
01:04:17,769 --> 01:04:21,349
which I'll what information should I arm

1028
01:04:21,349 --> 01:04:28,349
shoots I asked you to p6 over 4

1029
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:36,420
Sol arm to summarize yeah we have quite
a

1030
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:41,050
different mode of operation 0 we have
different design goals

1031
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:44,819
form which one to be achieved in the
ipv6 world on

1032
01:04:44,819 --> 01:04:48,290
in comparison to the ipv4 world and we
have

1033
01:04:48,290 --> 01:04:52,089
are lots of flexibility upon introduced
into ipv6

1034
01:04:52,089 --> 01:04:55,450
on promise security I'll send standpoint

1035
01:04:55,450 --> 01:04:58,500
I'll let you decide whether it's a good
or bad thing to have this

1036
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:01,619
on kind of flexibility on

1037
01:05:01,619 --> 01:05:05,750
in some use cases list this flexibility
is definitely good but from an

1038
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:09,410
corporate ladder press perspective it
may not be the best

1039
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:13,640
thing cell on so

1040
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:18,609
coming today interesting part on the
ipv6 security

1041
01:05:18,609 --> 01:05:21,730
before we are talking about specific on

1042
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:25,300
attacks on I just want to talk about a
que

1043
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:29,319
Yasi view 6 armed security actually upon

1044
01:05:29,319 --> 01:05:34,200
soul hearts on just have a couple of
reasons which I just want to %uh arm

1045
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:37,290
present to you just so that you get a
better

1046
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:41,109
feeling okay why is that the case on

1047
01:05:41,109 --> 01:05:44,319
what will cover we will cover Tia trust
model

1048
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:47,569
and steel modes of provisioning which we
already covered India

1049
01:05:47,569 --> 01:05:51,020
on in his life before

1050
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:55,770
would then we will cover the so called
crypto optimism we will cover complexity

1051
01:05:55,770 --> 01:05:56,210
'em

1052
01:05:56,210 --> 01:05:59,800
say problem stack federal hetero jeden
sanity in

1053
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,910
and on the attack and defence as a
metric

1054
01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:06,730
sought the big problem s on as a set

1055
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:11,579
warm an hour ago we have this year we
have 2 20's anniversary of

1056
01:06:11,579 --> 01:06:15,569
on ipv6 at we have différents

1057
01:06:15,569 --> 01:06:18,930
on generations of ipv6 sex

1058
01:06:18,930 --> 01:06:23,380
for different functionalities for
neighbor discovery address election a

1059
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:26,190
generation of the interface identify and
so on

1060
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:30,270
we have our initial RC's night 1970 and
then we have

1061
01:06:30,270 --> 01:06:33,760
24-10 4861 the 6980

1062
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:37,210
yadda yadda yadda well the problem is

1063
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:40,470
you do not really know okay

1064
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:43,710
which generational 526 they could ask
your

1065
01:06:43,710 --> 01:06:46,980
on and point on implements

1066
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:50,150
Sol maybe he is using as an address
election

1067
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:53,220
up on algorithm is based on the

1068
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:59,099
older RC 3484 or do you updated version
that 67 up 42

1069
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:02,770
or how does the out of their clients
perform neighbor discovery this the

1070
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:04,660
neighbors company perform base on

1071
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:09,849
RC 24-10 is it performs on are based on
RC 4861

1072
01:07:09,849 --> 01:07:13,030
up or degeneration of the interface
identify our

1073
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:16,970
you I think the 456 sensed and so on
point yes

1074
01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:21,400
arm thats when you tryin to get an ID
okay

1075
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:25,170
of all your systems if you're in
Vitamins it is

1076
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:29,180
um more less an impossible task to on

1077
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:33,790
to get an idea okay which I which
generational by pew 6sec

1078
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:37,089
gets or is implemented in all your on

1079
01:07:37,089 --> 01:07:41,250
and devices running in your network on I
mean when you just surfed

1080
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:45,099
20 or so device that's but devices you
can do that

1081
01:07:45,099 --> 01:07:49,049
a box in logic open environments with
100000 Swan

1082
01:07:49,049 --> 01:07:53,450
hosts or ipv6 potentially ipv6 enabled
hosts armpits

1083
01:07:53,450 --> 01:07:56,940
it's impossible to figure out a que a
what kind of thank on peace

1084
01:07:56,940 --> 01:08:00,990
on devices on implement which makes or
predictability

1085
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:04,599
well I'm pretty hot so you can't really
predict how to use systems behave

1086
01:08:04,599 --> 01:08:08,180
when it gets and a specific IP six
packet

1087
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:11,349
another problem is on

1088
01:08:11,349 --> 01:08:14,490
I view 6 ipv6 trust model

1089
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:18,210
back in the 90s they had a complete
different thinking of

1090
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:22,980
security in general as we have it today
and 2d basic

1091
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:27,859
security are some snow it back in the
nineties when they develop type 2 612

1092
01:08:27,859 --> 01:08:28,500
well

1093
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:32,270
the local Inc or the local network as
trust were see

1094
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:35,460
Sol everyone in the local Inc are we all
brought us

1095
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:38,600
everything is fine and dandy a I and
there will

1096
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:42,730
they'll will not be any attackers or
malicious

1097
01:08:42,730 --> 01:08:45,779
on activity is inside local network

1098
01:08:45,779 --> 01:08:48,960
the problem if because of this

1099
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:53,250
reasoning they didn't implement any
security mechanisms in

1100
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:56,290
these on basic arm features for

1101
01:08:56,290 --> 01:08:59,779
resolution to or four the router
discovery process

1102
01:08:59,779 --> 01:09:03,020
they arent any a on security mechanisms

1103
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:06,180
form which wake which you can secure

1104
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:09,910
these operations because of this arm

1105
01:09:09,910 --> 01:09:13,190
trust my love on the local Inc on we all
Prados

1106
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:16,450
I'll which makes that of course harder
to secure a

1107
01:09:16,450 --> 01:09:20,440
the year local Inc or two defend against

1108
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:23,460
a text on the local Inc based on

1109
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:26,560
dear all discovery process already
neighbor discovery up

1110
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:30,589
process and that's a peak problem

1111
01:09:30,589 --> 01:09:34,990
ants I'm a gun Salaam data security
assessments

1112
01:09:34,990 --> 01:09:38,339
of the neighbor discovery protocol for

1113
01:09:38,339 --> 01:09:41,950
on ipv6 ways ways that

1114
01:09:41,950 --> 01:09:46,810
well yeah on its increase flexibility
implies a somewhat increased

1115
01:09:46,810 --> 01:09:50,710
a increased complexity which is always
bad force for security which has

1116
01:09:50,710 --> 01:09:54,400
resulted in a number of boxes will
abilities on the popular implementations

1117
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:59,650
I in a diss by Marcy he provide some
guidance a.k.a on Hall

1118
01:09:59,650 --> 01:10:03,290
or what options you have to implementing
secure

1119
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:06,630
neighbor discovery process and we will
talk about it

1120
01:10:06,630 --> 01:10:09,930
arm later on yeah I'll

1121
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:13,200
and out we really like the idea our
butts

1122
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:16,970
form it's just not on feasible that we
all

1123
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:20,480
home that local Inc at least in most
environments this

1124
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:23,900
trust were seen any case but are

1125
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:27,630
we have to deal with this would with
that and we have to on

1126
01:10:27,630 --> 01:10:31,390
implements mitigation take these two
mitigate dole's

1127
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:34,590
attacks which can be easily launched
from the

1128
01:10:34,590 --> 01:10:41,590
local network which will cover upon I
think after the break

1129
01:10:43,730 --> 01:10:46,370
Sol arm coming back to rather

1130
01:10:46,370 --> 01:10:50,280
well because the source from an
interesting one as well

1131
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:53,290
law when you look up BPD a what is the
router

1132
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:56,590
around a city by set forth that the
packets between computer networks

1133
01:10:56,590 --> 01:10:59,930
if you're reading on 2468

1134
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:04,040
diem additional of RCA for ipv6

1135
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:08,290
that the definition of router is a note
that for what I P six pack it's not

1136
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:09,930
explicitly addressed to itself

1137
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:12,980
richest of course correct bot

1138
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:16,090
in the ipv6 wrought a router has well

1139
01:11:16,090 --> 01:11:20,210
it's not only following device it is
also a provisioning device

1140
01:11:20,210 --> 01:11:25,840
because of the 2461 say they're out to
advertise their presence

1141
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:30,010
up together with various things that
into the parameters I to periodically

1142
01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:33,650
by Sun Iran advertisements or in
response to run solicitation message

1143
01:11:33,650 --> 01:11:37,550
salt in the end of the day this means a
route is just not

1144
01:11:37,550 --> 01:11:40,720
Bama device holding packets it is also I

1145
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:44,640
provisioning device as well ants

1146
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:50,110
we generally like the idea but some from
an operational point of fuel

1147
01:11:50,110 --> 01:11:53,870
and I'm having my network administrator
on hats on in

1148
01:11:53,870 --> 01:11:58,440
lot carbon by men's all on this isn't
necessary such a good thing

1149
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:02,820
on the because of the brilliant in tax
no or state of fraud at the Tyson a

1150
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:06,150
dhcpv6 and action up that you have to
use both mechanism

1151
01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:09,410
through provide to clients a full on my
view 6

1152
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:14,450
on configuration which makes it more
complex from an operational point a few

1153
01:12:14,450 --> 01:12:17,910
and on complexity always competes on
security

1154
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:21,010
but we will talk about it on anymore

1155
01:12:21,010 --> 01:12:24,070
but on that's just the current state

1156
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:28,770
a which we have to the US yeah coming to
the year

1157
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:32,160
crypt optimism back in the 90s

1158
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:36,030
as already said there was complete
different thinking of security in

1159
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:36,650
general

1160
01:12:36,650 --> 01:12:39,810
and back in the 90s they thought well
yeah

1161
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:43,960
even if there are any security problems
we can

1162
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:47,230
we can address them was crypto well

1163
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:50,790
of as it turns out yes crypto maybe an

1164
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:54,300
sufficient mitigation take technique but
on

1165
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:56,010
crypto as always up

1166
01:12:56,010 --> 01:12:59,280
a racial price sec I mean using
encryption is easy

1167
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:02,530
key management at heart but up this
thinking

1168
01:13:02,530 --> 01:13:06,150
shaped the ipv6 because they said well
I'll be

1169
01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:09,450
we do not have to implement any security
measures I'm when

1170
01:13:09,450 --> 01:13:12,610
we have IP sec implemented in the in the
ipv6 sec

1171
01:13:12,610 --> 01:13:15,770
so when it when you want to do security
a just use

1172
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:19,360
ipv6 in the meantime that the IETF

1173
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:24,710
revisit that statement said well yeah up
until 2011

1174
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:29,950
are IP second was a mandatory all
implementation or for every ipv6

1175
01:13:29,950 --> 01:13:33,560
stack with are CE sixty you

1176
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:37,530
484 I think they updated the ipv6

1177
01:13:37,530 --> 01:13:41,550
no its requirements and IP sec small is
no longer

1178
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:45,240
mandatory just now and optional
component sold

1179
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:49,420
on depending on the year %uh generation
of IP 6sec

1180
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:53,460
arm it may be possible that the ipv6
like tough not includes

1181
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:56,760
IPSec it on but

1182
01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:00,630
on in denied a stay in they thought a
cape on

1183
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:04,000
everything can be solved by maas and
some iris

1184
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,050
at this thinking as already said shaped
ipv6

1185
01:14:07,050 --> 01:14:10,360
of for arm dhcpv6

1186
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:13,830
was complemented by RC 33 18

1187
01:14:13,830 --> 01:14:16,990
which defiance a antagonism

1188
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:22,190
when TCP v6 climbs I'm and is PB six
server can be authenticated

1189
01:14:22,190 --> 01:14:25,790
by means of a pre-shared key you well
yes up this

1190
01:14:25,790 --> 01:14:29,800
sounds fine and dandy but in Las
corporate environments you have to

1191
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:33,260
arm configure this pre-shared key if

1192
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:37,330
on every client and of course in every
server and as long as soon as you have

1193
01:14:37,330 --> 01:14:39,000
to change its armed you have to

1194
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,170
change in every client and at least
Knoll

1195
01:14:42,170 --> 01:14:45,180
well day CPB six over I know all of the
support

1196
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:48,870
this all mechanism don't expect that it
that it will

1197
01:14:48,870 --> 01:14:52,750
youth anywhere it was implemented by all
at once

1198
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:57,210
on developed by the IETF but arm don't
realize that it gets

1199
01:14:57,210 --> 01:15:00,930
on implemented by comment it's a PB six
overs

1200
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:04,100
or on Klein operating systems

1201
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:07,430
Sol another game cent

1202
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:10,770
secure neighbor discovery decide well
yeah

1203
01:15:10,770 --> 01:15:15,740
on there may be a reasons where it could
be beneficial

1204
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:21,020
to use cryptographic mechanisms through
security at neighbor discovery and there

1205
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:22,360
are discovery process

1206
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:25,410
that they came up with those wonderful
idea of

1207
01:15:25,410 --> 01:15:29,400
on sense where basically im what the
clients

1208
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:33,670
on do miss the following they are

1209
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:38,400
from a client perspective

1210
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:44,290
every client

1211
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:48,000
has to have public-private p a keep air

1212
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,540
and DU interface identify a forty
address

1213
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:56,440
configured on the client on is derived
on

1214
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:59,690
from this keep a.m. to prevent are

1215
01:15:59,690 --> 01:16:03,170
IP spoofing or ipv6 address spoofing

1216
01:16:03,170 --> 01:16:07,950
and do. rather discovery process

1217
01:16:07,950 --> 01:16:11,870
is secured by means of certificates

1218
01:16:11,870 --> 01:16:15,080
so this basically means on

1219
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:19,230
we have our router advertisements just
to make its

1220
01:16:19,230 --> 01:16:23,930
on a high-level and on this router
advertisements

1221
01:16:23,930 --> 01:16:27,190
we have all these fancy

1222
01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:31,880
certificates information sold the
certificate

1223
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:35,520
is on India abroad advertisement

1224
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,640
and only when the client is able to

1225
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:42,280
validates this certificates she will
process

1226
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:47,050
up the packet for to and the information
stored in this router advertisements

1227
01:16:47,050 --> 01:16:51,500
well sold this basically means you have
to deploy air

1228
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:54,580
certificates and every client which you
may already have four other

1229
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:59,030
punctuality but also you up to deploy
the certificates

1230
01:16:59,030 --> 01:17:02,440
on your routers on and they have to use
on

1231
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:05,870
these certificates with the rod
advertisements

1232
01:17:05,870 --> 01:17:08,920
in Syria back in the 90s assaulted the
sounds great

1233
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:12,430
%uh nowadays from an operational point a
few

1234
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:16,739
forget about its I don't on relied at

1235
01:17:16,739 --> 01:17:19,619
that you will see a sent in any coffin

1236
01:17:19,619 --> 01:17:22,729
environment because on the typical warm

1237
01:17:22,729 --> 01:17:26,699
corporate operating system Windows does
not support sense

1238
01:17:26,699 --> 01:17:29,909
sold of you're out of luck and disarm in
this case

1239
01:17:29,909 --> 01:17:33,610
arm for example Cisco to support it so
you can

1240
01:17:33,610 --> 01:17:37,800
we could technically configure it on in
the window space there's a ser party

1241
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,869
implementation by the house a plot by
Institute

1242
01:17:39,869 --> 01:17:43,119
so you could on theoretically

1243
01:17:43,119 --> 01:17:46,630
use on sense and Microsoft environments

1244
01:17:46,630 --> 01:17:50,360
but arm it is sold operation expensive

1245
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:53,710
that's at least from all parts of you
it's just not operation feasible to use

1246
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:53,979
it

1247
01:17:53,979 --> 01:17:58,460
in large-scale bomb environments soul
noted

1248
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:02,969
that its a but it was specified but do
not expect that its

1249
01:18:02,969 --> 01:18:06,119
that any environment is two points and

1250
01:18:06,119 --> 01:18:10,670
all any reasonable way but they thought
well

1251
01:18:10,670 --> 01:18:14,010
on to address all these issues we can
use bomb

1252
01:18:14,010 --> 01:18:20,849
crypto by means of sent yeah

1253
01:18:20,849 --> 01:18:24,269
then complexity you this is

1254
01:18:24,269 --> 01:18:27,320
was a very interesting statement as a
set

1255
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:32,659
long an hour ago the last my TF meeting
I was attending it was

1256
01:18:32,659 --> 01:18:36,699
on it.if 89 in London which was last
year beginning of March

1257
01:18:36,699 --> 01:18:41,650
and in this IP six six-man group the
working group which is responsible for

1258
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:44,019
maintaining the ipv6 of protocol

1259
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:47,340
the first eight months arm the first guy
on the

1260
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:51,570
on a microphone said well of India and
EU

1261
01:18:51,570 --> 01:18:55,460
over a specified and he is completely
right on and that's the problem

1262
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:59,320
on because they are trying to to squeeze
in more and more

1263
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:02,960
features and functionality into the
neighbors cubby pro thanks

1264
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:06,679
process diem on overall complexity
increases

1265
01:19:06,679 --> 01:19:13,679
which of course impedes are security

1266
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:16,250
yeah and

1267
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:19,750
looking at the neighbor discovery upon
are

1268
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:23,190
our season general Saudi unit

1269
01:19:23,190 --> 01:19:28,300
initial specification arson 1970 'em on
dated August 1 1996

1270
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:32,500
82 pages updated by RC 2461

1271
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:36,590
dated December 98 93 pages obsolete at

1272
01:19:36,590 --> 01:19:39,760
arm by RC 48

1273
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:43,660
61 September 2007 a whopping

1274
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:47,860
97 pages and this is mainly cuz that the
latest on

1275
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:52,000
stable one which is set at in most text
books

1276
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,440
and if if X systems back documentation
to

1277
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:58,540
saw and at you

1278
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:01,640
we can see a small excerpt from on this

1279
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:05,110
are see you and as you can see hero

1280
01:20:05,110 --> 01:20:08,160
well on it seems to be quite a complex
on

1281
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:12,120
protocol on which is the basis for

1282
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:15,190
the whole ipv6 protocols huge neighbor
discovery

1283
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:19,630
so now you could sing well we could have
reached a kind of

1284
01:20:19,630 --> 01:20:24,610
stable on state for decor mechanisms of
ipv6

1285
01:20:24,610 --> 01:20:28,800
well on fossil enough RC 48

1286
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:33,050
up 61 was for top updated by 5942

1287
01:20:33,050 --> 01:20:36,480
69 ATM 7048 yada yada yada

1288
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:39,560
which basically a both on

1289
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:42,719
onto thats even though the protocol

1290
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:46,010
yes has a 2003 arm

1291
01:20:46,010 --> 01:20:49,150
in this year we still haven't kind of

1292
01:20:49,150 --> 01:20:53,219
reach a stable state forty core
mechanisms

1293
01:20:53,219 --> 01:20:57,660
of the year next-generation protocol and

1294
01:20:57,660 --> 01:21:01,020
yeah India b6

1295
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:04,040
of are working group which is the on

1296
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:07,199
ipv6 operations working group inside
EITF

1297
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:12,010
they spends arm significant significant
I am

1298
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:15,380
on modifications of neighbor discovery

1299
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:19,400
and I was following to you are webcast
from the

1300
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:22,699
more recent IIHF meetings and on

1301
01:21:22,699 --> 01:21:24,130
they were just basically doing

1302
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:27,400
same on for two on which

1303
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:31,960
yeah isn't that good from a security
point of %um

1304
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:36,370
because we're never get to a really
stable state where we can say okay

1305
01:21:36,370 --> 01:21:39,620
but this is the core our specification
04 call

1306
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:44,040
ipv6 functionality 'em it always they
always try to squeeze in more and more

1307
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:47,310
or what if I am the behavior of

1308
01:21:47,310 --> 01:21:52,909
core elements of ipv6 yeah

1309
01:21:52,909 --> 01:21:57,340
well just a quick look at RC 6918

1310
01:21:57,340 --> 01:22:00,380
6980 upon this

1311
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:03,620
along from from a security point of view
along all but you

1312
01:22:03,620 --> 01:22:08,010
our C you on because

1313
01:22:08,010 --> 01:22:11,020
its four bits you fragmentation of

1314
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:14,659
all neighbor discovery related packets

1315
01:22:14,659 --> 01:22:18,290
arm y sus of importance we will see that
I

1316
01:22:18,290 --> 01:22:23,469
after the break but up it's a less
complexity decision taking an

1317
01:22:23,469 --> 01:22:29,179
supplicant subsequently stack Colts and
this r/c was released in August 2013

1318
01:22:29,179 --> 01:22:32,179
and as far as I know no at least on

1319
01:22:32,179 --> 01:22:35,980
corporate major perot operating system

1320
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:41,239
vendor us or supported are but we will
happen that people look at this our CEO

1321
01:22:41,239 --> 01:22:41,790
Bob

1322
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:45,780
when we're doing some attacks against
Fulham

1323
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:49,929
some clients next move

1324
01:22:49,929 --> 01:22:53,510
next big problem is attack and defence
symmetry

1325
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:57,469
the first well or due to the long

1326
01:22:57,469 --> 01:23:00,580
a wallop case we have to do jazz imagery
between

1327
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:04,250
Atoka attackers and defenders the first

1328
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:07,340
on ipv6 on attack toolkits

1329
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:11,250
on which was developed by Mark Weiser
DTH the ipv6

1330
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:14,310
onto a kid was released in 2005

1331
01:23:14,310 --> 01:23:19,480
so ten years ago a an RC it describing
an

1332
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:22,980
a feature called router but I still got

1333
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:26,690
which tries to prevent or to mitigate
some attacks which

1334
01:23:26,690 --> 01:23:29,810
which we will cover our beta I

1335
01:23:29,810 --> 01:23:33,139
was released February 2011

1336
01:23:33,139 --> 01:23:37,380
sold six years after that sold yet
echoes happen

1337
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:40,400
advantage of six years until the ITTF

1338
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:43,400
or general on some people thought about

1339
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:46,950
mitigating techniques to mitigate common

1340
01:23:46,950 --> 01:23:50,480
ipv6 at X and they are

1341
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:54,070
they are still not working on
sufficiently from all points of view

1342
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:57,410
and probably never will but on

1343
01:23:57,410 --> 01:24:01,480
the my hope dies last I'll these
features will work

1344
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:04,580
at some point on but we will see how to
use

1345
01:24:04,580 --> 01:24:07,950
up you just walk and how we can
circumvent after the break

1346
01:24:07,950 --> 01:24:14,100
yeah as we can see here arm just an
excerpt from the above pack sec

1347
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:17,520
up security conference they did back in
2005

1348
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:22,650
well mock was the present at on is to
issue it attacking the ipv6 all

1349
01:24:22,650 --> 01:24:23,600
protocols cute

1350
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:27,920
10 years a goal yeah

1351
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:31,270
and last but not least ipv6

1352
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:35,510
as we have now made no on this very
different from

1353
01:24:35,510 --> 01:24:38,580
almighty form and so is like 26 I

1354
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:42,250
security in you cannot transform your

1355
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:46,090
ipv4 on security model from one to 12

1356
01:24:46,090 --> 01:24:50,410
on ipv6 you have cause to make
adjustment modification up

1357
01:24:50,410 --> 01:24:54,450
and especially in regards to your
filtering approach

1358
01:24:54,450 --> 01:24:57,610
has already set when you're on filtering

1359
01:24:57,610 --> 01:25:01,310
ICP v6 form then you will run

1360
01:25:01,310 --> 01:25:05,570
into products so

1361
01:25:05,570 --> 01:25:09,480
no I think we are on time

1362
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:12,620
it's 11 o'clock on

1363
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:16,290
if you do not have any questions under
this point I would suggest we're doing

1364
01:25:16,290 --> 01:25:17,080
fifteen minutes

1365
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:20,210
coffee break and then we'll start on
with the

1366
01:25:20,210 --> 01:25:20,850
next chapter
