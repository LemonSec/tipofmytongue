1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,000
so I would suggest we start yeah welcome
back from lunch break

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,520
I'll be enjoyed a meal welcome to the
eye view 600

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,889
personal security much less allowance on
presentation of on

4
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:14,130
for myself Christopher well I've

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,300
I'm a mall as networking deco I'm
working a secure

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,580
for security researcher for young W arm

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,670
yeah mainly what can I do think since on

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,099
a couple years not as long as a No on
when I started on the around with ipv6 I

9
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:30,179
had other interests

10
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:33,980
on then on if you think that this case
so

11
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,219
are what I'm talking about on as the
name implies

12
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:41,309
arm ipv6 for Suffolk you two mechanisms

13
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:44,809
in the which lost my romance or concrete

14
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:47,850
in the away label on which'll switchers
on

15
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,390
different hypervisor platforms for the
overall agenda and we will first thought

16
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:52,920
was a

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,559
shorts bomb introduction hey what is
ipv6 personal

18
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,199
security about um then I will show you
are all

19
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:03,500
lets up let left setup on which we had

20
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,580
for the on different s we did

21
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:11,430
we'll on I will layout the test cases
which we done that with the above

22
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,740
different virtual switch OES

23
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,950
which were used then of course on the
results

24
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,650
and at the end of the day on the
conclusions

25
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,600
on just to avoid on confusion and
there's a slight pickup with the agenda

26
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,220
on on the door so this presentation of
small plan

27
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,659
fourth ninety minutes and on the
securing service provider

28
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:36,630
on talk is of the diem break in the
afternoon

29
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,970
45 minutes and then idea I'm talking to
a party complies considered I'll

30
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,369
a slash what it considered harmful just
on for the don't get

31
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:49,600
I'll computes

32
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,690
Sol on let's begin was just introduction
to first stop

33
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,880
on security a what does what is all
about ass

34
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,830
some of you may know on Cisco press up
security

35
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,520
is so marketing term Francisco
describing

36
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,430
various ipv6 security features in

37
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,990
a whale a book on a different physical
of platforms to

38
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,210
potentially mitigates some common ipv6

39
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,720
on attack techniques anti-eu rollouts

40
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,620
from these on all these features was
planned from Cisco

41
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,670
in three onstage us and every faith or
every stage

42
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,980
on has released the more ipv6 on
security feature

43
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,030
with the ultimate goal to achieve on
feature parity in 2d

44
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,440
ipv4 world in the ipv4 world on our

45
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,460
current actually a switch us we have a
couple of

46
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,790
on techniques to

47
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,940
mitigate common attack so for example up
moving can be mitigated

48
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:53,280
a biodynamic up inspection 0 or are okay
to pee before server can

49
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,840
mitigated by on DHCP bomb through paying
and

50
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,930
poem as I P six on gets more money ploy

51
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,340
on that makes sense where all these
features are available as well for the

52
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,380
ipv6 world

53
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,030
so it all began on summer on 2010

54
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,150
where Cisco released the for a state of
the

55
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,910
Press of security in feature feud
basically what they did stay

56
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,519
introduced on the router advertisement
gobs and port-based

57
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:22,860
on ipv6 on ACLs so that you have the
possibility

58
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,390
to mall filter a router advertisements

59
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:31,080
by means of August I got this working
basically like a stateless ACL filled

60
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,950
out which just

61
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,130
fit us traffic arm for my simply 6:05
134

62
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:40,000
forty on ratatisements and

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,269
was big into a wall support it arm in to
begin the only on the

64
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:48,610
Big Data Center on switch off like a
catalyst 4948

65
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:53,450
on EF in the meantime it is commonly
available on every a

66
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,940
typical actual flail platform catalyst
3560 im

67
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,380
3750 2916 thought a typical

68
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,040
switcher you are deploying in

69
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,510
the actual slayer onto pro on to
configure

70
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:11,280
on these features

71
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:18,090
yes I did so everything should be on
fine yeah and I are I got so on this

72
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,889
basically just in isolation principal

73
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:23,280
similar similar to other on their to
protection mechanisms

74
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,130
and so on wats specified in an RC of

75
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,479
from the ITTF NRC 6105 and

76
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,930
I'll works quite well well with the
exception on that as we all

77
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,910
might know that it can be easily
circumvented by yourself on

78
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,099
fragmentation

79
00:04:39,099 --> 00:04:42,330
diem second phase walls

80
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,599
film introduced in the end of 2011
beginning 2012

81
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:49,720
depending on the specific platform and
introduced

82
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,130
dhcpv6 card and NDP sloping basically

83
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,860
its equivalence to you on PCP snooping
in the IP for world

84
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,620
and dynamic up inspection Indian ipv4
world and

85
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,130
com also here it was first introduced

86
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:08,110
India the data center switch OES
catalyst 4948

87
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,190
you but in the meantime as the same
procedure as was rather but I stand

88
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:12,620
guard

89
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:18,610
it is on our way lable in bomb corrente
actual say a platform 35 60 SMD

90
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,400
3715 and 29 not sixty yeah

91
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,990
on as a set the 2 p-6 got works
basically Avant the same like in the IP

92
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,710
four worlds

93
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:33,430
on you out the possibility to configure
it on a pop by pop basis and wanted us

94
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,659
on this just on when it receives and
DHCP server

95
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:42,320
bodies to PB six or a packet on a given
interface where the 2 p-6 card is

96
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,639
configured it will just

97
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:48,080
drop on the packet and so on them in
order to circumvent

98
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,229
on or in order to mitigates thats

99
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:55,860
some malicious or unintentional on
system is handing out ipv6

100
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,940
address the slaughter on configuration
formation

101
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,770
to illegitimate clients

102
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,760
ants they also introduced the ipv6

103
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,150
snooping feature on the basically the
ipv6 on

104
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:14,120
looping feature on is responsible for
several

105
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,180
on the first up security in arm
mechanisms

106
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,380
what the switch basically the house is
it builds them

107
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,410
so-called snooping table by snooping and
neighbor discovered related

108
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:29,500
message us on a given target you can on
activities ipv6 looping on a

109
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,130
I'll on a completely langhorn on
interface and it redirects the NDP in

110
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,560
DCP traffic to

111
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,970
at least according to the documentation
to to

112
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,170
switch integrated on security what you
will a where these

113
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,180
a where just on database or defining
table on

114
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,450
distort on where you have to association
up bout between an ipv6 address

115
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,550
arm and a mecca for us and when I try to
spoof

116
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,260
on the mac Address forgiven ipv6 address

117
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,870
the switch what's interfere with that
and what not for what

118
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,680
on the neighbor advertisement packets
soul on that in a book

119
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,800
neighbor cache it's not about the fuck
gets all poisons

120
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,790
from the of the targets and toothless

121
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,070
I'll the bases lithium I view 6 looping

122
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,740
feature and realized by the IQ 6
inspection up on

123
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,680
feature on what which was integrated and
on face too

124
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,450
and as a set lunch and secures the
binding flat versus

125
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:29,840
in the neighbor table and bill so focal
trusting binding tale database

126
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,940
on base on the ipv6 routing feature and
all

127
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,610
on neighbor discovery later on message
us to do not have a valid binding

128
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,910
are dropped and a message is considered
valid

129
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:43,340
if the association between mac address
and ipv6 address

130
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:48,010
is verifiable so when the switch arm has
exactly these entries

131
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,340
in this label security database or
binding table

132
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,460
on and if the Mac is correct on

133
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,390
2d on my p6 address and then the up
packets it for what it is

134
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,870
or in a bus company message otherwise on
it will get just

135
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,210
dropped from from the switch

136
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,310
on just as them quick overview for you

137
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:12,300
are messy can see you in the meantime
there's quite a good on supports

138
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,900
based on the year on specific opera
platform and a specific I S device in

139
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,699
regards the

140
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:22,310
on several personal security feature us
we have are a god I V six looping

141
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,520
and so on and so forth way can see okay

142
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,599
know which on I US version to actually
needs

143
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:33,459
up to have this on kind of bomb feature
when I want to implement it and my

144
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:36,820
access layer Sol

145
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,120
arm I mean in the meantime the you

146
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,899
we have a I would call it more or less
mature

147
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:47,290
States of these first up security
features on

148
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:51,630
physical on switch us bluff for more and
more systems get which allies

149
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:55,170
in terms of on private cloud
environments yeah

150
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:59,820
sorry for the password on butts its will
get more prevalent in the new year

151
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,060
future to have the both reach us

152
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,399
also in the rush less environment that
this was the reason the

153
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,560
want to talk afford Fortis on
presentation just two

154
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,020
to get an idea okay arm as of: today

155
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,040
on how to support in regards onto these
for stop the cure to you

156
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,079
arm features on which will switch just
deployed

157
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:26,570
in common hype elisa platforms on
because

158
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:31,060
on the physical switch is your first
line

159
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:35,290
on all of Defense and this first line of
defense is now

160
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:39,740
moving from the physical world to doin
whatcha what word you bushel machines

161
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,140
are

162
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,329
not I would be connected to a physical
switch their first

163
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:46,390
connected to a virtual switch residing
in the hypervisor

164
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,440
and of course the hype ELISA has an
uplink to diem arm

165
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,290
physical world on to provide the author
connectivity from these

166
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:56,910
on to Twitchell machines

167
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,149
Sol on but that's just enough for you

168
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:03,540
quick introduction to the first up
security in on sweet

169
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,910
now on that's got to do. on hypervisor

170
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:13,029
bomb that's up left setup saw love we
had three different types of

171
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,429
on IPO as us we are the Windows Server
2012 are two

172
00:10:16,429 --> 00:10:20,249
on Hyper Beam on hypervisor we had a
VMware ESXi

173
00:10:20,249 --> 00:10:23,600
5.5 and we had the KVM a which

174
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,129
runs the on open we switch and on the
Windows Server 2012

175
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:31,529
we have few themed integrated high
public we switch on the

176
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:34,569
you think some violent we use the Cisco
Nexus 1000 be

177
00:10:34,569 --> 00:10:37,639
and on the I'm KBM

178
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:41,569
we use the open we switch to a bomb

179
00:10:41,569 --> 00:10:47,089
to our testing so um

180
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:51,230
for the test setup we at three in
different which will machines

181
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:57,670
deployed on each hypervisor on to
legitimate clients 1107 climbed 11 as a

182
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,920
client santia

183
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,589
militias on the techa on with the on
Cali looks distribution up

184
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:06,899
and they all I connected to the same we
switch and where all they are two

185
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:07,600
adjacent

186
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,230
assault they had the same prefix and
were residing on the same

187
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:16,549
on Bielat here just the Obama a
graphical overview

188
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:19,959
as you can see here we have our three
hypervisors

189
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:23,929
the you which'll switch with all virtual
machines these

190
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:27,339
which machines were connected to the
switch which of course then had an

191
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:27,860
uplink

192
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,309
to the outside world to you communicate
with the Internet

193
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:35,119
or with other systems residing here in
the physical

194
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:38,730
world and at all three hypervisor

195
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:45,730
as a set I puppy ESXi and KVM

196
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,319
Sol let's start with you

197
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:52,470
hi puffy on we switch the

198
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,639
stand at with which integrated in the
hyper-v im hypervisor

199
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:58,839
in the Windows Server 2012 on operating
system

200
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:02,050
on interestingly on

201
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:05,050
as a rat on the documentation on the

202
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,069
hyper be a we switch supports out of the
box

203
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:11,180
on through for us up security on
features

204
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,959
namely Obama route advertisement guard
on TCP v6

205
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,370
scooping 42 pp 6/ guard and

206
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:22,800
on the since 2000 Server 2012 the

207
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,430
twelfth they also added to support for
extended or

208
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:30,920
state form ipv6 on ACLs so that you have
the possibility

209
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,259
to fit the traffic going or going

210
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:37,329
to on a virtual machine but

211
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:40,720
it's a little bit unfortunate because
%um do not have any

212
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,339
we allow men to configure it is a calc
on you have to configure them

213
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:48,339
be a on PowerShell so you have to know
all what you happen to get

214
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:51,410
and there's no real on indication

215
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:55,600
whether there's something configured are
not you have to your specific

216
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,259
a Polish I'll come on sissy okay which
ACLs are applied

217
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:03,779
to a specific bomb was from machine
maybe this will get changed on

218
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:07,439
in the future I don't know are but as of
right now on

219
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:14,089
you have to rely on on partial to
configure it is extended ACLs

220
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:17,180
so looking at the properties of the year
all muscles which

221
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,690
on we can see here that we have a couple
of features we can

222
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:26,120
on configure we can see here we have
data people

223
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,480
got which basically means on bait dhcpv6

224
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,010
got I don't know what it what I forgot
Steve on b6

225
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:37,769
or maybe it's a proper conduct of thick
thought it works

226
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:41,730
for IP four as well as for ipv6 and we
have here

227
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,940
our on brought I got which is basically
%ah got

228
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,070
on implemented here arm on the on

229
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:51,370
um me switch and its pretty simple

230
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:54,779
a messican see him you just have to
click the click the checkbox

231
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:58,920
on apply the settings and then the youth
features are

232
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,300
are enabled for this specific whatcha
machine

233
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,779
in the you're in this case on at Los for
demonstration purposes the Windows 8

234
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:07,260
machine

235
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:11,740
but typically you when you are you think
on the which was a moment based on hype

236
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,199
love you

237
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:16,209
in 2012 you generally want you on
activate all speech us

238
00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:19,490
on poor every word for machine upon
because you do not want that

239
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:23,470
any word from a sheen can start to send
ratatisements and

240
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,940
maybe temple with your production ipv6

241
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:32,540
configuration on your clients sold then

242
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:36,199
with you did a couple of tests the first
up-close

243
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:40,360
pretty basic we just let the I'll be
switching a default configuration a

244
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,949
on perform different type you think the
text namely on to:

245
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:48,310
agrada on the signing of a croat
advertisement and flooding a product but

246
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:48,930
I last month

247
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,699
author document the results this second
step was a que

248
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:55,839
on now that we have a baseline Rd which
will switch behaves

249
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,449
we activated the features tested again
of certain documents

250
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:03,459
up the results and then at the third
step we tried

251
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:06,459
to abate these on mechanisms

252
00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:10,310
so that was the general on testing
procedure used

253
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:14,190
a in our lab environment to test the
various on

254
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,699
which'll switches

255
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:20,859
so well we use the computer via to THC
ipv6 toolkit

256
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:24,399
on poor that's all we have done a couple
of on

257
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,219
I got tests with the flat broader 26
what you will and if a cropper 26

258
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:33,459
on model with various extension had us
that we can see here minus H

259
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:36,239
with the hope will help at all with the
fragmentation had on with the

260
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:37,659
destination options head up

261
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:40,869
to enforce the fragmentation and just

262
00:15:40,869 --> 00:15:46,019
the plane flooding without any kind of
arm fragmentation a destination

263
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:49,139
on or extension edition anne gets up
called

264
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:52,239
and of course on perfect rather 26 model

265
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:56,329
where we just try to inject on militias
prefix

266
00:15:56,329 --> 00:16:02,519
into the environment and for dhcpv6
carts test we use on another tool from

267
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,189
the toolkit

268
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:06,969
up fake fake DHCP server on 6 where we

269
00:16:06,969 --> 00:16:10,389
tried to send day 2 p-6 server packets

270
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:14,289
to ATM publisher machines to see okay
and do they configure

271
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:17,489
an address on from the space or not

272
00:16:17,489 --> 00:16:20,720
just to make sure on whether or not to
be you

273
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,769
features working as soon as we

274
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:28,489
on configured its poor activated so it's
come

275
00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:31,899
22 results on

276
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:35,139
it was quite an interesting something
are you because

277
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:38,720
in the first tests where we just heard
the plane

278
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,869
we switch without any on additional

279
00:16:41,869 --> 00:16:45,289
mechanisms configured we had some

280
00:16:45,289 --> 00:16:49,239
unexpected results the you just basic
flooding

281
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:53,809
of router advertisement just with lots
of the 26 and specifying interface

282
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:58,149
did not yield any results on they were
not forwarded to the physical

283
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:02,179
on infrastructure and where not arm for
wanted to do.

284
00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:05,399
on which'll clients so I thought Moon
okay

285
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:09,949
I think we're doing something wrong on
because this should work out of the box

286
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:11,329
because we haven't configured

287
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:15,230
anything was so I started deepok up this
little bits

288
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:18,759
and as I found out um

289
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:22,669
interesting to seems to be a Bach on in
the flood rather 26 model

290
00:17:22,669 --> 00:17:25,790
on prom mock on because

291
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:30,230
after some thinking I am I find other
came the source mac address the two will

292
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:34,460
is using when he is flooding the router
advertisements effect to all the roles

293
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:39,270
so it should normally just use the mac
address of the interface or which the

294
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,820
URL to the Titans get

295
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:45,809
on the flood its but it did not for
whatever reason so I'll

296
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:51,140
we tested various worst of the TACE on
to work at a version 2.3 and 2.4 2.7

297
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,059
which is the

298
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:55,690
on actual the up-to-date abrasion and
they all behave

299
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:59,910
on the same and I even tried to enable
the

300
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:04,190
mac Address spoofing on the we switch
which basically allows the virtual

301
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:04,740
machine

302
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,210
to use another a mac Address besides the

303
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,870
mac address configured on the interface
on the watchful interface

304
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:17,130
but unfortunately im on this did not
yield any results are out makhani many

305
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:17,960
say

306
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,200
a so I talk to him wrote in the email
mock

307
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,150
on this is intended or is this a Bach
and he replied mmm

308
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:29,460
sounds like bach saw and my assumption
here is that that the

309
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,640
rituals which is just discarding on
these packets because the asean-india

310
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,700
on the source mac Address with all three
roles ass

311
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,309
in bullets and soul on he just discuss
the packets are regardless of the

312
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:41,890
content

313
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:46,169
but this is just my on assumptions do
interesting part is

314
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:49,870
on this stuff only upon happen when
you're when you're using

315
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:53,820
up plain flat broader 26 as soon as you
are using an

316
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,030
up by help at all or destination option
had a on

317
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:00,510
the tool issue thing to correct the mac
Address arm of the interface

318
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:04,080
so it only happens when on your using

319
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,460
the clock rather 26 model without any on
extension to solve on

320
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,350
it was a block we have to work around
arm

321
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:16,419
luckily and the big thank you to
Antonio's who also kind and

322
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:20,809
coated us the desired functionality a on
the couple of hours into kyron

323
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:25,280
so that we can proceed up with our with
our test I mean we could still have done

324
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,049
with köpa

325
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:30,590
arm but on having more for features in
common is always a good thing

326
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,620
on soul on thank you on

327
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:37,850
join us for calling this in a couple of
hours so that we can

328
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:42,549
see with our tests so does the list of

329
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:46,030
kyron come online

330
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:49,860
a parameters we used a for our tests we
do not

331
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,049
we won't get into detail what all these
on

332
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:56,190
not will you um these are just play a
reference

333
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,309
on on the other triggers the car and
workshop

334
00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:02,419
so on but these are just where reference

335
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:05,809
so when you have two slides that you can
at least see okay

336
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:10,230
what have they done in which on not set
their configured

337
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:14,700
to do all the flooding Sol

338
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,880
on coming back to you real also after

339
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,770
resolving on this on issue as soon as we
activated

340
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:26,190
on a router advertisement got on the
which'll switch on for all

341
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:30,650
which'll machines which were connected
to the switch will switch are out at the

342
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:31,490
Tyson guards

343
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:34,520
arm behaved like it should so

344
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,580
when we were flooding on the raw data
types and without any

345
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:41,720
of extension Adam they get aren't they
got from feel that reliably im

346
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,830
from the which will switch soul the EU
clients

347
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:48,419
on did not generate additional
mattresses and the CPU load

348
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:51,520
on did not on bomb get up

349
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,690
for so everything was working

350
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:58,780
ass on expected an interesting result
was up besides thats

351
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,929
when we use on do you

352
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:05,190
when we use the flat rather 26 model
with the

353
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:09,539
the destination of Fisher options had a
the web to enforce the fragmentation

354
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:13,530
um the actual second fragment

355
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:16,980
where the a Polya public all information
on this tort

356
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,559
on got filled up by the up by the switch
but the

357
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,450
Press fragments where there's no up a
layup up the conformational was the

358
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,549
what's good for what it to the actual

359
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:32,309
arm clients on FB see here I mean it's a
little bit hard to read

360
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:36,110
on from here but this is just the last
truck traced from one of our

361
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:39,549
week tim's where we can see you when we
activated it

362
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:43,669
Aug got on the whistles which and
enforce the fragmentation um

363
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:46,700
low with the use of the implant
destination options on

364
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,710
head up the

365
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:52,120
fragments were pat passing the oh my god
functionality a

366
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,730
about the actual fragment containing the
upper layer protocol information to

367
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:59,940
on where filled out by that we switch
Sol

368
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,010
on it seems of that the filter module
six is six

369
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:06,880
inspecting every fragment and its as
soon as it sees that the %uh play a

370
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,740
public Confirmation at the threat this

371
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,880
special fragment is blocked but besides
this

372
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,480
special fragment all other fragments on
normally belonging to the packet

373
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,919
will get forwarded to decline which
resulted in the

374
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:22,600
increase if you loath on the clients but
only on

375
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,880
during the the attack because on the
what solutions of course have to process

376
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,269
the

377
00:22:27,269 --> 00:22:31,130
up fragments on anyway but as soon as we
stop that

378
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:35,389
on the CPU lot has gone down to a more
reasonable level 2

379
00:22:35,389 --> 00:22:40,590
52 said attend up percent the year

380
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:43,960
a same applies also for the dhcpv6 cards

381
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,049
on the soonest we activated dis it works
as

382
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:50,269
expected and so on

383
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:55,200
its we the switch for that reliably the
implant dhcpv6

384
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,159
arm packets so

385
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,690
on coming to the Nexus 1000v dozen

386
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:08,139
at least for me personally an
interesting one on seeing that Cisco IOS

387
00:23:08,139 --> 00:23:12,630
more or less the leader in regards to
'em personal security features

388
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:17,309
on physical switch us I was curious
became on how about the support on

389
00:23:17,309 --> 00:23:20,960
the bushels switch Francisco after

390
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,460
digging in the documentation and
googling around um

391
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,490
I unfortunately found out um that they
do not

392
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,990
on support any purse up to cutie future
at all

393
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:34,100
on the the only thing they do support
this are

394
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,460
ipv6 ACLs in a more or less basic mana

395
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,590
inside if they see us to do not even
have possibility to filled up based on

396
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,610
an extension had a

397
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:46,000
so you just up basic ipv6 on

398
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,429
featuring state with filtering
capabilities but

399
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:52,630
on before going deeper into debt this is
just the

400
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:56,460
arm setup on just a

401
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,159
for you guys um who did not to work with
the I

402
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,880
system Nexus 1000v before on actually
there are two parts

403
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,890
on to make does which will switch
working

404
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:10,860
we have on the first part is the
which'll machine

405
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,990
this is called the BSM the watchful
supervisor module

406
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:16,820
all when you compare to the physical
switch is just a simple either to

407
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,570
control plane

408
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:20,730
and you have to to install

409
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:24,350
forever you hypervisor you have to go to
install

410
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:27,799
a dedicated to Ben molecule were chill

411
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:31,690
Ethernet module which you can compare to
an actual line card when compared to a

412
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:32,260
physical

413
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,610
up justice which and of course the view
them

414
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:39,240
and you need TV set up lines

415
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,519
because the BS and anti ban is a

416
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:47,610
has to be integrated into TV center on
appliance application a

417
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:51,720
because when an administrator when that
back at the stratum

418
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,519
configure a plot profile on the on
which'll switch

419
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:59,779
it has to get replicated to do we send
us so that they can choose the spot

420
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:01,159
profile

421
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:04,210
on the watchful machine to uninsured
that's

422
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:07,610
this specific watch machine member of a
specific arm

423
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:10,669
Bielat Sol I just connect with you are

424
00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:13,740
see a live on TV SMS based on an XO ass

425
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,840
sodium typical operating system

426
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,950
use on the physical on annex left based

427
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:23,779
switchers I configured to pop profile

428
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:27,340
the poor profit specify a sandwich we'll
certain which on Beale and

429
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:31,039
on the this Paul profile resides I
configure it

430
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,919
this on configuration or the name of the
poor profile gets replicated from the

431
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:36,590
workshop

432
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:39,720
months above us on what you want me to
do. up to be center

433
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,010
and to be sent to represent that on
through the VMware administrator

434
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:47,090
when you configure which'll machine cell
that

435
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:51,240
in the site configuration and in the
drop down menu has the possibility to

436
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,889
choose on the previously configured port

437
00:25:54,889 --> 00:25:59,039
on profile psalm are these

438
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,370
ought to be a them and give them a
tightly integrated into the you think so

439
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:03,700
I and TV center

440
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:07,139
this whatcha machine arm you only need
help

441
00:26:07,139 --> 00:26:10,250
once or twice for on redundancy purpose
earth

442
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,330
but you have to get you have to install
every

443
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:16,440
hypervisor you happy you need to install
this

444
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,239
specific watch or eason at what your and

445
00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:23,429
the which one is that what you will this
basically

446
00:26:23,429 --> 00:26:26,779
the on feature which is doing on all the
work

447
00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:30,159
and two Bs and that's just the control
plane it instructs

448
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,749
on love them what it has to do with
given packets

449
00:26:33,749 --> 00:26:37,480
I'll when the BSM is not available

450
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,739
on that's not that big of an issue on
the watch list with

451
00:26:40,739 --> 00:26:44,279
switch still for what's up the packets
the only

452
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:48,259
on restriction issue can't onto any
configuration changes until the virtual

453
00:26:48,259 --> 00:26:49,440
machine is running again

454
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,129
but on diem which'll switch or the poem

455
00:26:53,129 --> 00:26:56,950
you still for wanting the frames Sol

456
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:00,659
and on we use the force on the latest

457
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:05,169
away level version of the iPod was up
and forty be sent a server and of course

458
00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:10,960
on forty Nexus 1000 we 5.2 it up 1.8 33
1.2

459
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,239
I dunno who that this on naming scheme
for the worse inner

460
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:18,960
on they could have made it a little bit
easier

461
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,779
but for whatever reason the at the time
of the testing this wall of the

462
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:27,529
most recent version I think one week or
something ago they released the new were

463
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:28,009
shiner

464
00:27:28,009 --> 00:27:31,210
and I said okay I'm shall we update
sawyer on

465
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:34,899
I had a look at the real a release notes
but there was no are

466
00:27:34,899 --> 00:27:38,720
relevant on future and we got so I P six
which aim to rate its

467
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,070
arm into the new feature just world bach
fix this and some minor

468
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:45,419
had spent but it had nothing to do with
on

469
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:52,419
ipv6 in any case yes

470
00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:03,380
yeah distributed

471
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:10,380
yeah

472
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,230
okay interesting all okay

473
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:24,910
on interesting if this information
publicly available because I wasn't able

474
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,000
to find any

475
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,260
I see okay so I'm

476
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:36,260
okay thanks for that yeah

477
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:43,510
okay yeah I'll yeah yeah

478
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:48,080
um thanks for the info on thank you say
thank you to the product manager

479
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,630
from my site because a I think I am

480
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,670
spend an hour or something like that
googling to find any a

481
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:58,930
indication or whether or not this it's
on the road map or not

482
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:02,970
on but I was able to find any Obama for
tips or so whether or not

483
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:06,460
it's implemented in the near future or
not but it's good to hear

484
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:13,460
that he at least planning to do so for
thanks for that

485
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:23,630
yeah yeah well

486
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:26,940
I really would like to I think we should
chat about that on

487
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:31,640
after the session up yeah

488
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:36,410
up

489
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:40,760
yeah we met him at this disk alive

490
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:45,130
this year yeah

491
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:49,560
okay yeah thanks yeah

492
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,250
on as upsets on possibly a Knoll

493
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:56,580
as of now all but that will change in
the future as we know now

494
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,600
on no on personal security features arm

495
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,710
available on the Nexus 1000v im the only
option up

496
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:07,800
has already told you from filtering
based on

497
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,980
apart with ACLs and on

498
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:15,920
this these ACLs were also I'm introduced
just one working before the one we were

499
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:21,440
on testing and all better said I was
able to find any put information up

500
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,460
on whether ever just one road maps all

501
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,890
I initially called the day even here up
late with your wallet

502
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:32,100
onto make sure that on Cisco's living in
Cisco's implementing

503
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:36,020
arm these features also in there virtual
switch

504
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:39,610
but may be able on change said

505
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:42,770
a little bit but we'll see yeah

506
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:46,590
um as a set ipv6 ACLs

507
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:49,680
are supported but from my from
prospective

508
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,100
kind of limited arm no extension to
support

509
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,790
no on the time I'm transport on support

510
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:02,490
add steel configuration of the ACL is
pretty straightforward on nothing fancy

511
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:02,760
im

512
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,030
as we a on know it from the physical on

513
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,340
on the physical switch us we just great
yet the access list

514
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:14,510
and in this case on to test at least the
ACL functionality we explicitly denied

515
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:17,770
Anne arm ratatisements on packets

516
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:21,330
and to promote that are anything else
and

517
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:24,540
applied at this ACL to virtually silent
in the face

518
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:27,470
on where the which'll machines were

519
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:31,500
connected to with the as you can see
here it's a wesley is an interface

520
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,350
residing on which Lisa model

521
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,990
and we applied dis ACL

522
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:41,159
arm on this port where in this case the

523
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:46,010
on Cali machine loss on connected to
yeah

524
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:50,309
same procedure on as before we got

525
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:54,000
Press that the full configuration up
second step on activate configure to

526
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,140
feature in this case

527
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,909
only ipv6 based on ACLs and then of
course the third step

528
00:31:59,909 --> 00:32:03,260
are we able in any case in somehow

529
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:06,460
to debate dole's on just ACL

530
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:10,020
so coming

531
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,179
back to you on results for the Nexus

532
00:32:13,179 --> 00:32:17,190
salt with the ACL

533
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:20,980
applied to do you which'll on interface
the

534
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,530
about basic attacked without any arm
extension had a

535
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:28,809
on was block reliably from the ACL

536
00:32:28,809 --> 00:32:32,780
and we wherein able to debated with the

537
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:38,200
on extension at a Astia at it's the same
case as with the hyper-v

538
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,010
the second fragment with the upper layer
protocol on information

539
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:47,030
was just get locked so it just did not
on inspect the first fragment but also

540
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,030
the second fragment

541
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:51,940
were the im actual up a layer protocol
information was stored

542
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:56,020
arm what we're on and called on walls

543
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:59,480
little bit of an increased CPU load
during the attack

544
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,980
on the actual hypervisor so on it

545
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:07,460
use XI so I'll with the plane the
flooding it causing

546
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,650
call the 13 percent CPU load which is
not that much

547
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:14,679
well with want taking machine and as
soon as we are

548
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:18,460
on are are using on fragmentation up

549
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:22,320
with the destination options on had a R
McCaw South

550
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,570
arm the CPU load of 34 percent

551
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:29,240
just was one on attacking machine so

552
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,890
it could potentially result in adults
from the are my puzzle perspective when

553
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:33,850
you have more than

554
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:36,880
one on militias which'll machine on

555
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,710
running bills kinds of attacks

556
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:42,990
yeah

557
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:46,090
as you can see a here to different India
on

558
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:52,840
CPU lout so

559
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:58,050
coming to do you open we switch so

560
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:01,660
the we use bomb KBM which was she in

561
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:05,430
on an Ubuntu I and the open we switch

562
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:08,800
umbrage into the 3.1 and we're into a
3.1

563
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,870
space on OpenFlow the open we switch

564
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:15,929
on is using all pink OpenFlow for
installing

565
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:20,150
forwarding entries inside the bomb
falling plane of the

566
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:25,860
on actual which'll on switch Antti F'er
which'll machines

567
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:29,070
with or what which'll make which is
represented as a type device

568
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:32,340
we have are open we switch and then it
gets up Bridge to D

569
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,970
on physical make of on the of the
hypervisor and then

570
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:39,390
bridged 2d on physical switch

571
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:43,990
yeah on unfortunately im

572
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:48,380
for yeltsin we switch there are no ipv6
personal security features the whale a

573
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,620
book I

574
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:53,470
and I was not able on to get any
indication information or whether or not

575
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:56,010
these features a plan to be implemented
soon

576
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:59,710
and the only thing at what you can do
with on you can apply

577
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:03,370
on more or less what kind of ipv6

578
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:06,380
arm ACLs based on

579
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:10,580
to you low entries on as the obvious
which is using open phloem

580
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:14,840
which is a low-level bomb protocol to
dilute the install

581
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,020
arm forwarding entries in the forwarding
plane are

582
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,900
office which not only a which will
switch but it can also be done enough

583
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,100
for a physical

584
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:28,319
switch as long as the switch supports it
and open with which heavily upon realize

585
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,550
on OpenCL all open the switch has some

586
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:35,010
components we have our amo vs

587
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:38,900
on the switch diem with just a we switch
team into more left the corps

588
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,470
on component we have to call it what you
will

589
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:46,400
which is handling of course all the
switching of the packets and we have the

590
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,290
obsd be

591
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:50,740
a server which is more or less the
database over

592
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,260
that holds all the country girl

593
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:56,610
configuration a which we are doing on
for him he opened the switch

594
00:35:56,610 --> 00:36:00,250
and then as an optional components you
can Apple so-called

595
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:03,490
arm control class though or and OpenFlow

596
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:07,650
on controller so a centralized of
configuration orchestration

597
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:11,280
onto will on through on configure

598
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,500
the arm for wanting of low entries which
then get installed

599
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:19,680
ins into the on column what you up which
is

600
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:25,540
running on the hypervisor yeah

601
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:28,760
set same testing procedure

602
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:33,130
we first dated up without any Obama
additional configuration up

603
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:36,750
then 2nd Sep we're configured the ipv6

604
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:40,260
flow on entries and then the third step
what

605
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,270
we tried to debate the

606
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:46,740
configuration so

607
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:50,030
arm using using the basic on

608
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:53,050
flooding without any cause configuration
no surprises here

609
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:57,460
well off switches are falling on the rod
advertisements the CPU load

610
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:01,510
on spikes 1 percent on the victims the
Windows 7 and Windows 8 machines

611
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:05,540
and their configure a lot of addresses
in this case on exactly 100

612
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,820
up because on the system's were fully
patched and

613
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:12,320
when you attend that's the basic
workshop yesterday Obama told you about

614
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,790
the

615
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:16,060
Microsoft ipv6 readiness update which
they were released

616
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:20,750
at the end of 2012 to address the comics
awesome memory of issue

617
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:24,510
on by on restricting India

618
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,960
maximum amount of ipv6 address on any
given in the face

619
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,540
to I'll 100 so next step

620
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:35,270
on the Wii config be configured to you
low entry for

621
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:40,290
blocking ICMP 26 I Paul 134 on this is
the actual

622
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:45,170
on configuration get done we have to
specify overall vs

623
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:48,850
a all a left CTL we have two at the flow

624
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:53,740
to a given bridge where the virtual
machines are residing we have to specify

625
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:57,670
the actual which'll port in this poor in
this case it was poor to

626
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:00,710
where the I'm Cali which'll machine on
walls

627
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,470
connect that

628
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:05,840
we have to specify the datalink I'm
types of the piece %uh type

629
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:09,260
arm in this case ipv6 are 86

630
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:13,390
DDF than we have to a specified protocol

631
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:16,590
this case of course are icing pt6 and
then

632
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:19,700
the on my CPU the specific ICP

633
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,780
type the which is 134 and then of course

634
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:27,600
the actual which should be applied on
when a packet

635
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:32,160
is matching to disarm configuration and
of course on Madison now it we wanted to

636
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:32,640
drop

637
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,800
on packets so we apply to the small

638
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,140
configuration up and head look okay how
does the old vs

639
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:44,980
on but the open peace which behaves now

640
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:48,270
on soul to you

641
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:51,780
as soon as the OpenFlow order flow into
was installed

642
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:55,240
on most of the attacks were blocked but
on

643
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,290
as soon as we were using are
fragmentation on

644
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:01,650
I to buy using the floodwater 60 mod

645
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:05,330
apply to 26 module was a large
destination options had a

646
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:08,780
or using on kyron we were able

647
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:12,680
to sick on vent diem on ACL

648
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,970
arm and not only the

649
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:19,410
first fragment but also the second fact
when where the upper layer protocol

650
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,520
information is stored

651
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,920
Sol on this means with the youth the
fragmentation on

652
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,810
we where able to Ebates at the up this
country get

653
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:31,060
on OpenFlow orders ipv6 on

654
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:35,580
ACL and as you can see here in the why
shocked race

655
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:39,220
well we see here the the white ones are
the fragments

656
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,400
and the on call upon

657
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,590
Rd on I've the ICP or ratatisements

658
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:51,490
which up to you climbed reassembled and
as we can see doing dear

659
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:55,270
on attack to Cebu lot spiked on again to
10 percent

660
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:58,440
and issue an IP config command on the
command line

661
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,290
so it's a little bit hard to see you but
you get the idea

662
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:05,350
that you system has quite a lot of

663
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:08,640
ipv6 at Russell's configured

664
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,810
on on the interface

665
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:16,520
soul on we thought to ourselves well on
this end a possibility to

666
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:20,550
prevent the you fragmentation

667
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:25,540
ants on fortunately if there is the
configuration up

668
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:29,540
which you can specify in this low entry
to say okay

669
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:33,330
on Wii U please drop all fragments

670
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:37,030
ads

671
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:40,700
this year if the configuration of on
it's just

672
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:44,440
on the name is IP fracture I first other
came from

673
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:49,840
doesn't only apply to ipv4 on fragments
but at least for the documentation a

674
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,580
on that this on configuration up is

675
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:57,210
home protocol agnostic soul at least the
documentation should

676
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:01,560
apply to are ipv4 as well as ipv6

677
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:05,510
cell and after on configuring the

678
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:08,600
on ACL to block the fragmentation up

679
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,620
we were still on

680
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,810
that we were still able to pass some

681
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:18,150
on fragments abuts on the way to him

682
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:22,410
did not create any address or gateway
just because the a fragment way up where

683
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:24,060
public Confirmation worse thought

684
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:29,120
on got dropped but on we're as we can
see here

685
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:32,260
arm still even though we said we do not
want any

686
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,480
on fragmentation oil any fragments on

687
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,630
these fragments still on gets through to
you

688
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:42,330
actual bomb victims but only up the
fragments

689
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:46,720
not affect on with the upper layer
public Confirmation up so as we see

690
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,090
no additional are IP address this and no

691
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:53,420
on spike indeed on actual

692
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:59,609
CPU on you search

693
00:41:59,609 --> 00:42:02,690
soul um to summarize

694
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:06,359
so that to get so that you get an idea

695
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:09,660
Amanda got super sub security features
and

696
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,940
what we have Tom Tesla we have our three

697
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,950
on which'll switchers

698
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:19,000
and as we can see the only a a virtual
switch

699
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,460
as of right now who is so all which is
supporting

700
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:26,030
these kind of press up security features

701
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:29,420
if the I puppy vs which which supports
are a god

702
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:32,510
Andy CPB six guards all other

703
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:36,720
on test that in this case the Nexus and
the obvious which do not support any

704
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,290
on press up security on feature

705
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:44,160
but they all all three have in common
that you can at least configure

706
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,640
on ipv6 on ACLs

707
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:51,190
and just for completeness a catalyst
that

708
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:55,339
more or less all on a whale a book on

709
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:58,930
press up security features but as you
can see only to you

710
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:02,040
on opportu are supported by iPod the
switch

711
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:06,900
and no on other with which the support
any of these

712
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:13,900
for some security features yes yes

713
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:19,770
yes I have and they do not support
anything in regards

714
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:23,220
for something curity on and I wouldn't
on

715
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:26,490
this may be a snarky comment but I
wouldn't expect

716
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:30,380
we we and where to implement isn't there
spend it with such but

717
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:34,080
on to my surprise is that on as even

718
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,820
yesterday yet

719
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:43,460
well on it yeah

720
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:48,890
well it took them a until we're in five
to zero to realize that so it may not be

721
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:50,590
such a good idea to

722
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:54,650
forward spanning tree you on packets
from which a machine to the physical

723
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:58,980
on world so on but of it was interesting
on through here

724
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:02,130
on yesterday from you on that at least
in the Annex and is

725
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:05,850
and a sick and this X base they have
some kind of

726
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:09,680
on efforts FHS features but as

727
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,050
this NSX on is reassuringly expensive

728
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:16,230
and there is no evaluation a I on

729
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:19,680
available we we are unfortunately not
able on to test its

730
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:25,800
no

731
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:31,970
army isn't I mean I'll well and a-sixes
more

732
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:35,590
I mean there's a call there's a
component which is th our router but and

733
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:37,360
is it and its axis theorem

734
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,740
St envision of from VMware for a

735
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:45,650
the quick provisioning of virtual
machines with security profiles firewall

736
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:47,140
rules and so on and so forth

737
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:50,630
I but on as a set

738
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:54,560
reassuringly expensive on and I don't
know anyone

739
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,670
on whose actually using it %um well said
well we of

740
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:01,170
approximately 200 on customers right now
using its

741
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:04,750
but all I don't know any of them so I
can't comment

742
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:08,130
whether it works or whether it's good or
bad from a security point of your

743
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:11,730
it would be it would be interesting to
on think a little bit deeper security

744
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:12,930
wise into this whole

745
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:17,790
and affects or but on you don't want to
pay for that just for

746
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:24,790
security evaluation because at all is
that this reassuringly expensive

747
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:26,920
all

748
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,550
yeah well up yeah well but

749
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:34,300
the boss

750
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:37,750
I so you well

751
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:42,290
no you won't

752
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:46,740
I I have I've seen an unofficial
priceless

753
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:50,050
and I think it thought with to an OK or
something like that soul

754
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:54,190
arm yeah convincing you

755
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:57,660
are absolutely and I think I'll wouldn't
ride anyway you

756
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:01,490
yeah well but

757
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:04,910
well as you can see 'em saw that as I
have already said the I believe is which

758
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:05,720
is the only one

759
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:08,720
on currently supporting any on personal
security a

760
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,030
on feature but on that we're

761
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:16,290
up for it couple of minutes ago it is on
the road map for a

762
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:19,450
the next one thousand we have arm we
will see a

763
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:22,980
when on these features will be
implemented in the which'll

764
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:27,620
switch sheer

765
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:31,660
on conclusion to that we have seen

766
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:34,910
the I've you think for some security
officials are not widespread and common

767
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:35,730
were chill

768
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:39,110
switchers and as a already said Hi Po
view

769
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:42,170
this as of right now the only one which
supports at least a few

770
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:47,210
and saying that its result fifty in
quite unfortunate states and relied

771
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:50,320
throughout the state of the offer some
security on the physical switches

772
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:54,120
up four years ago where you just said
Rob that but I still got on

773
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:57,570
big data center switches and not on your
typical actual class which is

774
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:00,960
on this situation got resolved other
nope Liam

775
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,850
the same will apply to you on whatcha
Walt

776
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:08,040
again on you have to weigh with your
wallet

777
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:11,500
at least 40 on Nexus 1000v and forty
hyper-v

778
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:15,430
on stuff 40 lbs on its open-source

779
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:19,250
so away from with a while it may not be
on the best approach

780
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:24,590
may be potentially butts

781
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:29,000
yeah and that's from my site some a
little bit

782
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,010
quicker than I actually anticipated

783
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:36,290
will on so we have

784
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:39,660
enough time and room for of

785
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:44,110
questioner real at okay

786
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:47,430
affair fell are yet

787
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:48,430
that
