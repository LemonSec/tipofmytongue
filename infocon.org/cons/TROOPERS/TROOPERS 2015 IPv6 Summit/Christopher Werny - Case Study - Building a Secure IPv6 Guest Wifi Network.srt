1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,659
yeah hello everyone hope you enjoyed
your break all welcome to Tia

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:06,660
on second talk its a little

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,670
case study on from my side whole
buildings /url

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,759
secure a lot like to six guests on wifi
network

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,960
on as I responsible for building up here
the whole

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,070
on network environment so on if the wifi
connection sucks feel free to yell at me

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,980
arm to the All agenda

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,179
of just do you think we go love you on I
will present a cave on how to steal

9
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:31,599
actual network diagram

10
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,210
look like which components are using
hear the song

11
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,790
set up that we have a dedicated
monitoring infrastructure which will set

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:39,219
up but

13
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:43,250
up by two colleagues are of my to get
just some on statistics about

14
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,340
on my p4 type you think so you search
and SEO

15
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,170
may have noticed we have a dedicated its
like the Imam where you have to all

16
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,430
where not 64 is implemented so

17
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,090
and the six only situ on with that neck

18
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:01,820
not 64 up to axis ipv4

19
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,250
resources 10 as anybody use it up until
now

20
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,979
it work yeah

21
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:15,979
wonderful

22
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,710
okay that's it okay that's interesting

23
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,090
a I'll okay

24
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,310
doesn't only up to 40 nothing for
society okay

25
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,490
that's interesting from have to double
check that

26
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:35,710
so well okay then it starts for the
overall of network design on

27
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:39,040
we have several flaws on y'all core
component

28
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,690
o'rourke or alter is an ISRO a $1000 to

29
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,979
quite a beefy on device which could
theoretically

30
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:49,030
a push up to ten pick on done up we're

31
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:52,890
we are connected to a on how to be with
which is the local

32
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,160
on provider on we have connection with

33
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,420
on nine other megabits and in in theory

34
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,670
we were able to push up at least over
the white side

35
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,250
up to 10 800 megabits but of course

36
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,619
unfortunately over to while aside
armpits much

37
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:14,070
on floor all but it's just outgrowth we
have of course you're

38
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:19,020
on a wireless infrastructure and told we
have placed 16

39
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:25,070
or 15 on access points we are using a
centralized controller WLC Francisco

40
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,790
of its a Cisco 24 25 them 04

41
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,739
we effort dedicated on network
monitoring

42
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:37,850
on system which you can access from the
novel called from all the conference at

43
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:38,239
work

44
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,190
on it has a DNS name so when you are
connected to the north through both

45
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,600
a mess idea and just type in your balls
on that one not mine but robust up to

46
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,120
you

47
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,160
you will find on the statistics on up
until now

48
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,350
and of course we have to have a

49
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,760
separate on TNS server on which is doing
didion a 6-4

50
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,209
I'm stop 14 another for you the six only
as idea

51
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:04,350
and at this Tues 64 server gets

52
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,070
onto declines over on take CPB 6

53
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,239
and on ASM auctioneer at advertisements

54
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:14,680
sold at all times on get the on the
profit

55
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,820
DNS over who was doing to you
translation between

56
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,870
on ipv6 and ipv4 in regards to on

57
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,340
DNS up records soul arm

58
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,440
yet is ok or alter on we have a core

59
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,860
which was which is not

60
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,890
on your a and then we have

61
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:36,860
on fire up links to every on floor we
have a separate distribution switch

62
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,170
which then where Dan up to you access
points and the

63
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,210
all workshops which is our connected
which is basically

64
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,310
huge improvements on compared to the
left

65
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,360
years because in the left yes it was

66
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,250
quite a quite an IOC leave on network
design

67
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,209
because we had to use all a dedicated

68
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:02,220
the lawn from the network infrastructure
here place on the p.m. et

69
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,180
on at and up forty uplink through the
different flaw so we

70
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,560
didn't had any arm and he did and

71
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,340
dedicated fibre Online's which got
changed

72
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:18,310
I think beginning on indeed beginning in
2015

73
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,380
and so now we were able to on map a
dedicated

74
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,720
filing on probable course which to on

75
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,750
you for distribution

76
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,350
switchers as you SEC im well we have a
couple of us like to use your

77
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,600
on the MoMA conference situ a

78
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,140
little fact ipv4 and ipv6 on way up into
a v6 only sidi was not 64

79
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,860
and of course we offer on separate a
slutty which is just use for

80
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,020
management purposes so that I'm able arm
to access all the by slim K something

81
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,740
for install

82
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,840
arm which isn't hopefully not accessible
by

83
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,560
from the are Obama conference at work on
I try to verify dates but you shouldn't

84
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,479
be able to reach any administrative
interface with from

85
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:04,710
this all situ hopefully but I'm

86
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,880
when you see something please tell me so
that it so that I can fix that

87
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,260
um yeah this is the overall on

88
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,459
set up

89
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:18,839
and some generals when you're building
conference on

90
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:22,029
WiFi networks on the network is
primarily

91
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:25,139
arm radios and only secondary on
digital's

92
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:28,959
the other problem we have is that the
two dot for you gasp Angeles

93
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,849
ship other equipments Bluetooth cordless
phone calls with microphones

94
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:35,989
and so on the so you have quite a lot of
interference

95
00:05:35,989 --> 00:05:39,169
on when you're using it to 2.4 it gets
banned

96
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:42,939
and you should of course

97
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:46,819
more have locate where r potential
interferences and

98
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:49,829
this venue is quite challenging in

99
00:05:49,829 --> 00:05:54,319
finding all these on interference earth
I've had a look at our wlcm

100
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,189
I and he was telling me well yes your
Obama dis when you

101
00:05:58,189 --> 00:06:01,369
%um has seen in total wanna 24

102
00:06:01,369 --> 00:06:04,789
on separate on axles points bomb who are

103
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:08,229
sending out a different s idea if this
is just an excerpt from the

104
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:11,489
up from the on wlcm

105
00:06:11,489 --> 00:06:15,139
Amanda try to unplug every access point
which does not belong to us which I

106
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:16,419
could find here in the venue

107
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:20,219
well but unfortunately they are hiding
somewhere where can I find them

108
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:23,869
so arm depending on the area I'll their
is

109
00:06:23,869 --> 00:06:27,979
quite some on interference which I
unfortunate can't do anything about it

110
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:32,439
I but we have just a few words so it
could be that the wifi connection

111
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:36,110
maybe the aggregated on in some areas

112
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,219
but hopefully it works reliable up until
now

113
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:44,429
on I haven't heard any complaints you
are the first one at least 40

114
00:06:44,429 --> 00:06:47,800
he thinks only situ a and no news is
good news

115
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,449
so all I hope and I suppose that
everything

116
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:54,719
working as expected yeah

117
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:58,659
I am because the a 2.4 to get spenders
share song

118
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:01,739
one should encourage the use of the five
onto your hats um

119
00:07:01,739 --> 00:07:05,949
channels and tried to turn down are at
the power forty

120
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:09,039
up to 24 you get spent just to allow

121
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,419
for more active point without
overlapping arm

122
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:16,309
footprints and of course army should run
into a central the two piece over

123
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:19,800
on so that the on access points just act
as a

124
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,129
a bridge for more by on devices and
makes life

125
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:27,349
easier in on in terms of roaming from
Ron 1x this point

126
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:31,220
to another on because you do not have to
get on on another IP

127
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,819
ipv4 ipv6 on at us just can roam on

128
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:38,419
seamlessly on hopefully from one extra
point

129
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:41,740
to another so here through the venue
onto hafer

130
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,470
constant connectivity water thing

131
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,710
I'll one should note you should as long
as as

132
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,970
as it is feasible disabled on slow
speeds I

133
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,050
because the reason for that earth that
up to you

134
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,400
on beacons are sent at the lowest arm
rates

135
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,800
are the lowest supported rate

136
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,159
a which means which means they are using
more

137
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:10,310
on at hi I'm therapy can which have two
sons just because of the

138
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,580
arm lower speed and with 100 or

139
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,800
south of you with us you should
implement some on

140
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,949
mechanisms to limit the bank with
someone on

141
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:25,330
can consume by means of ACLs quality of
service or

142
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:29,310
law a central at practice over but I
haven't had up but I haven't implemented

143
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,680
and the quality of service

144
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,740
in does not work here so everyone is
free to use the bed with you can

145
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,839
get and interestingly up had a look
yesterday an hour

146
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,020
on one Detroit solution actually we have
to

147
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,440
which I will on presents in a couple of
minutes and

148
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,730
what would you guess would be the top
application use to dis

149
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:55,730
on conference environments in the course
yesterday what would you guess

150
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,970
no not Skype

151
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,050
no it's not nothing not GDP it's another
application

152
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,360
no a

153
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,760
famous application for hi sharing

154
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,800
torrance at exactly

155
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,890
so over a cause of yesterday as I had a
look at the stats

156
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,650
yesterday evening in Saudia seventy
percent of the all traffic yesterday

157
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:26,010
walls arm only if the Torrance consume

158
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:30,050
by to on entities or two endpoints

159
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,430
on Sol I think they were just constantly

160
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:39,440
on downloading over BitTorrent I think
they were just downloading some beers

161
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,130
distributions

162
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:43,410
or Italian ok for or whatever I but

163
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,550
petrone consumes the all seventy percent
of the oval bath with

164
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,970
on yesterday with the other a how it is

165
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,370
up today and so on the next two days
will be interesting

166
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,220
on to see and but

167
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,770
overall well I hadn't heard any
complaints all

168
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:03,820
even though whatever they were
downloading the whole time on

169
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,930
it seemed to be a all stable yeah

170
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:12,220
so just to give you our a quick
introduction to the network devices on

171
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:12,720
olive

172
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,110
already mentioned nasr 1,002 luckily

173
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,460
on as low as my boss and/or a

174
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,080
is all that network networking each RBS
a fable for

175
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,310
on big networking hardware and so we so
he

176
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:30,920
bought the youth a Sr couple of years
ago on e-bay

177
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:36,350
for not that much money and we wait we
are you think this is our

178
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:39,610
on Corrado but on the router itself

179
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,860
from the utilization point of you with
more the sport on

180
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,240
because is they can potentially push up
to 10 k arm

181
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,870
routed traffic calming hopper but the
interface utilization of

182
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:56,820
done around all peaks at around 2
percent or something like that sold all

183
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,950
is more or less arm idling but all

184
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,260
the bigger the box the better it is so
on

185
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,240
we are using this as our core

186
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,230
router connecting two teams service
provider up

187
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:17,589
separates el from n.o wifi point of view
we are using a wlcm this is the 24

188
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:20,750
2504 on running on the

189
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,519
a thought 0 um train with mentally

190
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:27,500
maintenance release one because the
press release of the aid of their a

191
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,680
train was just not

192
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,019
reusable because of all the horrible
back they had in this up

193
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:36,440
in this image but arm I talk to and Leah
tangle

194
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,860
armour working for Cisco up because I
was attending siskel life

195
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,579
a meal on the this year and my asking
okay which were in the running

196
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:48,290
and they were running on exactly on this
version so

197
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:52,060
when this witness enough for for 5,000
people it should be sufficient

198
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,459
for on this environment yeah

199
00:11:55,459 --> 00:12:01,110
we have no on hi a highway lability
mechanisms besides the second up you'll

200
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,910
see down in the basement which just like
the Colts that by

201
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:07,050
I where do you on configuration up on

202
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:10,250
was replicated and hopefully he'll a

203
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:14,079
LLC will survive if that's not the case
just the second then

204
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,130
all I hopefully can just switch them
quickly

205
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:24,130
at a question

206
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:29,720
yes I could def done that's I'm sure
I'll

207
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,250
but I decided against that just because
of time constraints

208
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:38,170
on so and so on I thought to myself okay
when the network is down for a couple of

209
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:38,750
minutes

210
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,010
yeah on that's not the best thing in the
world but on

211
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:49,010
everyone will supply yeah

212
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:57,610
yeah yeah

213
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:02,310
I'll actually Obama had thought about
that the case should implement it but

214
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:05,629
all as a set just decided against it I

215
00:13:05,629 --> 00:13:09,579
well it should be sufficient here for
our live in San up we were already using

216
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:11,269
the WLC last year

217
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:14,519
ads everything works on through police
all on

218
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:17,569
like what I'll ok hopefully we'll

219
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:21,029
are this your to but I'm quite confident

220
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:25,240
on these down in the basement and their
on cool environment

221
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,370
of 20 degree or something like that so
she should not overheat

222
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,810
and of the WLC /a from the a Cebu Cebu

223
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:35,990
utilization point of view he is more or
less idling to sip utilization is that

224
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,769
at the BART

225
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:39,779
5 percent or something like that a
memory utilization

226
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:43,620
50 percent so aren't we all on good to
go into the green

227
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,990
Almeria so on hopefully he will

228
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,990
so why the event and of course

229
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:56,110
up well

230
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,850
they're not well that's actually a good
question I'll salt the press consequence

231
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:04,120
would be you up there would be no v6
only a study anymore

232
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,120
because the we implemented that 64 on
the a Sr

233
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,540
and if the only books we have up in our
stock which supports

234
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:15,069
I'm not 64 I I would replace it with a
Cisco 2921

235
00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:18,920
up which should be sufficient for and
which is already downstairs

236
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,029
up but on it would have to consequence
that at least 36 only a study with

237
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,930
workout anymore because we can

238
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:31,680
we didn't have any on that 64 capital
life yeah

239
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,600
I'll I have some backup soul of course
would result in a in a short outage

240
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,630
are definitely but I would be able arm

241
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:44,290
when I'm not actually talking I mean
when it now breaks down then

242
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:47,519
along it could be a little bit worse but
sites that

243
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:53,800
arm we could or recover pretty fast I
suppose but hopefully

244
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,870
arm I don't have to run down to the
basement have to do that

245
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:02,070
and home I'm quite confident as the A's
are

246
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:05,370
the smallest service provider palm base

247
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:09,520
arm box so he should survive it and he's

248
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,770
but you never know maybe hopper on you
had a hardware fault and then

249
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:20,770
you're not you're out of luck yeah

250
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,720
yeah actually you're right on but

251
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,310
I have my hopes in this box up that he
was alive orenthal

252
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:31,560
armies alive to transport from use a
two-year I

253
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,820
you act interestingly as true received
the

254
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,130
the box the first thing I'm doing it's
okay I did you up configuration

255
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,980
left on from this box up and that lost
love

256
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:46,100
the on american-based South provider
forgot to

257
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,460
of erase the configuration and so we
were able to extract the

258
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,140
of complete up configuration 0 on from
the American peso

259
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,540
flight which which justifies using and
interestingly

260
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:01,340
I we wanted to by support from I'll
support contracts or just

261
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,820
up that weekend download on the image us
and then

262
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,890
our arm Cisco reseller said well yeah

263
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:11,360
you can't do that now I because the
state this box is still under contract

264
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,430
up until

265
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:17,030
six or 12 months all later so sorry but
you have to wait until the arm

266
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,260
actual support hun contract runs out but
this

267
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:24,180
just as height not yeah

268
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,190
that we have a couple alexis points on
deployed

269
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,200
mainly in Cisco 12 fall 42 or

270
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,290
but with all the models and Isis cool
1602

271
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,600
with of exxon tells home

272
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,800
place here around on the venue

273
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,210
as a set in total on 15 on extra points

274
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:48,420
we have a couple of pale left in case on
extra points all

275
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,870
dice for whatever reason to but this is
Tia

276
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:56,450
on overall upset up and then on as
always said we have our

277
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:00,100
dedicated monitoring info on structure

278
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,959
which walls on has already set
implemented by two colleagues of mine

279
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,990
I was just responsible for configuring a
offered doing the snmpv3 configuration

280
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,709
they did all

281
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:11,770
the hard work

282
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:16,459
on one is actually sitting here all its
pasquale who was man responsible for

283
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:19,939
calling all that stuff because I'm not a
column that I'm a network I don't have

284
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:20,490
any clue

285
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:25,459
about up coating so I just configure the
SNMP access up for him and he

286
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:28,500
on that all you other work

287
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,630
saw goal of on just to give you

288
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:36,559
on an overview of the actual traffic
values which were using in the venue

289
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,390
split in two ipv4 and ipv6 how many
clients do we have been told love all

290
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,020
many clients are connected to each

291
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,230
up and 2.4 like you got five garth

292
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:51,200
how many ipv4 only clients how many do
with their clients and home any ipv6

293
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,100
only clients we have on

294
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,270
in does that work and as a set on the

295
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:59,950
our wifi usage in on general

296
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:03,049
on as I have already set by

297
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:07,660
you can axis this box from in all the
conference at work

298
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,740
and as you can see here

299
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:18,740
well look that good because of change
revolution

300
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:27,850
all pledge just that looks better

301
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:31,260
so you you just seeing you bat with

302
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,450
sodium uplink battle that's just the of
uplink

303
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:37,820
I'm connected to all provider and Dandia

304
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,890
downstream into you on upstream values

305
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,520
for of ipv4 and on

306
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,920
ipv6 on as you see came

307
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,710
up until now warm 8 megabits Allstream 3
megabits for ipv6

308
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,580
on it's not that much so we have quite a
on

309
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:02,169
enough left you can see if on the

310
00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:05,880
actual you search of the while expanse
and

311
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,620
on you see above Wendy conference
yesterday started

312
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,740
wanted and on than the old lives and
then

313
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,340
arm set this up P at the rather think
nine o'clock or something like that when

314
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,929
everybody he was on the venue

315
00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:21,610
and on connect the two diem

316
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:28,610
a WiFi network at yes

317
00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:31,950
up from the SR

318
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,429
yes yes yeah

319
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:38,700
we are we are of installed the specific
maps

320
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,240
and all of we are acquiring days after
the payment

321
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,230
on from of want to train station but
don't ask me which

322
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:49,320
exactly at well a

323
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:55,240
I mean he can tell you well well

324
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,450
I'm not sure but we can't come

325
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:03,139
come back to you later yeah I'll week we
got to the informational

326
00:20:03,139 --> 00:20:06,139
and we have to you possibility to do

327
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:10,730
of a detailed view of all this crap
you're seeing and as we all see here now

328
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,950
I and we got Cydia awhile spans

329
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,509
that we are now peking on in total

330
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:21,850
9233 22 saw apart

331
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:25,149
170 on wifi plans currently

332
00:20:25,149 --> 00:20:28,539
on connect that as of right now

333
00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:33,379
and you see here to you IP protocol

334
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:36,429
arm distributional we have done that

335
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:41,450
by comparing the the of cash and the
neighbor cache

336
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,889
for on India at you actual

337
00:20:44,889 --> 00:20:48,279
a are on problem solved that we can call
eight

338
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:53,190
disinformation just to get up to get an
idea okay how many clients are

339
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:56,460
are ipv4 Oleum how many clients are on

340
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,659
the will select on in total and how many

341
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:05,169
arm ipv6 up only clients we have this
number may not be completely

342
00:21:05,169 --> 00:21:08,690
I accurate just because I increased

343
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:12,210
the amount of time and neighbor cash

344
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:16,830
entry states that the I a Sr so this
might not be a

345
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:23,830
on the actual number

346
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,780
yet the neighbor cache belong and India
entries in the of passion

347
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:46,280
for ipv4 because I've June on

348
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,309
the ha the amount of time the UN troops
they

349
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:53,670
India on Indian neighbor cast just to
reduce the year on

350
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:57,690
neighbor discovery you chatter that was
3

351
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:02,440
to yeah

352
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,130
ants than the that a

353
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:09,900
not 64 on clients as a set are

354
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,550
basic behavior on the just calcium
amount of

355
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:19,300
neighbor cache entries four dis specific
sidi or for this the surface a specific

356
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,400
of network on segment up to get an idea
or two get the number

357
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,980
are of neighbor cache entries which are

358
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:33,980
on currently sort on the L a are on
besides the

359
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:39,010
are that one I have we have a separate
on or

360
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:44,770
at an additional monito ring

361
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:48,530
I would call it its EU Cisco Prime
infrastructure

362
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:51,670
application from Cisco luckily and
there's a trial version available

363
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,300
because it's reassuring the expensive to
buy this

364
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:58,320
up to buy his application to the only
reason the as you can see you

365
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,380
here also says yeah well you lies these
bison

366
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,070
56a yeah it's fine for me the only
reason not

367
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:08,200
live set up this a because I'm going to
check up on Cisco

368
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,500
as doing some research in regards to on
client behavior

369
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,630
into a wireless and conference that
works and I'm

370
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:18,309
talk to him on the alarm system life you
went a and I'll tell

371
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:21,760
told him how can we can set us up for a
conference at work and we can provide to

372
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,340
data

373
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,929
so that he can do you can do with
analysis and its research

374
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:30,059
in regards to this on as we can see here
I have implemented

375
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:36,280
or integrated all relevant on devices
this figure here down a dawn is a little

376
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:36,610
bit

377
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:40,040
misleading on St can see you up the top

378
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,380
and memory utilization for d if on

379
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,350
floor distribution switches seems to be
quite higher

380
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:51,730
but the only reason this arm during the
year SNMP

381
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:55,639
pauling over snmpv3 im the CPU spikes
and then get

382
00:23:55,639 --> 00:23:58,649
displayed here so the actual CPU

383
00:23:58,649 --> 00:24:01,940
you search of this device on quite low
or

384
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:08,940
then this plate your ants we have this
for

385
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:15,970
all for the wired network and of course
forty-a while if that works so

386
00:24:17,009 --> 00:24:20,480
but it seems that this application the
slut work

387
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,649
fairly well for a up this resolution
just

388
00:24:23,649 --> 00:24:27,799
that Mia quickly

389
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:31,830
reconnect hopefully D A

390
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:38,830
or look at the just that but I'm not so
sure about that

391
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,910
well yeah

392
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:47,280
on so I actually do not have any

393
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:51,450
scroll by here

394
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:56,059
are but as you can see here from of Paul
gateway

395
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:59,170
this is the up to a Sr I

396
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:03,190
you have a rich transmits I'll
utilization up

397
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:07,559
is 1.6 4 percent on with the peak of 5
percent

398
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:12,590
soul more or less on idling and we of
course

399
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:17,190
on unfortunately I can show you because
the don't

400
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:20,820
scrollbar and FA sales look good so far

401
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,950
yak

402
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:27,650
its a thanks can you read it

403
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:30,919
or is agreeable um

404
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:35,880
I'm more or less having a hard time now
reading it but

405
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:42,880
on in any case

406
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:48,190
cell I'll what I also did %uh I
configure it

407
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:52,759
the on and bar

408
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:56,739
protocol the netbook with application
recognition on the a Sr

409
00:25:56,739 --> 00:26:01,309
just to get an idea okay up which flies
are using on which protocol

410
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:05,059
on already is our and are communicating
with the outside world

411
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:08,369
portia on past six

412
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:13,679
hours and well

413
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,539
interesting I don't think that this on
is correct

414
00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:21,119
sixty terabytes no

415
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:27,129
a I don't know how how prime get through
these values but sixty terabytes worth

416
00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:30,799
a its not feasible and that this

417
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,869
client here is using 50 kicks a second

418
00:26:34,869 --> 00:26:39,779
well that squirrel have this can't be
correct for whatever reason the

419
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:43,039
I don't know are RDA's are all prime

420
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,179
of get the info but on its actually

421
00:26:46,179 --> 00:26:53,179
a not true at all a

422
00:26:53,859 --> 00:26:59,430
sorry what data

423
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:02,950
yeah it's a dirty yeah sure I'll

424
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:09,940
I have some weapon to face your the
controller I

425
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,550
I didn't activate on wlcm up but I
included the WLC

426
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:17,450
on here of India in the Prime so on and
that's all

427
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:20,690
up applications at least oMG already a

428
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:23,940
a Sr on I just saw ticket it would be
sufficient to

429
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:30,590
on included here but for whatever reason
the

430
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:33,620
well on to be totally honest up its
Steve

431
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:37,400
first time I've configured and installed
its all I'm

432
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,420
have to have a look okay

433
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:43,910
I'll where do I find all these shy nice
and shiny graphs

434
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:49,370
so you can let you know we can actually
see a decline come by association Dr

435
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:53,590
a and authentication up it seems as of
right now we have

436
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:57,970
one at seventy-six on clients connect
thats which of course

437
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:01,700
split up to difference

438
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:08,700
different ideas

439
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:21,050
well okay at least this number on is
correct as we can see here

440
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:24,110
on in the opera on

441
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:28,080
we of one to 10 on climb to the five
yards

442
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,450
abandoned 66 in a 2.4 he gets

443
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:36,330
up bad and with the on our top access
points how much

444
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:40,780
are bad with their actually on consuming
and as we see AP 10

445
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:44,660
are is leading with 13 and bits per
second and third decline

446
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,690
on connected to dis on access point

447
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:51,920
and not try to on activate

448
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,110
the you so-called HTTP or at the

449
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:59,530
DHCP profiling word feel WRC you should
supposedly

450
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:03,920
get an idea okay what kind of operating
systems are used in this conference at

451
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,710
work but looking at the data

452
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:10,150
well on yeah it's more than 45 actually

453
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:14,390
but as we can see your knowledge our top
client device us

454
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:18,110
arm I think this is the one a the guy
from yesterday a

455
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:21,370
a at least remember the mac address he
is currently a

456
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:24,470
arm downloading with 17 n bits and

457
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:27,760
loss or responsible for

458
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,970
fifty percent of the overall traffic for
today so

459
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:34,400
own yeah I don't want to know what he's
doing

460
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:41,400
but all we can see or pop

461
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:45,960
yeah on actually the year

462
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,809
number of users in it at 64 of s ideas

463
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:54,049
or increasing from year to year last
year I think the peak

464
00:29:54,049 --> 00:29:57,799
on the PQ those were

465
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:01,790
approximately 546 or something like that
on we are now at

466
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:05,140
of 13 currently which is a good thing

467
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:09,220
so it seems to work otherwise they would
have already left I'm PSID

468
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,620
and we have one up seventy a

469
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:16,390
wanna 57 I'll 55 plans connector

470
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:19,679
troop us on that work and three clients
connected to or knock

471
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,370
sido one one is mine at the other two

472
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:26,620
one-fifth and the other one from the on
that working

473
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,900
all crew so just to get

474
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:33,100
give you an idea okay on how does look
like and

475
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:38,630
how are the statistics up until I'll Sol

476
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:43,940
yeah all as a set the monitoring
infrastructure so our Intel it's just

477
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,460
saw

478
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:49,040
a lot Linux all or maybe now it's a
previous the

479
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,280
with the web server and some 30-scrip

480
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,780
which he wrote or he was responsible for
or

481
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:59,980
yeah I met in space on the monitoring
system from the

482
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,919
on CCC its ac3 not Mon and we just saw

483
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,559
customize the following purposes: and we
are collecting all informational the S&P

484
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,790
on we three you without medication with
encryption

485
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:16,600
so on the right on snmpv3

486
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,169
on and not without authentication

487
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:24,169
friction at all so for the NSX for
possible

488
00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:28,330
we are using are on balance armada of on
the previous the box

489
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:31,740
on bond on comes with previous the

490
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:37,860
that wasn't was or fine was replaced by
on bones on the a sparse and old

491
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,730
beginning with previously released ten
or something like that

492
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:45,010
so of its there into default on
inflation a

493
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:48,040
and on as always said we had at that

494
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,750
and we have a stateful not on 64
implementation on all rights are

495
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:54,720
aunt

496
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,649
you see diem configuration it's actually
pretty simple

497
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:00,649
arm from India's perspective are

498
00:32:00,649 --> 00:32:05,630
of course on he passed up an ipv6
address wat way and just the Indian ask

499
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:06,679
why with which were

500
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:09,730
sent by the v6 only clients are

501
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:14,320
yes at yes a and ipv6 and ipv4 outgoing
interface

502
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,409
we have been able to ipv6 here

503
00:32:17,409 --> 00:32:21,409
and we are you currently using I'm on
for someone to a 1.5 2

504
00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:25,200
and that we have the only thing

505
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,519
left which we have to specify a city in
a 6-4 on

506
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:32,669
prefix so the prefix was a which issues
too

507
00:32:32,669 --> 00:32:36,149
synthesize the squat a

508
00:32:36,149 --> 00:32:39,519
record answer the European s server

509
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,970
is sending to you v6 only clients soul

510
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:46,179
when're sauce is only available over
ipv4

511
00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:50,010
on the on bodice doing on just to look
up forty a record

512
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:54,679
get the thirty but to are I'll IP
address ipv4 address back

513
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:58,230
and up because we appeal slash 69

514
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:02,110
are ipv6 prefix the une bonne translates

515
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:05,529
diem 32-bit ipv4 address

516
00:33:05,529 --> 00:33:08,659
in hexadecimal and you and use this
address

517
00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:11,769
ass on the last 32 bits of this

518
00:33:11,769 --> 00:33:15,669
on prefix and this is the answer

519
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:18,919
which declined so we'll get when they
are querying

520
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:22,760
and ipv4 resource nobody I'm v6 only

521
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,190
on SSID which I can show you

522
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:29,429
I'll in a minute self I am

523
00:33:29,429 --> 00:33:34,330
then of course well we have to do to you
on air clean up 64 configuration on the

524
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:37,950
on a Sr this is just an excerpt from our

525
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:41,630
on interface up configuration oh I
omitted on

526
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:44,760
some output which is not on relevant

527
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:48,240
um for a topic here but on

528
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,590
this as as assets up the dedicated
ambulance up that what prefix whatever

529
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,309
you would call it

530
00:33:54,309 --> 00:33:57,669
so does the prefix which get that but I
said you're out at the ties months

531
00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:01,419
and I am pushing on the DNS server

532
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:05,520
a address so the unborn over on
ratatisements

533
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,890
and over dhcpv6 just to ensure thats

534
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:12,659
clients who do not understand this
optional mainly Windows clients

535
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:15,860
are and get on the up DNS server are

536
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:19,040
over t dhcpv6 overall other operating
systems

537
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,380
systems which do not support it 6
Android

538
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:25,770
get the DNS a server information over
the

539
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:29,630
are ratatisements yeah

540
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:33,760
on configuration was it was pretty
straight follow up so all we have to of

541
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,669
course on configure hello I have to
configure couple things

542
00:34:36,669 --> 00:34:39,830
on to make on that 64 arm running

543
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:43,220
Afghan we I have a after that

544
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:46,370
could figure 1960 these two people

545
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:51,580
where just a DNS server gets a gets on
transmitted to the client's I have to

546
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,390
specify

547
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:56,140
all but access list where Tia that 64
prefix

548
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:59,280
this specified as you can see here to
slash 96

549
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,760
at this will be used as a stateful on

550
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:08,040
prefix and as an acceptor have to
configure

551
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,560
an ipv4 pool on because the ipv6

552
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,970
packets sent from the clients have to be
translated to ipv4

553
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:19,150
on the ice on the A's are and so on

554
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,410
they had to you also and IP for

555
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:25,410
address pool which I configure it

556
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:29,730
on here and then I had to bundle all a
tease previous configuration up

557
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:32,820
with this command: to ensure that on

558
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,950
that 64 this running up and running

559
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:39,300
interestingly evolve come Sunday evening

560
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,380
on a Saturday evening at sea level club
or something like that

561
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:46,190
all of them I had a couple of issues um
getting to sing

562
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:49,260
on running for whatever reason the but

563
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,730
or I haven't changed anything and it
magically started to work

564
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:56,850
I don't know what happened at all but of
its working and that's all that counts

565
00:35:56,850 --> 00:36:01,590
and yes just an excerpt from some basic
connectivity test

566
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:05,340
on we have this URL

567
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:08,620
a ipv6 the ipv4 only

568
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:12,210
and as you can see it when I'm tried to
ping up at this

569
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:16,650
up DNS name I get on an ipv6 address

570
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:17,930
this at work

571
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:21,280
as we can see here at this is the DNS 64
ended up 64

572
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,420
prefix and the last 32bits

573
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:29,680
RTM I ipv4 on address or use the ipv4
address representative in the

574
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,400
exit at the mall are notation so if you
if you would convert

575
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,460
the last 32 bits from x2 decimal

576
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:41,380
you would get to you of ipv4 address and
as you can see you

577
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:44,840
i least get an answer on from the system

578
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,780
and and then paying at ping and the

579
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,880
URL or entity that same which is on
natively

580
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,650
unreachable or ipv6 a mess we can see
you

581
00:36:55,650 --> 00:37:00,200
it's just of mobile ipv6 operational I'm
so in this case it was

582
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,320
completed translated from P six will be
four and back

583
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,550
and here it just I was just plain ipv6

584
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:09,580
routing and what a of lookup

585
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:16,580
for and ipv6 on resource

586
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:19,869
yes some statistics from on yesterday
evening

587
00:37:19,869 --> 00:37:24,670
in regards to you the actual on
translational

588
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:29,760
this is just unacceptable as you can see
from the showed not up 64 statistics

589
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,310
from the A's are books which I did

590
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:34,849
yesterday evening and as we can see okay

591
00:37:34,849 --> 00:37:38,869
they are quite some packets translate
that which is a good thing so

592
00:37:38,869 --> 00:37:42,040
that means more people are using on the
disastrous idea

593
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,430
soul and in total a 35 translator

594
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:49,630
on eight million a type 94601

595
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:52,670
packets from ipv6 to on

596
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:55,920
ipv4 it dropped up to drop the packets

597
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,770
for up whatever reason up and it
translated

598
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:03,770
on more packet from ipv4 to ipv6

599
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:07,740
Indies

600
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:13,540
statistics

601
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:18,619
so I'll coming back to the air some
specifics of ipv6 in

602
00:38:18,619 --> 00:38:23,359
arm WiFi network as we all know on my
view 6 heavily relies on all

603
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:28,030
multicast based packets and in the white
at work this

604
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:32,660
may not be a such a big problem but in a
while if that works this can result

605
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:37,040
are in a lot of problems because on of
just wasted

606
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,100
air time because all the small dick of
both packets

607
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,779
half have to be replicated to all y los

608
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,380
klein's and when the access point is
transmitting

609
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:51,410
up the month ago space packets on he
blocks up the radio

610
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:55,000
and on yes it has to wait until the

611
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,030
on trance transmissions over as we know

612
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:03,070
up their wifi on this just shell
half-duplex

613
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:06,609
environment once they transmit all
others must be silent

614
00:39:06,609 --> 00:39:09,650
and a mordechai also broadcast

615
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:13,320
broadcast transmission from an on Access
Point if

616
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:17,030
on physically transmitted to all wifi
clients

617
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:20,670
and during that time no I don't know
what can use the violence

618
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:24,930
on connection up on until the
transmissions over

619
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:28,550
and it basically behave more or less
like an Ethernet hop

620
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:31,760
soul disposals on interesting problem

621
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,350
on at least in terms of scalability on
so

622
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:40,040
when you have a lot of lines sitting on
the wild side and on the wireless side

623
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,960
when they're all doing their fancy

624
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,760
a modicum space neighbor discovery on
stuff or other discovery sup

625
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,980
its gets pretty chatty in regards to
multicast traffic

626
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,720
in the mom in the specifically here

627
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:58,150
India all like six world Sol

628
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:02,340
and 1 o'clock both yes to do a public
address detection a

629
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:05,710
well for which he is using up to solicit
lot more because address

630
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:09,590
he is sending rather solicitations which
are sent to the link local on multiple

631
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,400
to cast group

632
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,910
route advertisements our sense typically

633
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:17,180
2d on link local all notes a multicast
group

634
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:20,760
I'll one modicum of abroad advertisement
Avery

635
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,400
ratatisements into a ball

636
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,829
aunt one solicited ratatisements per
host

637
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:30,910
joining on the network and

638
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:34,369
of course we have all this neighbor
discovery stuff

639
00:40:34,369 --> 00:40:38,020
so neighbor to neighbor solicitations
are mostly

640
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:41,650
are performed over a month ago space on
mechanisms

641
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:45,559
our neighbor advertisement are
multi-unit caspase

642
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:50,700
Sol all these on features a five to six
and generate a lot of

643
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,000
Modica space traffic and

644
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,170
if there are no on measures I would call
it

645
00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:01,380
on the wife aside to reduce the chat up
this way it's quite a lot about time

646
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:01,930
which did

647
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:05,079
to gates the overall performance of your

648
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:08,510
wifi network yeah

649
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:13,359
ads the problem is different wireless
clients may use different transmissions

650
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:14,799
and coatings and data rates

651
00:41:14,799 --> 00:41:17,859
and a lower rate affect the locks the
medium for longer

652
00:41:17,859 --> 00:41:21,740
are time for a bit because it up the
access point

653
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:25,549
just the longer to transmit a specific
packet when it is sending

654
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:30,180
a with the lower transmission rate yeah

655
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:34,430
and the FAA DX is part is constrained to
transmit all multicast and broadcast

656
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,450
based

657
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:39,990
frames at the lowest rates possible so
when I have on

658
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:44,069
why and a 802 not 11 and clients

659
00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:48,430
and I f1 802 11b klein's on he has to

660
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:51,470
use the rates on of the I'll

661
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:54,609
802 11 be on client to ensure that

662
00:41:54,609 --> 00:41:58,569
he will also receive this all these
packets

663
00:41:58,569 --> 00:42:02,020
which is a problem Sol all

664
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,799
in general when you can where you at
least 10 can control the endpoints

665
00:42:05,799 --> 00:42:09,049
arm it may be beneficial to

666
00:42:09,049 --> 00:42:12,599
completely deactivated to you on be a
802

667
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:16,020
11 .be which I have I have

668
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:19,910
the activator some on speed so the
low-speed possible

669
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:23,990
on which has to be mandatory up
supporters 11 ambit

670
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:27,210
I could go don't hire but I wasn't sure
on

671
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:30,609
if this look if this stuff not cause any
problems with

672
00:42:30,609 --> 00:42:34,619
some clients soul when a client want to
join

673
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:37,829
here and does that work yes to on
support at least

674
00:42:37,829 --> 00:42:41,640
arm11 a bit and every rate

675
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,910
lower than that one and its on to 6

676
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:48,269
are completely on he activated yes

677
00:42:48,269 --> 00:42:54,549
I

678
00:42:54,549 --> 00:42:58,319
no I did not but did not tested in a
practical

679
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:03,180
yeah

680
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:10,180
yes I college minute in this case there

681
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:28,680
well

682
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,719
on at least from my understanding I may
I could be wrong up from my

683
00:43:31,719 --> 00:43:32,410
understanding

684
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:36,829
on it should but on as a set may be
wrong after double check that

685
00:43:36,829 --> 00:43:40,539
on but we can on chat about it the of
during lunch break

686
00:43:40,539 --> 00:43:43,729
arm but it is my

687
00:43:43,729 --> 00:43:47,209
on understanding that the church upset
at 11 on them

688
00:43:47,209 --> 00:43:51,509
megabits because I on configured on the
of wlcm

689
00:43:51,509 --> 00:43:55,279
that the all other all lower speeds I
completely disabled

690
00:43:55,279 --> 00:43:59,029
and you slowest possible speed is 11
tablets all

691
00:43:59,029 --> 00:44:02,609
up at least from my understanding from
the documentation to he should send

692
00:44:02,609 --> 00:44:05,769
up to you all the frames with on at
least 11 habits

693
00:44:05,769 --> 00:44:09,949
could paint yes

694
00:44:09,949 --> 00:44:15,259
on the hopes that you have to double
check that yeah

695
00:44:15,259 --> 00:44:18,609
of as he sets it is often translates to
as low as one

696
00:44:18,609 --> 00:44:21,609
megabit or so %uh 6 megabits a even when
the

697
00:44:21,609 --> 00:44:25,619
rate could potentially reach of hundreds
of megabits and

698
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:30,279
sending a single multicast on frame can
consume as much better the thoughts of

699
00:44:30,279 --> 00:44:30,939
you may cast

700
00:44:30,939 --> 00:44:34,469
friends because it just have to be
replicated to every arm cloud connected

701
00:44:34,469 --> 00:44:35,269
to the wifi

702
00:44:35,269 --> 00:44:38,779
up that work and that was recently

703
00:44:38,779 --> 00:44:42,549
other walls I think last year some work
done

704
00:44:42,549 --> 00:44:46,029
inside the IT Espace from ugly a tangle

705
00:44:46,029 --> 00:44:49,599
at UCB Inc and love encircle etiam who

706
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:53,089
ad look okay how tough the

707
00:44:53,089 --> 00:44:56,549
a wifi utilization of on look like when
using

708
00:44:56,549 --> 00:44:59,650
Ahmad the Gulf based packets face on the

709
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:06,650
0 well

710
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:10,640
just give me a second yeah

711
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,119
were back yeah

712
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:17,599
so they did a little bit of research
became

713
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,900
a based on the lowest and highest love
wifi rates

714
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,900
and the percentages of multicast based

715
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:28,569
frames on on in this why Love on network

716
00:45:28,569 --> 00:45:31,960
how much utilization up on

717
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:36,260
is on done by a multicast in their wifi

718
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:40,240
on environment ads as a kid as we can
see here

719
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,119
it rapidly on growth on

720
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:47,190
as soon as the percentage of the month
ago space

721
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:50,900
up frames on increases on

722
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:54,500
and I if you're interested in more
details

723
00:45:54,500 --> 00:46:00,260
these on I can at the end of the flights
out to reference a studio arm

724
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:03,819
work these people left on India I TF

725
00:46:03,819 --> 00:46:07,240
where they have I'll release a draft I
think on where they are

726
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:11,599
on explaining about all of that yeah

727
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:15,020
up another problem is that we are you do
not have any

728
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:18,510
on acknowledge a acknowledgement
mechanisms and WiFi network so that

729
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:19,890
means frames can be missed

730
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:23,450
and the neighbor discovery protocol that
does not take

731
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:27,430
a packet loss into account on at least
not up up until now

732
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:31,200
this could potentially have a negative
impact I'm in regards to

733
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,150
duplicate address detection im so when
the clouds configuring ipv6 address

734
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:38,359
you're sending the neighbor felicitation
to verify the unique uniqueness

735
00:46:38,359 --> 00:46:41,690
and the packets get lost all he doesn't
get an answer

736
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:45,119
when a when a second station has this a

737
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:49,650
as I P ipv6 address and discuss of
course that on

738
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:52,829
cause an issue because to Clydes having
the same IP sex at birth

739
00:46:52,829 --> 00:46:56,630
which is quite unlikely on but that
could happen

740
00:46:56,630 --> 00:47:01,369
and the problem the basic problem is
that the neighbors company public all up

741
00:47:01,369 --> 00:47:02,520
until now to take

742
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,640
on act of into account yeah

743
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:10,130
and you have to account for spur

744
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:13,920
a specific arrow rates in the wifi all
networks

745
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,950
and assuming an error rate of
eight-percent 40

746
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:18,710
corrupt the frame

747
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,680
if than a percent chance of losing a
complete frame

748
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,530
which then translates to are a 60
percent chance of not detecting a

749
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:26,230
duplicate

750
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:29,560
all address which could result on

751
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:33,150
into in problems but that's not
necessarily have to

752
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:36,740
yeah another problem

753
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:40,260
specific to WiFi networks sleeping hosts

754
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:43,970
on when else wake up wakes up

755
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:47,890
then of course he sent them all to Kelso
base rather solicitation a

756
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:51,670
district as a rod advertising message
from all on a chase brought us

757
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:54,980
he is doing to duplicate address
detection was link local address

758
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:58,240
transmitting on to mordechai stable
felicitations

759
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,630
and all these packets are repeated by
Access Point

760
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:07,020
to all other wifi klein's so that means
when there are several clients up

761
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:07,680
sleeping

762
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:13,140
they have to wake up because aren't they
have to process the multicast based

763
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,580
are package which of course then trains

764
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:23,580
the battery of this device yeah

765
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:27,220
at up as a set all the small details

766
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:32,580
it based packets have to get on
broadcaster or transmitted

767
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:35,850
all wireless clients on if not all

768
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:39,560
optimized which should be done

769
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:44,010
to on in order to minimize the airtime
which issues for this

770
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:47,860
all stuff and the same be happy of
course

771
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:52,350
4 per every Global Address so we have

772
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:55,770
6 wifi broadcast packets plus the unique
health replies

773
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:58,830
reply for each wake up of of the device

774
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:02,570
of one device so are this

775
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:06,710
of course then on scares up because

776
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:10,060
on the other devices have to wake up and
at least process all the

777
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:14,210
month ago space packets ads

778
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:17,400
yes just some another all example

779
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:22,340
the multicast wifi you such by sleeping
devices so when they wake up

780
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:25,660
how much bandwidth do they actually arm

781
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:29,330
consumer and how much a multicast bits
are transmitted per second

782
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:31,340
of when they wake up

783
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:34,710
up based on the different number of on
clients with a

784
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:37,920
with a specific wake up of cycle so

785
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,630
are we have pa1 life like five thousand
I've solving

786
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:45,810
with different wake up cycle six on a
second three other seconds

787
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:50,030
and this translates to a specific a
model for the cost-based packets

788
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:53,700
of sense per second which

789
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:56,830
that an increase of the utilization of
the WiFi network

790
00:49:56,830 --> 00:50:00,040
are in regards are two more to go both
packets

791
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:03,150
so as we can see here now are here this

792
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:06,270
up 1 percent with 5,000 left my clients

793
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:09,490
I waking up every 60 seconds we have

794
00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:13,180
utilization of 4.8 percent and

795
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:16,730
when I wake up cycle of about 30 seconds
we have

796
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:20,580
utilization of 9.6 percent so nearly
double

797
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:24,750
up to you utilization up or more than
double the utilization

798
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:28,050
on in re got someone to go off packets
in the wifi

799
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:31,560
of network yep

800
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:36,550
on and has already said we of course
quite a lot of local WiFi clients on to

801
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:37,410
save the battery

802
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:40,840
on day 08 they go into a rate you'll
sleep mode well

803
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:44,020
they're actually they can still be used
but the radio is

804
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:47,620
on sleeping until there's a local need
to send a while

805
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:50,880
frame so and thinking about the

806
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,050
ratatisements August based packets

807
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:57,480
the client has two power up the are

808
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,570
radio has to cross the picket even if
the you

809
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:04,610
even if it doesn't care about the packet
he has to process it which means he has

810
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:05,800
to power up the radio

811
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,540
this consumes of course of the battery
so the battery lifetime

812
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:13,230
get the greatest and on the

813
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:16,340
you have to plug in your on device

814
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:21,080
more often it the pop lock up to
recharge it yeah

815
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:24,820
that's they already have also

816
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:28,480
did a little bit of research on about
that

817
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,490
about the impact on the low-power hosts

818
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:35,860
in the up wife and my 0 at wifi
environments

819
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:39,230
in we got through bought a gas space are
packets

820
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:42,740
I'll where you can see okay how much
time

821
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:44,529
a bustier

822
00:51:44,529 --> 00:51:47,390
actual on client bob has to say up

823
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:50,459
India awake state based

824
00:51:50,459 --> 00:51:54,219
on the amount of multicast frames which
are sent

825
00:51:54,219 --> 00:51:57,670
on seconds we're with the he ok AP
Cannes France

826
00:51:57,670 --> 00:52:02,529
on ourselves on 10 per every second
which is a novel

827
00:52:02,529 --> 00:52:05,719
on time frame because and beacon

828
00:52:05,719 --> 00:52:08,930
for in situ sent approximately every 100
up

829
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:13,170
milliseconds up and when we are sending
fifty multicast base frames

830
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:18,069
every second on with them 30 bite-size

831
00:52:18,069 --> 00:52:21,309
at the lowest rate this are translate to

832
00:52:21,309 --> 00:52:25,910
up for dinner 4 percent fall awake time
and

833
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:30,579
in regatta in comparison to the four-day
percent

834
00:52:30,579 --> 00:52:33,650
of its more than up double the time

835
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:37,099
I'll rate you has to be awake state and

836
00:52:37,099 --> 00:52:40,229
process all these Modica space packets

837
00:52:40,229 --> 00:52:43,410
so as you can see above all these models
based

838
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:46,609
are mechanisms in the IP six world

839
00:52:46,609 --> 00:52:51,390
will have a negative impact on your wifi
klein's if there are not any

840
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:54,979
all optimizations Don either on the

841
00:52:54,979 --> 00:52:58,400
on access point or centrally on the W on
LC

842
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,969
sold them

843
00:53:02,969 --> 00:53:06,670
we have another problem dev so-called

844
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:09,789
I called it the multicast distribution
problem

845
00:53:09,789 --> 00:53:14,680
primarily in control a best wifi
networks now here in a Cisco space on

846
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:15,890
because left on all this

847
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:19,529
up with them Cisco WLC the problem if

848
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:25,359
up that of course the when for example a
row to sense the rather advertisements

849
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:28,630
on the rod advertisements gets to India
up

850
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:31,660
WLC and the WLC health replicate

851
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:35,109
this are brought up but I sent to every
extra point

852
00:53:35,109 --> 00:53:38,519
a which it wasa which are connected

853
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:42,779
to the while a flat control up

854
00:53:42,779 --> 00:53:46,059
so he asked the duplicates on the packet

855
00:53:46,059 --> 00:53:49,380
and followed it through the cup of
boiled up arm

856
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:52,749
tunnel to the exit point so that the
access point contrast the 2d

857
00:53:52,749 --> 00:53:56,340
connect that clients

858
00:53:56,340 --> 00:54:00,010
Sol I better depending on the number of
extra points

859
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:03,550
which are connected up to the EEOC %um
this good results

860
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:07,410
in little bit of birth because one

861
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:11,750
multicast base router advertisements up
gets ya been on the WLC a

862
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:16,970
and yes replicate this about this
ratatisements

863
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:20,000
to all of associated access points

864
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,730
yeah and depending as a set depending on
a number of X

865
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:28,760
points the controller might need to
generate up to 30 copy

866
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,950
copies of each multicast based packets
and as we've

867
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:35,120
on no on my view 6 using a lot of Malta
gas-based

868
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:38,510
up packets this translates to quite a
huge

869
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:42,540
burden on the processing power of the
EEOC when he has to do

870
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:46,350
are all a he's would have to send all
these copies

871
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:51,500
up and then flooding that work with a
large number of duplicate unique cast

872
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,600
on packets to any access points so that
they can

873
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,600
that they get transmitted 280 actual

874
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:02,370
wifi clients soul up this is just solve
a problem

875
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:07,040
on between on the WLC and he actually
bought the stuff nothing

876
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,710
up to sort of have to do with the actual
ipv6

877
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:14,940
multicast base problem which I talked
about earlier this is just a problem

878
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:19,270
how the WRC you on trance but all the
about the gas phase packets

879
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:22,460
up to all access points which are
Associated

880
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:25,820
up to him regardless on whether it's up

881
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:29,520
ipv4 multicast placed back into what I
six months ago space packet

882
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,950
the main problem is that the controller
has to replicate

883
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:37,650
this these packets up to ensure that
every

884
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:43,310
extra point up receive this up packet

885
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:47,870
yeah they're quite a lot a a couple
things which can be done

886
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:51,770
up to on reduce on this problem

887
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:55,560
so you can use on specific multicast

888
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:59,080
group on the access points and on the

889
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:02,990
are a WLC so that Wendy w/o theory

890
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:06,450
receive the router advertisement he does
not have to generate

891
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:10,360
are a copy for each access point he is
just sending

892
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:14,130
DU are hirata advertisements

893
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:17,510
to a specific multicast address

894
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:21,020
and all these access points our member
of the small decaf

895
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:24,210
of address so whts just to send it out

896
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:27,360
once and every member of this

897
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:30,390
multicast group which would presumably
all on

898
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:33,590
exploits will on receive this or

899
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:37,320
multicast packet and then it gets
forwarded

900
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:40,680
to the actual of clients Saudi
controller

901
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:44,070
on doesn't have to up copy three other
for that

902
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:48,460
up packets up he just has to send it out

903
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:51,780
to a specific multicast group and

904
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:55,030
just once and every extra point here

905
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:59,290
its member of this group and the packets
replicated

906
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:03,150
to be explained of course if you have a
route infrastructure

907
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:07,110
this have of course are implies that you
up August based routing

908
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:10,730
up implemented in your core your
otherwise this would not work

909
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:14,650
well luckily here this environment I'm
using

910
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:18,120
of this mechanisms but because them
they're all sitting in the same

911
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:21,940
all logical thought that I do not have
to configure on but because based

912
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:22,450
routing

913
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:25,470
they're just sending it out at the
access point to remember

914
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:29,080
are of this rubin et getting are the
packet

915
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:33,020
and up then we got to go but this'll
this quite a simple

916
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:36,270
on environment here if you have a a
complex environment a

917
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:40,470
where the access point or not layer two
adjacent up to wlcm

918
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:43,560
you have to rely on multicast routing
I'm in order to ensure

919
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:50,560
are that the I'll packets gets up gets
your to the access points

920
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:59,650
all my can show you pretty quickly

921
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:08,810
yeah as you can see here it is to

922
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:12,119
on the AP multicast mode and the

923
00:58:12,119 --> 00:58:15,990
ipv6 multicast called sodium ate up the
road train

924
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:19,950
has more ipv6 cap abilities

925
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:23,290
on then up the seven train that the

926
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:26,660
than the 7.6 train so and as you can see
here

927
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:31,250
I'm using an ipv4 I'll more to cast does
as well as an ipv6

928
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:37,060
on more diecast group up which gets you
thru replicate the Baltic of packets

929
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:38,339
that the appeals to receive

930
00:58:38,339 --> 00:58:42,950
to send them to the access points so
that the WRC does not have to

931
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:46,290
are copy all the packet the multicast
place packets to

932
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:49,450
unique health to upside to all access
points

933
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:52,880
and are interestingly

934
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:58,630
the I Cup up thought the topless topless
min between the access point and the WLC

935
00:58:58,630 --> 00:58:59,109
you

936
00:58:59,109 --> 00:59:02,440
can in the aid of their train can be
realized

937
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:06,400
over ipv6 but to be fair I was brave
enough to test

938
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:11,380
up so I just relied at least forty Cup
up Tom Lasorda communication between the

939
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:13,760
access point and the actual controller

940
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,950
still are realized OVR are ipv4

941
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:21,849
up as we can see here arm but in theory
it should work

942
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:26,050
with IP with six as well of course you
have to provide updates appear

943
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:29,660
six over for dress assignment that you
actual points get their address

944
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:34,210
and of course on they on you have to
provide to DHCP options

945
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:37,210
so that the country so that the access
points find

946
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:40,950
are the controller this is mandatory of
course

947
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:46,480
but on it should work but in all honesty
I Aug 22 type 1 strains

948
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,599
I really would like to have it over ipv6
but

949
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:53,060
architects time with friends I just
wasn't able to test that at both fight

950
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:56,420
works as expected tho adjusted the all

951
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:59,540
ipv4 just got to the eye for

952
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:03,190
alt

953
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:05,960
yeah I guess you can also see here on
diem

954
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:10,940
WRC also on supports link aggregation of

955
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:14,300
I'll unfortunately only static sono al
LA

956
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:18,280
LACP or no PA que fue on when you're
using Cisco proprietary stuff

957
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:21,730
arms just upside report on Channel on

958
01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:25,180
St w/o cs4 port or more

959
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:28,270
about half on both four of these Gigabit
ports

960
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:31,640
21 up what channel on the WLC site and
on the

961
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:35,250
on course which site on just you
distribute the load

962
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:38,270
are between different physical
interfaces thought that the that

963
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:41,600
not all has to go through one on

964
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:45,390
interface from the WLC 22 wired
infrastructure

965
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:48,920
just two on prevent that out that there
may be some

966
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:53,740
bottlenecks but

967
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:57,990
based on the band was which issues here
one with this action but

968
01:00:57,990 --> 01:01:02,670
adjusted just perfect for in the book in
the

969
01:01:02,670 --> 01:01:08,309
think aggregation group

970
01:01:08,309 --> 01:01:11,780
yeah a we all

971
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:16,010
already talked about this this %uh stuff
also only apply to ipv6 this up this

972
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:19,990
applies to all multi of both packets
which are transmitted on the wild side

973
01:01:19,990 --> 01:01:23,750
up for example when you're using for
some runs the protocol

974
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:27,420
for example HSRP they are arm

975
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:30,960
sending there hello packets to a
specific

976
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,030
a multicast arm group and of course

977
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:38,270
def has to be a are transmitted as well
up to all these clients

978
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:41,549
soul diskette seriously great the

979
01:01:41,549 --> 01:01:44,990
wifi throughput for clients when you're
using

980
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:48,780
something like milliseconds Hilo hello
time of on when you want to have a

981
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:50,650
failover time of less than one second

982
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:54,690
so up without any optimization up this
could save you earlier

983
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:57,809
on the great your wifi performance

984
01:01:57,809 --> 01:02:01,190
saw

985
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:05,230
coming back to the ipv6 up specifics
what can we actually do

986
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:09,390
to reduce the chanting death of five to
six and WiFi

987
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:12,599
networks there are actually a on

988
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:15,970
very good presentation from an acute
angle Francisco

989
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:19,619
he which is doing on arm on every Cisco
live

990
01:02:19,619 --> 01:02:22,789
are event where I thought exactly
talking about that

991
01:02:22,789 --> 01:02:27,059
and I stole some configuration up on
from him

992
01:02:27,059 --> 01:02:30,880
I'll and he's a very smart guy up in
regards to ipv6

993
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,990
wifi are that works as we know

994
01:02:34,990 --> 01:02:39,020
or never discovery process on this all
based on August based

995
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:42,329
up packets and the controller has a

996
01:02:42,329 --> 01:02:46,010
acts as a so-called up proxy

997
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:50,359
so when I'm sending a neighbor a
multicast based neighbor solicitation

998
01:02:50,359 --> 01:02:54,720
at the controller already knows on the
client which I want to have to get

999
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:59,609
mac address from up this month ago space
pack it does not get replicated to

1000
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:02,910
all on wife I'm clients are

1001
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:08,720
in that the WLC you will answer to you
on specific lives and

1002
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:12,279
the Armada gust based packet of not get
replicated

1003
01:03:12,279 --> 01:03:16,140
into or to all wifi all clients

1004
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:21,640
when you're when we r for example

1005
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:24,150
I'm just five firing up while shock
amaya

1006
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:28,650
wifi connection to

1007
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:31,970
and I'm

1008
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:38,970
I will connect to the conference not
work mean of course

1009
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:44,050
now we have a little bit definite yeah I
don't know what this

1010
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:47,609
if I have this I have to since yesterday

1011
01:03:47,609 --> 01:03:51,940
everytime I connect to a network be at
Ida y at all why does and yes I D

1012
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:55,569
%uh doesn't matter he always tell me %uh
there's an IP address conflict

1013
01:03:55,569 --> 01:03:58,880
but well sorry

1014
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:04,970
up okay

1015
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:08,079
um I think he lies to me because

1016
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:15,079
well

1017
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:20,050
where do I find it here

1018
01:04:20,050 --> 01:04:23,870
yeah perfect that's it into

1019
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:27,740
that's an interesting what the system
detected an IP a conflict 5p at

1020
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:28,700
Roscommon column

1021
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:33,370
all fifth forty on specified address
with the system having network hardware

1022
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:33,810
address

1023
01:04:33,810 --> 01:04:37,220
blah blah blah blah blah blah are that's
an interesting one

1024
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:41,150
ants it just started yesterday but I
don't know

1025
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:44,490
what was causing its on for whatever
reason

1026
01:04:44,490 --> 01:04:49,440
arm you think the case someone else has
the up specified address

1027
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:53,650
well at least temporarily FBI you see
flight path that dress

1028
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:58,090
yet but I will just

1029
01:04:58,090 --> 01:05:01,540
let's have a look okay we have few or

1030
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:04,820
or our Dadu stuff

1031
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:11,820
but as we see you there's actually a

1032
01:05:15,769 --> 01:05:18,559
no on answering 40

1033
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:22,089
on pretty your requests all for whatever
reason the

1034
01:05:22,089 --> 01:05:27,170
by one of boxing's okay on there is a
duplicate IP address

1035
01:05:27,170 --> 01:05:31,480
cell

1036
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:35,059
but coming back to the Wireshark we see
you

1037
01:05:35,059 --> 01:05:38,240
besides the initial traffic

1038
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:42,789
on by initializing the of I 26 sec

1039
01:05:42,789 --> 01:05:46,180
or connecting to the sidi and doing some
all

1040
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:49,210
vs magic we see your

1041
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:52,660
we don't see much your soul all we don't
see you

1042
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:56,480
an e-marketplace packets all at all i
mean of course

1043
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:00,230
we had on little bit earlier we had of
course our audit the title so that I get

1044
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:01,180
my view 6

1045
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:04,960
on configuration on correct but besides
that

1046
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:08,700
ads based on the fact that that

1047
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:12,750
up until now there are more than one at
fifty klein's are connected

1048
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:17,150
to India are true plus wifi network
there should normally be more mud to

1049
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:17,799
caspase

1050
01:06:17,799 --> 01:06:22,170
noise are than what we are seeing here
and the reason for that the simple

1051
01:06:22,170 --> 01:06:25,849
up the WLC I'm just stuff up up for this
traffic

1052
01:06:25,849 --> 01:06:29,440
to the wifi klein's on because he is
acting

1053
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:34,589
as a proxy always say he okay so
application data but thats

1054
01:06:34,589 --> 01:06:38,059
but as but this is just all unique
outpace up traffic and nothing

1055
01:06:38,059 --> 01:06:43,029
multicast based so

1056
01:06:43,029 --> 01:06:46,190
just connecting to do you address

1057
01:06:46,190 --> 01:06:50,670
studies so that I have so that I can
connect to you

1058
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:53,750
to WLC to show you

1059
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:57,630
well

1060
01:06:57,630 --> 01:07:04,630
maybe not troopers

1061
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:12,390
looks better

1062
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:19,390
so where up here

1063
01:07:29,470 --> 01:07:33,480
well and when we when we have a look at
the show ipv6

1064
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:36,620
on neighbor binding just doing a quick
summary a

1065
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:41,530
because of the revolution the look like
very good

1066
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:45,580
but up what we see Europe these are all
the entries

1067
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:49,040
the wlcm hassen is they've a binding

1068
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:52,160
on cash fall the address this are

1069
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:55,830
on the wifi side he has seen and when
I'm sending in a ball

1070
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:59,850
are the solicitation for one of the
address a stadium up WC

1071
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:03,460
WLC already Dolce of are he does not
follow what

1072
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:06,500
this neighbor felicitation up to all the
wifi klein's

1073
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:10,650
inset he will answer me Munich Espace
okay

1074
01:08:10,650 --> 01:08:14,410
that this a specific ipv6 address is
reachable over a

1075
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:17,590
of mac Address why a and

1076
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:21,090
as of right now as we can see we have a
total of 4.5

1077
01:08:21,090 --> 01:08:24,150
of entries and its neighbor binding

1078
01:08:24,150 --> 01:08:29,170
on table and when entries not

1079
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:32,510
up inside the in this on binding table

1080
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:36,970
then of course the naval solicitation
that will get for what it so that the

1081
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:40,150
are LLC has a chance to see okay

1082
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:43,450
does this on station actually on

1083
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:46,680
or cessation actually alive when it's a
life up

1084
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:49,960
he will insert allman entry here and its
neighbor binding

1085
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:53,740
and the suit as another on Klein tries
to reach

1086
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:57,170
order dusty neighbor of revolution for
dis

1087
01:08:57,170 --> 01:09:00,200
on for IP address: diem

1088
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:03,210
LLC will answer for what the political
space

1089
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:07,850
packets and that's all the WLC magic is
doing

1090
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:11,109
a and you you do not have to configure
anything at all

1091
01:09:11,109 --> 01:09:14,780
up that's just up on by default in this
doing this India

1092
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:18,240
default configuration just optimize the

1093
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:21,400
all distribution of multiphase packets

1094
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:28,400
on in the wifi that work

1095
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:39,120
old long but

1096
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:42,980
yeah so last up did i do

1097
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:47,370
arm the WLC has a feature which is
called

1098
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:50,970
RA arm throttling when the router

1099
01:09:50,970 --> 01:09:54,640
ascending periodically brought
advertisement for example every three or

1100
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:55,490
four seconds

1101
01:09:55,490 --> 01:10:00,180
on and this month ago space pack it has
to be transmitted to do. actual

1102
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:04,240
all or to your wifi klein's this of
course

1103
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:08,020
results in quite a lot of of waste that
at time

1104
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:11,830
because because it gets replicated to
all while us

1105
01:10:11,830 --> 01:10:16,350
plots and to reduce that on the EEOC has
a so-called

1106
01:10:16,350 --> 01:10:19,540
air RA I'll throttling way can achieve

1107
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:22,600
that and ratatisements only on

1108
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:26,330
sent to order while its clients are in a
specific

1109
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:29,940
are into while and all others all other

1110
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:33,100
are brought up the ties with the client
the WLC receives

1111
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:37,010
archer just gets I'll throttled and will
not be four warded

1112
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:40,080
2d actual wifi clients

1113
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:43,300
are because I as the asean-india

1114
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:47,610
of class act race we have only seen one
route advertisement which will send

1115
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:52,200
after I i after I have sent to rob a
solicitation but the actual Intel which

1116
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:54,240
I have configured on the interface on
the

1117
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:58,600
on the router if four seconds on just
I've to Liberty configured it

1118
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:02,370
very small just to see okay well does
this feature work

1119
01:11:02,370 --> 01:11:05,770
I'll so that I can troubleshoot of a
couple things because we have this

1120
01:11:05,770 --> 01:11:09,320
up we r issue on Saturday am that the

1121
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:13,180
router II initially I had the into all
set to

1122
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:16,530
1100 second so every 30 minutes

1123
01:11:16,530 --> 01:11:19,890
should be sufficient because when a
client comes up he said the rubble

1124
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:20,710
solicits

1125
01:11:20,710 --> 01:11:24,350
rather solicitation up the Rado rather
answers and all this good

1126
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:29,650
but for whatever reason the up brought
up the top respond to rob the

1127
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:30,460
solicitations

1128
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:33,750
so that means all ipv6 was not working
on

1129
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:37,730
and of to up what is this you

1130
01:11:37,730 --> 01:11:41,050
but I had no time to followed it up on I
just

1131
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:44,830
on reduce the into a ball to make sure

1132
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:48,100
okay that declines get

1133
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:55,100
the IP to ipv6 configuration pretty
quickly

1134
01:11:55,889 --> 01:11:56,280
yeah

1135
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:59,449
um a couple of other things

1136
01:11:59,449 --> 01:12:03,260
all my life but figured a mess I'll
initially set inspired by Andrea Chang

1137
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:04,889
co pham thank you again

1138
01:12:04,889 --> 01:12:08,030
up for that where some specific prior
meet us

1139
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:12,349
on the are gateway site I have
configured the

1140
01:12:12,349 --> 01:12:16,030
a a row to lifetime to arm 9000 on

1141
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:19,329
seconds salt that the actual

1142
01:12:19,329 --> 01:12:23,920
on that the year information stored in a
rather the Titans is valid for

1143
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:28,650
9000 on seconds and based on my
calculation

1144
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:31,969
I initially wanted to sent on their
other Thais

1145
01:12:31,969 --> 01:12:35,650
every 1800 seconds so even though the
client

1146
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:39,610
would potentially also up to rot at
hostels due to the wifi right

1147
01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:42,780
armpit he would be possible a or

1148
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:46,309
you I view 6 connection with the work at
the third one would go through

1149
01:12:46,309 --> 01:12:50,920
and would be inside this lifetime
additionally

1150
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:54,090
I increased the you reachable

1151
01:12:54,090 --> 01:12:57,300
lifetime to 90 seconds so lost

1152
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:00,809
what does this reach a lifetime do well
up

1153
01:13:00,809 --> 01:13:05,869
this just basically means that the year
neighbor cache entry

1154
01:13:05,869 --> 01:13:09,510
on the wifi clients for the router stays

1155
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:13,260
India reachable state for 900 seconds

1156
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:17,639
just to reduce the are neighbor up on
reachability detection a

1157
01:13:17,639 --> 01:13:21,729
on induced chatting us soul

1158
01:13:21,729 --> 01:13:25,179
just that tickle that all clients which
are receiving

1159
01:13:25,179 --> 01:13:28,360
other odd advertisement from this router
all half

1160
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:31,780
this entry for the router individual
state for

1161
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:37,979
are 900 seconds yeah

1162
01:13:37,979 --> 01:13:43,180
and Essex as you can see you

1163
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:46,070
which alzheimer are which s on

1164
01:13:46,070 --> 01:13:50,250
configured as up me seconds and

1165
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:54,230
the life and soul and lifetime up nine
thousand seconds

1166
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:57,260
at which a full-time are miners
thousands

1167
01:13:57,260 --> 01:14:03,890
well sec yeah

1168
01:14:03,890 --> 01:14:08,680
all this was a configuration I've done
arm on the wild on site just

1169
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:12,630
to reduce the chat another five to six
and luckily wlcm

1170
01:14:12,630 --> 01:14:17,040
has some built-in features to reduce up
the year China's 526 order

1171
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:20,300
distribution of multiphase packets are
even more

1172
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:24,510
to on safe on at time and about to
increase the

1173
01:14:24,510 --> 01:14:28,100
on the throughput of the wifi network

1174
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:31,350
so are but of course on

1175
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:35,480
we also have to think about some
security features in the wifi space

1176
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:40,800
in regards on to for a sub security
mechanisms available on the Top you'll

1177
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:41,360
see

1178
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:45,800
and the first of security is just a
marketing term from

1179
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:49,230
on the Cisco which %uh specify a slum a
couple of of

1180
01:14:49,230 --> 01:14:52,460
mitigating techniques for our several

1181
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:56,260
of attacks and the WLC it does support a
number

1182
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:59,280
up a few just discussed below I'll just
quickly

1183
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:02,970
skim through to we have are a god we
have TCP 6 cart

1184
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:06,500
we have IP source guard and we have

1185
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:09,720
are ipv6 on ACLs which altered

1186
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:14,340
can be configured on the on wrcb some of
these

1187
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:18,170
on features all are enabled by default
some of them you can't even

1188
01:15:18,170 --> 01:15:21,760
figure they are just enabled by default
for example are

1189
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:26,320
dhcpv6 carts on at least according to
the documentation that this enabled by

1190
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,010
default

1191
01:15:27,010 --> 01:15:30,540
and you do not have the possibility to
deactivated for

1192
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:34,990
whatever reason but I haven't actually
test that if it processes I hired

1193
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:39,750
up I just of suffocate the

1194
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:43,190
documentation at least should be
sufficient

1195
01:15:43,190 --> 01:15:47,480
all up until now then we up are ipv6 or
Scott

1196
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:51,000
army neighborhoods on this is of course
a pitcher are

1197
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,820
which prevents I P spoofing

1198
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:58,500
and bomb because the up w ill C you have
today but by the table where yes the

1199
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:02,770
up the information from IP six on the
address to mac Address up he can

1200
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:03,480
implement

1201
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:06,750
live TV I V x4 Scott more or less
reliable

1202
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:10,640
but only for this of thinkable and you
can of course

1203
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:14,030
configure ipv6

1204
01:16:14,030 --> 01:16:17,460
ACLs like on any on Cisco device

1205
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:20,610
these are disabled by default but of
course you

1206
01:16:20,610 --> 01:16:24,680
have the possibility to go to get them
and apply them on the extra point

1207
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:28,150
up level so that traffic are gets
already

1208
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:33,960
fitters on the extra point that as you
can see here for I got

1209
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:37,530
you as you can see 'em you cannot
disable it

1210
01:16:37,530 --> 01:16:42,050
on the WLC level the only level way we
could potentially disable it

1211
01:16:42,050 --> 01:16:45,330
obviously the extra point level by the
always

1212
01:16:45,330 --> 01:16:48,340
on on on the WLC

1213
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:51,380
yeah soul

1214
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:54,730
then I configure some ipv6

1215
01:16:54,730 --> 01:16:58,150
arm ACLs does anybody know are

1216
01:16:58,150 --> 01:17:01,800
which protocol on is using QTP 5353

1217
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:05,460
it's an apple

1218
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:09,160
use protocol yeah what you up

1219
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:13,810
and DNS I'm honestly I don't want the
crappy protocol here my wifi network as

1220
01:17:13,810 --> 01:17:17,250
they are distributing of all the
phagosome August based mechanism so I

1221
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:18,020
just that

1222
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:21,020
are the hard way I just said okay screw
it

1223
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:25,130
are if this if all all all have these
and DNS packets

1224
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:28,900
should just be get of discarded and
permits up everything else

1225
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:32,780
in the meantime they have something like
called Mtns

1226
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:36,180
snooping soul arm but

1227
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:39,580
on I didn't trust this feature so I just
configured are

1228
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:42,730
decide who think they see a and of
course why p4 as well

1229
01:17:42,730 --> 01:17:46,010
up just to make sure that all of this
and the NS

1230
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:49,590
of crap on it's not on transported over
by

1231
01:17:49,590 --> 01:17:54,450
WiFi network in any case

1232
01:17:54,450 --> 01:17:58,340
yeah a Antonio trafficking clients that
is six we have already seen

1233
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:05,160
arm before the at the beginning of the
presentation yeah

1234
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:08,810
and as a already set visit it's a

1235
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:12,190
over the up the death and that pawn not
robust idea

1236
01:18:12,190 --> 01:18:15,910
assault is that all thanks both got at

1237
01:18:15,910 --> 01:18:20,660
offer for setting this up on I have
nothing to do with it besides the out

1238
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:23,510
the snmpv3 above configuration on the
boxers

1239
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:27,660
salt all kudos to them yeah

1240
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:30,970
well just to summarize a given the IP it
to you

1241
01:18:30,970 --> 01:18:35,430
nature 526 link layer behaviour reducing
the amount of Chatham

1242
01:18:35,430 --> 01:18:39,380
a induced because of the multicast based
behavior

1243
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:42,970
must and should be taken care of just
two increased the

1244
01:18:42,970 --> 01:18:46,440
throughput of your WiFi network luck in
the year obvious

1245
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:49,680
wifi control us half some

1246
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:53,740
implicit mechanisms to reduce this month
ago space

1247
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:56,960
flooding I would call it to arm

1248
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:00,730
to all the extra points oil TX on sexual
wifi klein's

1249
01:19:00,730 --> 01:19:03,760
and Steve at least the WRC supports

1250
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:07,430
quite a lot of FHS up mechanisms some of
them

1251
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:10,580
which are enabled in the of default

1252
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:14,630
state yes and as up all your set

1253
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:17,690
you know the reference a studio of draft
versions from

1254
01:19:17,690 --> 01:19:21,920
ugly a tangle on everything up and like
the quality a

1255
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:26,820
where they had arm a look at the KY
network LAN will pick up this fall with

1256
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:28,300
officials at the data link layer

1257
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:32,470
especially the WiFi networks and
reducing all the costs and I view 6

1258
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:33,450
neighbor discovery

1259
01:19:33,450 --> 01:19:39,080
especially for all WiFi networks because
they're too small of a problem

1260
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:43,280
then in the wired that work yeah

1261
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:47,890
so that's from my site any questions

1262
01:19:47,890 --> 01:19:54,890
or anything you want to know about
network or anything

1263
01:19:56,519 --> 01:19:59,249
I mean I will be here all week as I said
yesterday so

1264
01:19:59,249 --> 01:20:06,249
we can talk whatever you like

1265
01:20:10,850 --> 01:20:16,270
and fragments so does the only for what
the first fragment of the

1266
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:19,560
up also followed a factor in what the
upper layer protocol information stored

1267
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:23,000
the second one okay well that's
unfortunate but

1268
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,969
obviously love it was kinda expected on

1269
01:20:26,969 --> 01:20:30,100
well

1270
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:34,650
so than thank you very much my attention
and enjoy lunch
