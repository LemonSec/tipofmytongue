1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,549
and a quite exciting keno it

2
00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:08,099
very discussing some approaches that

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,210
are maybe not really in the young beauty
NW style

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:14,870
and the but no detect pick me go on

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,730
and I may introduce

6
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,359
marcus luttrell his contents post and
the

7
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:26,640
conectar con penn State is quite common
for publishing company needs for

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,740
a tener testing the application testing
so

9
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:34,219
from what someone is getting the
community I am is well aware since post:

10
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:37,489
and market presents sense that both

11
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:41,420
called security covering the cloud and
we can't be be

12
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:46,050
and 2008 long so it's a double feature
talk

13
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,850
and bookmark it ain't me he would do
some kinda pipe minutes break in the

14
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,510
middle

15
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:55,460
so the you will have time and the to
have a cigarette or what elk

16
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,989
grab a copy yeah so a don't vary

17
00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:03,070
okay let the fun begin clobbering
account

18
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,880
thanks very much I'm so

19
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,390
welcome to the folk covering the clock
the stalkers

20
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:16,630
one in which always one that was
presented lost to at Black Hat

21
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:20,220
USA and in Vegas on and it was

22
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,259
to colleagues to myself who put together
the presentation

23
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:28,820
I'm and this year we were invited to
troopers and Andrew quite grateful for

24
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,009
the opportunity so

25
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:35,210
definitely thanks to and the floor and
all the rest of the guys who get this

26
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,049
opportunity

27
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:39,210
I'm this focuses a talk that covers

28
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,540
I think what to find quite a broad
spectrum

29
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,520
%uh issues that relate to cloud
computing and cloud computing

30
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,560
security on and it's it's quite a

31
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,040
of changing field in fact the definition
for what is cloud computing is with the

32
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,790
is is also something that changes

33
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:59,670
quite rapidly a so there's this from
four thinking here

34
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,790
we hope on this some things to look out
for

35
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,939
and this is quite a few videos a

36
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:09,649
because of the nature that is cloud
computing it's kinda hard to do

37
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:13,099
live demos so we've got a whole bunch of
videos that

38
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:17,620
opal the fight so her in and the crew my
colleagues my name is Michael

39
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,230
with intense burst a little bit

40
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,360
just a little bit about us a we got way
off from

41
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,489
South Africa throughout the saw and

42
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:30,519
Africa that's come easy place to find a

43
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:33,730
we're hosting the soccer world cup nine
in three months time the if

44
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:38,220
you'll probably see football a and
Europe you'll probably see

45
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,560
lot of mental South Africa that point
committee

46
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,900
Pretoria at any point in the coverage
that percent opposed is based

47
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,260
little city under a million people but
it's quite close to Johannesburg which

48
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:50,879
is that

49
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,910
industrial and economic up

50
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,830
Africa just from South Africa and it

51
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:01,680
within our company we're not that big
said 120 people

52
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,209
but we've been going up for almost ten
years and its

53
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:09,220
you know it's been quite a fun ride I'm
why should you listen to us

54
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,800
well you know you don't really have to
we've got a few things behind us

55
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,989
this some books we talk fairly regularly

56
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:20,220
on the release tools and you try to be
active on we are kinda involved

57
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,300
but just to give you an idea of a what
what I've come from

58
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,680
so I live in Cape Town actually

59
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,799
and when I left Cape Town on Monday
night

60
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,920
it was 40 degrees and to me when I
landed to

61
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,970
felt a little bit like this now I'm sure
your

62
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:42,129
your quite a you probably lost at this
and this is Nicole

63
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:45,560
wait till you see November or December
when it gets cooler

64
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,060
sub-zero but it really does feel Phil
Coke me

65
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,989
I'm but I must say that it's been quite
a quite an education

66
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:56,030
it's my first time really in japan is in

67
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:00,319
the trains run on time yet this is
something that that I'm

68
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,750
I am impressed by coming from South
Africa so

69
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,769
the one question or look at this
question out the way I'm

70
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:12,989
why we talking why I'm what why did we
got this

71
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:16,530
cloud computing a.m. topic

72
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:20,639
on at because at the topic that hold a
lot of light which I'm sure you'll agree

73
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,610
and so when it comes to cloud computing
a

74
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,110
we specifically what not necessarily
just got computed

75
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,560
but a tense but with we specifically
don't always go to hike the

76
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,880
talks so we on the road this summer the
slowest handling tools you'll find

77
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,320
um things which have very little bearing
on

78
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,530
what's actually what's actually hot

79
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:47,240
at a given point in time but we do think
that there's something important that's

80
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,880
happening

81
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,620
in the cloud space and and we think that
two-degree

82
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:56,080
some of these broader issues are being
missed and so

83
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,540
we think that that that there's a lot of
cool stuff for one

84
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,199
that can be had on the club space: but
we also think that the messages

85
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,759
that that need to be said I'm

86
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:10,970
and as we go through this you'll find
that wanna buy messages that is not the

87
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,210
time to split hairs

88
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,020
over individual technologies it's not
the time to split hairs over

89
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,660
the definitions of what fits within
Claude what doesn't victory cod

90
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,759
it's such a fast changing field with
such a POS tenzin

91
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,139
corner about industry a that actually we
need to be fairly open to things

92
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,419
I'm into to to be open to a.m.

93
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:35,949
some other services that are going to
come out a the cloud space

94
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:39,789
sup lot of people talking about God on
as you can see there's

95
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:43,820
there's a lot of loud and clout I'm

96
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:48,190
and a with within all the people that
are talking about it so this somewhat

97
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,580
incredibly positive about it and telling
us that is going to change the way that

98
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,660
we to business and contract and and
wanted to school things

99
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,389
but there's also a separate group of
people who are saying that there is

100
00:05:58,389 --> 00:05:59,050
nothing

101
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,250
new to its exactly the same as

102
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,940
multidex in the sixties I

103
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,190
so big on appeal to authority
personalized

104
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:12,940
reasonable RT and he's on record as
saying that there's absolutely nothing

105
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,160
new when it comes to

106
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,300
cloud computing everything that we we've
known before

107
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:24,229
um but this is because we're splitting
hairs that the definition of okay well

108
00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:27,620
when we specifically defined cloud
computing reciting that its

109
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,060
just a service that runs in front of the
computer its time sharing

110
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,600
it's nothing new it's not that that hat

111
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,190
let's look a little bit broader they may
be cool things that let's not fix

112
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,979
ourselves and that definition

113
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:43,560
so quickly so possibly we need to talk a
little bit about

114
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,900
what I consider all we consider to be
Plowden

115
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,830
and the things that we consider to be
within scope

116
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,870
and this diagram

117
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:58,050
so the sets alt one definition all

118
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,550
cloud computing and its from missed in
the USA and pretty much

119
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,830
they divided up into these three
sections they said its characteristics

120
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,639
of models and

121
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,860
and deployment models and if you talk a
little bit about

122
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,490
the characteristics that we expect that
every cloud service so that

123
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,560
that missed with expect to see up to the
big one the

124
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,740
is going to be resource Boolean

125
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,680
so its intuitively what we think is
cloud computing

126
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,250
you share machines shit time with
someone else

127
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,449
at so in that instant it's kind of like
multidex right

128
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,020
the UNIX what operating system that come

129
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,349
since then in which you can the
multitasking operating system you can

130
00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:36,690
run

131
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:40,030
processes and other people through
processes cents on

132
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,870
but this resource sharing and this
happened in already brought girls does

133
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,639
not just

134
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:47,990
one process so that you share in maybe
you sherry arm

135
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,430
network attached storage with your
storage area network with

136
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,840
a hundred the other users and so you're
you are sharing

137
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,000
many many resources and there's a lot of
resources to go abroad

138
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,330
but this other aspects that make a
difference from Simple Plan shared

139
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,080
systems

140
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,449
so for example you've got on-demand salt
that

141
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:09,580
so if you want a particular

142
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,620
cloud service you got a website maybe
fill in a form you hit submit

143
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,270
now you've got it there's no for this
very little human interaction

144
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:22,210
you don't have to wait for someone else
to its approval someone else to sign off

145
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,430
or you don't have to wait for the
support team

146
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,810
to come back to you and say that they've
managed to do this

147
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:31,340
its undermined when you wanted you can
have it

148
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,519
its mostly accessed over networks

149
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:38,370
so the clout when you when you see it in
the party

150
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,459
met by greta is that and his little
cloud mister link

151
00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:46,850
connected got but that's one of the
features on the clock is

152
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,850
actually you don't know where it's at
this fairly location independent

153
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,120
a.m. for the most

154
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,630
but is either the third- also quite
elastic and we're gonna talk about

155
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:03,190
back one for a little bit as well but

156
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,350
what are the features again if a cloud
services that its all-you-can-eat

157
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:11,230
so when you want more there is more when
you don't need as much

158
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,589
you can scale back against New York your
room

159
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:18,980
your use of the Service can vary you not
fixed into these

160
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,890
you know by five racks of servers
another also bet I can along even though

161
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,450
you don't

162
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,750
it work them to do on the weekend

163
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,970
and then lost it it's a mess it's a so
you pay

164
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,279
as you use it you paper our all

165
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,010
CPU time for example you may pay for
take about 20

166
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,209
other with more Gigabit transfer to keep
it sport

167
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:43,490
a month but does the characteristics
that we expect to see of

168
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,149
a cloud service but be the delivered

169
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:50,700
in a number of ways and is basically the
three major world

170
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,029
soft as a Service Platform as a Service
and

171
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:57,670
Infrastructure as a Service and those
are probably terms that you

172
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:02,630
heredity softer the services is quite a
common time at this point

173
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:07,459
and up I don't again I don't to be split
has hit

174
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:10,480
but to give you a broad idea of a
difference between those three

175
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,839
I'm you can consider

176
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,160
three models there's the Gmail model
that happens and model

177
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,160
and Amazon's ec2 model

178
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,380
in Gmail you don't get to choose which
web application

179
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:29,010
Europe you use Google's web application
at the two peoples Wepner

180
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,250
its gmail all you can do is change
configuration parables

181
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:37,000
at that's the sum total of your
administration of that

182
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,110
and that's an example Software as a
Service someone else got software using

183
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,980
best of it but they host that they're
responsible upgrades are responsible

184
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,079
make concha that service stays available

185
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,070
and all that good stuff and you just
make use of it as service

186
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:55,589
platform as a service to the is a little
bit different I'm within a platform as a

187
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:56,420
Service

188
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,620
what you find is that the provider gives
you

189
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:04,120
and Runtime Environment in with you can
write your own applications

190
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,380
and people happens in this one example
they are others

191
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,630
but essentially they give you a little
sandbox and within the sandbox you can

192
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,839
run a Java you can run in Python
whatever you want

193
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,579
so you get the code your own web
application

194
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:20,730
I'm and in support of that they'll
provide you with

195
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,839
databases network connectivity

196
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,570
messaging services love the stuff but
ultimately responsible for the

197
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,829
application

198
00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:33,480
everything be late application mobile
store maintains responsibility for

199
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,180
so to make sure that a.m.

200
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,279
operating systems updated to make sure
that the runtime environment is kept

201
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:45,410
and so on is people's people's

202
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:49,470
top and then the lost service

203
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,920
model that we have the is Infrastructure
as a Service & Infrastructure as a

204
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,440
Service

205
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,540
just goes one more doubled up and it
says that

206
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,760
a you get axis to some kind of

207
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,750
infrastructure and everything on top
that is your responsibility so

208
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:09,260
Amazon ec2 does this where they give you
the ability to run a virtual machine

209
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,440
so they uses then based at

210
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,950
that will but everything from operating
system up with his

211
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:19,329
your responsibility you get to put
whatever you want insider this

212
00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:22,550
but machine so those are the three men
services of course

213
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:26,380
a platform as a service is not
necessarily just about virtual machines

214
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,709
that could also be about

215
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:30,820
I'm storage on the network would could
be about

216
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,889
virtual private clouds or you know
there's there's many different

217
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:37,700
ways in which you could higher
infrastructure

218
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:42,260
but the common one is he said and then
the deployment model is

219
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:46,160
how these collection services that you
purchased

220
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,769
are delivered to or how they presented
to the client so

221
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:56,510
%uh starting at the top with got a
private cloud and the private cloud is

222
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:00,180
one in which is only a single user a
single organization to make season

223
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,300
so no one large company could

224
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,760
virtualized most their services and a

225
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,980
to collect this together in 10 that they
descended Niagara with an organization

226
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,000
who wants to

227
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,930
computing resources uses their local a
private club

228
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,089
that doesn't necessarily have to be
local I was in talks about virtual

229
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:22,100
private cloud to actually

230
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,560
your you get a private cloud it runs at
Amazon speak and like the phone

231
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,769
thought that the relief of changing well
with this many options that are very

232
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:33,370
available community cloud is something
you don't is often

233
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:37,410
a community Claude supposedly refers to
I that's shared by

234
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:41,139
like-minded a close group of

235
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:44,269
organizations up but the mall common one
is

236
00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:48,040
publicly to the public about is where we
have

237
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,649
services that offer to members of the
public and all about the

238
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:54,730
services that will look at today are in
the public

239
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:59,089
so we're not gonna all our public lands
so we're not going to be

240
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:04,070
lookin at any of the others

241
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:07,899
up Christopher of is a guy who's at so
it's going he

242
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:11,910
is that are responsible for their
fertilization strategy in israeli

243
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,910
a vocal certainly player in

244
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:18,839
club and in and virtualization and you
kinda put together this

245
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,820
technology an ontology showing so the
different

246
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:27,060
ways that so there's different service
models and components within them

247
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:32,240
and he's got the services that one would
expect to find it be to these layers

248
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,329
and he's done a little bit of a map into

249
00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:38,440
a.m. commercial offerings you to those

250
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,680
and and it's starting to get you know
it's really starting to be fleshed out

251
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,360
I'm open crowd that this diagram in
which they

252
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,570
tried to put together a taxonomy of
olive the

253
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,690
companies who are responsible companies
are offering

254
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:56,779
part services and they use the a very
similar taxonomy you'll notice that both

255
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:58,490
about infrastructure platform

256
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,600
and software services and and within
them all all the corporate

257
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,760
with the the commercial offerings up but
the one that they do at the

258
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,610
is makers of software that run in the
club

259
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:13,190
to the makers of a stop to that support
the clock and then you'd expect to see

260
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,579
players like VMware

261
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:19,220
and so on and then so

262
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,839
what you can see is that is as many
different that many

263
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:26,600
different definitions in many ways a
looking at

264
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,980
plot the one thing I should've mentioned
on the most slide

265
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,009
is that was version 15 up there

266
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:36,339
definition all what part is

267
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:42,110
um and it was updated December 2009 and
I think this thought it early 2009

268
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,800
with that definition so than the other
but 15

269
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,430
updates to definition so this is clearly
something that's movin

270
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:52,480
and risking trying to get a feel for
what

271
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,839
it all is but we see this a little bit
simpler

272
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,860
hence they rarely basic been photograph

273
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,440
a and as security guys to see it as well
what is the stuff that an offer

274
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,449
and how can we break so me get to break
it up

275
00:16:07,449 --> 00:16:11,500
and those those technologies and
policies and sauna useful

276
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,300
in trying to picked august's apart from
that

277
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:20,420
we just want to look issues

278
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,360
so why do we want to look at issues well
41

279
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,130
a it's going to be where the action is
so companies are moving

280
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:32,949
many services into the cloud I am and
our customers are moving services into

281
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:33,759
the club

282
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,980
they come to us the ASCUS denies the
secure should we be doing this

283
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,120
and so we need to go to inevitably

284
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,040
will your customers go if you want to
stay and business if you want to help

285
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,649
them

286
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:48,660
you want to add value you'll need to go

287
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:53,250
where they go and so this is where a lot
of the action is going to be

288
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:57,139
in the in the near future I'm

289
00:16:57,139 --> 00:17:01,730
its it's interesting will see the a
little bit later with mobile army

290
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:06,059
that when it comes to cloud services
they slowly expat

291
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:10,309
and so this to the slowly slowly sup the
the various services that one would

292
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:11,610
normally expect to see either

293
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:14,699
internally or new services that get
added a

294
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:17,939
and so from a cool

295
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:22,660
I'm not really a risk guy but from the
risk this perspective

296
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:27,079
a you've got a slow to change in risk a
tight-knit

297
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:31,000
and it ought to you need to stop and
measure every non that to second well

298
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,350
what's changed between

299
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:36,179
the lost time we looked at this
particular service what have the added

300
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:38,370
what are the new features

301
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:42,100
because its rapidly changing new
features are coming out

302
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,299
as we'll see more about me a

303
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:49,950
and one other they really interesting
what

304
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:54,000
one of the the fee to the cloud is that
most accessed through a web browser and

305
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,720
i wanna talk about that

306
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,840
quite extensively but essentially we
haven't really got web applications

307
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,730
right now where

308
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,890
putting all our trust in its cloud
services that all

309
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,830
access 3 interfaces that we haven't yet

310
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:13,270
affected this seems to be scope for

311
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:17,580
things getting screwed

312
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,010
and redacted don't have to be making
these mistakes I P

313
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,440
we don't think probably so

314
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,730
if you look at the things that that
drive plot plot adoption

315
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:31,410
for the one you've got the so-called
inflight magazine

316
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:35,530
magazine affect the your

317
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:39,900
bosses bosses boss goes line somewhere
probably

318
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,780
travels and business glossary data and
but it's getting saucy opens up the

319
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,520
magazine that in front of him

320
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,740
and within the magazine has a glossy one
page

321
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,970
on how cloud computing say some company

322
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:55,380
fifty percent to the operational cost
got his

323
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,130
well that's what you gotta do because I
hear this is the way to go

324
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:03,590
and its great and

325
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:07,419
that's fine I'm we don't you know

326
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:10,730
a lot of decisions get made like that
but let's not fool ourselves there's

327
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:11,429
also the key

328
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:14,650
version of that so each got thirty call

329
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,860
I saw Amazon allow me to run

330
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:22,260
any beyond that i won through a web
interface that pretty freaking cool

331
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,910
a let's play with the cod that got on
the bus

332
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:30,309
on both sides got management saying wall
week it is a lot about slits

333
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:33,740
spot to look and see if we can get cost
savings and on the geek side what about

334
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,590
the tech guy say

335
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:39,750
well this is actually just fun kept its
of

336
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,740
and and what we've gone through the play
or throughout later this week actually

337
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,520
a lot of the services are very nice
people

338
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,510
is simple thinking and up -30 and
security point to become a

339
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:56,419
functionality and features wanna be up
there's another

340
00:19:56,419 --> 00:19:59,539
there's another a viewpoint that's also

341
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:03,409
kinda growing on the in terms of

342
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:06,890
white cloud is becoming adopted and
thats

343
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:10,880
historically in organizations people
generally get

344
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,620
generally that they get poor service
from internal it.

345
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,630
guys the mail servers down again to the
VPS

346
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:22,450
pippen's not worki and you have to hear
a story about quiet this upgrade

347
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,440
couldn't happen

348
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,480
or why you got taken out but this were
mall

349
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,830
anti whatever in a if your user of a
service inside an organization it back

350
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,980
to be quite frustrating

351
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,400
thing and so when you get a promise

352
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,760
all cloud computing that's gonna you
know magic you take one of these

353
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,150
things then its

354
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:46,470
that make sense that there's there's
interest

355
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,280
Marcus Ranum you sum up you may be
familiar with

356
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,350
work that tenable who make messes

357
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,710
a this is his comment on it he said the
cloud computing can be seen as

358
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:00,020
the business unit final revenge tonight
in security

359
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,150
with a No one too many times for taking
too long costing

360
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:07,090
to so that there is this a driver

361
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:10,490
applaud computing that's not

362
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:14,500
that's not necessarily d and the pushed
on

363
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,640
decision of course ball

364
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,480
economies kinda picking up at this point
yes very slowly

365
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,400
but the economy is done which means
people looking to say cost

366
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,929
and so a pay as you go model becomes
quite attractive you don't have to spend

367
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:31,929
lots of money and big rack successes

368
00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:35,450
of service you can just rent time as
needed

369
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:40,020
catholics becomes topics

370
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,960
this is of course the capital of texting
really

371
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,289
private clouds out at that debate so
we're not talking private parts

372
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:51,120
today and I mention that it's cool it is
really cool

373
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,470
a but like crack want to taste it

374
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:58,380
spoke whatever you don't really

375
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,179
everything off kinda health and
insignificant but what we have fallen

376
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:03,390
through

377
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:07,200
the when we're preparing this talk is
that their number

378
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,250
problems that come outta testy and the
club

379
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,570
so one of your customers goes out and
gets a

380
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:17,770
you know they start um with a cloud
service whatever that may be

381
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,880
and then they come to you and said okay
we're not deployed this thing I

382
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,360
applications run in bed

383
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,890
we want to test it or they say we wanted
to evaluate this provide a

384
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:33,080
in preparation for us but seems services
from them

385
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,700
and what we came across was that
actually this is

386
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,990
blueberry fuzzy area for protesting
things in the club

387
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:44,260
I'm and is this big ones so this thing's

388
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,960
a like Commission if someone

389
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,309
if a company hosts there email

390
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:55,730
with people Google handles all their
email

391
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:59,120
can you just start 15 shemale like

392
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,659
where is that ways that line

393
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:06,500
is the line clearly I mean if you if you
followed trying to hack Google

394
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,250
eventually you I'm gonna come at you

395
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:13,659
but there's there's a fuzzy line and if
you approach Google and say we want to

396
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:15,630
test your systems

397
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:19,890
they're gonna turn you away I'm so it
they are they will they are

398
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:22,710
there are many problems for example what
happens if you do get permission and

399
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,570
your testing on a cloud service

400
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,740
and you come across someone else's data
all

401
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,240
you know depending on the country you're
in that may have

402
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:36,500
and its implications and so on

403
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,539
this other two this other issues that
are not related to the legalities to for

404
00:23:40,539 --> 00:23:41,990
example

405
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:45,049
your customer says test the service you
test the service to get all the

406
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:45,820
Commission saw

407
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:49,140
it's a cloud service right there's no
version changes

408
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,570
or there's no person numbers that are
exposed to us what version is

409
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:56,470
people with Gmail running at today

410
00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:00,279
it's not be to like that's about the
most you can say

411
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:04,309
so let's assume that you do you manage
to test gmail today

412
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:07,760
what about tomorrow what about the next
day its it's hard for a company to

413
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,179
who who of pics on into to change
control process and all that

414
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:17,360
when back they don't know what has been
changed at that provide a

415
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,909
there are a couple of other issues of
course transparency is one

416
00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:26,510
so you may remember loss to um

417
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:31,250
Amazon had an issue with a soul a copy
of

418
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,669
George Orwell's 1984

419
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:38,049
and it turned out on the Kindle device
little reader device

420
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:41,429
and it turned out that actually they
didn't have mission to

421
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:45,570
felt that particular both in so they
went or remotely they wiped

422
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:48,970
that the by what they want they wiped
that book from people's candles

423
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:52,679
it this crazy transparency

424
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:57,630
and privacy implications that of course
the fact that it was 19-8 the book 1984

425
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:00,799
you know you know I read it it's just
kinda piled on top of

426
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,419
sadness in that particular case

427
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:07,620
am but it Helton a who

428
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:12,460
is from Princeton I believe a.m. kinda
commented on this and one of the things

429
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,250
that he pointed out was he said

430
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:17,990
when someone else is responsible for
your computing

431
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:21,250
in in a broad answer you know cloud
computing a

432
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,559
transparencies key you have to be able
to know

433
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,110
what it is that they doing and what it
is that they're doing to your

434
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:32,620
data I mean when Amazon Paul tricks like
this clearly they're not they're not

435
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,419
really being

436
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:37,000
that comes back so if we take that that
content is important

437
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,610
been its its kinda interesting because
agreed-upon awesome

438
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:44,590
is responsible for Google at engine a
pattern and

439
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:48,090
what about stuff and then he did an
interview with the card security guys

440
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,750
and I don't know if you can read this

441
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,880
but essentially what is this yeah I
asking what role

442
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,360
do you think people can play in building
trust with its clients and his responses

443
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,860
quite a nice one it says a actions in
terms have been open to users will be

444
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,870
the most important factor in
establishing trust

445
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:10,460
open to all users okay so he recognizes
transparency

446
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,490
is important card security carry a

447
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:19,000
what security principles to follow Lapid
what a cunt any specifics on what we're

448
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,320
doing happens in

449
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,049
aka that's his response that

450
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:27,289
another question please provide some
examples how both principal

451
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:30,460
played out in terms of the current
implementation I'm sorry

452
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:34,740
we don't Tybalt that information

453
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,000
next one how do you contain an attacker
could exploit

454
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,039
but lovable you're correct is the altar

455
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:46,760
that strong measures are in place but I
am not at liberty to discuss the details

456
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:51,480
okay on the one hand hussein we need to
be open with a uses

457
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,419
but when he gets of specific questions
about well what do you do it

458
00:26:55,419 --> 00:26:59,090
is is kinda coming up with a black
Street

459
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:03,429
wall and Pete herzog in his pork this
morning

460
00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:06,600
spoke to us about how you need to know
exactly what is

461
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,620
going on you need to be able to look
into the system

462
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:13,620
to see what they're doing and when the
response is what I'm sorry

463
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,880
week on tell you will show you that you
look

464
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,510
then it's not something that engenders a
lot of trust

465
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:24,690
so transparent either is a hard well
it's not necessary ha problem

466
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:29,230
but it's not a problem that that many of
the cloud providers have yet

467
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:33,360
recognize there's another big one of
course

468
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,500
the elephant in the room at this point
is compliance so

469
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,240
compliance is kinda but dirty word

470
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,460
at that people hate but it small and
necessity

471
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:49,970
I'm and so a what about our state
security started this is basically same

472
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,240
here that

473
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,890
a if you've got they said that doesn't
have any compliance

474
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:59,919
regimes attached to it and put it in the
club if you want

475
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,299
but it's too early to say whether or not
you can quit

476
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:06,740
data that needs compliance in terms of
peace and i wanna be other

477
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,970
regimes it's too early to say if that
will go to clot

478
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:13,169
and part of that is because there's no
direction from

479
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:16,529
the compliance councils so

480
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,690
it is basically left up to order to

481
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:23,610
to figure out whether or not your
controls Mac

482
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:27,210
or a with your controls a sufficient

483
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:30,809
not PCI for example is they're they're
trying to address this

484
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:34,970
later this year they've got version 1.3
of the DSS

485
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:37,970
a.m. and they going to cover

486
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:41,360
virtualization they expect
capitalization in the

487
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,230
but you don't get no what the final
decision on that

488
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:48,760
is going to be so bottom line is
compliance in the cloud

489
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,860
is really really message

490
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:55,110
not we can come across or we can also
talk

491
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:58,429
the privacy and legal issues but that
one

492
00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:02,630
season the club a mostly the supplies

493
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:06,000
with more flexible trip to the US but
essentially

494
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,710
in the US the for amendment to the
Constitution provides protection against

495
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,809
unreasonable search and seizure

496
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:15,440
in other words you need a warrant
commuted touched warrant problem

497
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,360
and I would naturally assume a similar
provision

498
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,360
in your but in terms of

499
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,429
a cloud computing within cloud

500
00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:29,659
because love the stuff is remote doesn't
that on site

501
00:29:29,659 --> 00:29:33,200
so its owner providers

502
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,230
in a bit racks of servers I'm your day
sir

503
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:41,799
is not so your data can be seized
without a warrant

504
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:45,450
for that that that named you

505
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:49,840
in order for that particular data
centers sufficient Amanda means that

506
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,779
your machines can be seized without a
warrant without to be notified

507
00:29:53,779 --> 00:29:57,390
and this happened last year where a

508
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:01,149
data center in the US was graded

509
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:05,510
and I think FBI at confiscated
everything

510
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:08,510
they literally took down data center got

511
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:12,029
on because they were there was a an
investigation that in poll

512
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:15,580
certain machines in the data center but
instead of

513
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,120
figuring out which machines that Pope
lights and everything and

514
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,340
all the equipment went up to so that
there's definite

515
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:28,529
is definite concerns if you're a company
whose real I

516
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:32,990
on about services not only we get all
will look at if you're worried about

517
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,330
privacy or legal issues

518
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:40,260
the solution is stricter those the magic
pixie dust that when you speak llama

519
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,919
things sudden it becomes secure

520
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,340
its appeal to authority again but in
this spot

521
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:50,990
have as opposed to the biggest I think
night does have a point

522
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:54,730
that's worth repeating so he was the guy
who said that

523
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:57,610
if you think trip that will solve the
problem you don't understand the problem

524
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:58,760
you don't understand

525
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,880
it a and and part of that is because

526
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,110
you can throw and all the crypto you
want if that could pose running

527
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:11,929
in the cloud then actually you still
don't have a trusted base from which you

528
00:31:11,929 --> 00:31:12,690
can

529
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:16,409
rely on the curb the storm crypt is
lonely heart

530
00:31:16,409 --> 00:31:20,000
with almost always hot and so that
magically

531
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,760
trainer on a yes 256

532
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,519
not really something that engenders a
lot of trust

533
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,659
without a lot people a been looking at
the big one

534
00:31:31,659 --> 00:31:35,299
when it comes to the club so

535
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:38,500
you know it it is relatively soft
explanatory

536
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:42,710
but if you're developing the this is
quite an important one specific people

537
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:46,720
Platform as a Service models so we are
writing applications that run on

538
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,860
someone's

539
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:51,350
and right or run into someone else's
Runtime Environment

540
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:55,500
that Runtime Environment often has
quirks it'll have specific API's

541
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,820
all have things that are custom pool
that

542
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,880
API hope for that environment

543
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,269
and it makes it quite hard to poor that

544
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:09,669
or try not to put it makes quite hot
just shift that application

545
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:13,500
if you're unhappy with that with that
particular provide a and

546
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:18,929
for example with an app engine that is
less so useful right and platen but you

547
00:32:18,929 --> 00:32:19,860
can use people's

548
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:23,740
libraries and they've made some effort

549
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:27,220
to allow you too to write it in one of
the common

550
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:31,100
web application frameworks your
application abandoned it'll run

551
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:35,860
keenly on ap inter but if you look at a
company like Salesforce

552
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:39,779
dot com which will look at a little bit
later sales force that calm has got a

553
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:41,510
completely custom language

554
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:46,049
but you're right you applications and so
once a written application

555
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:49,390
in apex which is the language you're not
fifteen that thing

556
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:52,950
or felt both the cock to lock in is is
an issue that

557
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:57,210
that definitely needs to be considered
there's also a question that data and

558
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:57,649
good

559
00:32:57,649 --> 00:33:01,320
data in so

560
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:06,880
I'm and so when it comes again to
running things in the club

561
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,450
what are the promises that were told
cloud computing is the guys who run

562
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:13,710
or one of the big benefit is that a

563
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:17,519
these guys do this job they did really
well so they manage

564
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,230
you know servers that are supposed to
stay up that's their job that's what

565
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,620
they can do

566
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,970
and so the the premises that

567
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:30,250
your you've got to IT admins and
accompanied yet

568
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:33,720
take on another job we've got a team of
50 guys monitor

569
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,880
all of service and so will do as much
better than you and of course

570
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,750
talk to law that they there are quite
good at what they do

571
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:44,399
but this doesn't mean that they're
fallible in Tulsa

572
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,710
so these are just a bunch of screenshots

573
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:50,750
I'm that we came across why we were
testing

574
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:54,409
but clubhouses the stores provide a a.m.

575
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:57,880
and so the point you know they go dog
pretty much all your

576
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,549
your date you your day to school that in
read-only mode

577
00:34:01,549 --> 00:34:04,640
but if you're a line on this thing to do
business wall

578
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,750
you know it's the system is offline that

579
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:11,060
which is if you come to South African
three months

580
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:15,710
probably something you're quite often
that you get the system is applied in

581
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,210
many

582
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:19,520
different places post offices

583
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:26,240
shops commenting

584
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,190
hopefully not the soccer tournament like
hopefully we've got generators for the

585
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,899
possible okay

586
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:35,700
this should be liked but yet notebook
three for the sucka

587
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:39,020
will be right a circus think is another

588
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:42,510
it's another sports brought in their
quota lots towards providing this

589
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:45,359
another don't let them be not so
basically here they gain

590
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:49,530
through routine maintenance and updating
that fight and I'll be back

591
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:52,669
online the three-hour when the downtime

592
00:34:52,669 --> 00:34:55,740
one of the interesting things that you
don't get to control that

593
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,740
so if that happens to fall at

594
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:02,410
where the on the world midday to 3 p.m.

595
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:05,810
that that's not really something that
you can control

596
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:09,790
so this is one another one of the
concerns that you need to be where

597
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:13,680
and then lost in July cool at engine

598
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,750
somebody email recall with

599
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,970
out also the six hours so they had a
kinda

600
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:23,440
underlying issue in the Google
filesystem

601
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,640
and this thing cascaded through to the
data center in which

602
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,349
at engine at threat what was interesting
was that

603
00:35:30,349 --> 00:35:33,609
App Engine run what that pointer and
soul in a single

604
00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:37,550
data center cool and pretty much this is
a series of males

605
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:41,640
talking about to give the update is this
thing went on

606
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,940
but basically for six hours App Engine
was

607
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:49,290
shaky and eventually was completely
offline

608
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:53,670
and that's cool so their responses
outstanding I mean they've got

609
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:57,070
within seminar in the HOF of the fault

610
00:35:57,070 --> 00:36:00,520
they've got the Google filesystem
engineering team

611
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,900
debugging this thing rapidly so clearly

612
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,300
you know the they recognize the urgency
in getting this

613
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,240
sorted but they often you know that

614
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:16,190
the scope or the possibility for
downtime doesn't disappear with club

615
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:20,770
not at all this is another example of
availability but not in terms of system

616
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:21,520
kind on

617
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:26,070
but about what happens if your provider
gets old

618
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:29,619
it's still early days caught this lot of
small companies have played

619
00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:32,990
space and so here's an example with a
who

620
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:36,150
a they've been a quite and the message
says

621
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:40,099
and then pretty much what's interesting
is that it will once the transition is

622
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:41,660
complete we'll get to bed about

623
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,740
I who's getting my bases should be a big
question

624
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:48,230
a cruise port you do my to the contract
that I

625
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:51,450
under the terms and conditions that
under to carry over to the new company

626
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,500
you know all these things

627
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,160
are questions that need to be off

628
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,099
here's another example to Tech Crunch
did an awesome

629
00:37:00,099 --> 00:37:03,210
a loss to they talk about a company
called on the drive

630
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:06,859
i mean they give on the drive a bit of
space but if you go to on the drive

631
00:37:06,859 --> 00:37:10,820
site what you'll see is that on the
drive no longer exists

632
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:14,119
another recommending you another place
cool

633
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:19,790
momentous so it's a rapidly changing
field

634
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:22,810
a cost carrying this even further
because

635
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:26,240
availability is as one of the strong
selling point

636
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,280
in terms of part so if you put aside

637
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,220
the system's going don t put aside the
system could get it sold if you look at

638
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,800
malicious activity

639
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,430
what does this mean for things like a
cop lockup if your lines from that

640
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,170
service

641
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:44,160
to do business and this some kinda
authentication that you need to do

642
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,940
and someone else is able to lock you out
well what happens not to

643
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,270
mobility to do business

644
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:55,609
so account lockouts with school when we

645
00:37:55,609 --> 00:37:59,420
and and this is 10 with this is the
point that will raised with

646
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:03,010
the web application side of things but
when you're

647
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:06,950
your management interface or if the
access to the system is through web

648
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:10,560
application that historically we're
kinda funny right now brains around

649
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,220
said what it means to have a secure web
application at this point and now you're

650
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:17,579
changing behind went up to getting all
your infrastructure

651
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:21,270
are all the controls that were used to
in a web application using a map of it

652
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,310
and maybe a capture

653
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:27,750
are they suitable to protect all of your
in perspective

654
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:30,950
so to keep going coming comedian max

655
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:35,400
Bay read the script said you gotta feel
sorry for the guy run script basically

656
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,060
though it they were trying to

657
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:41,089
purge inactive accounts there was a
mistake and the script unopposed

658
00:38:41,089 --> 00:38:44,329
active account and the data a.m.

659
00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:47,589
and it took them out they never
recovered from that so that customers

660
00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:49,920
all left them in the company closed up

661
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,400
so kinda fat finger on a script was
responsible for

662
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,530
company going out of business Nokia's
Ovi Store

663
00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:00,550
lost three weeks with data sales force
to come

664
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:03,710
January lost ship with having issues
with

665
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:07,130
core network equipment and so on

666
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:11,329
a you may remember recently in October
2009

667
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:15,109
the three-month I consider I'm

668
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:18,800
Microsoft so Microsoft runs the Sidekick

669
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,680
as a psychic products is a little mobile
phone type

670
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:27,210
device with clock back in contacts and
pictures

671
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:31,589
well except a and there within issue
with the storage

672
00:39:31,589 --> 00:39:36,619
a sidekick to the point that they lost
all the customers they said

673
00:39:36,619 --> 00:39:39,720
got and at the time they were talking
that

674
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,750
the data with irretrievably lost it took
them a month and a half to recover the

675
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,640
dates they got the data back

676
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,829
but in that time there were no longer
with a suspended sales of

677
00:39:48,829 --> 00:39:52,560
the device and a little otter pup cities

678
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:57,200
so when you put on your eggs in one
basket the basket drops

679
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,480
all your eggs break a

680
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,579
you may recognize this guy that appeal
to him again so

681
00:40:03,579 --> 00:40:07,290
thats then get and he had a thesis I'm

682
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:11,040
or more than a decade ago about motor
cultures

683
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,530
in computing to say that when you have

684
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:17,650
many systems that are identical and

685
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:21,359
in his case he was talking about when
does up

686
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,520
as soon as a vulnerability appears in
one other systems they're all wonderful

687
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:29,140
and so it makes it the week that this
shit

688
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:33,609
so this the whole system is quite weak
as opposed and so he comes from a

689
00:40:33,609 --> 00:40:34,780
biological sciences

690
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:39,380
background and i think is is thinking is
strongly

691
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:43,470
based on that but you don't have a
heterogeneous system which is able to

692
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,869
resist

693
00:40:44,869 --> 00:40:48,010
multiple attacked the soon as one system
is vulnerable

694
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:52,240
in a homogeneous system then everything
is wonderful

695
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,640
and it's a general I mean it's that the
principle that

696
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,920
that many people to accept

697
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,390
his was cool when does the but actually
does this carry over into cloud

698
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:07,829
well let's look at a company Colts Mike
Mike and SmugMug

699
00:41:07,829 --> 00:41:10,880
does up violent video sharing

700
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,569
sometimes that their lease losses that
they were processing more than 50 tera

701
00:41:14,569 --> 00:41:15,319
pixels

702
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:18,690
day which is a lot of pixels

703
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:23,010
up and they were they would definitely a
poster child for

704
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:26,560
ec2 which is a Muslim all monograms

705
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,060
services and it

706
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:33,109
music and so they may do so by PC to and

707
00:41:33,109 --> 00:41:36,859
s3 which is the storage service and they
did put things like

708
00:41:36,859 --> 00:41:40,780
on one click of a button they launch
almost 2,000 instances

709
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:44,030
all there virtual machine that they

710
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:48,880
that paralyzed of a but it doesn't get
more homogeneous

711
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,940
than 2,000 instances the exact same
machine

712
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:55,910
I we're not even talking about minor
differences it's the exact same machine

713
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:59,520
so that that monoculture argument

714
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,270
a starts to move into into the cloud

715
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:07,140
which is just an interesting observation
for the most part up

716
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:10,369
when it comes to the carter also
extending the attack surface

717
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:13,740
so where normally

718
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:18,630
if we we agree the permit is dead but
they'll point that we tried to protect

719
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:21,670
I'm and when it comes to the cloud will
now you've got

720
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:24,990
more points your extended the attack
surface

721
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:28,619
and it becomes interesting because
something like

722
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:31,829
your clog provide a getting fish

723
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:35,640
means that you would have been issues so
you've seen

724
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:40,130
or you probably recall to a large degree
the two attacks at the posterior

725
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:44,230
officer opt with the constant to get
security right and every time

726
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:49,200
that someone manages to get an admin
password will someone manages

727
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,760
to take a ver and admins all email
account hotmail

728
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,849
and then and login to Twitter on admin
panel

729
00:42:56,849 --> 00:43:00,930
than you know all these celebrities and
other well-known people get their

730
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:05,810
dictator or Costco their account
hijacked whatever

731
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:09,170
I'm and you also saw this work sales
force to get incidently

732
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:12,750
November 2007 Salesforce had one up
there

733
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:17,119
employees Spearfish so what are the
employees were sent to specific email

734
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,940
blah blah blah his credentials started

735
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:24,060
and so attackers were able to log into

736
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:27,690
healthful stockpile get list of

737
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:30,700
customers and start infected it

738
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:34,010
in effect the attackers claim they were

739
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:37,099
kinda spam to customers and saw I'm

740
00:43:37,099 --> 00:43:40,869
but if your data is that in the cloud
and and the cloud

741
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:44,960
provider is not taken adequate
precautions on security the data

742
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,609
three basic things like this it so it
works against home uses for the bank

743
00:43:48,609 --> 00:43:49,240
accounts

744
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:52,520
you don't really expect it to work
against employees a lot

745
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:59,520
operator but experience shows that it
has

746
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:03,910
it goes a little bit further then just

747
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:07,960
even your data in the cloud so it used
to be that fishing was

748
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:12,310
may be lost individual account but not
means that if

749
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:15,569
summits best it could be you
infrastructure that's gone so

750
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:19,270
it's just something to consider when you
signed up for Amazon ec2

751
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:22,810
if you already have an Amazon account I
E to buy books

752
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:26,690
then used you can use the same account
so

753
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:29,690
one option and I guess we can

754
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:34,560
we can talk scenarios but once in our
that that is possible is

755
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,579
the cs4 or whoever you signed up for the
service

756
00:44:37,579 --> 00:44:41,640
uses his own personal account to do this
because

757
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:45,089
his second title I to say no and you
want this project to get on the

758
00:44:45,089 --> 00:44:49,000
get a got and so he just uses the same
account that he uses

759
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,640
to buy books to buy his company's

760
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,190
resource computing resources a and
Sony's head

761
00:44:56,190 --> 00:45:00,069
is is still thinking about this account
as this is the account that I used but

762
00:45:00,069 --> 00:45:00,780
books

763
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:04,030
meanwhile actually this is of the
company can used to manage all this in

764
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:04,829
perspective

765
00:45:04,829 --> 00:45:08,329
so evident provide with the single entry
point when you can

766
00:45:08,329 --> 00:45:11,500
the bite books or you can buy

767
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,910
hundreds of computing hours its

768
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:18,810
it's a great store I so the features of
them

769
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:25,810
but from a security perspective is to
questions

770
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:30,359
the conversation that hiring had with
I'm a guy

771
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:33,530
online and so pretty much what it is one
of his friends online

772
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:37,170
and and pretty much the guy was talking
about cost is

773
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:40,720
cloudburst to which was a guest

774
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,040
to host escape so impressed in VMware

775
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:47,180
if one was in within a virtual machine
one could break up

776
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:51,829
into the host which is an
extraordinarily scary attack in and so

777
00:45:51,829 --> 00:45:53,220
he expresses

778
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:56,990
a this thus far as they look this is
scary stuff

779
00:45:56,990 --> 00:46:00,630
but Iran's point is that

780
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:04,640
it at the right to be concerned about
such attacks

781
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,130
but there's no indication that Amazon
isn't owned

782
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:14,369
ida so why would you be more concerned
about

783
00:46:14,369 --> 00:46:18,050
cost is attacked then and his Indian
doing bad things

784
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:22,069
and all the one argument says that look
you trust Microsoft

785
00:46:22,069 --> 00:46:25,290
with the operating system wanted to
trust Amazon with that

786
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:28,800
that cool but a little bit of a red
herring there are differences and it's

787
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,410
important to

788
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:34,400
to look into what those differences of
and so

789
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,869
you can complete that phrase trust but

790
00:46:38,869 --> 00:46:42,040
and you verified thank you

791
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:46,319
trust but verify and so we've got the
trust fund down

792
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:51,160
because beer running their service

793
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,380
but the verification think possibly come
shifty

794
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:59,589
so verification under Microsoft so and
with Windows piranha on your machine

795
00:46:59,589 --> 00:47:02,589
to a degree is always possible so your
best engineering

796
00:47:02,589 --> 00:47:05,740
whatever component hat you can look into
it and

797
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:09,670
exactly what's going on cannot small

798
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:12,819
a good number years ago someone found
strings in

799
00:47:12,819 --> 00:47:15,970
in Windows dll's with NSA

800
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:19,329
at the spot at the strings and the
related to cook to and everyone's

801
00:47:19,329 --> 00:47:22,660
well number people through quite a

802
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:25,920
fit about it and its it in

803
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,800
dictation of the verification that can
happen to people look at

804
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:34,130
what is on the system they can monitor
the outgoing network traffic vacancy

805
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:38,619
you know exactly what's what's happening
but when it comes to what Amazon's doing

806
00:47:38,619 --> 00:47:41,760
that's not OK the verification with
Hamilton

807
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,970
is absent you on cadavers an attack I'd
like to plug into

808
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:50,210
the server on which by AM I is running
and I want to do some test

809
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:57,130
you law other

810
00:47:57,130 --> 00:48:00,220
this relate a little bit back to

811
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:04,690
what we're talking about a earlier in
terms of the person in a system

812
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:08,260
so if you managed for some degree at
look the same

813
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:12,230
you purchase windows you do you go
through the whole verification step

814
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:15,280
whatever that means you but you get the
point is I cannot trust the system

815
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,400
that's cool

816
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,450
up at that point you got that software
you can use that an organization

817
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:24,730
when it comes to Anderson even if you go
through that whole verification step

818
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:27,900
however that may or may not happen I'm

819
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:31,460
there's no good guarantee that the next
day that system

820
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:36,230
remains constant at so the verification
within cloud is

821
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:41,450
is is what is is lacking and why I think
many of us have

822
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:44,660
discussed issues so

823
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:47,750
put aside by guess um made

824
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:51,380
actually be more a common story to crypt
AG

825
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:55,589
anyone familiar with them basically a
company who for fifty years with

826
00:48:55,589 --> 00:48:56,270
supplying

827
00:48:56,270 --> 00:49:01,119
crypto to companies and governments
around the world

828
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:04,119
with a really good reputation but it
turned out that

829
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:08,680
actually they were kinda front for an
essay in the US

830
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,700
that's quite an interesting article Rita

831
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:16,020
I'm and so this company that had been
trusted

832
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:19,740
but hadn't committed verification a.m.
was

833
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:25,010
doing bad stuff so it it's not a huge
leap to say look at as an

834
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:28,690
your nice guys and you got cool services
and we'd like to trust you

835
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:32,140
but we need to be able to verify if you
want to trust you fully

836
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:35,569
we need to be able to verify mister

837
00:49:35,569 --> 00:49:38,730
a will take another small little

838
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:42,230
diversion and will check out somebody
uses for

839
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:46,819
clout I'm XO go through these recruiters
basically three uses her

840
00:49:46,819 --> 00:49:50,290
we've got the unit as though the been
Nike

841
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:53,680
design and Scott and David Moeller a
pretty much this is how guys are using

842
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,579
it said

843
00:49:54,579 --> 00:49:58,819
a with Dino Dai zovi you'll you remember
the

844
00:49:58,819 --> 00:50:01,930
Debian open SL fiasco

845
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:05,690
pretty much a they wear a fixed number
keys

846
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:09,910
that could be is regenerated that would
be

847
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:13,579
produced when with when one was trying
to create

848
00:50:13,579 --> 00:50:16,970
a bunch of crypt actually pretty by the
to

849
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:20,099
as the state specifically up and so
pretty much he

850
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:24,490
generated whole bunch ok all the
possible

851
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:28,000
arce keys in this case and it took in
six hours

852
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,900
at a cost sixteen dollars for about half
a million cue that is quite a

853
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:37,190
cool little use a PC to it so you had
that computing on tap it turn on the tap

854
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:40,720
rattle is is computations

855
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:45,690
and head is on them and then didn't need
to hold on to iraq six others

856
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:48,700
in bed muggy spoke at Icecat

857
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:54,240
about buzzing a harness that is
developed the present platform

858
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,710
but pretty much he brings up virtual
machines he fudges

859
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:01,450
stuff inside them on a two-step crashes
pulls out the results dumped into

860
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:02,380
databases

861
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:05,569
and saw but it's happening in Parliament

862
00:51:05,569 --> 00:51:09,400
quite an also quite a nice example of
how to use the clock

863
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,760
a man in the guys from dynamic so I
suspected be

864
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:18,480
well known to you also have have made
you some bc2 to cast by malware

865
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,180
because of the project in which open
source software

866
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:25,569
was on ec2

867
00:51:25,569 --> 00:51:29,770
sought the this gives an indication of
ok well some other players

868
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:33,150
in the cloud but actually really
interested in 30 that

869
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:36,260
for um the talk so

870
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:40,190
more about me is as apples

871
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:44,740
to the cloud service felt both but calm
as a commercial service

872
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:48,119
that deals mostly with CRM software its

873
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:51,470
a but it also has a platform as a
service component

874
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:55,900
and Amazon which is the well-known one
so just to give you a taste

875
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:59,390
I spoke earlier that Amazon allows all a
leftist

876
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:02,770
electricity is a big component of cloud
computing

877
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:06,589
so this is an example of a customer's
usage of

878
00:52:06,589 --> 00:52:09,690
a CPU's over

879
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:14,579
overtime and what you'll see is that it
spikes when they actually need

880
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:18,349
the computing popped during the day an
accident processing

881
00:52:18,349 --> 00:52:22,280
they need to see pews on the week at it
can drop off and you pay

882
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:25,390
based on how much you so it's quite a
nice Peter but

883
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:30,059
biz gotta be a little bit over concern
here

884
00:52:30,059 --> 00:52:34,020
it means that if someone else can drive
your usage up

885
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:37,210
and depending on how you a leftist is
coming figured it could cost you more

886
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:38,079
directed

887
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:41,319
the competitor could quite easily

888
00:52:41,319 --> 00:52:45,369
you know but due to be due to be tough

889
00:52:45,369 --> 00:52:49,000
cost people money will not necessarily
top but not really easy to cut someone

890
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,910
money you can just W get

891
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:55,550
loop a really expensive already process
intensive paid

892
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:58,660
on his site a

893
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:03,200
storage is the services is one of the
other key components

894
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,550
that that one season cloud computing and
it's also quite a common service that is

895
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:08,079
the so there are many providers

896
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:12,930
it's probably the most common service
that will see when it comes to

897
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:16,240
the clouds space and it is quite a
simple thing

898
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:20,740
I'm that there's a whole bunch ok

899
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:24,000
reasons why I it becomes useful so

900
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,460
for one it's available from wherever you
are you just need an internet connection

901
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:30,750
on you not limited by your own store
it's likely

902
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:34,270
you need to buy new drive to just pay as
and when you need more and more data and

903
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:36,109
you paid

904
00:53:36,109 --> 00:53:40,869
gigabyte so it's quite useful

905
00:53:40,869 --> 00:53:44,260
but often we get that web application
interface that thrown on top of this

906
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:47,809
thing and if there's one thing we heard
about applications is that mostly we

907
00:53:47,809 --> 00:53:49,569
doing it wrong

908
00:53:49,569 --> 00:53:53,800
and so now we've got applications that
we generally done out a bold and we

909
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:58,170
so that they can file systems behind
them and it seems to be

910
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:03,740
a recipe for some lost so for example
Amazon

911
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:07,309
a.m. with the city in the early days the
2006

912
00:54:07,309 --> 00:54:10,630
when they would re provisional machine
in other words

913
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:14,190
machine had bean they were installing
the new

914
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:17,640
there putting in a new but she know
whatever the previous

915
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,520
disk usage but at the scene wasn't white
chocolate

916
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:25,099
the meant that you could just boot up
clean

917
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:28,890
or you could meet up in image and start
going through

918
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:33,040
the desk sector by sector even though
you're looking at it from a

919
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,059
inside a virtual machine useful that
read in sectors of

920
00:54:36,059 --> 00:54:39,390
does can you can put a lot information
from the people who were

921
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:43,040
using that machine previous to get
documents to get partisan saw

922
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,079
on and that was demonstrated

923
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:49,380
but these days we've got a

924
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:52,490
well there's a service call speaker

925
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:55,930
and they were purchased by executed so
the security company

926
00:54:55,930 --> 00:55:00,530
with the goal being to do secure storage
in the clock

927
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:06,000
and so they've got the markets feel that
but I got all dressed mcree

928
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,319
fund actually a relatively stupid

929
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:13,510
cross-site scripting vulnerability in
there service so

930
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:17,490
your you are relying on the service to
provide you with access

931
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:21,680
to your data so they're disc they
restored service

932
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:25,710
but actually their web applications got
cross-site scripting at

933
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:29,430
a minute in this case it was assistant
process cryptic

934
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:33,589
is a little bit worthwhile worse than
reflected

935
00:55:33,589 --> 00:55:37,150
I'm and so you know these guys

936
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:41,819
was supposed to be a secure storage
provider that's the stated aim

937
00:55:41,819 --> 00:55:46,270
are not rarely getting it right either

938
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:50,480
I'm Apple have their I disc service

939
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:55,930
up to this again another example that
escort service and lets you store

940
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:59,920
whatever you want on their win the clock

941
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,520
and so you can upload from either your
iPhone or from within

942
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,569
iTunes or whatever weaving from

943
00:56:06,569 --> 00:56:10,849
find a and so Jeremy Richards in this
case

944
00:56:10,849 --> 00:56:14,280
showed us this example so yeah he's got
his I does

945
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:18,290
which is as you can see in the leftist
accessible as another volume

946
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:21,589
and this is the contents of his I disc
but

947
00:56:21,589 --> 00:56:25,020
what are the features a I does is that
you got a public folder

948
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:28,549
and so it means that people anyone

949
00:56:28,549 --> 00:56:31,760
can access to public poll on the net and

950
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,010
will show you an example by that's bad
let

951
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:38,160
a but what he put says the put the
private but txt

952
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,280
outside the public folder to not be
acceptable

953
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,599
to the public and as the content

954
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:48,109
but what you find is that you'll see
that

955
00:56:48,109 --> 00:56:51,990
you Jeremy doctor to the best public
forts that

956
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:55,940
and if you're you familiar with
percentage to yield know that translates

957
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:56,770
to

958
00:56:56,770 --> 00:57:00,319
a dot period a full stop I'm in other
words

959
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:04,420
we're talking directly to reversal
really

960
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:09,270
directory traversal in this day and age
unfortunately yes

961
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:13,900
directly to both on Apple I disc which
is

962
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:17,240
incredibly lame but it's that

963
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:20,619
a and so one of the big guys within the
storage

964
00:57:20,619 --> 00:57:24,369
service is sugar thing but before we
actually talk

965
00:57:24,369 --> 00:57:27,549
sugar think I want to quickly talk a
little bit but that doesn't

966
00:57:27,549 --> 00:57:30,680
I'm you probably all use to

967
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:35,040
a route 14 loggins two pages the
typically you try to login

968
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:38,549
to page you get back to your part to its
not

969
00:57:38,549 --> 00:57:42,000
Baylor or you part with invalid you do
this a couple a time to get the part

970
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:42,819
that is invalid

971
00:57:42,819 --> 00:57:45,930
maybe finally you get the correct of
that

972
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:49,109
you get a message that is welcome ball

973
00:57:49,109 --> 00:57:52,210
but what happens if you don't know her
about the welcome

974
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:55,450
Bob message on then it becomes

975
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:58,450
a little trixie so what one way to do
this

976
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:03,940
is to kinda get a signature for what
invalid login

977
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:08,150
attempt looks like the to some string
population the page

978
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:11,970
and then you always check to get that
string calculation to see if it matches

979
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:15,160
and where it doesn't match

980
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:20,220
then its so where it matters that the
felt like it where it doesn't matter you

981
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:21,430
don't know what that is

982
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:25,359
but you know it's not I felt like maybe
it's another

983
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:28,549
might be in this case another error
message or in this case that's

984
00:58:28,549 --> 00:58:32,589
the welcome message okay up

985
00:58:32,589 --> 00:58:36,040
problem is sometimes you get kicked out
of

986
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:39,670
we get it locked out of an account in
this case you can just run report user

987
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:41,599
name to the constant password

988
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:45,230
I'm and you make it some luck

989
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:48,670
but actually all that is the lead-up to
get in a session ID

990
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:51,900
in most applications so a cookie is

991
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:55,140
a in common applications it's

992
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:59,750
the most popular way all handley in

993
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:03,680
authentication it's an authentication
cookie

994
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,839
and so actually your only ever trying to

995
00:59:06,839 --> 00:59:10,109
to get back about it could be that type
2 time in session

996
00:59:10,109 --> 00:59:14,160
so the question becomes:

997
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:17,250
well can we brute force cookies

998
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:21,420
and generally beyond to that is no I
mean it at least 228 but

999
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:25,490
number that you cannot be close and that

1000
00:59:25,490 --> 00:59:29,420
the chances love you get into that space
of quite small

1001
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:32,780
that is not so if you could if you could

1002
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:36,520
brute force every picky on the site and
eventually you

1003
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:40,619
did find one that that matters of course
there is statistics of fun in this case

1004
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:41,880
in

1005
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:46,170
and so you can improve your chances

1006
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:50,210
with some random selection but we did
look at this company called

1007
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:54,829
sugar think and what is interesting and
and white ties back to the brute forcing

1008
00:59:54,829 --> 00:59:59,859
is exactly this so I'm gonna show you

1009
00:59:59,859 --> 01:00:03,470
these few videos and then we'll go I
think to the first

1010
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:10,470
break

1011
01:00:14,330 --> 01:00:15,150
okay

1012
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:18,309
so I'm or this is just

1013
01:00:18,309 --> 01:00:21,779
all the luck in kinda Exeter

1014
01:00:21,779 --> 01:00:25,869
last him okay so we want to look into
sugar think

1015
01:00:25,869 --> 01:00:29,499
every donor I use that we've got up off
it

1016
01:00:29,499 --> 01:00:33,319
so we follow the Forgot Password process
yet

1017
01:00:33,319 --> 01:00:36,979
so we enter not email address and what
happens is you'll see dotnet

1018
01:00:36,979 --> 01:00:41,489
I'm up for papa little notification to
say that you mail has been received

1019
01:00:41,489 --> 01:00:44,489
go to the email base engine

1020
01:00:44,489 --> 01:00:47,680
email it and inside the email is link

1021
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:51,569
and the email has that link

1022
01:00:51,569 --> 01:00:54,989
but just in the middle and pretty much
at the at the reset

1023
01:00:54,989 --> 01:00:58,710
link with the toca because the need to
present the token in order to

1024
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:05,680
reset that possible a man of course once
you enter in the token

1025
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:11,349
when you get to reset deposit kept but
that's pretty much what

1026
01:01:11,349 --> 01:01:15,200
link looks like and you'll see that at
that link is

1027
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:21,380
not as big as just looking at it visit
it's not as big as one might expect a

1028
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:28,380
a cookie to be and so

1029
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:37,200
and so where does this leave us to do
them study math

1030
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:40,340
and will like back then looked up and
you'll find that that's actually a

1031
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:41,530
really big number

1032
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:46,340
I'm it sorta 2.2 billion possibilities

1033
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:49,660
so well

1034
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:54,160
that numbers 2.2 billion right if you
try to guess things

1035
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,470
but they attack becomes quite quite
interesting but it's still a really big

1036
01:01:57,470 --> 01:01:58,550
number we need to get

1037
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:03,300
two billion but they've got an interest
in approach to their account

1038
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:08,740
with a possible reset and that is that
you can submit as many reset as you want

1039
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:12,110
a.m. and that

1040
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:15,470
token all these tokens are that

1041
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:18,880
so that %uh a writer could they just add
tokens

1042
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:22,060
to the allowed reset ok

1043
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:25,700
list so it would we try to

1044
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:29,450
we try to skip this we try to brute
force this a just over two days but in

1045
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:30,140
two days

1046
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:33,820
it said to be retried 2.2 million tokens
which is

1047
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:37,490
a small subset of 2.2 billion on

1048
01:02:37,490 --> 01:02:40,930
so it's not that much but the question
the morning

1049
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:45,340
the more interesting think ross' will
want to notice they getting loads of

1050
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:50,150
reset request um they're also getting
loads of

1051
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:53,490
attempt to to guess other

1052
01:02:53,490 --> 01:02:56,710
reset legs surely don't notice but
actually

1053
01:02:56,710 --> 01:03:01,330
upgraded so we put a bunch of work doing
things like

1054
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:04,990
on an obvious stuff actually so we
multi-threaded that some not gonna go

1055
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:05,710
through that

1056
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:09,380
video but the morn the more interesting

1057
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:13,030
I think a the more interesting aspect of
this

1058
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:18,280
was the fact that I'm

1059
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:22,360
two weeks later so often we went through
this attack two weeks later these

1060
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:22,970
accounts

1061
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:26,840
authorities reset link with still valid
so

1062
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:30,830
so you can attack this problem into
thoughts on one side you can try to

1063
01:03:30,830 --> 01:03:31,530
guess

1064
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:35,030
random links to get anyone

1065
01:03:35,030 --> 01:03:39,260
anyone slick out there but on the other
side you can also generate

1066
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:42,990
as many reset link to the 13 given a cop

1067
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:46,440
if you know the address of someone you
are trying to

1068
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:49,530
attack you can submit 5

1069
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:54,360
million reset link on their behalf of
I've been on the other side you can try

1070
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:57,890
guess one of those so your probabilities

1071
01:03:57,890 --> 01:04:01,980
start to increase um for us

1072
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:07,050
what we found there was that time this
lynn issue

1073
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:10,890
and so in this case we didn't have

1074
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:14,000
we didn't have permission from these
guys to test the system

1075
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,010
and so this is not something that this
is one of those murky areas

1076
01:04:18,010 --> 01:04:21,200
so we didn't go further than this we
wanted to demonstrate

1077
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,260
the potential I'm but

1078
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:27,690
you know generated by then it doesn't
reset link that probably

1079
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:31,500
or like

1080
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:35,250
at least okay up I think whilst

1081
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:39,000
doc there for five minutes I remember
this is a two hour presentation and you

1082
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,370
thought about 22

1083
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:44,860
that's not all 22 12 it will take five
minutes break

1084
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:46,590
and will carry on of it
