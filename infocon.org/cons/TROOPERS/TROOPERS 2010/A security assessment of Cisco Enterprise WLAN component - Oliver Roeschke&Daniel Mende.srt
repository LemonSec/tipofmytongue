1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,379
and okay

2
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:07,569
welcome to the life talk am opting to
take a break and the announcement

3
00:00:07,569 --> 00:00:08,980
between the picket wats

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,799
an blocked two guys could be present
today are

5
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,789
on everest and can you mend a an making
for dr. NW

6
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,300
and they're presenting the results okay
security research paid our

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,260
a contract they're doing adults and the
he's getting the prize

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,060
while Islam soul Scott and

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,630
especially i think im you to maybe be
presented so it will be a very

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,430
interesting

11
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:37,030
your content entity and %um with
recommittal

12
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,059
all hotel to look more fancied Negri

13
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:43,760
than before so it easier to

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,760
get so hello everybody I'm night that

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,309
got it to the last talk and we have some

16
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:53,730
quite something interesting companies
and deep

17
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,890
technical stuff award presented to you

18
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,219
and its all about the school enterprise
wireless

19
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:03,239
security and I mean I'm we can

20
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,659
nearly skip the who we are I mean
everybody knows as historical trends and

21
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:08,950
that

22
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,990
some two things all one thing that

23
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,439
a we have apparently you some kind of

24
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,880
but a company blog week going but 20

25
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,000
it video insinuated top cop a dotnet

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,850
salty fried with it 232 subscribe to the
RSS feed

27
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,030
and get all the news that would being
out on the world of

28
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,460
wonderful what a security so long

29
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,460
this is just too stay in touch with
what's going to

30
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,470
happen in this talk with just the
talking all

31
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:45,810
little bit about what's weedy meeting
with her

32
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,020
when we say enterprise-wide as land
security all solutions

33
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:54,079
we talk about so a bit about what's
behind

34
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,649
that what's not thats make the
difference between wireless and

35
00:01:57,649 --> 00:01:58,680
enterprise wireless

36
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,880
and of course the technology overview
and the potential attack as you have in

37
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,369
that

38
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:08,080
just because of the the overall decide

39
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,730
and hey dig into

40
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,050
to freeware sins of Cisco enterprise
Wales

41
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,120
land where and the first one is the

42
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,260
at small world and the devil the second
Walton

43
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,560
is the cumm wall and we will not walk

44
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,629
is interesting from the security

45
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:33,330
standpoint within these generations of
awareness security and

46
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,300
of course we have some all blank and
this is an ongoing research grade take

47
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,120
so long

48
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,349
for the next don't know how long it
takes

49
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:47,500
time you will the a new findings your
stuff we can talk about that

50
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,810
because protest with just in the middle
of

51
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,910
and analyzing so

52
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:58,800
an what briefing we're doing

53
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,810
not only security research but we don't
do

54
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,580
also doing practical implementation of
all that stuff and

55
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,450
we did practical implementations of and
and the price gain wireless networks

56
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:15,459
and we had the complementary read the
documentation all that stuff nothin

57
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:18,989
some parts of the documentation when I
think is this really

58
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:23,569
with doesn't work said that his defect
just read by reading documentation you

59
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:24,129
say this

60
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:27,489
can't be possible this shouldn't be the
way it is

61
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:31,170
so every time you read it every time we
set it up with that

62
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,440
and now with this this hurts you don't
do we

63
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,659
it like dad if you want to do with the Q
as always like a

64
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:42,209
reading documentation senior potential
liabilities

65
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:45,760
it was like that we said okay in germany
you say it

66
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,650
mild an in away like a okay that's
something wrong to say it like that

67
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,200
you say now than we said Kate just been
reading documentation

68
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,439
be see that at something going wrong and
we want to do at this couple

69
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,530
that you want to see what is the
potential of that

70
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,980
missus exploitable it so which are the

71
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,360
circumstances you have to make it
exploitable it

72
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,430
are you we able to write to me for it to

73
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,729
really have not only and you're reading
When abilities but really practically

74
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:17,709
vulnerabilities

75
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:21,790
network and that than exploit and say
hey

76
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,430
nope you have to you have to secure this
to happen you have to say

77
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,810
do that step to be secure or it doesn't
sometimes it's not even

78
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,350
possible to be really secure with these
environments

79
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:37,590
so this is something that caught us just
been reading documentation can we say

80
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:41,389
this is interesting topic we can do a
lot of stuff in there

81
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:45,550
and this is hard all started the thing
is

82
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:50,070
that course not of security research
about

83
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:53,449
while balding crypts and wireless about

84
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:57,270
a khomeini's how many times it

85
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,449
or how many hours just research has been

86
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:04,970
ban Gong WPP protection to break it all
down

87
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,190
this is all almost done this is nearly

88
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,070
and this is not what we're talking about
we think this more in

89
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,990
enterprise environment it's the ball
manageability in enterprise environments

90
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,560
that coming and points like you're
roaming

91
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,740
and when you have noise overview on for
example

92
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,740
an enterprise environment which has
somehow to be covered

93
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,360
so that more and we say we focus on the
more stop

94
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,960
more than what is shortly already done
and

95
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,690
in that field nationally-known research
done on to now

96
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,300
that some back hey we know this protocol
is law

97
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:46,300
and that may be used in there but this
nobody looked at these devices itself

98
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,380
nobody look at this

99
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,080
setup at the configuration inside 8 keep
an eye on

100
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,340
the following function and so

101
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,639
second point was also a very large
company

102
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,500
just paid us a little bit of money we
also got 10 the more hardware

103
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,130
completing the model we can work on and
to do some

104
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:09,289
testing with so this just

105
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:13,710
happened like it what it wants would
really good for us because we

106
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:18,419
good mix the two things together gotten
a girl taking research paid research

107
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:22,350
and even had access to hardware you
normally wouldn't

108
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,389
by because the costs like more than

109
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:29,160
I don't know what is that like 2004
30,000 euro

110
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,550
the largest control Cisco so normally

111
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,580
nothing a nobody of us would have that
just

112
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,509
lying around for research Nationals a
great thing

113
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:43,889
and so the missus all how all this
started

114
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:47,000
I what are the goals

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,740
I of course meal want to provide you
with a result of a security researcher

116
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,470
cause we say thats things going on that
need

117
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,750
to be public people need to know all
that so that they can fix your

118
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,000
that environment in be incorrect way

119
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,060
so that Wireless if SA-six your

120
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,280
as it should be and

121
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,139
course best also wall ng are you will
see the previous heart

122
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:17,490
that some whole protocol decide and
bolted

123
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:22,910
go three lost some protocols was just

124
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,099
day it's just in secured by the side UK
you can

125
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:29,870
say you can no for example yes thank

126
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,610
authentication you can say hail to
secure protocol design it for you in

127
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,069
secure authentication

128
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:39,800
boss missus long life follow people you
need to tell you need to show them you

129
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,699
need to be

130
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:46,789
some whole let say let this exploitable
by toolkit

131
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:51,180
and of course nothing really up to you
all things going on that expressly in

132
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,300
the Cisco wall

133
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,379
that we just wanted to show you that
some slight

134
00:07:55,379 --> 00:08:00,330
the which just make it on the end of the
day I would say

135
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:04,190
soul what we're currently talking about
it in

136
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,210
can be poured in a cool picture like
that

137
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,490
what you have is a corporate network
that

138
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:16,009
in all in for the understanding of this
talk is just all the way it network

139
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:20,849
missus we don't have all but this is
just wide a corporate network

140
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:24,870
of course we have a amount of access
points which

141
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:28,180
delivered the and wireless mobility and

142
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,330
we have the small white notes here which
I'll the end users on the wireless

143
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,810
service

144
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:38,640
what is always the cases that you have
in some way some kind of control

145
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,209
which is responsible for controlling the
Larchmont Access Point thing about some

146
00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:46,850
from large company campbell's with

147
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:51,080
that's a housing access points there
needs to be some way to control that in

148
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,540
a centralized manner

149
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,920
and this is what the controllers of for
depending on

150
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,220
which generation they do more or less
stop these controllers

151
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,100
nearly all have in common that they
support some kind of

152
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,880
an don't wanna 8.o 2.1 it authentication

153
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,500
song there's always some authentication
server and more

154
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,970
that are sometimes even split up for
like of indications up

155
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:20,019
inspector devices like excess point

156
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:23,360
because they may be placed in hostile
environments

157
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,370
the think about a conference room

158
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,800
and the authentication service for como
by

159
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,850
nolte the end users of the wireless this
is sometimes even split up

160
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:38,820
and of course better credential database
for the authentication services itself

161
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,839
which is in interesting part and

162
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,630
the funny thing is authentication
service in and controls a

163
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:50,930
typically always administrated beyond
that interfaces

164
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:54,140
and I mean application the

165
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,420
better education security is a field of
its own that mean

166
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,779
everybody has a me over if you all that
whole

167
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:05,130
many things can go wrong in dat and it's
not the core business of such a

168
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:08,120
controller to have a secure web it

169
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:13,279
by the way sold this what all the
generations of Cisco Wireless

170
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,360
and field on and weaving

171
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,399
hanging there hack all after your I'll
treat

172
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:24,760
different generations Wireless new for
small business

173
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,800
so-called structured Wireless where
networks

174
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,750
and often called as long

175
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:36,420
and then there's things all the great
difference between the first generation

176
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,410
into

177
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:41,760
in the second and third is that you have
some may call it autonomous

178
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,050
access points meaning nearly all our
tickets place in a

179
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,320
in the access point and nearly all
function is take place in the access

180
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,040
point

181
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:55,880
and then the the second and third
generation

182
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,300
and built awning some really control a
model

183
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,570
the exact point get down really dumb
sometimes

184
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,750
the access point is nothing more than a
pretty between why it

185
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,980
and what your last nothing more an

186
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,850
this came from the acquisition of every
space in 2005

187
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:18,060
and which originally built that model in
Cisco quite every space

188
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,350
and with that the complete product

189
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:25,329
and the complete model of came this
wireless with controllers

190
00:11:25,329 --> 00:11:28,390
I'm what if the control dot and if you

191
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:32,500
look deeper into the vices your the see
some parts where

192
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,510
you really see the brand name every
space in it even if this quiet

193
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,300
right now so I'm you see this is Justin
like an

194
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:46,720
a like an ongoing switch from Ari space
to fiscal which does not have finished

195
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,190
the third the the second generation is
built on a protocol called

196
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:56,880
like wide x this point protocol about
this will not be covered in that Paul

197
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,310
the third generation will be covered the
new protocol

198
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:04,399
the called Cup what and its integrated
into

199
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,579
the vision of fiscal called Cisco
Unified

200
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:11,370
why let network this this will be the

201
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:15,410
second generation will talk about first
vietnam

202
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:19,110
then the CNN generation we'll talk about
going

203
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:23,709
tell you something funny ratings people
and

204
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:26,860
so what are the main attack has if you
look at such an

205
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:31,389
complex environment it's not only in ask
that point with some configured SSID

206
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:35,279
but it's all about management and having

207
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,730
this integration into existing wired
infrastructures

208
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,100
there of course is attack have like

209
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,630
attacking traffic which is currently in
transit thing about

210
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,839
to he's dropping on the wireless
interface if you're

211
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:52,329
being if you may have access to wired

212
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:56,649
connection an access point but just an
alternate from the wall in

213
00:12:56,649 --> 00:13:01,480
take that cable for example so this
isbn: part

214
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,490
get attack against cryptographic
material use a lot of cryptographic

215
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,310
material on

216
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:11,010
one-sided on the y los interface

217
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,100
and of course on the why it

218
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,089
interfacing access point to because the
access point might be placed in a

219
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,940
hostile environment like a conference
room

220
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:25,769
all public area so confidential data
which is transmitted from

221
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:29,579
the access point to its control and must
somehow be secured

222
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:33,240
typical an field for cryptographic

223
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,410
so excess main apec have all that

224
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,889
cryptographic material can we break
cripple can we

225
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:43,180
some how do you write the key that is
you for

226
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,930
securing that can we may be in check the
devices

227
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:50,230
and Wintek packets into all that data
stream

228
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:54,760
and menu late as we want to

229
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,690
and the last thing of course the salt
complex compliment with a lot of

230
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,660
software on it

231
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,680
attack against the continent itself

232
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,750
like attacks against what interfaces
physical replacement of

233
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,769
interfaces to statistical tampering with

234
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:14,329
these devices all that stuff many a
physician

235
00:14:14,329 --> 00:14:17,430
of course attacked again management
interfaces

236
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:20,760
this also involves protocols like ATP as

237
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,290
SNMP SSH Telnet whatever is all

238
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,500
they're used for management

239
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,730
Nikon the main attack pat and that we
figured out for

240
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:35,380
this kind of environment

241
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,730
so it's got over to include the s1
myriad

242
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,930
the S 10 10 will now be say

243
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:45,810
filled with some devices the

244
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:51,380
idea between it behind yes one is yes
so-called why Islam control domains

245
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:56,130
which is nothing more like a the
dysfunctional eighty called is a while

246
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:56,970
if the main

247
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:00,130
services the WTS

248
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:03,389
in short so you have some kind of
control

249
00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:06,570
within the certain state that's a

250
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,899
part of the network and within

251
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:13,070
that domain York or you have of course

252
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:18,149
these wireless access point the way they
think that points and the WD

253
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:21,970
its mobster dates change Massachusetts

254
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:26,740
on a protocol called WN CTP

255
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:30,600
and these all

256
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,720
for example of Education data which is
transported

257
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,829
this could be cut graphical material
like

258
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:41,040
pair was masa keys which is reported on
that

259
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,320
so this thing protocol which is
interesting for us

260
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,670
thing about the main attack have
stripped the traffic take

261
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:52,410
against cryptographic than

262
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,820
panties everything's and all that

263
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:00,660
and of course these the WTF moscow has
some kind of

264
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,610
authentication the within

265
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:07,769
aquarium authentication server discuss
that you are

266
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:12,209
ACS in normal and that's the kind of
monitoring device

267
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:15,529
called the widest lens solution engine
WLS

268
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:19,029
he which can lead to a mall then one of
these

269
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:22,370
and playlist domain so you can

270
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:25,550
spread like a while if the main an

271
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:29,620
pit office you have alway this domain
building you have

272
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,690
and within such an domain for example
services like

273
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:38,259
roaming and from one access point to
another

274
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:41,420
touring having was over Whiteland called
forty-some

275
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,730
stuff like that going on dig deeper into
debt

276
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:48,860
great guys about the complex structure
mean that is behind

277
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,560
is because it's not that easy the
important

278
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,009
and one important thing the solution
engine right here

279
00:16:57,009 --> 00:17:02,240
communicate to the masa also using WS
TCP

280
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,850
and so on the youth this improbable but
they Chris Paul

281
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:11,069
different types of data like radio
frequency measuring date on all

282
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:14,799
still the the idea is

283
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,350
to say okay an access point has quite a

284
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:23,160
bit of logic in it it does the group in
a while is packets for example

285
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:28,250
and its ok enormous but it needs to be
configured in a sensual way

286
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:32,390
so you take a the while a plan to use an
engine for it

287
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:36,169
all the away as long service medal which
can be placed in a cup

288
00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:39,330
65 for example

289
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:43,840
an did with WL CP

290
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,220
it became really interesting the
protocol itself is

291
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:52,620
the documented in to US Patent
applications

292
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,059
the but its you can save new like

293
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:59,630
little bit divided in two parts their
message types in it

294
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:03,940
and some messages types carry non
critical data

295
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,140
the unencrypted male

296
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,320
and documented within the attend
application

297
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,419
and a message hide which carry

298
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:17,490
attends a dictator they aren't repeated
and they are document

299
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:20,900
so you have to revise engineer these if
you wanna see

300
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,370
what's in there

301
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,470
the the the figures

302
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:30,610
you depending and what just set up is

303
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,049
and what the the kind of day two AC-one
to transport your

304
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:37,200
different types of encapsulation and

305
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,590
a one thing and many really hard its you
don't have a really good

306
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:45,789
possible that network and I'm quite sure

307
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:49,240
that in Brumbies to a pic potential
application

308
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,390
the Wireshark corning guys only called
the first one because it

309
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:56,620
has in the name of the protocol itself
and

310
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,030
but it does not contain many this
package description

311
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,030
on SSI description and so you have

312
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:06,260
like let's say really basic message

313
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:10,910
paldon everything else you want to know
you have to read invite and headache

314
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:14,309
and sometimes in binary soul

315
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:18,090
I'm you have to realize engineer it and
you have to take

316
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,400
in account that it encapsulated data in
different ways

317
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,929
sometimes it's even at encapsulated
sometimes it UTPA encapsulated

318
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:30,450
and the protocol itself is a really I
think complex monster

319
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:36,679
because you can do :p the only thing it
can't do this cooking

320
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:40,350
what it dogs in the background is it
delivered

321
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:44,870
well one thing is it delivers
authentication services

322
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:48,000
authentication services in two different
menace

323
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,539
the first one is every excess point
authenticated

324
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:56,260
within the whole infrastructure to be
sure that

325
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:02,850
the nor ok devices able to join that
infrastructure

326
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:07,659
a good idea by its cool into effect of
Education

327
00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:12,059
is done by protocol called light white

328
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:15,580
expendable authentication protocol all
the principal bro

329
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,650
proprietary the second thing is you have

330
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:22,559
of indication of client devices como my
notes

331
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,179
and this is this is not bound to any

332
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:30,230
AP method it every yet he met to discuss
support

333
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,770
so you have need to have support a
client side and on the authentication

334
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:34,460
server

335
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:39,250
and then you can used that
authentication method

336
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,830
be authentication method Bowl

337
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:47,840
weary here retrieve encryption material
informal keys

338
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:53,059
so you have something like that
so-called network session key and SK

339
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:56,270
the NSK he is what you get

340
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:59,390
after your successfully authenticated
yourself

341
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:03,020
we are typically and that's something

342
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:07,500
additionally in the infrastructure
authentication call

343
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,000
the is the so-called context rent spare
key

344
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,280
CPK which is derived separately

345
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,460
of the FT Wright the net an escape

346
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,530
but this of things we will talk about
will be later

347
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,570
soul an what are they really

348
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:27,710
been parked in year is

349
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:31,919
an siskel is giving you

350
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,030
possibility is like having really fast
roaming

351
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:38,240
imagine like an at the clinics

352
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,350
and say can take up to several seconds

353
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:46,530
if you have a pic Voice over IP phone
call you want from one access point or

354
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,309
the other

355
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:50,700
got it roaming you have it re of
indication process

356
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,909
that takes that long your call dropped
Cisco says we have money fight that

357
00:21:54,909 --> 00:21:55,919
process

358
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,130
weekend the the process roaming

359
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:03,010
can be done in less than 150
milliseconds

360
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:06,980
which is quite possible home call
doesn't roll what they do

361
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:10,030
it with even the slightest the main
service

362
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:13,120
they cashed your encryption key for the
wireless

363
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,820
interface and they distribute the key to
the new

364
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:21,400
access point you wrong to that system
this is the idea

365
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,580
you don't have to ago the fall
techniques the

366
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:29,510
message on often the case in
authentication exchange

367
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:32,880
but you have some whole you have to
transport

368
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,530
the key from one access point to the
other excess

369
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:40,549
which is done an using

370
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:43,950
wsftp and of course because it's

371
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,309
ban if encryption material it's an

372
00:22:47,309 --> 00:22:51,929
the key it security relevant

373
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:55,429
these data is protected encrypt it by
the so-called

374
00:22:55,429 --> 00:22:59,690
CPK so and if you want

375
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:02,750
ever wanna showing

376
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:06,650
into this the city paid

377
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:10,840
becomes really interested interesting
for you if you are able to get that

378
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:16,100
you can you able to communicate within
that interest you

379
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,900
the second thing it a.m. you have these

380
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:24,340
a while if the main service ma sis
that's an election protocol

381
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:28,010
if anybody knowles is this cohort that
by meeting people

382
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:31,730
each a rst

383
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:35,100
use maybe remember they have strong

384
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,640
like mobster election and

385
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,720
bill up on the priority you can
configure

386
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,110
with halting kinda authentication

387
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:49,690
the same paying is here

388
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:52,909
it just happened priority value in a
packet

389
00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:56,669
and the one with the higher priority
that's good while estimates are some of

390
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:57,870
that

391
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:04,110
and I mean this is quite obvious if you
can create these packets

392
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:08,450
your able to pin the master collection
you able to be the one who controls the

393
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,110
complete

394
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:12,230
Wireless to main West Mitt

395
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,850
potentially excess every pairwise
masakane

396
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:20,200
that encrypts why industry at in traffic

397
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,690
and if not okay if you both the master

398
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:27,610
and don't behave like a must see what
happens this is typically

399
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:31,500
a denial-of-service so it just bring
down the whole infrastructure

400
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,570
and Wales becomes unusable so

401
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:38,779
I this is one point he said take what
does this have to do

402
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:42,730
we've got a protocol this time and

403
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:46,650
or weekly with a if this is usable

404
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:50,220
you can exploit that yet to then

405
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,610
that might not might not be a good
practical decide

406
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:57,850
so I I think it's time to head over to
die not because they know that the

407
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:58,510
coding

408
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:03,520
and he will show you old bed

409
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,100
a act all the talking about the

410
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,640
left they'll actually and just

411
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,150
all the ball and then

412
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:20,120
acting it can't be that hard to just pay
duty right back up to 30 we left

413
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,010
electing

414
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:24,900
and for start creating

415
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:30,390
and you about a deadline to seek aid I
got a team which sends out there at

416
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:33,490
negative and all the access point

417
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,679
up with that the I day a W

418
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,400
yes Matthew so my connected to the

419
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,840
theory line with one of these exit
points and

420
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,179
and as you can see they

421
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:52,770
just elected one of that which is in
this case

422
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:57,760
and the exit point with the got turned
on the left act at

423
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,039
and a business done automatically

424
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,070
they both adults and yes it the packages
and

425
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:08,659
like them i three all mean

426
00:26:08,659 --> 00:26:11,950
okay still coated small to me

427
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:15,049
which is called a evaluate the puter
cricket

428
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:18,490
many to name but and its recipe

429
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:23,450
one sec so I am wanted to deliver to the
green

430
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,610
won the IP address all the you

431
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:31,080
an added yet more of the revised and
make a trip up the method

432
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,559
in this case I just used the and layer 3
in there to address of my

433
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:38,730
physical interface so I will get all the

434
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:42,340
and traffic the exit points we try to
authenticate

435
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:46,630
with me with the new Matthew and 42
traffic

436
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:50,480
and of both I won't get into your role
you must be because I don't behave like

437
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,370
that

438
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:54,690
a WTF so it

439
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:59,049
that the area it will end up in Internet

440
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:02,409
it 123 and just

441
00:27:02,409 --> 00:27:05,630
wait a few seconds to get enough I could
just generated

442
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:08,850
and all the access point and

443
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:12,150
just get noticed

444
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:15,710
all all me up than you may think and

445
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:19,220
at the few seconds to beat the they both
got it

446
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:24,000
and you WTS and three which is goodnight
address delivered at

447
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,500
material and the IP attracted in this
case they both try to be

448
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,240
just and authenticated with the new
yesterday

449
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:38,270
which we gotta be done because I don't
entity that and authentication request

450
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:42,350
thing at mate thing kind of did I look
at it

451
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:46,630
you see okay these which to thank the
Lord because they don't got a

452
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:49,720
W the peace-loving and

453
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,600
all day and the and distributed

454
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,200
and W land get this guy yet

455
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,240
funny thing about that course have to
configure on an access point which at

456
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,590
that point is the WDS master

457
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,820
and the moment to configure that

458
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:11,809
and the their excess morning

459
00:28:11,809 --> 00:28:15,929
to or hadn't certain priority work for

460
00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:22,929
value it 10 Alden these packet the
priority value can be up to 255

461
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,880
and they send all the number 254 so you
always

462
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,539
able to school from austin because
that's just one number let

463
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:34,100
and you can configured the priority pace
yourself

464
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,669
it's just to say if this is the master
it take

465
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:42,360
nearly the highest value but not expect
the highest value available

466
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,630
so we always able to do that that meant
a whole

467
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:48,880
how you configure that divided so

468
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,850
Monday I will sleeping aid yet

469
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:56,970
briefly then long to do the

470
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:00,470
and and though missus

471
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:04,330
like really simple the more I don't know
how long did it take

472
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:10,370
for you to call Det young so quite and
easy if you own it on BluRay documented

473
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:11,010
a

474
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,070
you'll be values within the protocol
which acted dumb from

475
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:18,450
original packet is a paper and bite by
bite into the cold

476
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:25,090
saying as all about that it's not
located

477
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:30,190
quite easy peasy but can be a very
successful if you have existing

478
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:33,690
that they unlock button excess Boynton

479
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:37,470
typically these the while 31 access
points

480
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:40,630
Houston and hanging on the wall
typically this

481
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:45,110
kind of infrastructure behind it but
that more

482
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:52,110
an reset okay the the communication
between a piece

483
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,159
is some have to queue its base of
indication of Education sleep

484
00:29:57,159 --> 00:30:01,110
remember back it was a I think it was
2005 some

485
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:04,409
great actually a ride he sold 8

486
00:30:04,409 --> 00:30:08,000
you able to break me because just need

487
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,289
the beliefs Ellefson some by

488
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:14,330
10 a.m. touring encryption the it leaves
at

489
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:19,179
value 0 so we can retrieve the key all
that's a part of that

490
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:23,179
and you can't break need it the pastor
is not strong enough

491
00:30:23,179 --> 00:30:26,250
boldly the and going to krissi001

492
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:29,440
pay how clever is it too Houston

493
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,380
already broken authentication scheme

494
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:36,649
for such a thing at the school

495
00:30:36,649 --> 00:30:39,880
this girl really says within these
potential applications we know that

496
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,090
leave this insecure

497
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:45,399
this is why we derive special key 56 you

498
00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:48,590
critical data in that infrastructure

499
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:52,480
but the me this new key

500
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,320
is based on the key that is delivered by
me sorry operating the

501
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,830
I have that the key for deriving

502
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:03,409
the new key and so I broken to get

503
00:31:03,409 --> 00:31:07,350
and this with again the question about
lead protocol the site

504
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:10,350
in the pain it said it

505
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,480
50p 50k its right to know

506
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,940
really easy manner and these PRF hunting
is the

507
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:20,200
a is the function defined in the
meanwhile bandits

508
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,370
operating key material

509
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:26,980
and you give these a password this is
the

510
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:30,200
so-called network session key which is
the right by Lee

511
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,480
and then you have some pics and some
ideas which I mean

512
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,720
nothing more than Mac oppresses and some

513
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,919
make arrests Hyatt getting on to switch
it

514
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,740
random numbers and you have to keep
secrets counter to ensure every time you

515
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,769
create a new key

516
00:31:46,769 --> 00:31:50,159
I'm doing Reiki met you get a new key

517
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,659
and then you get all that information to
the PI function at all

518
00:31:53,659 --> 00:31:57,440
comes here contract context transfer ke

519
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,840
with 32 died a blank that all

520
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,000
and I know that he's you don't

521
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,610
transmitted in cleartext so I had every

522
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:11,720
information I need to get that context
in fact to break

523
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,789
the the whole infrastructure so

524
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:18,120
the only thing is how do I get in there

525
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,409
all done all want to break who all

526
00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:24,559
we speaking by video city

527
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:29,429
and it's quite easy because these kind
of packages for authentication

528
00:32:29,429 --> 00:32:33,120
a European capsule 8 so just taken and
that

529
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,549
with 10 of the cables on on the net that
point

530
00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:40,090
and drive bring the whole network
segment and you will get

531
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:45,440
all devices which do speak W SEP

532
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,419
easy but hit me authentication scheme is

533
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:53,750
look like the the WTS late

534
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:57,240
or all the access points in a

535
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,460
WTS environment which are not moscow
authenticate against the mafia in that

536
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,510
environment

537
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:05,960
and the monster is just like Danny
already sold

538
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,130
it says the package you sent alternate I
think its height

539
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:12,399
second space to broadcast so you know
which

540
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:15,570
who is the mobster in take your

541
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:20,289
Queen authentication data and you know
what up this late

542
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:23,409
use initiate the authentication so

543
00:33:23,409 --> 00:33:26,490
there's only one thing that you need to
opt on the day

544
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:29,779
on the access point to get all that data
other than that particular

545
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:33,140
and guess what because these devices
goal will be to

546
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:37,090
up school so it's totally easy to get
that

547
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:40,659
you can get the and the NSK

548
00:33:40,659 --> 00:33:44,929
truly cricket that the grateful for that

549
00:33:44,929 --> 00:33:48,590
you get the 50k an effort after work

550
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:53,480
it's just you both could be the WTF late
newsday

551
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,260
the following no more by an old with
that mac Address

552
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:00,669
is roaming to make that point give me
the pair was masakane

553
00:34:00,669 --> 00:34:06,600
forty before the wireless interface that
which is established that no one told

554
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,720
and then access point will give it to
you because you at

555
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:14,220
that contact transfer K European that
you belong to the environment

556
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,609
but you do not and is broken

557
00:34:17,609 --> 00:34:21,000
so the end result is

558
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,480
you have week of indication

559
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,339
on infrastructure and if an attacker you
able to get

560
00:34:28,339 --> 00:34:32,710
every encryption key for wireless
transmitted date

561
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:36,349
for wireless transmitter traffic and get
all that date all of that

562
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:39,899
so why does is mean all the whole

563
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:43,010
infrastructure is not secured at that
moment you get

564
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:48,480
excess to the why its second open access
point

565
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,879
so calls we have a deal for that

566
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:56,240
to dunno takeover the

567
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,410
the mall an all that say the coal

568
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:04,420
jointly stopped at the point where you
have the TTK

569
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:08,190
because we say the rest it's like um

570
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:11,480
you want to talk to people and we don't
have to called

571
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,609
all up and ready that from when back in
it

572
00:35:15,609 --> 00:35:19,050
for and but we can show you we got the
CPK

573
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:22,230
between two devices so dunno it

574
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:26,240
building we need to disconnect 18 impact
point just the poor thing really

575
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:26,980
indication

576
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,839
and then need dated you could do
anything

577
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:34,109
acting texting are you can just do this

578
00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:37,670
why an taking out the a

579
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:41,589
WDS small then and just delivering

580
00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:45,910
day packets at all forget yourself mark
the

581
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:49,079
and after that exit points

582
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:52,460
Justin bold another order a

583
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:55,680
you yes then you got all the
authentication data

584
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,040
a different way with the of sporting
interests not for wanting

585
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,710
packet to see because that some people
out mechanism IP based

586
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:05,829
of opened on Paul call a packet where

587
00:36:05,829 --> 00:36:09,339
like two minute the connection between
this late animosity

588
00:36:09,339 --> 00:36:13,170
onto I'm still nothing fancy you have to
do

589
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:16,650
to drop these connecting official ways
to

590
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:19,740
blockade you okay still

591
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,260
with that and nipping and interfaces and

592
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:26,599
at the moment we won't see anything
because their Kb

593
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:30,630
and thinking and have a look at the
council

594
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:35,829
should see it

595
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:39,530
okay it just switch to send an opening

596
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,630
then they again song

597
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:46,030
there most disliked available

598
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:53,030
written like indicating a good

599
00:36:53,890 --> 00:37:00,890
thing

600
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,710
didn't at the field while when the
applications by

601
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:09,390
you with the and communication

602
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:16,390
popping up up

603
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,050
and

604
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:29,050
good

605
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,810
you

606
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:34,770
in master its I'm

607
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:41,180
consistently indication

608
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:48,180
a it still indicating

609
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:54,170
a strange only should cool thinking

610
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:57,529
okay it

611
00:37:57,529 --> 00:38:01,209
there is actually be a communication and
at the theater state

612
00:38:01,209 --> 00:38:05,339
we just than sniffed all in

613
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:08,829
to the reached request and rethink it

614
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:12,109
think we got all the material long or
and

615
00:38:12,109 --> 00:38:16,559
lead working with attack hopeful that we
just have to be

616
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:20,559
selecting a quiet day this best-prepared
work well with Bay

617
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:25,819
an matching past gate and wide at the
beginning of the parties to take time

618
00:38:25,819 --> 00:38:29,160
and then no reckons that

619
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:33,380
trekking day sleep at night at the
theatre body just

620
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,699
all the pathway which is a 123

621
00:38:36,699 --> 00:38:39,769
and ewwy and

622
00:38:39,769 --> 00:38:43,079
at the getting out there leap ethnic
this a

623
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:46,400
communication weekend says generate the
and it

624
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,109
K which is displayed and the body

625
00:38:50,109 --> 00:38:53,769
and want to get the Noke just need to do
the

626
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:57,799
an show on the repudiating

627
00:38:57,799 --> 00:39:01,519
running hey pointing and that and

628
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:05,339
do we get the ticket it miss key now is
to use

629
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:08,959
for like if you're on promoting excess
point another

630
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:12,299
the request for you that was my sticky

631
00:39:12,299 --> 00:39:15,729
will be encryptor an authenticated by
that he'd

632
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:19,249
we had that key we can don't in polls
we're

633
00:39:19,249 --> 00:39:23,249
what we are a ballot access point and of
course

634
00:39:23,249 --> 00:39:28,589
we have the picky itself to authenticate
against that infrastructure the weekend

635
00:39:28,589 --> 00:39:31,929
not only say like okay we stay in a man
in the middle of the

636
00:39:31,929 --> 00:39:36,589
can't participate with like own expense
point in that infrastructure all

637
00:39:36,589 --> 00:39:40,099
our own people software within that in
perspective said

638
00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:43,140
completely open for snow so

639
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:47,209
we get the band was not the key out we
get the we get way less traffic

640
00:39:47,209 --> 00:39:50,229
and then your vision for that too

641
00:39:50,229 --> 00:39:53,410
is like the you connect with your cable
to

642
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:56,489
the white side of the Internet by
unplugging and I P

643
00:39:56,489 --> 00:39:59,890
and it just get the

644
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:03,380
get about 50 K and then you to fade hit
me

645
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:07,199
me pat was not the key for the following
the

646
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:11,499
make it s Wireless mecca and I
automatically to trip the data

647
00:40:11,499 --> 00:40:15,059
of it maybe place it in a peek at what's
up like that shouldn't be that

648
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:18,359
shouldn't be that hard to place it in
the Peak Avenue kinda open it with

649
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:19,809
Wireshark interest nope

650
00:40:19,809 --> 00:40:22,869
into what the white

651
00:40:22,869 --> 00:40:26,660
motto of the mobile client the you on
the that interface

652
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:33,660
okay

653
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,800
hidden

654
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,020
goal an in

655
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,070
net interest for that they it's a reason

656
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:46,250
this environment what

657
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:49,810
or at all and build and back toward

658
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:53,390
and this is a security advisory wrong

659
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:56,570
what is it to to help the poor

660
00:40:56,570 --> 00:41:01,260
which that that was all for it default
username and Bell

661
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,950
the username and password within that
w/o

662
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:08,550
St device which made you

663
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:12,090
able to have complete control of the
device so

664
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:15,470
that you see that some from

665
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:20,510
missing parts for real the your for your
secure environment

666
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:24,870
which a which need to be in place just
to use it in a

667
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:28,350
incorporate passionate secure fashion so
we say

668
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:31,670
the this case generation is broke

669
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:35,100
maybe we don't have all the cold up for
showing entry

670
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:38,460
Iranian lied butter it's not a problem

671
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:42,230
the rest is just some but they
Corningware

672
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:47,690
but the the breaking it up completely
done song

673
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:50,860
after that we began to focus on the the

674
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:55,680
carrot generation and the so-called
fiscal Unified wireless Netgear

675
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,700
and the interesting parts in that
network

676
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,740
are so-called fiscal wireless control
system

677
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:05,830
which is some that's a

678
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:09,680
very blind spot briancon even the system

679
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,320
to control your whole wireless
infrastructure

680
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,430
and

681
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:19,960
called the these Whiteland controllers
and

682
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,230
excess points and big

683
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:26,630
different in in that infrastructure

684
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:29,690
is that the access point get Dom

685
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:33,440
and the on the coordination of wild

686
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,350
Alliance of indication of all but halted
all that stuff this

687
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:41,540
all done on the White House lawn
controllers itself so

688
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:46,460
you can imagine X excess point like
really allay a1

689
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:50,130
preach between the wired interface and
the wireless interface

690
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:54,080
sometimes this bridge that the crips not
packets sometimes not depends on your

691
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,530
configuration that

692
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:58,560
not much more the devices doing

693
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,930
goal and we set up this environment
because

694
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:06,500
with a this what part of the customer
brought take the

695
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,870
we gotta really big control all that we
get

696
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:12,920
the same access points we set up the
whole paying

697
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:18,300
and this was the first thing we stop
that

698
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:22,290
you see some traffic going from

699
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:25,660
and more or less on the client IP
address to

700
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:29,300
colonial I P broadcast using protocol

701
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,380
this lock stating involved the

702
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:37,590
all displaying the current day of
devices in that case access points

703
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:41,770
trying to authenticate against that in
fact check that take

704
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:44,880
bed it up cool it

705
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,270
transmitting this long in

706
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:51,940
away like this and this is like a oh I'm

707
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:56,980
a lot able to in to keeping my eye my
automated

708
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:00,190
automated discovery process honestly

709
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:04,110
you been you set up these devices in
their automatic discovery process

710
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:07,700
which should enable them to stated in

711
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:11,870
and have working environment including
just

712
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:16,230
this is like if you see stuff like that
it just ate

713
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:19,830
West the security in that in that and in
this environment

714
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:25,290
so if you think a little bit deeper

715
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:29,250
you come about you step over the
protocol FL

716
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:33,500
called Cup up and

717
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,770
what it is is this a UPPP based protocol

718
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:42,230
it encrypt it using data from TLS btls

719
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:45,310
which if nothing else like TLS WDP

720
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:48,550
ended uses certificates Paul

721
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:52,240
education itself like okay

722
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,550
why did the sand mechanism to secure
your data

723
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:59,400
and all security relevant data

724
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,550
is encryptor an authenticated using key
material

725
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:07,330
I'm derived in during that's the TLS

726
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:10,880
authentication with the certificates
full but they formed

727
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,840
the first point a few looks quite good

728
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,970
I messin

729
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:21,010
axes of course involved this goes

730
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:26,220
i think is going the way of designing
protocols and trying to reason that

731
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:26,990
mister

732
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:30,620
public protocol and the main

733
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:35,460
our thesis so for 118 a hockey ticket

734
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:40,140
a taxonomy for control and and
provisioning of wireless access point

735
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:43,350
and hours see if I for one 5

736
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:47,140
and controller provisioning wireless
access point spread

737
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:52,090
hope specification the summit to you
main hours the switch to

738
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:57,510
define couple and of course quite a lot
of up protocols involved

739
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:00,610
and that for automated

740
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:05,180
a of all the automated some

741
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:09,220
that DHCP involved even for access point

742
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:13,120
call to have why it was involved you
have a involved

743
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:17,120
the things like a syslog that this and
then he and I ate and

744
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:20,170
all what think this long

745
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:23,280
want political

746
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,100
gonna anyway and quite some protocols in
what is that

747
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:30,230
complex structure so

748
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:33,860
an the pain is man who really is that
the ball

749
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:36,880
what like reading this r/c just sees

750
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,120
things like 8 when you a couple

751
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:44,490
and you encapsulated Cup what you TP

752
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:47,930
only with i ke version for addresses

753
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:53,110
leave the IP check some feel at the role
because although why didn't like that

754
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:57,610
you repeat take some otherwise the
packets will be dropped

755
00:46:57,610 --> 00:47:01,550
what's that this is a text every day I
should economic package to

756
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:04,790
make sure that your information is
correct

757
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:09,440
so this is like a another being that
part of what we say

758
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,610
we really have to the it deeper into
that environment because nothing

759
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:19,850
really some point going wrong an

760
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:24,620
say in Indy today they determined that
protecting the couple practical detail

761
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:28,400
and even implemented got like a

762
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,420
and the reordering negative that look at
all that bad

763
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:38,630
and stuff like that for this protocol is
it's really really playing

764
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:42,040
yet so we just part about today

765
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:46,470
missed what quite in bed quite different
to the first generation

766
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:49,700
soul I'll attack perhaps Ali

767
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:53,730
on time and and look for it especially
about the

768
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:58,040
50 stuff is that okay what's this I'm
this is

769
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:01,450
even if it's documented in RFC with this
comes out of the

770
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:05,620
let's face it collapsed this convention
all that an

771
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:10,770
today we have all profit or stop did to
implement btls which is a

772
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:14,240
an artist on their did the implemented
themselves

773
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,970
did they use open like respond that for
example

774
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:21,160
it it like trees like a what may well as
you know

775
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:25,130
the OPP on the type to use is it
winnable called the protocol

776
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:29,760
if go with it like united visited remote
code execution whatever

777
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,490
and to Courtney question but on the
other hand

778
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:36,970
in encryption they you and

779
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:40,070
death certificates certificates are

780
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:43,210
to pick up the courts all I'm cut

781
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:47,230
you know that some questions like a
certificates is

782
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:50,310
displaying trapped between two entities
and

783
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:55,670
question is that whose trusting and who
says that these two entities contract

784
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:56,870
its a bit

785
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:59,980
if there was a like certification path

786
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:04,190
and all that stuff for certificates and
maybe things like a

787
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:08,930
that sayin relocation of certificates
which is it

788
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:12,280
widened part of all this is that okay I
interest you

789
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:16,260
just doesn't that work is it implement
the correct they're all that

790
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:19,430
so this will cost you 1 attack

791
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:23,090
and assessment I'm that will

792
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:26,460
need to be look at all soul and

793
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:30,250
the first thing is we looked at the
Sofitel unpacked the image in all that

794
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:31,190
stuff like a

795
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:35,010
okay on whether except for the mix just
let's see what

796
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:38,010
in that to second text strings on it and

797
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:42,380
resolved all ASCII strings and

798
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:45,880
in that long lineup ASCII string know
what need

799
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:49,200
include the critical

800
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,910
they use within the and the image access
point image itself

801
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:56,770
is open Excel based

802
00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:00,070
on Verizon the 0.97 be from

803
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:03,840
to of victory this is from an

804
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:08,000
really decent operetta excess point
image

805
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,380
is it you don't know is it packed

806
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:15,810
that it had one abilities if so and Ave

807
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:18,820
can exploit them on that that and
because it's not a

808
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:23,820
normal x86 like a policy that poem in
all that stuff

809
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:27,470
and the court did mate also be like

810
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:30,550
licensing issues and all that stuff at
this could hold up

811
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:34,150
okay back in 2003 as we're programming

812
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:37,200
initially program that thing weak
hearted

813
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,700
open SSL continue

814
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:45,210
add to that that could an and we had to
do some stuff like okay

815
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:49,490
it's not possible compatible the image
you have an access point and all that

816
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:50,220
stuff

817
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:54,080
so that quite some potential sport just
mistakes that

818
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:57,590
say like that that may be introduced
during

819
00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:01,160
application all that may not have beaten
peaks

820
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:04,920
and but and to leave the

821
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:08,780
holes indicate that point and
implementation up

822
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:12,750
still that's good for the certificates
the certificates Rs

823
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:18,440
there signed by the so-called COO
manufacturing CA

824
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:23,080
of the MIT and they are pre-installed on
expect point during

825
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:28,040
process of manufacture during you you
not able to overwrite the images

826
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:31,550
your not the you can read them all only

827
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:34,620
the public park the private key salt in
it

828
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:37,970
they say secure are real the excess
point all the

829
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:41,050
the flash drive we don't know this might
be some

830
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:44,830
interesting part 4 somebody who's
willing to revise and musical II

831
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:48,830
point access point but the interesting
heart is

832
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:53,000
that everything you buy has a
certificated which is signed by that the

833
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,120
eight

834
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:58,280
meaning if I take the Speck this access
point

835
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,730
and stick it into your wireless
environment

836
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:05,060
between be authenticated because fiscal
feel

837
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:08,370
across in to it its people

838
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:13,780
everything's good devices capable on at
successfully authenticate itself

839
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:19,300
into your environment as long as you
don't replace the second on the device

840
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:23,250
so misapplied of all quite funny imagine
like a

841
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:26,640
unblock an access point and like a
controller into it would complete

842
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,000
different configuration

843
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,410
complete different networks and I just

844
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:36,470
recreate you all wireless network from
wpa2

845
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:39,620
down to no encryption because that

846
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:43,640
locked in a control stuff like that

847
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:46,780
I'm so this is one thing was that okay

848
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:50,300
thing about the crossing behind that
that this is no

849
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,540
this is not a good decide if you track
every

850
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:57,570
hardware which come from Cisco your call
stress hot weather that

851
00:52:57,570 --> 00:53:03,170
and hacker country into your environment

852
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:06,450
and difficult and attacked again
management

853
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:11,180
people we found an MP which is enabled
by default

854
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:14,510
which has of course some people
configuration guess what

855
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:17,630
public-private conversion to see

856
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:21,350
or read and write access and the
complete call

857
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:24,740
communication between that wireless
controls to

858
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:27,990
which control to a complete
infrastructure

859
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:31,010
and Whiteland control which is

860
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:34,780
and the intelligent which is like had
OpenAccess

861
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:39,220
on the talent in part were the access
point communicates with

862
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:43,870
its all done yes and it P and I think
this is a good part for Daniel

863
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:47,940
to hand over because he's the classical
SNMP guy

864
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:51,790
and he will tell you a little bit mobile
that a good thing

865
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:55,570
and took a look all more we get them all
yeah okay

866
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:58,990
pick that up all about that very thing
presidents ripping into a pick up a

867
00:53:58,990 --> 00:53:59,790
small

868
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:02,800
okay and nothing special

869
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,440
hey I took a look at the at 9p and

870
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:09,780
all the Mitt behind exit points

871
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:13,030
a W the Selanne

872
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:17,430
their worst song had from all that
interesting

873
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:20,670
and values you could get all case warm
is and

874
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:24,780
yet been released Monday a gave
manufacturing date all

875
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:27,950
the ISTH think about and chill gazing
and

876
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:31,140
II that's good advice and it

877
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:34,390
alton page b2 identified

878
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:37,720
period a situation through the exit
point

879
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:42,400
so I can see the which while its client
is connected to reject this point

880
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,010
I get all the latest information a
goodly 3 information

881
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:49,640
and of the client an

882
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:53,730
ok well up the exit point feel I get all
the

883
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:57,010
a IP configuration of the exit point
itself

884
00:54:57,010 --> 00:55:00,420
and what that could be set why I think
you're right

885
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:05,010
exit King and I could just reconfigured
you at this point

886
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:08,430
my attending militias ethnic he
commanded

887
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:12,340
bTW healthy an

888
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:15,770
and the walls all kinda strange that in
the

889
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:19,200
and message information-based a

890
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,340
opal most ultimate still owned by

891
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:26,100
every space so you see the all those
products a

892
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:30,960
just all in and and that girl immigrated
to fiscal

893
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,650
an friend asleep you walk

894
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:37,900
with in a bit and you see them

895
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:41,870
them long strings by the way this a 4839

896
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:45,130
is every space and

897
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:48,230
kitty very reflected and rank

898
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:52,640
AP detected or anything about the truth
like

899
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,380
a linked only got think this is

900
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:59,720
actually who think they did in the

901
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:03,920
had as an MP met the truth commission
based

902
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,040
for all Latin ppl bleak you could just
read all all the

903
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:11,020
loading that the truth of you wht

904
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:17,030
and which in this case okay bill like
the information exported

905
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:21,140
an all told there is warned you idea

906
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:24,270
in the irish-based admitted which is
called

907
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:27,890
agent at 9p community name which in fact

908
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:32,520
is the community 3 configured and at 9p

909
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:35,640
still with all at the MP reject this

910
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:39,810
you could easily read all the S&P rights
community 3

911
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:43,450
its fifth level I don't think

912
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:47,140
and by the way it recreate

913
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:51,520
so if you got and right exit

914
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,870
3 gate a keep making basic

915
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:58,160
you could just an attached on you

916
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:03,400
red an 83 just be effected

917
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:07,540
an one more you could redoubled

918
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:11,190
all the name all and using

919
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:14,359
a twat and ok nopee admin

920
00:57:14,359 --> 00:57:17,780
on the EEOC unfortunately and

921
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:21,810
the path kid obfuscated by expires

922
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:25,210
you can't read all pass gate but

923
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:28,710
all there to be all 33 create

924
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:31,900
you could just create new admin using

925
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:35,130
and then we did this in all tests that

926
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:38,810
I just extending one ethnic peace at
command

927
00:57:38,810 --> 00:57:41,910
and getting in your local administrator
you

928
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:45,109
and by the way there local administrator
user is

929
00:57:45,109 --> 00:57:48,130
able to lock in on the web interface and
change

930
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:52,270
every configuration option like it
administrator should do so you have

931
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:57,510
it with one packet needed the whole
device

932
00:57:57,510 --> 00:58:01,910
okay and 33 an

933
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:05,650
K week and reset the password of an
existing using

934
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:09,780
bad as I just that UK create and you at
menu

935
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:13,390
yet only a local admin but also an admin
user

936
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:16,430
which got them more privileges a

937
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:19,510
on in a bit more about a can

938
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:24,280
a normally we go to the mall here by
showing you how easy it is to create and

939
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,350
yet music that we don't get the

940
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:29,990
a wht with a thing unfortunately we
can't

941
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:33,730
presented at: like believe it it's
really really the

942
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:38,000
just fire at Wally I think he said to
make set the right already is to use a

943
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,339
and it has made

944
00:58:39,339 --> 00:58:46,339
that then you thirty at me anti-roll

945
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:49,790
okay so long you can read me

946
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:53,500
K when I can I'm okay so

947
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:56,790
the thing is i mean this is ongoing
research met some topics we have to

948
00:58:56,790 --> 00:58:57,790
admit

949
00:58:57,790 --> 00:59:01,210
to look into but this whole saying
compact

950
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:05,510
haven't nearly of a dusty protocol

951
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:09,730
in there doctor call different purposes

952
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:13,589
that are configured to know let's aim
all that your way I'm

953
00:59:13,589 --> 00:59:17,040
of sometimes it even obscure way thing
about this is like paying

954
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,690
and this is default configuration if you
wanna hack

955
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:23,890
if you wanted disabled that you have to
enter as

956
00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:28,150
separates the slaughter got this look is
enabled by default

957
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:31,450
thought an and this get

958
00:59:31,450 --> 00:59:34,800
the deeper you dig the mall security get
nason

959
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:39,390
broken truck model in it with brings you
to the point that I can inject nearly

960
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:42,690
every Cisco hardware which belongs to
that generation

961
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:46,750
in and by the way the switch from the
second to the third generation is just

962
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:47,280
an image

963
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:51,460
upgrade so you can take off in the
second generation put a new image on it

964
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:56,240
and iPod before the party generations of
that enough heart valve that

965
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,940
and when that you can use to abusing

966
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:03,470
all that stop and of course they are

967
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:08,359
controls and and you can configure
nearly everything you can configure SNMP

968
01:00:08,359 --> 01:00:10,120
version 3

969
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:13,900
on everything why is you have six you
ought to

970
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:17,940
mechanisms in there like a shahal often
TSR

971
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:21,210
hasting and ATS in

972
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:25,260
encryption all that stuff but it all
disabled by default

973
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:28,460
and you know the more complex in an
environment get

974
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:31,710
thats time spent hardening

975
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:34,890
because every administrators happy that

976
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:38,520
bought environment self up and running
and that's what it's all about

977
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,200
availability

978
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:43,770
so I'm this one paula when we say hate

979
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:48,130
this is so complex that so many wrong
default configuration

980
01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:51,730
really if you try to use that you

981
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:55,230
think about it pics read the document
said think about that first look at

982
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:55,760
every

983
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:00,300
configuration option and think about it
first before deploying that thing

984
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:03,900
because it can really make you insecure
and don't forget

985
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:09,080
the basic network building plot like
segmentation and all that stuff because

986
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:09,940
if you

987
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:14,580
don't forget that and I we get to you
SNMP traffic

988
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:18,480
and you forget to use SNMP version free
because maybe your

989
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,819
fiscal works which does a monitoring

990
01:01:21,819 --> 01:01:25,080
to is not capable of doing it we got

991
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:28,630
we owe you always pain

992
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:31,890
and make it more or less insecure this
evening's

993
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:35,760
sometimes ways to break it and

994
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,550
my personal opinion is that if you look
deep into that scientific 8

995
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:43,020
I quite sure we able to break that too
because

996
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:46,850
verifying certificates is a cop is
really tough call

997
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:50,200
unit everybody says hey we do it every
day in have

998
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:53,980
all the time it's not easy so

999
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:58,370
if they let may be talking a hot here
may be here late

1000
01:01:58,370 --> 01:02:01,589
militia we are quite confident tell you
more

1001
01:02:01,589 --> 01:02:05,400
on that sony Mobile abilities and show
you more

1002
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,010
obscure things a on these environments

1003
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:13,100
and hopefully also get a break
generation to which will

1004
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:17,150
just at the moment other I'm that they'd
like that

1005
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:20,970
but it can it on the it's on the agenda

1006
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:27,280
so and any questions

1007
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:31,360
you want warm everybody's tired

1008
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:35,070
