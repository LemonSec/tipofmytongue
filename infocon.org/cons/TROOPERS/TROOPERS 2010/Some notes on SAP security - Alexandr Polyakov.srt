it

55
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:05,699
so and then they play about the

56
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,650
was about the solutions a

57
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:15,879
so you can you

58
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:20,889
things to make the product to you

59
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:24,830
station so it's very simple

60
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:31,830
maybe

61
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:39,060
if future

62
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,440
you are

63
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:48,460
can so to implement this

64
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:55,460
system security must okay

65
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:02,920
scared

66
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,250
very huge

67
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:14,190
area of the don't so just a

68
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:18,630
so and belief

69
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:22,440
maybe

70
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,610
you will about

71
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:31,320
this is the condition all

72
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:38,320
with okay

73
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,120
there are many a

74
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,340
different things you can understand the
and

75
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:54,340
different platforms about you can use

76
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:58,500
shower about you of

77
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:04,130
think a area brother

revision they have

79
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,610
different security features

80
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,229
so you can with the

81
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:20,260
occasions like you can

82
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,380
though if solution UNIX those

83
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,979
or the best the base

84
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:30,370
and the all these a

85
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:35,080
into sex so all this a things

86
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,909
a so you must all

87
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:42,120
sex to understand

88
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,459
all featured though

89
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:50,589
kinda that

90

most people know

91
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:01,420
both here what is real

92
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,860
okay let's will

93
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,520
a in the the security

94
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,959
from the I O I'm

95
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,529
basically transient

96
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:23,529
so we have where we can the

97
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,240
share this is weekend look

98
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,680
net or net weekend operation system

99
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,770
yeah I weekend or

100
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:42,450
tried hard the

101
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,980
clients to get access by

102
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:50,440
that then maybe then many

103
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:57,440
face

104
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,230
thumb problem I this problem

105
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:07,720
with encryption the you can

106
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,080
of course

107
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,580
health or four-week

108
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,370
eclipsing about the by default not
implemented so

109
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:26,540
problem me

110
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,750
problem the protocol

111
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:36,120
the 7

112
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,660
and the you can have the

113
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,210
problems proper fishing for example you

114
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:47,419
you don't

115
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:50,139
make netbooks this the

116
00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:55,679
users administrators there are many

117
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:59,209
protocols a that not group you can

118
00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:02,619
the bus at something like this

119
00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:05,889
make

120
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:09,139
another show

121
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:16,139
you can

122
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:24,509
the captures the SAP traffic if you are

123
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,040
just the

124
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,550
sample from one so

125
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:38,550
has

126
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:45,830
access to it excesses it's the exchange
infrastructure system the system

127
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,670
the have connections to different
recipes

128
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,529
so with its not storing the

129
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:59,399
business this about have connection and
the

130
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:06,399
these user weekend

131
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:18,330
see and use nations to another

132
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:22,090
simply while the choicest

133
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:25,580
Nationals so

134
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:32,580
force comment

135
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,110
example with with a simple 10

136
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:48,110
the there by the full

137
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:57,140
in the past this thing

138
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,140
weekend a we can use that are

139
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:14,140
arrested functions the

140
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:19,610
like out the those so you can remotely a

141
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:26,610
anything we have you

142
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,530
CPAC

143
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:35,820
a which many

144
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,160
companies focus

145
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:46,160
so with this

146
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:56,530
remote arabs the which

147
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:01,400
rise see a

148
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:08,400
data

149
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:17,020
okay week name while

150
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:37,590
hours

151
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:50,259
week and connect the credential

152
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:59,809
to our though it's war

153
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:06,809
walks only on the so

154
00:15:07,099 --> 00:15:10,489
our all

155
00:15:10,489 --> 00:15:17,489
kept from

156
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:23,719
which

157
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:30,719
if rock

158
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,720
so we'll for me you about the hedge

159
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,420
from them word up

160
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:47,420
only have the shows X

161
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,320
this

162
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:59,320
all because the for both

163
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:07,120
a publication cerro up

164
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,520
so we talk about their

165
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,250
operation we a

166
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,860
youth Ennio the operation his

167
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:24,860
the system problems many

168
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:38,160
many nations recipe files

169
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:47,410
access by

170
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:52,829
also we the problem operation system

00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:47,010
so we problems connection

182
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:52,320
me the

183
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,370
date your data and your bus for

184
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:02,070
can be stored

185
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,630
when we talk about it database security

186
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,750
a as operation system

187
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:12,740
all database

188
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,210
to problems so many problems

189
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,710
most up installation

190
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:23,370
Oracle Oracle Database

191
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,600
many a problems so

192
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,960
the mail the most like difficult
problems the

193
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:36,960
people

194
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:46,580
there are many buffer wealth you

195
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,899
get and

196
00:19:49,899 --> 00:19:56,899
mean problem option

197
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:11,920
attacks

198
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,480
remote oath

199
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,970
so

200
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,240
you this option I

201
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:27,240
database and you have the

202
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:35,070
to sever you have the user one user

203
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:40,080
while so the the same user

204
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,140
another seven and you can

205
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:50,130
out

206
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:57,130
database error with their credentials 1

207
00:21:03,969 --> 00:21:05,020
you

208
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:09,200
Heather option like a local
authentication

209
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,640
where you can connect database using

210
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:18,360
local cation this this of

211
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:25,350
justification you can local

212
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:29,620
this so to get remote database

213
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:36,620
goes

214
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,629
vacation

215
00:21:42,629 --> 00:21:45,980
check the race

216
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:52,980
though the

217
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:02,080
with right

218
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:07,390
because yes

219
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:14,390
and week

220
00:22:19,229 --> 00:22:21,070
problem

221
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:28,070
but restricted

222
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:41,090
so mania ish

223
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:46,379
a

224
00:22:46,379 --> 00:22:51,840
and the also we have me

225
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:58,840
just for right own

226
00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:07,460
I

227
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:14,460
the man

228
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:24,850
you can find all the possible
publication business bro

229
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:31,850
example of top 10

230
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,630
so the another example is

231
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:47,630
not you

232
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:00,440
install the connection some kind of
processor

233
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,630
with the

234
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:10,630
insider sources when you

235
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:19,750
configure the server the address them

236
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:27,050
and or

237
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:34,050
so

238
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:39,840
Ford in the next session a

239
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:46,840
and problem

240
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:52,930
contrite

241
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:57,630
you know

242
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:01,760
the bus for for

243
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,780
just guess the basic

244
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:08,490
vacation there is about

245
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:11,650
with no no is a blocking

246
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:18,650
up to the like

247
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,860
and the

248
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:30,860
the I all so there are many have
application and we

249
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:43,429
a our search about

250
00:25:43,429 --> 00:25:46,850
with that

251
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:53,850
a no published

252
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:57,210
send it to this the make

253
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:04,210
much

254
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:11,850
so

255
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:14,890
security

256
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:18,320
SAP cell

257
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:25,320
area over there

258
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,790
this business writer

259
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:33,160
a in

260
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:40,160
you

261
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:48,850
the

262
00:26:53,090 --> 00:27:00,090
US with

263
00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:08,830
for Best many

264
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:15,830
many people

265
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:18,830
yes

266
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:25,820
growth

267
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:32,820
all which bus for basically

268
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:40,990
changed many companies user

269
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:45,900
so

270
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:51,929
another have a

271
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:55,520
very complex molehill of

272
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,690
users

273
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:05,690
relations roles or so

274
00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:11,180
or

275
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,410
so Wayne all

276
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:20,410
being while profile

277
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:26,160
both

278
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,220
you as assess

279
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:33,090
check

280
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:40,090
all being and me

281
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:50,110
and user have or operations table

282
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:59,600
can with the

283
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:05,340
of so

284
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,590
there is ish a

285
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:15,590
magic's where you different Kenzo

286
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:23,100
access something

287
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:30,100
nations one user

288
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:42,560
don't

289
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,700
talk about

290
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,830
right

291
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:57,830
red talking videos

292
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:06,520
from both

293
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:11,990
does

294
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:18,490
are you weekend you can

295
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:25,490
yet axis that

296
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:35,690
nations 0 profile

297
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,650
okay

298
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,320
and

299
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,299
claims that if

300
00:30:57,299 --> 00:31:01,869
area I think mostly on

301
00:31:01,869 --> 00:31:08,869
hour

302
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,179
recipe is a skank

303
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:23,620
most-favored

304
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:30,620
other will

305
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:45,450
with occasion and the

306
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:50,150
main problem a example

307
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:56,120
I'm to viruses at updated magically and

308
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:02,340
Minnesota's where are the problems with
the

309
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:07,770
updating posted on

310
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:14,770
the problem with the SEP created

311
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:23,909
field the

312
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:30,909
a buffer overflow using this
vulnerability can

313
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:39,790
the

314
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:43,820
simple the

315
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,150
over the political a and this

316
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:54,150
started so

317
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,210
you and

318
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:05,690
the mall to be a all the IP address

319
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:09,429
the class company

320
00:33:09,429 --> 00:33:12,910
and basically in the companies

321
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:16,169
you have a about I'll

322
00:33:16,169 --> 00:33:20,010
0 the CPU so you

323
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:27,010
rage somebody botched

324
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:33,450
the next a

325
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:40,389
area hope lines ActiveX

326
00:33:40,389 --> 00:33:43,409
so with the

327
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:48,499
City agree program well

328
00:33:48,499 --> 00:33:52,129
ActiveX controls

329
00:33:52,129 --> 00:33:55,570
the but they actually have may have the

330
00:33:55,570 --> 00:34:02,570
different kind of so

331
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,290
everybody knows how to use 2x
vulnerabilities

332
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:11,590
for example can me the a

333
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:15,060
HTML page with include call

334
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,679
while little bit rebel 2x control

335
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:22,389
put it on the ASX error and then the

336
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:26,000
make email

337
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,290
to the

338
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:35,150
the people from the company's with the
link to the

339
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:39,440
to your a your side and when the

340
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,830
click on this link a X

341
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:48,970
control will activate and buffer
overflow

342
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:55,970
can give you access to the our client so
you can get

343
00:34:56,990 --> 00:35:02,830
the environment by social engineering

344
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:09,830
mix of social while

345
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:13,309
for the Phils buffer

346
00:35:13,309 --> 00:35:16,640
low-earth comp

347
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:23,640
worth

348
00:35:24,349 --> 00:35:31,349
three

349
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:35,440
while

350
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,670
fine

351
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:43,800
also

352
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:50,800
published

353
00:35:58,819 --> 00:36:02,720
the real problem

354
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,920
and the next think

355
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,269
the buffer overflow

356
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:17,650
all the security problem for the company
so

357
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:21,130
have the be solution like a CPU

358
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:26,559

ish which automatic tool

400
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:15,640
for the it plans occasion so

data from the a

407
00:41:38,869 --> 00:41:44,049
system tries to connect if this error

408
00:41:44,049 --> 00:41:48,880
collect all this data and the you opec

409
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,209
and

410
00:41:54,209 --> 00:42:00,749
you can anybody's

411
00:42:00,749 --> 00:42:07,449
hear about that spray like

412
00:42:07,449 --> 00:42:10,739
fifth

413
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:17,029
its prey so so you

414
00:42:17,029 --> 00:42:23,869
this you can were

415
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:28,329
a security

416
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:32,380
so we

417
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:36,019
right so-called

418
00:42:36,019 --> 00:42:39,279
and

419
00:42:39,279 --> 00:42:42,329
exploits or

420
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:46,349
s

421
00:42:46,349 --> 00:42:50,099
users nude export vessels

422
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:57,099
also

423
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:03,930
both

424
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:10,930
much all the public the mall

425
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:18,890
the you were youth

426
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:26,010
or but the latest

427
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:32,010
vessels sound 5 by the full

428
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:36,580
bit so you can't use this

429
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:43,580
and maybe

430
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:47,460
you find another ability can

431
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:54,460
cannot be a you

432
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:12,150
okay

433
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,330
so

434
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:20,150
you also can take plans you

435
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:23,270
which use the

436
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:28,800
a browser many

437
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,550
a it should be systems which

438
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:39,550
applies

439
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:48,840
can

440
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:59,240

relationship

444
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:35,470
there are many companies we have say

445
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:38,640

and the big problem address

459
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:05,990
you can a get

460
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:09,210
kooky you can't use it your

475
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:25,110
much now

476
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:31,500
with the

477
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:38,500
