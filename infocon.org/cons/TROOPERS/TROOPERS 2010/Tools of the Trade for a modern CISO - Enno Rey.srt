1
00:00:03,699 --> 00:00:04,170
the

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,240
title of this talk as tools of two
traits

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,059
home what a nice also see as those

4
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:20,059
a dose a kind of I'm sorry behind to
talk about this

5
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:27,420
lassie and about term something august's

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,050
la CI I was for several reasons I was
quite often Austria

7
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,590
and I have some contacts to

8
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,239
to saw the University in Austria and
they approach me like them

9
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:45,430
I okay an arm can you all we have a arm

10
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,620
a curriculum for information security
management

11
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,260
them move in that direction on can your
provider

12
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,210
say a free day all walks of one

13
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,239
I

14
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,270
say are roles and tasks and challenges
son what have all of

15
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,590
ISO some I i said well

16
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,869
I could probably do that us

17
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:15,220
my lot of my walk includes

18
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,340
solving nasa kind of from I call it to
insinuate a

19
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,570
so I'm seles are on to

20
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:26,340
to I saw this is something we i there
were some

21
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,729
several ISO psych consult to own a very
ongoing basis

22
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:34,580
like him I'll I we once in some

23
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:39,200
some weeks are reviewing documents are
providing and why some

24
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,920
terrorists on the line by women who are
pretty much every week I get something

25
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,200
on my desk like him

26
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,550
what's your opinion on this so can you
have a look at on this

27
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:52,130
so I know say there was a high sauce

28
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:56,470
what I think quite a lot so I i downside
yes I could probably do that

29
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,630
onstott that discussing

30
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:04,560
sadik potential contents of such an
curriculum on

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,810
on a possible level may never for me my
old friend Brian fy2

32
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,780
gave yesterday stock on are tossing
security

33
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,329
and who's the boss of the packet loss
and

34
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:20,660
he done came around some I mean he's
organizing another you went in in the US

35
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,489
and

36
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:28,190
he said all lesson once you have to
prepare to stuff anyway what about

37
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,750
giving a keynote on this

38
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:34,459
at the the US Conference I agree it's

39
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:37,690
on one you will see today is that exact
keynote

40
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:42,680
so compared to other presentations I
think giving in the past

41
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,500
which usually had some more or less
technical content or some

42
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,810
arm yeah let's say

43
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,480
some some structure are to somewhere you
have a

44
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,959
stuff that was prime spot at this one
might be a bit different

45
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:03,670
it was intended to be a keynote I'll

46
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:08,829
which it usually means it should be a a
bit thought-provoking not too technical

47
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:11,090
not too overloaded with stuff

48
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,209
and I saw I've done this I was some

49
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:18,489
approach several times when I discussed
this were from

50
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,530
I saw up colleagues at some level

51
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:24,709
I like cocoa could you give this again

52
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:28,810
on so true plus obviously it's an
opportunity to

53
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,299
if this again CX sector same stuff

54
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:35,540
no modifications since some essential

55
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,560
house what I think stayed more or less
the same

56
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,260
and I I put it in the afternoon of the
second day

57
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,079
as usually thats people get more relaxed
and

58
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:50,220
a I mean you can't hold attention

59
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,190
of taking high-level input a

60
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:58,290
in a foreign language for two days so it
seemed to him

61
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,840
having at this in the afternoon of the
second might be an idea

62
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,380
so enough Sat do not expect some

63
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,209
the same level of technical accuracy

64
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:12,510
that maybe other presentations are given
apostate

65
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,269
I skipped this I'll skip this

66
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:19,690
block there are so many free piece S&S

67
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:23,900
talk that s I discuss say that costs and
challenge us

68
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,050
be the past

69
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:31,520
tasks on it car and to all those on that
I see in the future

70
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,610
often I saw a alarm discuss

71
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,020
say what what is the role of a nice all
within an organization

72
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,759
as I think this has changed and I will
spice it up with some

73
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,270
references to movies I

74
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,759
from what I get many of you are mainly

75
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:52,680
say India the same H that I am

76
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,220
WEA no more 22-year-old Sudan so

77
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,860
you might know some of the movies some
the

78
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:05,440
might be part of the audience not being
present here who have no idea what what

79
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,650
kind of movie is that

80
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:10,150
so there were some some emotional well
you at the taco

81
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,169
which might even stimulate you up yeah
at that time

82
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:18,490
when I when I was young I was at movie
at the intended audience

83
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:23,509
obviously s as I cells that Desai I want
to kind of

84
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:27,840
I wouldn't even say I have a message to
deliver I'd say I

85
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,419
like 20 make your thoughts going on

86
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:34,580
body or olive in your organization and
the way

87
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,860
your you fulfill your daily Tosca and
maybe

88
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,919
I get some ideas so what could be a

89
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,069
all waste 2002 considered under

90
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:50,409
by elements to consider in the future
and I cystoscopy my

91
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:55,090
wetland congress talk I'll what I did
was a i

92
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,939
a contact at some ice also that I

93
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:02,550
no or no on slightly possible level

94
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:06,639
like okay done I am facing BDA

95
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,780
the task of preparing a talk on walk
from your focus back to

96
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:15,110
automate failed five main
responsibilities

97
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,240
I often I saw land I collected those

98
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,340
I put those together and those on a5
that are mainly

99
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:28,060
that the on with them most on

100
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,419
say points like number of citations:

101
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:35,650
that is a long time security strategy

102
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:39,219
creation of policies and guidelines risk
assessment

103
00:06:39,219 --> 00:06:44,229
analysis of security incidents on taking
care of compliance

104
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:48,999
this is a pretty common I'd say
description of what I saw

105
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:52,009
usually das what is interesting about
this

106
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:56,680
s a this is heavily say circulate at

107
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,319
around the let's say security space

108
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,770
which might not be surprising given I
saw stands for information security

109
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,400
officer

110
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,830
so obviously this possum has to deal
with security

111
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:12,060
sure admit it %uh still

112
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,849
on when Mike the two-man introduce
himself

113
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:21,259
us the head of application security and
to information security office i'd

114
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:24,550
at the I W I was tempted to at

115
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:29,150
that at the time when I have a save gave
him the responsibility the role of being

116
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,900
the other ISO the understanding

117
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,330
overnight so warsaw okay this possum

118
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,999
has to be a a some body like it

119
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:42,090
teria gonna send I'm I mean I'm

120
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:45,249
I'm not sure if this is the correct
translation into English

121
00:07:45,249 --> 00:07:50,569
likable the doc somebody who iz a
paranoid about security

122
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:54,610
and by being paranoid some about
security

123
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:59,110
balance assault biznass forgetting about
security

124
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,729
so you need a a bulldog on this site

125
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:07,849
I'll to a to have a say a balanced
living the overall organization

126
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:12,639
this was an a very commandant I
understanding of the role of a nice or

127
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,370
in at that sometimes and me

128
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,800
classifying this ass at sometimes means
I think this role

129
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,449
might have changed some I in the
meantime

130
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:29,539
mom I think that kind of how I
understand

131
00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:34,979
a and future I saw is so what i'll would
call on

132
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:38,750
and thus a Thomas the sunday weak point
by point wife item

133
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:43,460
across a business and Liza so not so
much as a bulldog

134
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:49,010
trying to are to correct was caught what
goes wrong security wise in the business

135
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,630
Walt

136
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,740
and someone who might

137
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,960
agreed that this role hasn't performed
so well in the past

138
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,100
are so it might be time for kind of

139
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,270
role adjustment in the sense of all I'm
I'm know what a bulldog I'm

140
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,610
I should be I should try to establish
myself as a

141
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:15,080
process lights um

142
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,339
this the say it just meant of

143
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:22,610
for a potential adjustment after all
often often I saw

144
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,880
a is some I mean they're worse

145
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,970
elements coming in which make this
adjustment

146
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,360
say maybe even haha that is so was

147
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,100
getting ever more complex

148
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,420
I'll their wrists stuff like outsourcing

149
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,100
on which at so some say contractor
complexity

150
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,360
think about the price of yesterday doors
new technology showing up

151
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,640
heavily are changing the picture of how
security a

152
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,310
all Aug heavily affecting say the
overall picture

153
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,380
security like what relation on

154
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,410
a there was limited we sauces and it
says

155
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,610
always be like that have limited
resources and it will

156
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,130
believe me about be so long

157
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:11,490
the SATs some spice to the challenge has
a nice oh might

158
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:16,200
face anyway and there is the Harry touch

159
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,040
of being say to spice to your own
organization

160
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,880
for a long time it's not like t.i so I
saw

161
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,770
most well you'd turn mosul of passing
within the organization

162
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:32,860
are to say it cautiously on

163
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,470
soul there were seven tests and this
challenge ass

164
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,190
have to be face on its arm

165
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:45,430
not even easy to face them given the the
role

166
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:49,500
I and DNA match that business might now
for fun

167
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,960
of a nice on what i'd saying

168
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,060
charm makes some al amounts of job often
I saw

169
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:01,460
rds.a a sudden persistence

170
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:05,960
so if you don't have to if you're not a
pup has a certain type of guy

171
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,960
you might not be qualified to be nice
all on it's a job that

172
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,770
week why are some constantly going into
battle

173
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:19,180
that's and battles that are all

174
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,510
quite a number of them might get lost to
some degree year so on

175
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:28,920
having some persons house it absolutely
hot summers and the business

176
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,400
on that s what I think a key requirement

177
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,880
for one and I saw the ball the doc at
the time

178
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,110
obviously I'm given he was powerful

179
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:44,960
organization arm had some maybe to
dispose of some

180
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,220
knowledge of the business but it was
some at a time it was a

181
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,560
know we gotta take a key qualification
for being a good I saw

182
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,860
about it was regarded like okay this one
has to be our

183
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:02,230
someone who knows about security and
hoot carries to bed now security

184
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:06,080
and thereby balances out to stuff from I
think I'll

185
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,500
knowing I'll business walks and then

186
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,280
prying I mean again this is so I'll

187
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,270
not that new but them a trying to add to
our

188
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,960
allying business and security

189
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:26,110
this %uh some what are Izabella

190
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:30,440
elementary part of a nice life and again
this is

191
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,920
not that use of all for you I

192
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,330
and yeah although this is one of the
movies by the way

193
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:41,810
on who who recognizes which movie is
that

194
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:45,590
yet taxi driver are and there is a
famous scene on

195
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,700
I mean doesn't many famous scenes in
taxi driver but

196
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:53,750
some argue might know that some he's
kind of our

197
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,690
I what's his name in the movie on Travis

198
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:02,380
arm Travis s kinda preparing for its
mission for its job going out safe to

199
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,570
walk

200
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:08,170
any talks with Mara a resume famous
email he's there with a crazy

201
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:11,460
expression on his face like talking to
me

202
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:15,200
Outlook email are have a look at the
issue you what you will find

203
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,630
that one on he goes he he's on a mission

204
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:22,430
and it kind of goes postal orders
mission

205
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,860
and yet this might happen to a nicer as
well on

206
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,060
but are Arteta get

207
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:33,640
law seriously I think there were three

208
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,770
peace S I'd like to to bring on the
table today that assess a technology and

209
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,650
technological change us

210
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,760
communication until Sun sound

211
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,150
assay mindset so mental attitude often

212
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:50,440
of a nicer to what some his mission and

213
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,110
this job for asphalt technology

214
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:57,630
again this is a loose collection of
thoughts there was no

215
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:01,390
by was stricter structure a in it I'd
like to

216
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:05,090
mention free things I see going on of

217
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:08,310
if we things I we got some

218
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:13,900
maybe in parking for nicer to understand
that's what I call the house of security

219
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,230
on that s the chanting changing Fred
landscape

220
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,490
anti evaporation of network-based
controls

221
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:25,000
i gay for some of the those of you who
have fun

222
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,210
seen my troopers king of last year all
with

223
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:32,340
recognize some slight said happy news
before

224
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:37,130
this is one of those this is what we
call the house up security at

225
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:40,620
on think about it doesn't I saw

226
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,560
%uh sitting on this on this task

227
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,320
and della sua like security control its

228
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,820
all like a firewalls and antivirus on
policies sound

229
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,820
maybe some process us and

230
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,960
one of the year say approach

231
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,130
us 2002 well to rate

232
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:09,140
they don't walk ought to understand the
on lock could be like to classify all

233
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:09,970
the

234
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,710
all the elements all the instruments
contributing to security

235
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:17,550
and discuss education can be done in two
major ways

236
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,640
other foster that I'm not going to
tackle is the one number

237
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:26,590
preventative stuff the to Texas stuff
and we action stop

238
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:30,540
arm and usually I

239
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:35,370
a money spent on prevention is better
than money spent on detection reaction

240
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:39,400
but that left be cites another approach

241
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,220
of classifying all the components

242
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,510
components not just mean products of

243
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:51,060
tactic the peace S but process is a
swell of guidelines

244
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,660
on all the pieces contributing six to
security

245
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:59,150
can be on in move in some
classifications scheme

246
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:03,140
been broken down broken down to
components

247
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:07,480
file on sandy Weisz whatever stuff that
you buy products

248
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,780
second I what I call implementation

249
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,080
holiday stuff buy something

250
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,430
put it into your environment

251
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:21,180
I am hoping at to somehow to contribute
to our

252
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,350
on security and operations how you
operate

253
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,480
the stuff within your environment

254
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,760
and from those free say pale ass

255
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,130
and in the end of the day already

256
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:38,910
will have to to get some security

257
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,680
on and implementation can even be split
into

258
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,300
say two pieces like to sign an
architecture

259
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,960
and configuration how you assemble the
peace S

260
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,270
for made products coming in box us

261
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:59,990
all your net for this belt how these
pieces are brought into the network

262
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:03,670
and how those pieces are configured from
these p

263
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,740
free pilus arm

264
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:12,089
ought to look to maintain to their arse
we saw says need it

265
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:15,620
I usually for of all components is money

266
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,650
for this I type of

267
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:22,630
first of its some FTEs

268
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:26,140
unfortunately it so looks like this

269
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:31,090
I and I'll what i'd like 20

270
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:34,309
delivers a message from the slide

271
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:37,480
usually

272
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,860
organizations to some degree focus on
one of the

273
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,280
safe repair Las I in the US

274
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,980
there are so strong there are set so
called best of wat

275
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,309
approach large US organizations

276
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:55,600
a look at it got no we part so who's in
the Magic Quadrant all we have a

277
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,419
security problem to solve

278
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:01,200
by this I'll get one of the freemen
dozen

279
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,919
I'll that I and got us Magic Quadrant

280
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:08,019
a let them pay for 5 Kos

281
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:11,690
there now with a ship crews and arm

282
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:16,429
than decide on what to spend a huge
amount of money

283
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:20,200
arm of all for some

284
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,830
components a plus associate at
maintenance

285
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:28,419
contracts are not sure if this works out

286
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:32,740
there was a other organizations which
put a very strong

287
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,030
perspective fun

288
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,390
say this one aware you have to

289
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:43,620
say on the Golem all fall forms to be
filled out

290
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,710
a and some background checks on whatever
our

291
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,510
a to get access to assist some and then
this access as

292
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:54,710
implemented but %uh not abut

293
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,780
still they think they are secure so they
have a strong

294
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,830
element of from what they call

295
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:04,880
all what call operational security
understanding

296
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,290
that there are three pillars trying to
figure out okay in my organization

297
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:16,240
we mentally focused on this one or that
one on this one I

298
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,390
might help to get a better understanding
of our house security Watson Dr

299
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:24,110
on organization in general as a rule of
thumb

300
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:28,550
spending we sauces here the URL

301
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:32,410
a Manowar spend he usually

302
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:35,810
will fund your mileage might vary I

303
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:39,010
contributes launcher security at than
the

304
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:42,060
a unit spent here

305
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,100
again willful um

306
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,350
but the think about just spending money

307
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:53,210
here are bringing on I mean this is so
we're quite some amount

308
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:57,060
of Jesus band on it's good to

309
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,690
half security in this space but some in
the end of the day

310
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:03,970
Iran WV perform a lot of a security
assessments

311
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:07,530
the Securities say holds the findings

312
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,680
we stumble across usually are located
this

313
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:15,930
space it's not like a the ass a a good
fight was in place it's not like they

314
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,810
have been configured correctly

315
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:21,920
when the they went into operation 12
months ago

316
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,480
but today I rule number for

317
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,950
487 as a are

318
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:32,860
kind of a allow any any 4 side neck
network segments

319
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:36,030
and this means that we saw sales went up
band

320
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:40,130
the right place so this house a security
a

321
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:43,860
might be a some approach

322
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,890
to get an idea how security is some

323
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:53,380
I strive for in your own organization a
second thing

324
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:58,160
again citing from my last year's keynote
Asus one on that the changing

325
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,580
Fred landscape Indl

326
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:05,840
all that data some degree malicious code
guidance system

327
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,750
awful ISA long by missing Pacha

328
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:13,080
a diss has changed to a large degree and
this is

329
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,560
absolutely no on nothing new I'm telling
you here

330
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,440
are what happens in the meantime Asus on
their way to use a is

331
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,840
saw I involved and arm

332
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,070
the user performs lots of functions were

333
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:31,700
by means of a browse our mate line and
as well as i hasa

334
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:36,120
all kinds of additional functionality is
I

335
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,690
and locating at say

336
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:42,940
I'm off on that security incidents
Condrey

337
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:47,030
in a sufficiently large organization I'd
say

338
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:51,710
75 eighty maybe eighty five percent

339
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:55,980
Brian I'm not sure what your perception
s

340
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,910
I what put them into this I

341
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:03,560
into this space are so this is a space

342
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:08,970
remember limited we saw sus limited we
saw so self repair Las

343
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:12,280
and a mission to make the water secure

344
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,840
ma secure placed otherwise of the
organization

345
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,300
this definitely as: I

346
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,270
the stuff you have to focus on currently
as for technologies

347
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:30,270
arm if I'm everyone sign some weeks I
have a discussion about

348
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,590
this and

349
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,600
a I use a time like a way for

350
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,590
a if area a come out right on the
roundout I had three vicious

351
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:46,860
disabling XY I would be one of my wish
us

352
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,820
usually I get out okay what's the other
two on overall

353
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,640
I mainly to us we are to far over onto
the set afire

354
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,300
over there say depending on for my speak
to

355
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:02,310
but those five I'm name them at some
point the friendly

356
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:06,570
during the presentation on pretty much

357
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:09,690
status a min and one of dollars says saw

358
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:14,750
I this aiming de vise grips and Acrobat
Reader

359
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:18,250
which hassle-free

360
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:21,740
think I Ali I mentioned thing what a
business

361
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,750
there has to be a line the business I'm
currently a

362
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:29,810
I'm in the technological space if that
harry turned up when I had some wish us

363
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,820
in the technological space

364
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:37,830
like down to increase the level security
disabling JavaScript what be

365
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:42,920
this is one of those are getting way to
win the CDI is another one

366
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:47,230
no one eats that that has been therefore

367
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:51,310
10 years ago following disappointing in
the days of possible pointing

368
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:57,760
know what any pretty much no one in its
a GTI and TDI accounts for

369
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:03,900
Heights a6 si VI critical Connell other
liabilities and Windows since some

370
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,530
in the last 24 months so does the
component sitting around

371
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,540
know what he needs which assets every
year

372
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:15,500
armed security problems us okay without
this will

373
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:20,770
immediately I'd say increase lot
decrease the overall

374
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:25,140
%uh level of fun security

375
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,230
are an ailing DP

376
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:33,030
would be not a one I mean does up this
stuff is from the time when I get to get

377
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:33,820
the keynote

378
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,400
but this stuff is so we covering I could
have fought founder

379
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,410
a similar I

380
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:44,470
one in the in the February edition of
Microsoft patch day and

381
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:47,630
a deal with this year had this always so
many

382
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:51,650
stuff in both way to and flash its it's
easy to find

383
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:56,480
such a piece as well on so we are eager
to get your free

384
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,350
on the other two after the talk

385
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:04,360
are this is simple stuff

386
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,910
but some given the con tread landscape
I'd like to

387
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:13,560
this is my personal mission to on
delivered a message

388
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,880
they're worse it's not about buying

389
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,180
XY set I D S IPS

390
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:24,450
are d-pa whatever kind of inner product
space

391
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:28,220
it's simple things that can greatly

392
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:33,060
a increase security and to these are
some of those

393
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:36,100
of thought point and it technology space
s

394
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:40,300
there s what I call a evaporation of
network-based controllers

395
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:44,270
in times of our con la chance staff from

396
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:47,720
the growing together offer was lies
Asian

397
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,840
of maybe put putting things into the
clout

398
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,990
the traditional approach of

399
00:25:54,990 --> 00:26:00,100
network segmentation of filtering at at
same network come

400
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,910
upon us this this approach

401
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:09,440
which I've mean preaching for many many
years I'm in my and my pa some

402
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,890
I'm a security guy a yeah I'm sorry I'm
a network guy I have a better a

403
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:17,060
background in networking I have a
background in that have operations I've

404
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,120
been working in

405
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,120
lots carry environments are I have been

406
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,980
singing the tune of all you have to
second-guess to fill it up for many

407
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,010
years and

408
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:31,700
I kind of cool I still do but I have to
recognize

409
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,910
that this stuff for in in the currently

410
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:38,110
on growing ma Jing

411
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:41,270
watchful eyes so walt's on

412
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:44,370
doesn't make sense too much anymore
which some

413
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,450
again possibly this house as I I'm
network I

414
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:51,890
but what idea consequence some

415
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:55,770
there are side of security control its
that gain importance

416
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:59,110
that is so mostly what I call the host
hardening

417
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:03,240
are so hot ending of entities host
doesn't does not necessarily mean a

418
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,190
physical holes

419
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:08,170
but my dolly the as well i mean that was
a machine

420
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:11,990
but a look at the entities processing
date are

421
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:15,720
and try to increase their security level
as they have nobody out so

422
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,220
to rely on in the old days one could
rely on OK testify a 101 day life

423
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,790
sitting in a in a dedicated

424
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:26,370
segment arm not everything can get into
here

425
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:29,390
the state's elvira PS

426
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:32,390
might be responsible for your own
security

427
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:35,770
and encryption my play a large role

428
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:39,360
think about a whole cloud discussion
I'll

429
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,550
what can you do on a national level once
a day doesn't clout

430
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:46,600
nothing you can try to encrypt a which
brings in new problems

431
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:51,330
like a so that easy to such databases
that I'd quit and stuff but

432
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:54,560
some I'll

433
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:59,850
decir a slight shift of control its from
the network level to us a system-level

434
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:03,750
whatever system means atom but about a
moment might mean in the pic

435
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,290
cation are some some some box

436
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:10,590
be at wasabi be it physical

437
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:14,520
so to summarize his first piece
operations is key

438
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,620
take care of operations prevention pace

439
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:22,750
prevention mean some ton of
functionalities

440
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:27,429
on that you might not need I have from
going to this discussion so many times

441
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:27,970
and

442
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:31,630
I love it tired of it still I like to
discussion

443
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:35,400
or get you shouldn't have Flash and
suddenly most people in the room

444
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,640
would agree but your business needs it

445
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,280
up okay if is in its at we have to
understand business that was one of my

446
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,020
past my such a southern

447
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:49,740
be de flash stale whenever I have the
opportunity

448
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:53,540
I I tell you the frat landscape is
changing

449
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:57,630
and stuff like flash this is dangerous
stuff

450
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:01,770
if you can get rid of it so be it but be
have error

451
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:05,250
that if you cut could get rid of it and
beat

452
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,700
Justin say sup departments a subpart

453
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,700
with the diminished at the frat expose
it to

454
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:17,820
logically a second communication tools

455
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:22,450
again and for the last time no I I
inform you that this is a loose

456
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,840
collection of things some

457
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,900
I just want to bring up again some some
mids are some elements somewhat

458
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:33,270
what you show it and lot of Eli cyl

459
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:36,690
I saw several already practice some of
the stuff for

460
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,910
anyway I'll just so what I think

461
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:43,320
arm given that initial moment

462
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,700
for to talk a lot showed a nice so today
sigh so

463
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,890
are we consider what should to: she know

464
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:54,090
and think of from salomon

465
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:59,020
understand who s the money I mean this
is as again it's a simple thing

466
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:02,150
but I obviously

467
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:06,070
are the approach of being a baller doc

468
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:09,370
within your organization doesn't walk
anymore

469
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:13,040
arm I mean you you might %uh still
approach that

470
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:17,910
a was so so far law a practice that
approach but nobody will listen to your

471
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:18,900
business will do

472
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,920
what business wants to do anyway I

473
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,740
maybe your have good luck in the San
Siro

474
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:31,710
there's an a governance instrument like
a risk it sat down and saw that

475
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:35,570
cause a lot a lot on your desk like okay
the Swiss government business ask me all

476
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:37,820
they have a policy violation

477
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:41,170
year okay other less followers this up
except on Sun

478
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:44,380
so everything's months you have to get
it I was like oh said the

479
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:50,440
analysis %uh firm se me to get it up you
at now now it is OK baby prolong atom

480
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,880
and a than the might come out

481
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,580
appoint a little you come maybe you had
you can to save prolong

482
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:02,260
the risk that separates us more than say
24 months

483
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:07,140
a but then something else happened so I
it's named a bit differently arts are

484
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:11,740
I it's some gets a second chance even
high on the hierarchy level

485
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:16,530
aughts its just paper on a fun anyway

486
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:21,880
I so you have to have a release if you
want to get your mission accomplished

487
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,340
you have to have at least within your
organization

488
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:28,730
on I ass simple ass assaults

489
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:33,130
my experience some try to understand

490
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:36,700
so who has money all with power-law

491
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,950
and with money who you might Katze

492
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:43,210
say into some millions of the quality
guys

493
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:46,410
said they might have been a funding and
you and

494
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:50,670
I somehow come of laws your mission with
their mission

495
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:54,320
I try to find out where to get funding
for your

496
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,200
for your mission I and who have

497
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,890
even if the SAR early as this you might
have not had to a

498
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:06,440
in the past some don't going to fly to
country

499
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:11,070
their wrists faces are not some

500
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:14,270
are there was flights technologies you

501
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:17,610
content have it I

502
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:21,640
regardless how hard you try I think
about BlackBerry's

503
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,850
think about what yeah

504
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:29,940
maybe on suddenly on the stand for it
some

505
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,140
are what make sense a fight and wet
doesn't make sense

506
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:37,760
some and if terrorists are if it doesn't
make sense some

507
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,200
don't don't try that this this isa

508
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,530
ass sad as this might sound for for my
first moment

509
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:49,050
on this is an otherwise some I was
suddenly gif

510
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,650
those people into and University cause

511
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:56,000
like okay if you are

512
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,860
don't be naive there will be fights you
Conklin

513
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:05,280
don't spend your energy up

514
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,740
policies on

515
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:16,660
remembered its life where I had us one
of the tasks of my soul writing policies

516
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:22,470
in quite a number of organisations the
dusts it's not like there's 1i saw

517
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:27,230
who performs lot of tasks and writes a
policies

518
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:32,900
himself them I P divisional I saw some
likely I so so contrary I saw

519
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,790
all this and they do not why the
policies

520
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:41,790
there are some maybe some group for at
the CES although department or

521
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:46,870
I if things some all the nice in Assam
way is they said

522
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:49,960
somewhere in compliance and

523
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,000
compliance upon whatever law arm

524
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,340
if you have not written them yourself

525
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:01,200
establish a line of contact the policy
people

526
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,800
you will most probably is tom brokaw
situations

527
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,880
again if you'd not not what number South
year a

528
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,990
you had a policy you know it by heart
maybe i shud i sell

529
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:17,109
but there are some discusses coming up
if some behavior of business

530
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:21,820
is aligned with policy and then you have
arm

531
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:27,390
a stuff like cum policy mandating for
strong authentication

532
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:31,390
strong authentication for Preval sxs so
what does it mean what a strong

533
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:32,669
authentication

534
00:34:32,669 --> 00:34:36,850
and are there are cases where this is
defined in the policies

535
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:40,100
just quite some cases where this is
Marty find what this means what it what

536
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,489
a strong authentication

537
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:44,810
does it necessarily mean two factor
authentication

538
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:48,740
I'll what are those factors us are two

539
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:54,030
say different pass what some not good
enough farm

540
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:57,700
are too packed us %uh to pass what's a
factor some

541
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,030
so if there is something in the policy
like a strong locational

542
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:04,510
a strong authentication populist access
arm

543
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:08,070
you have to understand what it means
especially in a situation when you're

544
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:12,660
get menu unwilling to chop it's not like
a organizations not disposing of

545
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,480
policies right now

546
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,520
but think of our arm 30-year-old pason

547
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:24,020
authority fire farm who wassup promoted
to be and I saw

548
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:27,960
on divisional I saw I mean in that

549
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,650
say space of from 500 to 5000 use all
annotations

550
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:36,650
yes they'll plenty of them who don't
even have a nice all

551
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:40,820
but they will I say should have one bead
only for compliance we sense and then

552
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:44,580
some money from mobile network security
appear

553
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:48,430
I high-quality all that lies named the I
saw

554
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:51,580
asahi this POS inherits a policy

555
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:55,600
try to find out what is meant

556
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:00,990
I if from there was classes like this in
the policy and this happens very often

557
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:05,390
in case you write them yourself in case
you still have TV

558
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:09,820
position and Tosca writing policies sup
of business

559
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:13,470
this some most important point even

560
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:16,970
thought this might sound process
security people like him

561
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:20,210
oh wait a we we surrender

562
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:24,900
we we say our love their business at the
those all enemies son now that

563
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:29,520
while later I have to write a policy is
not to control them to steer them

564
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:35,820
but to support them a believe me I've
seen so many things are

565
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,839
sup of business you won't get out of
your position

566
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,480
as a bulldog nobody listens store up

567
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,670
if you do not change your mindset to a
mindset that is not

568
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:52,140
I'm at the fight all say the the
approach of fun

569
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:56,520
his policies his business and his people
behaving

570
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,570
and now policies come in and have a

571
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:03,370
controlling impact and what's get better
this is naive

572
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:06,960
this has been an understanding of policy
of yes sir

573
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,620
2002-2005 this does not walk

574
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:14,690
so we have to find not a model and the
other one s

575
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:19,200
maybe sadly but it is what it is. yes
business and in the end of the day been

576
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,170
as winds

577
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:24,859
so change your mindset to one that s
okay I understand

578
00:37:24,859 --> 00:37:30,170
I'm on a fight some on the last
possession

579
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:33,420
I can still try to pursue my mission but

580
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,460
I must support business and this should
be

581
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:41,100
saying that we're loading in the in the
arm mental attitude is policy is

582
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:46,319
as written where which might mean to
provide some flexibility

583
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,460
I you can still be a precise like
prescribing

584
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:54,160
very end the watering arm

585
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:59,690
stuff like strong authentication must be
you list

586
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:04,530
on if this is feasible for the
organization and air from

587
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:09,290
people can find out what us strong
authentication mean

588
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:13,150
and if they have a a parson ideally you

589
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:18,450
to approach I okay we want to implement
this or that some

590
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:22,470
I'll technology a this user some

591
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:27,030
a weapon to face the authentication is
done by on a pin it on

592
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:31,230
this is good enough s what's wrong with
authentication or isn't it

593
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:35,240
arm they should not decide on their own

594
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,819
they should no who to ask

595
00:38:38,819 --> 00:38:42,589
you are maybe some other departments are
women the organization

596
00:38:42,589 --> 00:38:46,120
and went to our ask I think some point
within the project

597
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:51,160
this is a setting you have to be a arm
trying to prescribe how the white

598
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,060
behaves by policies

599
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:57,800
that'll another thing come when talking
about

600
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,920
talking about policies are

601
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,750
there was some business while change
dress

602
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:08,920
us whole while change us and their arse
are more and more

603
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:13,330
things like john Lynch us corporations

604
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:16,990
I large corporations

605
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:20,400
buying smaller ones selling longer
industry

606
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,780
operations all this kind of stuff there
are smaller and more business partners

607
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,230
or more like stun parties

608
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:32,930
try when again you in a position of
writing policy I just in policy

609
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:36,940
try always to I'll

610
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:40,130
say we consider this perspective

611
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:44,080
writing whatever kind of from policy or
guidance you want to provide

612
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,940
Joss looking at all these %uh my user us

613
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:51,580
might be shot side the soyuz us but

614
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:55,910
the next day somebody turns out it turns
out there was a joint venture with from

615
00:39:55,910 --> 00:40:00,839
I'll some company in the Emirates like
the example i gave yesterday

616
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:05,060
to I those passes will have access to
your sister

617
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:08,109
to to some degree I

618
00:40:08,109 --> 00:40:11,859
to develop a new product out to make a
lot of money this is what business wants

619
00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:17,700
are take my twice try always to think
about what this about

620
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:22,430
Extang parties coming into my
organizational into my network

621
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:27,380
this is a perspective growing have a
more important

622
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:31,600
lastly in the essay to its escape from

623
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:36,170
to a spacer it's all about or scan the
end of today

624
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:40,720
%uh so honestly I already said it
yesterday I I can understand how any I

625
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,940
saw si ESO can walk without

626
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:47,020
say it will perform so hot water
efficiently without

627
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:50,740
wis.-based some who space approach

628
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:54,430
in every day decisions a soul one

629
00:40:54,430 --> 00:41:00,230
should have fun some influence from and
so wat whisk

630
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:04,930
which I summarize as for a second
section

631
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:08,780
find their ideal lease on the stand one

632
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:14,230
your mission is lost some from the way
first moment

633
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:18,130
there was some a changing role of
policies

634
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:22,400
were in the overall implementation of
security and was placed

635
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:28,550
plays a major role thought part mindset
and approach

636
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:32,339
arm this one this kind of

637
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:35,420
repetition when I had earlier be able to
take punch

638
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:40,020
us thus if you

639
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:44,830
are you don't have I say personality and
mindsets

640
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:47,990
that some able to do so

641
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:51,430
you should to maybe I saw the best shop

642
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:55,069
for you on the wall

643
00:41:55,069 --> 00:41:59,100
this one is some more important and to
some degree

644
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:06,100
associate thats to that angle of
business

645
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:10,730
you might recall from those of you who
have been present my yesterday's talk

646
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:14,080
on director risk assessment

647
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:18,220
I mention that case %uh DVR we've abroad
and

648
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:22,160
to perform their up a risk assessment
are and the

649
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,760
heart was a soft open discussion

650
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,150
were the that project

651
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:33,670
as I call it now I argued with for okay
we can for

652
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:38,290
size safer 325 million US dollars a year

653
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:41,350
on the security people the Bulldogs

654
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:44,680
well-liked 0 wat we can do this saw

655
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,640
this will arm %uh just the sky will fall

656
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,300
on and that will be my lover I want to
all

657
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:55,390
corporate assets will be a ex post

658
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:59,550
just talking about this you can
certainly understand

659
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:03,740
are which of those parties have my
sympathy

660
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:08,100
which s believe me but just may be funny

661
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:12,510
are some ways you might my time funny I
feel secure doing security since 97

662
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:16,880
I love what I do

663
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,089
I for family and I'm doing some spots
but besides this

664
00:43:21,089 --> 00:43:25,260
pretty much everything I do in my life
some as we dated to

665
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:28,770
security I do this and let everyday
level I have been

666
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:31,890
one of the Bulldogs in the all the time

667
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:35,069
so it's a it might sound crazy seen this
possum

668
00:43:35,069 --> 00:43:39,930
Collaroy I'll who is a security guy

669
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:43,960
and having sympathy for business %ah
being about cost savings

670
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:49,910
and making fun of of the Bulldogs still
this is part of my pasta line Inc of

671
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:53,620
the Bulldog approach doesn't walk any
longer

672
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:57,870
I'll you you will lose South the fights
anyway

673
00:43:57,870 --> 00:44:01,240
soul try to adjust your mindset

674
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:05,260
from I'll

675
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:08,710
some action so we take

676
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:12,350
hot told us we place bets of tokens all

677
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:16,589
that this might mean was a falling out
that everything will break we will have

678
00:44:16,589 --> 00:44:17,560
a tax on

679
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:21,310
to I'll we will get out of mocca

680
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:24,430
to a mindset that this okay

681
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:27,480
on suddenly there might be some

682
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:31,480
impact on the security arm

683
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,650
on some aspects of security try to find
out which

684
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:38,450
this is again by the way do you want to
risk assessment will come in

685
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:43,850
but some obviously changing something

686
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:47,710
technology and architects are a contract
the modding

687
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:51,260
a model of operating I T I will f

688
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:56,000
Atlanta chess and this is one such as:
we a security people in the past

689
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,170
has been used to understand just

690
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:03,600
ought to focus on a disadvantage us what
can go wrong

691
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,710
about the risk definition

692
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:11,430
um I kind of gave yesterday all that is
using it for a sec

693
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:15,430
is usually a can cause harm risk
something

694
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:19,600
oh and yes where that late so negative
impact to harm

695
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:24,210
which is completely conto rear to the
understanding of risks a natural

696
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:25,690
language

697
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:30,339
and and German we have that time like
and physical forty going to name our

698
00:45:30,339 --> 00:45:33,460
a risk in that case is not

699
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:37,670
it's not a bad thing and he's all he is
a cool guy he takes risks

700
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:42,970
to which some call it together which
whatever our up to got to them of polled

701
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:43,750
by swimming

702
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:47,650
tools runs the whole what about and
that's a positive outcome

703
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:51,200
try to understand that what happens

704
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:56,819
might have positive outcome and Mike
even have positive outcome on security

705
00:45:56,819 --> 00:46:00,350
getting rid of hot opens sup

706
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:03,490
suddenly I I'm cautious okay

707
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:07,770
I take might increase some attacks %uh
face

708
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:11,220
but might at the same time free a lot of

709
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:14,390
are we saw service

710
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:17,980
needed for operation so far are

711
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:22,140
those of you who have been sayin
inflatable operations

712
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:26,609
I in a sufficiently large organization
you will know that

713
00:46:26,609 --> 00:46:29,850
there is some

714
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:34,280
given a certain size of an organization
there was one ft E

715
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,319
that s dealing everyday somehow us

716
00:46:37,319 --> 00:46:40,450
with hot topics of it has been at a time

717
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:45,080
got that up but the hot helping sell
which had lost which had to a place

718
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,770
which I'll the same can all this

719
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:52,089
so a technological change might have
this atlanta just but might have

720
00:46:52,089 --> 00:46:53,400
advantage us

721
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:58,020
try to adjust still mental attitude not
just from looking at risks

722
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:03,000
things causing harm but maybe things
having positive outcome

723
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,930
which is perfectly a depicted in this

724
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:10,140
some are described in this

725
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:13,210
a piece I took from one of the main

726
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:17,460
I books on risk i John Adams

727
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:21,180
whisker certainly II week away reading
it

728
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:25,990
it's not the it's not about it for a sec
risk what was once an hour

729
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:30,130
and I he describes the situation of old
people not leaving the house

730
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:34,390
us as some might fall fall slipping on
ice

731
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:38,400
are which obviously it would you assess
the risk

732
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,300
but still not being able to leave the
house anymore

733
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:46,640
takes quite some say life quality

734
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,890
away from that so it whiting risks

735
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:54,450
I might mean you miss opportunities and
this a SWAT

736
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:57,560
I i want to the Picts assists our

737
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,680
again try to adjust a mental attitude

738
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:05,410
some thought at a value of trust on

739
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:10,230
some love you already know this stuff of
contra dance

740
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:13,880
which I described like being able to
sleep while

741
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:17,350
up being built on to sauce

742
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:22,670
that distrust in control on

743
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:28,740
if I want to if i living in Hollis Rd in
my capacity of sleeping well of feeling

744
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:32,280
cozy warm and safe might depend on

745
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:37,470
a decision that goes like al-qaeda so
this is a friendly neighborhood some

746
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:42,000
on I'm far away are from bat

747
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,140
a create just some things anyway so that
I don't have to lock my door I I don't

748
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:49,420
even need a lock at a doll

749
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,960
banda de sus this is trust I

750
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,650
obviously I could be paranoid like I
laughed a lot my house and they are any

751
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:57,839
defense and

752
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:02,210
II needa motion sends on all this

753
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:05,620
on these elements of control both

754
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:10,060
might some contribute to the fact that I
sleep well to some degree

755
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:14,720
problemas you can control everything
your we saw some limited to you have to

756
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:15,540
trust

757
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:18,900
some were you just have to figure out

758
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:22,890
we have to trust them not to control and
the ball doctype

759
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:26,390
10 store to use controllers all we have
to

760
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:30,040
control it is we have to bring the same
you might know term

761
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,450
I have a different stance or something
so them price I would be hot soccer

762
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:38,900
to today armed you have to trust some
well

763
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:42,580
soul we got crossed as a good instrument

764
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:47,870
it's not just about controlling on Monte
tarring and putting

765
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:51,520
we saw sis into is so immense

766
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,580
try to understand where you can apply
control

767
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:59,089
over you can apply trust so again this
is about a mental attitude

768
00:49:59,089 --> 00:50:04,020
term there are situations where you can
trust our situations way

769
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:08,339
contrast on and you might need some
control saw at least

770
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:12,220
trust might not be applicable way of
handling the situation

771
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:17,790
but understand this in the end of the
day I should be confidence

772
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:21,600
are confident sleeping well not only in
the past

773
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:25,089
level but a saying have a climate

774
00:50:25,089 --> 00:50:29,240
our farm of productivity within a given
organization

775
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:32,650
and this is saw sauce from two sauces
trust

776
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:36,859
and control not just focus on this one
and this costs money discuss operational

777
00:50:36,859 --> 00:50:38,010
