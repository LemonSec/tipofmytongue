1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,819
he okay

2
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:09,040
hey again very warm welcome to the wanna
go to track

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,679
at to this country and the this one

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:16,670
is the a tech Trek say and UTC

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,840
a lot of interesting stock adult how to
break thing

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,920
had to take all the staff and

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,449
a hopefully yet a lefty like sergei

8
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:31,539
suggested in his keynote today and how
to make things better and more secure

9
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:36,239
we stacked and the Tech Track weeks i
think im really really interesting topic

10
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,020
presented by red Nike and me some and
they take care

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,520
ants a I think you left to break some
kind of security appliance and

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,530
a he didn't expect with Netscreen
solviva tremendous paulk

13
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,629
about possibilities an how to compromise

14
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:57,969
he's kind of security devices and the

15
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:02,539
that are normally balked and to make
your network more securing

16
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:05,549
let EXT really secure network

17
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,860
okay great please going thank you
introduction Michael

18
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,990
I'm yesterday and talking by that

19
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,080
neck screens by Dena Potter I'm also

20
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,259
just a couple weeks ago I've sent a
FortiGate by an

21
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:22,189
right fight because in with your cell an
appt for you

22
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:26,049
I'm some new stuff that mean released a
public before

23
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:29,689
about it Fortinet FortiGate appliances
as well

24
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:34,799
so I'm one being stalked by

25
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,259
in quite as much detail just because I
haven't had any discussions before 10

26
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:38,579
a.m.

27
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:41,880
but on win it all all be revealed

28
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,310
so I'm a penetration tester security
researcher

29
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,149
originally from Scotland and I live in
New Zealand as a fat

30
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:55,329
I'll be talking about equipment by Dena
Potter and

31
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:58,350
fortunate both sell these

32
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,850
network security appliances all in one

33
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,829
firewalls routers still the wide area
network BP and its

34
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:09,500
I basically edge security devices I

35
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,569
which I would assume hopefully

36
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:17,010
are secure and a second anti-trust you
can hopefully trust them

37
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:24,010
I'm likely that really what they're
selling so my wrist shot from skoo

38
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,580
work we were doing for a client I we
were recommending me any security

39
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,310
measures

40
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,290
to do with the management and access to
their these

41
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,830
kinda age security devices in particular
next screen

42
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:42,910
5400 which are large tell Kuske ill

43
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,849
gigabit fiber interfaces limiting way to
a networking

44
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:49,930
a globally for them I

45
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,660
their main security measure Wallace

46
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,800
I i mean had my networking

47
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,780
segmented all but there the real task
was that they wear

48
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,120
regularly auditing the configuration
files as an all these devices

49
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,620
as the offering system and then there's
configuration of the device which is

50
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,459
stored separately

51
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:14,060
and that so they were regularly taking
them off the devices in order thing them

52
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,019
because they felt that

53
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:18,620
that if anyone was doing something
malicious

54
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,480
there's really no way to avoid changing
the configuration file

55
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,930
to you that United try and make traffic
we didn't want it to go basically any

56
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,129
attack me felt would be

57
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:34,040
in the configuration file soul we really
sad to see where they are and that was

58
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,459
true

59
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:38,090
on whether there's any way of having
proper hadn't

60
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,760
control the device actively and we can't
or Trojan

61
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,450
to within a lead to control and I i
showing up in the configuration

62
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,340
so that you know you're only thing the
config you don't know I'm there

63
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:54,549
and i spose the at the main approach

64
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:57,849
blow a different cuz most I need as
devices are not

65
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:01,189
remotely accessible over the Internet
publicly

66
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:04,420
or even from said networks by the people
who own them

67
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,470
I and certainly shouldn't be there

68
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,510
the Bunbury he said services and

69
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,360
often their only accessible by trusted
PSN for example

70
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,540
BGP your way to a networking protocols

71
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,549
I'm so really felt the

72
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:24,840
trying to find relax plates on these
might be interesting but

73
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,720
wouldn't have been very useful and I
really felt threat was much more to do

74
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,160
with

75
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,979
that I'm on a single man may find a bone
ability in them

76
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:36,449
and that's one one threat but
third-party support

77
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:39,650
I is a big issue obviously you gonna
another party

78
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:44,070
today to manage these devices I'm the
supplier the device

79
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,389
if I can somehow any control the device
maybe I can sell it to you before

80
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:52,000
you know I'm pre-install before before
you see that

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,900
I and also that mister social
engineering attack or malicious

82
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,509
employees

83
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:01,530
I'm so getting someone to install
something on the device

84
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:05,150
they don't know what it's doing I'm

85
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,190
so does the real threats and I was a

86
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,520
letter travel to using

87
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,100
so all talk about that to really then
approaches

88
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,610
modification and where on to do things

89
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,130
no not visible in the configuration and
I'll talk about

90
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:28,130
obtaining the farm where mass
engineering at and that

91
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:31,180
are giving a damn or all an the next
screen

92
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,820
and also the the FortiGate each other
said

93
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:39,440
I'm no one seen yet so should get

94
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,039
just that by gunmen experience at all in
one viable VP and you everything

95
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:44,990
security appliance

96
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:49,110
at this is the small one obviously for
small business

97
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,750
and only up these and if people hundreds

98
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,419
the all on the same operating system no
called HBOS which is close source

99
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:00,710
this misapplied USA at hundred-acre

100
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,789
on from my blog an

101
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:06,940
they are the next means enemy of Common
Criteria

102
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,000
except to fight give you a warm fuzzy
feeling and I'll

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,160
mentioned something about that as well

104
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,990
the FortiGate I'm yesterday they are
also

105
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,440
on packing factor might as well

106
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,060
they neck screens I'm stoller the at

107
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,090
the one at here we can go to des moines
its para pc

108
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,400
risk group Sr and as the allotment basis
for you

109
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:38,400
your console web lesson stuff

110
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,699
when it comes to attacking them where
not really at

111
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:48,000
two approaches I'm often they will
supply

112
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,120
a debugging stub on the machine

113
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,590
and you can connect with a client
oversee line

114
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,630
I the other approaches to try and obtain

115
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,979
farm where I Andy since nothing by now
sits on a

116
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:07,000
using dissembling hex editor obviously
advantage in the debugger running live

117
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,060
has the any

118
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,639
protections on the farm where encryption
mopus cation compression they will be

119
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,870
dealt with an issue

120
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,539
loading in memory on potentiation LTP
stumble memory

121
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:21,380
which would give you the former a

122
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,669
so I I to both these by side on the
Juniper

123
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:30,690
and just amusement park PC I hadn't done
any para pc before I started

124
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:34,020
looking at the Juniper I I backs

125
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,699
quite that an ex-employee obviously this
process is less instructions

126
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:43,090
and FX construction site at four bytes
flat memory model

127
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,629
I'm societies it's all quite nice and

128
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:49,789
be easier almost an x86 I'm

129
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:54,550
the only issue is see the documentation
you have to be to the

130
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:58,759
ibn PPC 45 embedded processor core user
manual which is

131
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:02,210
that a good bet on me

132
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:06,910
right here in like that can happen and
your

133
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:10,770
so the other problem at all with the air

134
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:15,080
the light debugging using gdb upside on
any para pc boxes

135
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,270
so as the embedded Linux development kit
1982 decline

136
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:24,590
compiled for 50 PCT you can run on your
your xxx client

137
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,740
I do have any source so I but scraped

138
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,599
and some cuss and I gd:na files

139
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,870
and so I can look at the BBC registers

140
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:40,469
the and stack which is based on to
register by the ball on PPC

141
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:44,070
I and so I made one that

142
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:47,290
my mash and getting back nine is on xxx
I'm

143
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,950
piece of thanks a lot many little
messenger news I there

144
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,830
I'm cya try to make myself a little in a
file that would give me a sense of taste

145
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:55,300
like

146
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,250
context by my bro am is fairly
straightforward be

147
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,290
you can IC line connect the network
cable

148
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:06,140
on an extremely long and you run say gdb
enable and then you should be able to

149
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,070
connect to be a steal console

150
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,140
and debug to your heart's content

151
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:14,860
I'm unfortunately didn't quite work like
that

152
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,899
and memory dumps I could do

153
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:21,330
and although very very slow for this
year line and

154
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,760
I quickly memory addresses bad I could
never get break pointing are

155
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,250
single stepping to actually work for me
I

156
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:33,310
I'm still not really sure when it's that
spry customization dddd stuff they have

157
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,839
on the next screen devices

158
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,970
I'm just limited to

159
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,089
to why can't do in

160
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:48,709
so me that was left with that static
analysis

161
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:52,300
so we went and bought a.m. Slovakia

162
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,440
became a customer juniper a client

163
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,450
20 recline you cannot log into the
website

164
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:02,050
and I'm download bastions of

165
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:06,140
somewhere specific your device and
sybase be logged on and got

166
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:10,130
all possible passions a farm where that
would that look up on my device away

167
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:10,860
from

168
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,950
way back in action forced to find

169
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:18,839
I'm and that his passion sex as well

170
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:22,720
and when you at

171
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,890
when you look at the farm where in a hex
editor it's basically

172
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:29,000
you know that some structure myspace
they just a bunch in

173
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,329
a bunch of stuff Munchen bites I'm

174
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:35,570
but by comparing many passions on it I'm

175
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,610
you can start to see a pattern

176
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:43,579
looking for Strings that kind of thing
so this is the

177
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:46,700
the rock structure that that comes out
and I there is a

178
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,029
he had a fairly small had a which has
some

179
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:54,240
magic signature bytes in the beginning
I'm has some other bites which appear to

180
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,740
be about

181
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:00,459
system mashin some system information

182
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:05,890
the same field relate to the signees all
the the compressed image

183
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,990
as a check some there's a

184
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:12,200
must so that's that stub as well and

185
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,010
sec second stage load up and then
there's a vast majority at the bottom

186
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,560
nationally to scale

187
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:22,510
this compressed blog but I'll call Bob
it clear that binary update la plus

188
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,769
that appears to be where all their the
code is

189
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:29,529
for the yet for the screen OS that runs
on the Juniper

190
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:32,640
I'm now the stub

191
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,470
that some say what accesses the binary
blob

192
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:40,660
unzips unencrypted that lever is doing
and loads up

193
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,029
so looking at that I could see the
strings and their

194
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:47,470
nearly 80 else and I'm a compression

195
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,620
an slow no bashing sex actually use geez
at

196
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,240
on but this national by I was looking at

197
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,180
by on device these Dells enemy

198
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,760
so that's my first nine point I haven't
a clue there that

199
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,500
that there's obviously something to do
with bells and im a compression going on

200
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,700
so mystery animal utilities for
al-haramain

201
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,910
so i download those in running through
the then against the compressed blog

202
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:19,010
but that nothing really worked I'm

203
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:22,120
night in one of the court at my own
nails and MA cuz I'm naturally quite

204
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,040
lazy

205
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,610
and I played make mistakes and

206
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,060
so this is really where

207
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,200
again comparing the different farm where
passions I

208
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,290
and now since it in a way that the court
I'm in terms of breaking this device

209
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:41,230
late I and eventually I discovered

210
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,519
that sack what they've done is

211
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,720
they the usual that in a compression and
then a mass

212
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,730
with the first few bites which are the

213
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:55,190
the Al Thani header he well tell you
what yells at him a

214
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:59,279
blog as cell standard Els enemy had a
had Sam

215
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,950
three fields and options field they can
decide an uncompressed size

216
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,110
I'm the Netscreen but had a as

217
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:12,889
the fields as well and a slightly
different I nearly signature bytes

218
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:16,130
they have the options they have a
dictionary sites that have no

219
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,399
uncompressed sites

220
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,839
am but knowing that allows you to you
that

221
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,230
to modify header and therefore
uncompressed

222
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,670
so that's why did II coyote the

223
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:33,120
blog from the main farm where

224
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,690
I I can then and sapped just an extended
to an uncompressed size

225
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:41,120
field in -1 which is unknown that's
allowed

226
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,610
by Dales enemy specification and

227
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:48,040
again though some playing around here
had to modify the dictionary seis

228
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,600
I am ike cats come about you

229
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,199
guess what buzzing reading out enemy
spec and they're not lies

230
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:59,220
maiti decompressing standard Els enemy

231
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,800
utilities so way so no encryption

232
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,579
and basically obfuscated compression

233
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:13,579
his head at protecting their close
source operating system and really

234
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:18,300
not difficult not on thank consuming

235
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,360
a little bit annoying and kinda painful
but

236
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,499
not difficult so then the next step is

237
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:30,790
can I compressed something back up and
sent it back into the farm where

238
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,870
and then load up on the device ask for
stage

239
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:37,720
and yes I can me compress

240
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,899
the at the blog I can change one bite

241
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:45,230
one bit beacon press et modified to take
a site back

242
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,899
and delete the uncompressed site feel
take bites were

243
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:54,649
and satin original firmware file Sun
estate and

244
00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:57,689
I can run affectively

245
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:01,430
untrusted code on the next screen device

246
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:06,199
so I said he said and security

247
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:09,290
to do with that computability and trust

248
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,889
and I think here you're at a stage where
economy trust

249
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:16,009
what's running on that device because I
can taking off

250
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:19,720
I can change it put it back on am

251
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,809
and yes so over this year line

252
00:15:22,809 --> 00:15:26,379
I can't modify a the binary screen OS

253
00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:30,309
I could at a change code or data we
compress it

254
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:33,680
trip and the original better which has
the stub

255
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,910
and the signature bites all that stuff
and then re upload it over the seal

256
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,610
console

257
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:43,740
on the device on at this stage

258
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,029
the and also supplies a web interface am

259
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,379
which allows you to load up from where
from web console

260
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:53,550
and i cant T to do that at this stage

261
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,889
and there was an additional check some
check going on on

262
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:00,589
and I'll all address that later on so
the state I couldn't quite do that

263
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:07,589
at we'll talk about that in a minute I'm

264
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:13,880
so no and remembering that my goal is
heading control

265
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,370
that these devices on just just a note
the

266
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:21,530
on another possible attack

267
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:25,880
even though I am doing the uploader
rescue

268
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,890
console I still need a network
connection and the farm where is loaded

269
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,630
up on the device select the FTP

270
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:35,090
as a plane thanks for the call so than
potential

271
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,450
and police like in the control where the
devices are in the

272
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:42,610
in the network the snow potential than
for me to actually modify not firmly on

273
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,170
the wire

274
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,330
and you'll see later on that the changes
I make personal small

275
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:53,330
that in that probably wouldn't pose a
great problem

276
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,170
so sad to get into my at my aim is

277
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:01,820
having controlled the device I really
neat analyze this binary that got

278
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,189
so the uncompressed blog soul

279
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:08,689
this end up being a bite 20 megabytes
Anna

280
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:12,160
and again there's that looking at lots
and land

281
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,610
cycle through all the formats and
uncompressed the mall again there's a

282
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:17,929
header with some

283
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:21,569
magic bites and while these like an
office address

284
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:25,850
some other stuff going on I'm I want to
load it up into

285
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:28,919
a deep and December so ida

286
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:33,940
I will depo PCP on minutes and I know in
binary format

287
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,830
soul I need to find out and miss the way
the program entry point as

288
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:42,910
so looking at the head of I am is a
fairly obvious

289
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:47,790
of senate dressing nap subtracting knows

290
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,660
I cannot then one of the uses a the
remote debugger that actually work I can

291
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,400
confirm that light be bugging so

292
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,190
I can look at that that entry point
address and

293
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:00,919
check that's where executions started on
the device

294
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:05,919
and such great I can load up and died
and I don't stop my sis and like my

295
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:06,600
analysis

296
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,929
so again

297
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:13,370
I don't tell me though at this stage
what's called for state at

298
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:17,169
I so I need to make some scripts

299
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:21,809
define punch in Prolog smartness code
I'm sacks for strings and a

300
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:26,160
sections by market which better which so
again if any time consuming process but

301
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,580
not not hugely difficult I

302
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:34,400
some finished a poor techniques using
our strings

303
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,480
to try and identify functions of an hour
single Talib you

304
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,860
you know error and read final

305
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,900
function miss can I think so a lot among
the

306
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,040
the code you can start to what I was
doing it. build a pic of weapons as it

307
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,270
becomes clear unclear

308
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:52,470
and in such fire there this comments he
functions

309
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,059
I'm to do with strains and by reason
pyrites

310
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:59,760
looking for login from looking

311
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,950
fire you know loading farm where all
these gonna all is going to help you

312
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:05,720
build up a picture

313
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,840
and again a fairly simple flight

314
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,409
image here but you end up in a header

315
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:16,900
the code the data section and then more
interestingly

316
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,390
and you discover that they loader as
part the firmware

317
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:26,880
I'm so it seems that to modify to change
the butler

318
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,030
only need to do is upload a new firmware
image and when it boots

319
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:33,630
it will also change the boot loader for
you code and data

320
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:38,919
so I will become more important later on
again a at

321
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:43,390
useful as an attacker and whole bunch of
other stuff

322
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:47,480
and sabes he's

323
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:54,480
I'm or quench thing

324
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:01,910
so for me am a Trojan

325
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:05,100
screen last to run XP really had 3

326
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,300
three main functions I need to do I
wanted to be able to

327
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,389
that install or upgrade a farm where at
over our

328
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,840
any the interface is the Cedar Hill the
web console

329
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,710
I want people to maintain access so
anything can a backdoor organ

330
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:26,810
and I also crucially want to build tech
ski object code so I want to be able to

331
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:30,440
inject code into the farm where I me
compressor

332
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,110
upload and be able to execute that way
runs aspect

333
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:39,400
say what most you know rootkits it if if
I want my botnet

334
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,310
Juniper Netscreen devices those does the
dirty things I need

335
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:46,820
I so the stage I

336
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,870
I'm ABC modifications are all just on
way

337
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:54,800
there I just bankrupt assembly what got
the opcodes

338
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,590
I nan:nan is a hex editor it would be
Catholic possible to

339
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:03,610
obviously right to let me do this for
you I don't even want to die

340
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:08,710
a you actually like writing we'll attack
killed so

341
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:14,030
the first one and install upgrade I

342
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:17,050
said I can upload the co-counsel but

343
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:21,120
when I try to upload over the web
console I'll get checks on their

344
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,100
and it wouldn't do it so I'm looking
ahead are you can

345
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:30,300
very clearly see to check some I've got
the distance and layoffs you know ask so

346
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:30,900
I could

347
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,080
go through that I could find to check
some all grinning like an ass and you

348
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,280
need to add a kid and

349
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,710
break XO myron running against my
modified

350
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:44,270
code but and I realized that when I try
to load up

351
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:47,840
a image with the wrong check some a
print side

352
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,040
at on the serial console I'm

353
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,280
a check some value the bad check some
value so obviously its campaigning

354
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,180
what it thanks to check some should be
with the bad one that actually in the

355
00:21:59,180 --> 00:21:59,760
farm where

356
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,070
printing at a bad one so at some point
thinking well

357
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,640
it's already what that could check some
for me so why I just make a farm where

358
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,560
instead of printing out the bad check
some prince I

359
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,750
the good check some I don't have a check
some calculator I can netload my

360
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,440
modified firmware again

361
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,730
I can abuse the device look at my and

362
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:24,080
my modified form I know County watch
economic should be

363
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,140
I'm cell that's what I did and

364
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,560
analogy to then load modified images via
the web interface

365
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,490
so and again a a little as wanna

366
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:38,780
the she said he was talking about using
code that's already there

367
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:43,550
I'm I got my own you know it would have
taken longer I may have made mistakes

368
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:47,550
and and also this way even if they
change the checks on all gun

369
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:51,640
and it's always gonna work so no matter
how complex it gets

370
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,710
I'm if they're printing out to the
console any aris

371
00:22:54,710 --> 00:23:00,170
then I can use that and that turns out
to be

372
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,600
fairly straightforward so here's the

373
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,850
at the PC s/n: way for the para pc
assembly for I'm

374
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,900
in the first couple lines there

375
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,280
its loading at a check something to
register for

376
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,100
register three contains the yet
calculate at some

377
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:21,300
at and he just looked down to the botnet
as a friend to console lane

378
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,300
where register for is printed to the
console

379
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,470
so I just need to change that at

380
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:30,880
the third line but the bronte people
whine which jumped away

381
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,220
and everything's good I just change that
to that

382
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:37,650
below drenched the internet before and
then and now

383
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:42,150
and I was the the for you know this form
I won't load any firmware

384
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:45,790
at all happily print typed at the check
some value I need

385
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,860
a trivial changing trivial

386
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,420
much less work i'm happy

387
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:56,170
so second

388
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:59,710
thanks allocate maintaining access so
this is where I need

389
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:03,240
to that and you can go back to login
this is key

390
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,430
this is Sam this is really what I want
am

391
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:10,590
again Vasant viewing the

392
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:14,870
the code looking at the code in a
disassembler

393
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:19,360
after some time I can see that fuel
console town that

394
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,170
web an SSH the all compare password
hashes

395
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:27,400
so in the configuration the next screen
the

396
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:32,270
password hash is stored on the password
until the

397
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:36,050
yet spin class compared ashes so when
you enter your password

398
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:39,180
ashes up in memory and exit the config
it's got competitive

399
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:42,810
ashes just nice and no passwords
actually stored just the hash

400
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:46,040
I'm as you'd expect the only the same
function

401
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:50,160
I also SSH will fall back

402
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,040
password and cation if the kinda supply
key

403
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:59,660
unless explicitly disable it something
to think about harding's devices

404
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:05,050
you know disable functionality don't
want again it can be abused

405
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:10,120
I we discover that day one bit patch
provide a login with any password

406
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,650
if you valid username and to be honest
getting a valid user names such as admin

407
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:18,330
or route or administrator it's at

408
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:22,360
it's not particularly difficult I

409
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,730
soul one bit one back in the cold so
this is paying like cat

410
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:30,460
1990s can have their you know cracking
shareware

411
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,860
on where people really don't understand

412
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:38,530
what you could do with X editors at the
Sandler and a protection mechanism

413
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:42,040
if that would never be discovered so
again

414
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,110
one once you're into the screen OS and
the disassembly there is

415
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,420
you know the night in the modern
operating system protections its its

416
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,830
it's all just a nap

417
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:54,930
and they're assuming I will never be
there on attack I will never be a

418
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:58,000
so the changes become once you find the

419
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,340
become become trivial

420
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:07,170
again so here's use the function here's
the code I'm

421
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:12,580
what's interesting about it this code I
suppose as that

422
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:16,780
I could I could make this code a so that
onto the one bat

423
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,810
and as is nice n Easy

424
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:23,670
I'm I just as a comparison %um one

425
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:28,530
I just change the bet I'm so here you
have the option of making any password

426
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:28,940
work

427
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,990
or I could change it so that that

428
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:36,410
any password except in the proper one
would work which is quite fun

429
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:40,070
and again on backpack so

430
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:44,390
either saying intercepting this on the
wire over TFTP

431
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:48,460
given I will only had to change one bit
for an SS take back door

432
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:54,210
I'm becomes fairly doable

433
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:59,660
and then the last that the last this
functionality

434
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,640
is the real meat on is why when injected
into buying

435
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,640
so at this is that headin functionality

436
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,760
in cold that I can then make the device
in

437
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:16,250
do things I at that are not reflected in
the configuration

438
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:20,530
his life took an old in the spin last I
is a very common and farmers obviously

439
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:21,920
they

440
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,280
that sense I guess is that a word up
into memory and ladies room for extra

441
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,620
functions that they may add it later
date

442
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:33,220
I'm so I can inject concept code into
both the Noles

443
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:36,270
I'm for the purposes and

444
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:40,930
proving what I can do I decided just to
put up a I sent messages day function

445
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:43,960
I not be satisfied all things I need to
do

446
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,600
I I need to packed a branch in the code

447
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,750
which will jump to my code I

448
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:54,100
I want to be able to use in Bilston West
functionality yelsin

449
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,240
great stuff packet that manipulation
routing

450
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,250
I want able to access all those
functions

451
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:05,080
I want to have new code and I need to
come back to you

452
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:12,080
the normal pop that program execution

453
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:16,180
still here's my at fairly simple
function message in the day

454
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:21,550
until Sat discovered an apprentice your
console function effectively

455
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:24,890
I so what this code does this whenever
anyone II

456
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:29,410
the login function whenever anyone lawns
and potential for serial console

457
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:33,670
the web TFTP an open a message in the
day to use your consul

458
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:37,480
and so I've injected some

459
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,810
a new string in today in into this p.o.s

460
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:44,370
the system Bay minimal

461
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:48,410
saying up stack at the beginning loading
up straying

462
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:54,050
I the instructions that and power pc's
said before that affects I see at the

463
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:58,050
lit up the string and most significant
bit and leasing Afghan met

464
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:01,520
Prince the console of of back to call
the function

465
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,590
and there's just that translate into

466
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:08,370
into hex and just taken to the hex
editor

467
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:13,110
and then recompense the farming

468
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:17,130
so again it's not it's not real attack
ok not someone would actually

469
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:20,150
good n but that does everything that you
need to

470
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:24,650
formula tackled

471
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:31,110
soul onto that some other protection
mechanisms

472
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:35,700
I noticed and while I was looking up and
playing with it that attack

473
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:39,080
every time I loaded farm where little
I'll string came up said image

474
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,040
verification

475
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,720
ignored explanation mark I'm I turns out
all the gym per screen less

476
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:50,540
firmware files and are signed

477
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:54,980
on as an administrator you can loaded
University forget to validate the farm

478
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,850
where

479
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:59,600
but crucially this certificate is not
installed by default

480
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,680
II 2.0 web site and the web beautiful
website find

481
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,920
the sack and download it and soul

482
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:10,020
1 I'm potentially not obtaining from a
trusted source at my DNS servers being

483
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:13,760
exploited and I'm being the director and
the place I'm

484
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,330
its potential for for changing that
stack and

485
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:21,080
administrator you can delete Pacifica
I'm mistaken answers

486
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,460
Lotus at least at I'm

487
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:28,540
so for me that doesn't really at really
can't

488
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,630
I if I'm doing this in the supply chain
or

489
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:36,170
I have some seal consul consul access
the device than I i can.

490
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:39,980
I can do that and then reloaded I'm and

491
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:43,310
more interestingly obviously I can look
at my own sack

492
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:46,960
on and a check is done

493
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,900
in the bootloader nephew remember back
when I was talking about the sections in

494
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,310
skin OS

495
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:57,460
I the discreet escort and a couple and
by the bootloader Korean data

496
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,560
I so I can know

497
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,720
going to the bootloader and in my
modified firmware

498
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,100
I can have a modified bootloader which I
can make

499
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:11,190
and 2k images that before Miami just

500
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:14,240
or media and it would lean on juniper
images

501
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,610
soul the process would be ideally sack

502
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:20,900
if it's install I install my farm where
with the pack

503
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,730
bootloader which will attend K any
firmware attack and then reinstall asap

504
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,120
so many come along

505
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,110
the readme in texas ass loaded set
loaded when it beat up and I'll say

506
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:33,290
yet great and defend skated

507
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:36,880
so I really think in a design flaw
there. on

508
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,090
that certificate on the skin arrested
really be installed by default factory

509
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:45,500
and you should not be able to delete a I
can see no reason why you never want to

510
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,390
delete that stack

511
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:50,760
on even if you're not enabling the
former check for

512
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,000
whatever reason you might not want to
enable the premier tech

513
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,010
I that he be of the

514
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:02,420
the process hard-wired

515
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,200
so here some code is the code in the
bootloader again trivial change one

516
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,630
function

517
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:12,340
one instruction you change the branch
athlete and two branches equal

518
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:16,590
to INR always branch so all images are
authenticated

519
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:19,720
or branch have no equal so only my

520
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,220
bogus images are indicated which is nice
because then I can prevent

521
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:28,000
an upgrade from or a my my modified
children farm where

522
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,240
and so i cant stop the real
administering along with the crack

523
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,190
password

524
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:35,580
I can stop and basically loading up his

525
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:41,620
proper form where

526
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:45,549
so thinking about tak

527
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:50,340
what we would do I real attacks would be

528
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:55,390
and all all possible building shot a
configuration file

529
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,559
and soul rather than writing all that
over

530
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,510
para pc code in today into your farm
where you jest

531
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:06,610
right fairly straightforward function
that makes the

532
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:10,789
con pickpocking function I and then you
can effectively have a

533
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:14,250
config file in your modified firmware
with whole bunch instructions that

534
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:14,659
attack

535
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:19,630
the things you want the device to do an
app which become part of the bill and

536
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,679
on pickpocking it's quite nice an

537
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:27,240
I could maybe topple the network traffic
I I could also

538
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,510
patch the bootloader a to provide

539
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:35,659
persistent infection so f back if I am i
all for Miami just be uploaded

540
00:33:35,659 --> 00:33:40,150
maybe I can now at II and there's a
function in the bootloader

541
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:43,789
to do with downgrading to you in this
when I from bashing

542
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:47,230
by connection for some pretty big
function easily enough space for the

543
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,760
need to inject some code

544
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,270
which on an upgrade I keep the upgrade
function and

545
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:55,669
propagate my my and he's my back door my
one bit

546
00:33:55,669 --> 00:34:00,090
on and potentially more I kids

547
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:05,350
that on SLE the web console thing in the
farmers well so all those ATM now

548
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:08,580
so I can then made a plea and some jobs
trick

549
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:12,679
JavaScript code injection attack
administrators who log in their flying

550
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,369
machines

551
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:17,710
on and then for me most interesting

552
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:21,429
is me further fascinating so

553
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:24,820
what Sandusky last what what more

554
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,260
information can I discover and buy it a
base

555
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:33,100
US from the National doing so honor
private keys private sabes

556
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,429
I can start looking at it

557
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:41,649
for vulnerabilities I I can look at the
algorithms are using

558
00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:47,450
and nose kinda that this guy thinks not
want to talk about nine

559
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:51,359
so on some new stuff for you brian the
unseen before

560
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:57,470
I'm so I just

561
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:03,400
just before I talk will actually and
said this this came by spot part work

562
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,410
I so the state up I've got something
that

563
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:09,640
that proves I can control is quite
device on

564
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,830
so I have carried out at Park
penetration testing

565
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:17,310
real attacks against and next screen
stands before hundreds

566
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:21,330
I'm couple apprentice an one

567
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:25,510
aids that because I la people have
mentioned dozens

568
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:28,690
physical security and

569
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:32,400
not protect their devices cell again
going to prove that

570
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,770
human being weakest link when the attack
week I

571
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:39,890
was anything at the center as a third
party vendor

572
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:44,020
out by the old you know security

573
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:48,060
the the security at section that the
client's knowledge but not the

574
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:52,310
operations section way right to work on
some machines

575
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,990
there's a whole buncha processes in
place which means we should be monitored

576
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:55,940
we should be

577
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:02,030
and restricted into what we can do and
by and nationally

578
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:05,660
we are able to access a rack next door
and

579
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:09,970
this to that effect the 400 saying in a
high-availability cluster which is nice

580
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:14,190
still you can bring one down and and
install the modified firmware

581
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:17,330
it comes back up and then takes over
again on

582
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:20,910
so that's a a real attack in a real
situation

583
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:25,680
and again and and process in humans
being the weakest link the physical

584
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,510
security

585
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:29,859
really and I don't think he should be
lying on for

586
00:36:29,859 --> 00:36:32,950
you know I I don't think devices himself

587
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:36,619
more security and the other one

588
00:36:36,619 --> 00:36:40,330
more social engineering style attack
where thinking control

589
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:44,660
that internal DNS ever with and send the
admins all

590
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,950
that these devices say yet an urgent
email from the Juniper

591
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:51,720
security dotnet basically saying here's
a link to

592
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,960
a new form it's been released a patch is
this there horrible

593
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,260
that's been a dead issue and please go
to the website then when the former

594
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,690
install as you can

595
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:03,790
and again that works and

596
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:07,280
so these work in real life

597
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:13,680
the real attacks and

598
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,630
and so this one there's more recent fine
I'm you

599
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:22,350
doing effects and Common Criteria

600
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:25,550
on it saffir taken to a whole system

601
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:30,320
including net screens and I'm one of
those

602
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:35,160
make the as call there from the feds 142
security policy connecting device thing

603
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,570
that

604
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:38,660
falling on approved all their names are
disabled in text mode

605
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:42,220
I'm in basically you can enter command

606
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:46,250
enables its mode all these devices and
disables Ubuntu modern and

607
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:50,070
those being as and defied and S&P

608
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:55,680
the bunch of stuff I'm but when you to
bash the skin OS

609
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,860
and password hashing algorithm you
discover

610
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:03,000
the use and the fight even

611
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,080
infects mode I'm it makes the cake user
name me take a pic string

612
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,950
call on administration tools call on the

613
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:15,610
at your password they have up the base64
encoded and man

614
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:19,020
then comes the genius ok

615
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:24,960
the real protection the known md5 this
is what makes at No Name t5 I'm assuming

616
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,640
the Internet the character which I think
if you need them backwards and steps

617
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,150
amis

618
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:32,530
I think you'll find spells next spring
I'm

619
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:36,380
the instep these NRC St and expositions

620
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:40,200
in strength and there you go

621
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,930
so again trust I N

622
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:49,340
I think just becomes an issue at missus
clearly stated is not using md5

623
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,390
contraption

624
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:56,070
but clearly it does and so I mean UT
approaches ignited

625
00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:00,210
take the those letters I an and as an
md5 hash

626
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:04,730
or what we did with the you know you
unite simply write lawler them that will

627
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:06,010
build a remote able

628
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,210
likely passwords using all their them
and

629
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:12,900
and then you can if you gain the
confidence you can start cracking at

630
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,870
netting passwords

631
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:18,500
I'm so interesting what you find when
you look in the

632
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:24,800
at the close source so

633
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,960
I i sat out most for atlanta has a black
hat

634
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:33,170
I'm for that I before and I'm o'clock
tonight anyone I did dat

635
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:37,040
I sent information on academic firmware
to unify and

636
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,260
you know point and white find and trying
to engage in a

637
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:45,310
a dialogue with them at their initials
response was this is expected

638
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:48,710
which I thought was interesting so I
wrote back saying

639
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:52,750
well in fact the missed some well

640
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,860
I got some sleep I'll of she had things
going I'm

641
00:39:55,860 --> 00:40:01,810
initially and the security guy responded
very quickly saying great thanks very

642
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:02,310
much

643
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:06,510
and then months past and then I I got a
call from

644
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:11,240
helpful man from support basically

645
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:15,330
asking me i understand you have a
problem with your farm where loading

646
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:18,890
I said no I don't

647
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:21,900
I don't think I do and and a thing to do
at

648
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,740
and he said holiday what why did you
come into that said the only succession

649
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,250
with me

650
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:29,510
and we can find diagnose the problem
that's like I

651
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:33,610
really don't okay whatever I I'm

652
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:38,060
so he did he's anything any support
network at and it's clear he's got my

653
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,030
email open

654
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:42,780
act really think children firmware
basically in the subject line and later

655
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,180
on

656
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:47,230
Trojan firmware and that he's loading up
on a support network on 3rd unified

657
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:47,700
device

658
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:51,040
saying to me lick it works fine ac

659
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,380
so

660
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,750
lack I did I did consider sending and
some other ones

661
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:01,760
and Anderson IP saying then

662
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,200
yet but to so I then went to them saying
well

663
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,690
okay I take in this is expected you
don't mind me publish at publishing at

664
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:09,100
and

665
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:12,400
I which by didn't get a response and and
then when they find out

666
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,660
talking they at the senate some other
emails

667
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,980
than which they not so they thought it
was cool but I was presenting

668
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:24,350
which is nice and and then the day
before presented they have published a

669
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:29,180
ti kak dela 10 which is that base they
seek your advice 342 customers only

670
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:33,110
and stating at can ask him where image

671
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:37,070
indication of cation risk level medium
which basically says

672
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:42,030
that all duberstein at 54 platforms are
susceptible to circumstances in which a

673
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,060
maliciously modified

674
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:46,300
a nice image can be installed so

675
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:50,850
I would say if these devices are are
protecting your at

676
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:55,630
perimeter are you waiting area networks
I'm that's not a great statement

677
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:58,860
and so I think trust become you know

678
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:03,180
an issue their recommendations are
installed sacked

679
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:06,310
which is fine and respect which coats

680
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:10,610
posts can manage a firewall and against
him greatly to magic

681
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:14,680
change TCP port for admin traffic she's

682
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:18,370
defeat everyone obviously and

683
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:23,520
good luck with that a headhunter and
never find it now

684
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,400
so I'm with what can you do rules for
survival

685
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,100
I'm obviously install non-farm where's

686
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,760
when you buy these devices and

687
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,960
don't buy them off e-bay and

688
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,860
anything could be running on I would
recommend that you administer these only

689
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:47,010
by on VPN so which can connect today

690
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:50,460
the next one the management network
gonna they have the idea but two routers

691
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,030
on

692
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:54,110
and next screen cell you can effectively
South

693
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:57,660
AV ADP and I

694
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:02,270
and your admin and faces then went
missing on

695
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:05,700
loopback interfaces on the device
themselves still on

696
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:10,730
that to me is is the best protection you
protecting all the traffic as well

697
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:15,220
and weekends are har hard to find in
your SSH poor

698
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:19,150
was gonna things and depending a step to
BP and needs tax surcharge case it's

699
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:20,110
coming a password

700
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:24,530
I'm at

701
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:28,350
and yet that there is still as one
technical issues pose with

702
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:31,920
the the net in BP and again come and
invest in tuning in looking at real

703
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,090
installs

704
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:36,900
they and when they said pp and the next
been sends out a

705
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:41,080
keep like paying I it's a pain

706
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:45,160
and it's known plaintext so

707
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,790
yeah there's a potential weakness there
at its tell depending what he says

708
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:50,450
encryption all rooms is going to be hard
to break

709
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:54,830
that known plaintext is happily there

710
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:58,470
tell again this knoll is no additional

711
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:01,990
random information included not pain
just as a went to study and to make it

712
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:02,560
look

713
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,250
different or to confuse you

714
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:10,310
which limit number business and strong
strong passwords

715
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:13,390
because if someone going to admin
password

716
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:18,420
and making up in control the device in

717
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,550
so on give me about the demo

718
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:28,550
an my screen less

719
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:33,850
so I just got this is there the lot next
in Europe got a serial console

720
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:38,180
on a at network interface a mile laptop
here

721
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:41,480
abut TFTP server with some math

722
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,810
a modified firmware image on

723
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:48,720
sure you cell this is the

724
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:53,110
web console Netscreen I've got a very
strong password

725
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:56,780
you name it admin admin and

726
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:03,510
so this is their the web interface that
you get the Juniper

727
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:06,710
sure you the yet soul

728
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:11,170
update so here's where you can now

729
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:15,490
load up a at

730
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:22,490
firmware update over the internet and
the web interface if he wanted

731
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:27,170
and

732
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:33,350
slogan over the co-counsel

733
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:40,170
soon

734
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:43,290
saying

735
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:49,530
there's been it's been system so when I
will do three sets device

736
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:56,530
in

737
00:45:57,290 --> 00:46:01,320
so here we go so over the co-counsel
easy hanneke to run motor

738
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:04,460
miss getting the opportunity to load up
a former

739
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:09,380
in I have my

740
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:12,380
troopers web interface here

741
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:15,619
and

742
00:46:15,619 --> 00:46:19,840
you 30

743
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:26,840
so you can see there TFTP seven million

744
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:34,980
on this one I have installed the sack

745
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:38,790
on initially the command key

746
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:41,950
delete this data is basically delete
crypto of key on

747
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:46,099
so here I now have the option and this
is quenched thing

748
00:46:46,099 --> 00:46:51,170
I to safety on-board flash and after
that I'll get the option to

749
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:54,930
run the uploaded from where so this
gives me

750
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:58,150
an opportunity to the effectively runnin

751
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:01,220
in memory attack so

752
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:08,220
I'm not gonna say flash by well

753
00:47:09,859 --> 00:47:13,320
run the downloaded system so if someone
can access your system

754
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:17,579
they can actually load up a former into
memory and form their own

755
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:21,030
black where I went and downloaded the
firmware would be the official one

756
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:25,910
times and on a thing in forensics and
becomes very difficult to

757
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:30,540
Taman whether a new farmers being
unleashes farmers been loaded

758
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:37,540
so here we go

759
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:38,620
so a

760
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:42,170
if I change the boot loader I'm that
would get written

761
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:45,990
to the flak so that would be the only
opportunity eighty discover whether

762
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:49,220
had been modified or not so here you go

763
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:52,700
upgrading a lotta so here I'm the former
have supplied

764
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:57,990
as a patch to you effectively and pick a
any farm where

765
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:02,620
on dialogue and

766
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:06,930
I have my login package

767
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:12,120
so I can just login

768
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:15,400
as my little message in the day some
advice if you ever and attacked by

769
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,080
zombies

770
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:20,570
and and I will just

771
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:23,880
the in shaky

772
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:30,880
all night is lit up the sack

773
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:43,630
they go and i'll know reset the device

774
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:47,660
night he just watch the

775
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:51,770
Europe to this would go back to the old

776
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:54,990
the old fashion good I N Save cell just
load up

777
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:58,480
my modified one again

778
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:05,480
in

779
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:15,510
mmm

780
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:21,230
can actually watch the messages here I'm
in

781
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:24,530
night at pretty Kenya

782
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:28,680
CCI patch this the city functions they
actually need to Sac

783
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:32,910
there's only one that controls whether
the former stand-up she can see I have

784
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:34,220
invalid ESA signature

785
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:37,410
a terrible it's not the right one but
hey

786
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:41,740
images then to gain and obvious I could
pass the other one which said

787
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:44,780
yeah baladi as a signature and and
opposing the attacker

788
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:49,090
I would and but netscape haven't

789
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:56,090
so and then system and yes son and a
situation where I can load up any

790
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,070
farmers i won

791
00:49:57,070 --> 00:50:00,580
with this app noted like I'm

792
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:07,580
and while do years so here

793
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:14,609
I will start a Niamh

794
00:50:14,609 --> 00:50:20,800
I'm all up I'm good just open SSH

795
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,880
session to it so login so I need

796
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:27,369
a valid username much admin

797
00:50:27,369 --> 00:50:31,650
any possible on I'll just hand to a

798
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:35,450
presto and there we go SS-eighteen any
password

799
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:39,609
that's nice I'll message today and some
club then on

800
00:50:39,609 --> 00:50:43,960
I did make some other small
modifications

801
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,880
to web console I really didn't like the
way it licked

802
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:53,230
Inc

803
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:57,300
in and mile paper is bob

804
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:01,680
be CCTV a web console had long known
behenna

805
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,820
be afraid K

806
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:08,170
so just quickly on in quick take: tinier

807
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:11,930
FortiGate so that as an example the next
thing

808
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:14,960
so kindly and Brianna here make ten days
ago

809
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,070
some the FortiGate and and lead them to
challenge

810
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:21,520
and for 10 days well can you find and

811
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,670
sold there but different they and

812
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:28,660
exactly same market is at the same
device dad same functionality

813
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:33,700
and as an x86 platform nope now runs an
operating system call for Tues

814
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:38,050
based on lanix and actually got done
pretty plz violation but we won't talk

815
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:38,550
about that

816
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:41,950
and it supplied standardise at

817
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:45,520
to the office cation I has a satin a
hash appended

818
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,630
looks good and when you decompress

819
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:52,839
the the image it's just an incredible
the data

820
00:51:52,839 --> 00:51:56,320
however and Senate

821
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:59,660
that's a step up from Juniper you're
thinking that's good

822
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:03,000
its and crafted I'm over an awesome
witnesses

823
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,680
I'm and even our Alexa hard disk
encryption on this is some issues around

824
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,820
random access the sectors and hey
encrypt that where the keys are

825
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:16,080
and effectively that all watermarks in
this data

826
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:19,700
so that the patterns in the data and it
looks like a disk image still

827
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:22,800
you've got first 512 bytes

828
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,580
and an electron number that is 512 bytes

829
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:29,690
day start looking like an NBR nice to be
record

830
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:34,400
and the Cinespace than the something out
that's about the right size for Karen O

831
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:39,280
and is a big tent today I start looking
like a a a compressed file system

832
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,480
and if you not only to embedded Linux
system set

833
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,310
typically what you'll do you you have
some flash system

834
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:49,990
which he then the caramel and retail
system the

835
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:55,380
get basically loaded up and around this
console run from there and so again

836
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:58,640
Miss Kitty known plaintext Anna

837
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:03,570
you know what someone those bites going
to be and the spot to the root file

838
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:04,900
system that will be no

839
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:08,810
I see costar attack in encryption

840
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:12,080
also on the 14 at

841
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:15,650
the BIOS chip saying in a at PLCC well
socket

842
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:18,910
being able to imply you can see Kenny
from reader

843
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:22,700
I'm I'm not gonna tell you what I find
in there

844
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,790
as unfortunately I'm I haven't done

845
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:29,869
had time to that north by force now talk
to him about this

846
00:53:29,869 --> 00:53:34,080
so some details are going to have to be
a little bit fuzzy

847
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:39,300
an but bottom line as

848
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,450
FortiGate will load firmware even if
there's no staff no action is

849
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:43,100
uninterrupted

850
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:46,300
so there you go I

851
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:49,780
so the only verification if he can

852
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:53,270
d crept the files this the the firmware

853
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:56,400
the only verification I is to string

854
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,810
verifications I'm the start the MBR

855
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:04,310
has a file name which has to do with the
device in a national ID

856
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:09,170
and decompress can a listing in there
must be called 40 Cannell died

857
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:13,650
geez at to the file names and indeed it
asked me for Carol I

858
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:17,270
as it it's happy I'm

859
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:20,560
soul approach here's a look at the front
I'm

860
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:23,640
policy to modify this is the mean do I
did on Jinnah Park but

861
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:27,700
you can also entirely replace the cattle
and root filesystem

862
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:31,070
I and international feature and

863
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:34,550
if your USB stick with that the former
thing on it you can

864
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:38,270
you can stake in the force that when you
re Battelle automatically upgrade

865
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:41,510
from the USB stick that's nice

866
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:44,720
so quick Bumi B-movies on the office and

867
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:51,720
I just needs changing cables yet

868
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,710
same kind of idea though you have a
console

869
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:02,920
your network interface and

870
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:09,920
loads up for my room a TFTP key

871
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:13,880
yet this crazy cable that goes from

872
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:17,550
Rd 45 to serial adapter to

873
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:24,109
USB it all works though key

874
00:55:24,109 --> 00:55:31,109
soon

875
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:39,560
so he'll just connect to the FortiGate
and

876
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:52,270
in

877
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:54,970
beautiful so just let this load up so
this is the

878
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:58,970
the official firmware again eighty press
any key to display

879
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:02,340
configuration many b2b 10h

880
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:07,010
so young when did the same thing

881
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:10,810
what has been up all all weekend box
look at my own former

882
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:17,810
on just takes a little while

883
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:28,289
so 30 on in a minute when you get a

884
00:56:28,289 --> 00:56:33,429
login prompt on given time in a week
that

885
00:56:33,429 --> 00:56:36,429
that's affected later the boot sequence
that the official one

886
00:56:36,429 --> 00:56:43,429
Apple plug reset

887
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:57,270
come on

888
00:56:57,270 --> 00:57:00,549
come to your own conclusions about the
reliability in various vendors

889
00:57:00,549 --> 00:57:07,549
in

890
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:24,990
come on

891
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:38,540
Kate gimme a second here China's you

892
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:07,160
no using Windows honestly K

893
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:30,140
moon

894
00:58:56,450 --> 00:59:03,450
worth it honestly I'm just building
attention

895
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:20,900
okay and when last right

896
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:38,039
K

897
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:41,369
in

898
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:44,660
in here we go right you know

899
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:47,809
get image troopers

900
00:59:47,809 --> 00:59:54,809
still 48 the dead

901
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:04,359
right

902
01:00:04,359 --> 01:00:11,359
really

903
01:00:22,109 --> 01:00:25,960
a still this one on as a diff replace
the cattle 100 filesystem

904
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:30,350
at new country back doors just reports
just the whole thing mine

905
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:34,869
and happily very fine integrity if I
managed by comparing two strings

906
01:00:34,869 --> 01:00:38,630
and sunnyside basically

907
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:41,990
at used to sell and these flatware S key
image

908
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:45,619
rescue panel plus that busybox

909
01:00:45,619 --> 01:00:48,890
and and I just got some stuff that runs
on boot

910
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:51,920
and should come up in a second

911
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:56,190
I'm so again I have they made

912
01:00:56,190 --> 01:01:00,150
the optional band saving it to the
flashers running at Minto

913
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:04,430
saving started running life-saving and
seem like an oven memory attack so you

914
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:05,540
can see a very similar

915
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:10,140
on you wanna

916
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:17,140
whether they were written by seeing
people as said you can't even explain

917
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:24,940
possibly a little quicker in some
respects and might be a reason to buy it

918
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:32,750
back

919
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:35,720
year ago but the message you see what's
in the box

920
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:39,470
I nice little message in the day you
know

921
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:46,470
ok

922
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:51,140
I

923
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:56,119
allege event I just know the gym so on

924
01:01:56,119 --> 01:02:00,400
so that makes all thanks for listening
on I don't got a question time anywhere

925
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,430
final there me too much but maybe one
Christian

926
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:09,960
I think it is also the possibility to
you to take to gramm

927
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:13,730
absolutely needed break so don't like
case again

928
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:20,730
thank you very much very entertaining K
well

929
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:54,710
you should

930
01:02:54,710 --> 01:03:01,710
week

931
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:12,750
in

932
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:26,839
in

933
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,680
week

934
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:37,250
okay we just needed some time p change
the laptops

935
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:40,480
and the addresses ready now so

936
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,790
a make talk I think we ought to be

937
01:05:43,790 --> 01:05:47,270
very interesting and the you can always

938
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:50,420
and go back to the to keynote today
because could

939
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:53,590
de Gea already talked about to try a
rented could reading

940
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:58,940
so and now would be a get them you
commission about 10 or integrate good

941
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:02,190
to identify track countries can be your
best your manheim

942
01:06:02,190 --> 01:06:06,870
at working there and a.m. i think is
working on two kind of 210

943
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:10,730
strategies and all that stuff and so
he's okay

944
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:14,580
you can pour you a text that can be done

945
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:17,630
against safeguarded by threats forced
help you track

946
01:06:17,630 --> 01:06:21,190
thank you can the night introduction

947
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:24,420
and welcome to my presentation about
return oriented rooted

948
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:29,560
and he said already that I work for the
University of Mannheim

949
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:32,760
right now which in where I am a PhD
student

950
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:35,860
and what I'm going to present you today
is

951
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:39,600
actually what I and research when I
wrote my diploma

952
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:42,810
better 1 year ago and

953
01:06:42,810 --> 01:06:46,570
yet today I'm going to show you at home
eating onto programming works

954
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:50,050
what's it all about so that's the best
part of my presentation

955
01:06:50,050 --> 01:06:53,610
and once we've done that we can dig into

956
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:57,040
certain domain in which we need that
kind of you

957
01:06:57,040 --> 01:07:01,030
attack to bypassed iraqi protection
schemes

958
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:04,040
so and I'm pretty sure that

959
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:07,770
many of you have already had the
expression it on into programming

960
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:10,970
especially up a dwarf presented altering
the keynote today

961
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:13,970
and it's a pretty high topic that wall

962
01:07:13,970 --> 01:07:17,170
discussed in many presentations

963
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:20,170
and past year security conference in

964
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:23,580
such as black head of that column and

965
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:28,280
and in the beginning it all started in
2007

966
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:33,260
well of Japan rose baby 30 omit the
openness and flashed on the bone

967
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:37,030
returning to the the without country
called so long

968
01:07:37,030 --> 01:07:41,650
as always some crazy hacker dude had
already happening idea

969
01:07:41,650 --> 01:07:44,770
beforehand bad let's just say that

970
01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:47,740
this was kind of the beginning of the
entire hype about returning to

971
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:49,670
programming no

972
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:53,870
arm he would not be what return on the
program you call the bank

973
01:07:53,870 --> 01:07:57,120
I would say that it about how to ride
program

974
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:00,620
that do not have any on call until

975
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:04,370
me an a few years ago everyone had this
is something that

976
01:08:04,370 --> 01:08:08,320
if you would want to execute your own
computations on a computer

977
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:13,000
then you would need to have are you on
call back to Intec tinkered with them

978
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:18,260
and executed in Conway bottom the 4th
kind of the fourth time that we will be

979
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:22,670
stalled at this assumption is not kind
of true and especially from the security

980
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:23,300
perspective

981
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:27,640
this is problematic than many
protections rely on this

982
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:32,780
certainty think that'll and using on
called in the fifth in

983
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:35,960
developing techno on called in to assist
them me too

984
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:39,630
abuse already ok that's the are
cold-blooded

985
01:08:39,630 --> 01:08:44,030
that all around the main memory and we
try to tame this code together

986
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:49,940
to make it to arbitrary stop and when we
meet we mean outgrew stuff usually mean

987
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:54,740
militants to will be form

988
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:58,990
I tell you had written on to become
actually works it might be wise to take

989
01:08:58,990 --> 01:09:00,010
a look back into

990
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:03,870
the three of up to new booties
especially to take a

991
01:09:03,870 --> 01:09:06,900
you can being what I call it king of

992
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:10,260
doctor will not be with you which is
back political attack

993
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:13,540
am battle with nobility

994
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:16,880
which polled the lot of headaches too
many

995
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:22,020
security researcher as it is I with the
steel multi one of the most widespread

996
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:25,830
on your abilities that you can find in
software

997
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:29,110
then multiple software that you run on
your computer is

998
01:09:29,110 --> 01:09:32,620
the written at the and as we all know
the same on tight

999
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:36,030
day programming language between with
ultimate that

1000
01:09:36,030 --> 01:09:41,710
it def not have any included databank
text and

1001
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:46,570
so the idea bob beckel simply that we
have youth teeth missing data bone steak

1002
01:09:46,570 --> 01:09:50,080
20 and 30 baton and then we can alter
all

1003
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:54,590
override Country Fair into bit of about
that of somewhere in the memory

1004
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:58,530
and hand we can baby a pic company

1005
01:09:58,530 --> 01:10:00,740
the taxes
