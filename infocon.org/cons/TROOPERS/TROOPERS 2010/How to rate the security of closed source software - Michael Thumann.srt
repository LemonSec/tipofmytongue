1
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,470
up

2
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:03,470
so

3
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:20,770
I I

4
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:24,900
but right so I think I'll left thought

5
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,020
for welcome to talk how to read the
security in close all softer a

6
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,150
um just talk if through

7
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,920
work in progress I'm trying to implement

8
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,190
concept to deal with the problem

9
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:42,730
from my point of view it's a big problem
um

10
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,870
how you can rate some kind of
trustworthiness

11
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,980
of close all software where Khan to

12
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,280
any kind of source code all its or

13
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,230
the other approaches are to
time-consuming

14
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,380
but arm before going into

15
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,010
the topic itself shot introduction as
usual

16
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,960
a Who Am I I michael record for yards W

17
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,920
a from the company a was hounded I'm the
head of the application

18
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,700
security team occasion just thinking and
I'm ship security officer of the RW

19
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,190
arm who's just shot overview about

20
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:27,190
talks publications I did during the last
year's and my

21
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,910
maint of the company are reverse
engineering security research

22
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,720
and of course penetration testing and
court audits

23
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,890
on addition to

24
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,600
quite technical tasks worm

25
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,220
well-to-do consulting stuff I helping
our customers

26
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,970
implementing I'm security development
life cycles

27
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,170
a whether Inc can implement this kind of

28
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:57,520
test methodologies arm also under the
moment life cycles

29
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,770
who makes the software more secure on

30
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:05,690
one approach we have for me to court
ordered some penetration tests

31
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:11,010
this that we're trying to produce some
results that are comparable

32
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,519
so from what Canyon to to make results
comparable

33
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,400
you have to define some kind of metrics
we did that prop intrusion tests for

34
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,500
court although it's

35
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,760
um so we can measure improvements

36
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,740
when we are doing retests on this
approach

37
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:34,400
from the daily business a Wraith the
idea

38
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,580
to do something was close source of

39
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,130
um there must be a possibility

40
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,780
how we can construct a metric that helps

41
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,270
especially companies and enterprises um

42
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,270
to rate Security office of and

43
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,920
sold the idea for this talk was born and
as already mentioned it's

44
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:00,560
work in progress I'm later on I will
also present some practical results

45
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,510
test that I did from now it looks good

46
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,430
but this still room for discussion

47
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,630
there are and for improvement on

48
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:15,200
so it's kind of rosen let's say old old
one

49
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,750
of the concept so it's pretty new stuff
okay

50
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,610
a.m. Genoa shot introduction what's the
problem

51
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,600
the storm approaches for dealing with
the problem today

52
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,590
I'm the alternate approach I already
mentioned

53
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,970
would be kinda metric the most
interesting point

54
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:41,270
what can we measure to do some kind of
security rating of close all software

55
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,360
how do we wait the results

56
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,370
that we can collect I'll short flights

57
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,430
about possibility um I would do

58
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,280
first of based on when the software arm

59
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,450
pots I have also a mine in mind to
extend it

60
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:03,460
to other operating systems because when
talking about the metric

61
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,270
shouldn't be a metric for reduce of
Tribune metric for all close

62
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,320
so shops like about how to make it
possible

63
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,099
putting all the stuff together practical
demonstration

64
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:20,000
shot discussion of the results a month

65
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,080
how to improve list of so what r
possible probable steps

66
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,560
okay and because I am a trooper

67
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,560
I'm here to present a list of and let's
stick

68
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,240
into the frost part of the agenda
introduction and

69
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,909
what's the problem her viability
assessment

70
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:42,909
read it pretty cool workshop about that

71
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:46,719
on the trust today's of to press
conference I

72
00:05:46,719 --> 00:05:49,760
vulnerability assessments and the press
contacts get

73
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,250
more and more common arm the people are
buying appliances

74
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:58,710
to viability assessment to get some
feeling for the security of the Nets

75
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:02,029
rockwell the viability is what you have
to do

76
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:06,529
ants from next step when implementing
viability assessment

77
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:10,130
after looking at the network level and
the operating system level

78
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,390
is that the applications are accessed so

79
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:17,490
from other thing for injection problems
process scripting

80
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,120
find them all mitigate some all a

81
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,930
improve the software are train the
developer

82
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,390
so that I well secure coding principal

83
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:32,450
and if they are we r how to produce
secure software

84
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:36,849
to avoid 22 good programming flaws that
lead to

85
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:41,229
all the security vulnerabilities the
just make better software:

86
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:45,789
they all security well in the
development environments like

87
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:48,870
Visual Studio from Microsoft or GCC

88
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,640
I'm dumb or more security futures to
implement it

89
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,529
to help the developer us to avoid the
typical

90
00:06:56,529 --> 00:06:59,940
I Ross and produce vulnerabilities

91
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,099
so arm the manufacturer us of

92
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:06,979
this kind of compilers and development
environments

93
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:10,469
are trying to enforce and help all the
developers

94
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:13,630
to produce more secure software

95
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:17,159
her the problem

96
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:21,419
itself that the filing of application

97
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:25,789
ongoing market so just need to browse on
the client side

98
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:29,289
so what is better than verifying
applications

99
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:32,659
running the the applications and
centrists of us

100
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:36,979
a month so we are just dedicated to that
education assessment

101
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:41,630
that's pretty easy pots there are a lot
of products around

102
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:45,490
that are not verified yet that up
stand-up arteries

103
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:49,080
I'm compiled client server environments

104
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,729
that are used for special type of for

105
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:56,229
very important and the price prophecies
and of

106
00:07:56,229 --> 00:08:00,219
and all these products outside and
enterprises

107
00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:05,050
are close also of they use all start
programming languages like C++ or C plus

108
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,180
plus

109
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,839
are on there are no easy to use tools
available

110
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:15,800
to do it any kind of assessment of the
softer

111
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,229
I don't say there are no truth but they
are not easy to use

112
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:24,450
but we r assessing

113
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,570
that the conditions reduce Usman Zafar
network

114
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:31,750
of our infrastructure of power of all
operating systems

115
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,570
I'll but we don't do you was kind of
close of of

116
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,800
but we also have a neat to do that

117
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,310
but another part of our software are um

118
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:47,020
where we have to answer one question can
we trust the software

119
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:52,470
and Kansas offer process for example all
confidential data

120
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,220
or not are um

121
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,540
what about implemented effect of but

122
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,540
will sent are confidential data I'm

123
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,330
using proxy server or to the
manufacturer of the software

124
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:08,550
phone home activity all that stuff

125
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,990
it's not pretty nu um running past the
fire was on the system's

126
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,690
very often reveal any kind of saw fit
for the tries to phone home

127
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:20,870
yeah so from the contest install the
software process

128
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,050
our date or and think okay it sure

129
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,500
so we have 22 to do some kind of
assessments

130
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,210
to ensure that it can process date are

131
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:37,320
especially data that's classified the
standard approaches

132
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,410
for today that behalf for

133
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,730
a for the measurement of close also
where r

134
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:49,540
we can do reverse engineering of the
application they are fed

135
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:54,240
box office and this a test technology
called having

136
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,800
um fault injection let's have a look at
this

137
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,720
standard approaches we're talking about
reverse engineering

138
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,339
a trust when it some people that have
the skill to reverse engineering

139
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,660
reverse engineering length that too
disassemble

140
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,420
close all software and try to read and
understand

141
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,780
disassembly that's not so easy

142
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:20,920
and doing a security assessment

143
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,890
also means that you must have some more
lurch what to look for

144
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:29,510
in the binary to find security problems
and of course

145
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,900
the menu task in its time um

146
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,589
doing our research rock for

147
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:40,520
talks I'm we did and the past few years

148
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,330
arm we spend a lot of time reverse
engineering stop

149
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:50,080
and it's not on in hours understanding
what's opera is doing

150
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,030
meet days weeks maybe Mom so

151
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:57,480
springtime from you turn

152
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,310
do some kind of security rating of the
software

153
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:05,080
it's not enough to look okay that's the
main application

154
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,790
and I've stopped reverse engineering the
main application they are

155
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:12,120
additional functions to put into
libraries

156
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,200
are so we also have to assess these
libraries

157
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,000
we also have to rush engineer the the
library and to understand

158
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,480
if there are if the functions that are
in the library's are implemented

159
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,020
properly

160
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:28,980
and that's also some kind of party
libris

161
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:34,160
are youth by the developer I'm to avoid
more coding

162
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,260
implementing functions for themselves so
we also must analyze

163
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,950
this kind of party libraries and we also
must rate

164
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:45,830
the overall security of the application
so

165
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,410
this stuff is pretty time consuming a
month

166
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:54,400
if you have a look at one application
that must process confidential data

167
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:59,380
might say okay a spending one to three
weeks

168
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:03,620
arm the project to do security
assessments of 3r

169
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,930
might help that's okay a afterwards I
know okay

170
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,920
this because the structure of the on of
up but it's not about

171
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,220
one application if you look from some
kind of

172
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,050
at the cakes inventory lists big
companies they are not

173
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:23,820
10 100 thousands we have seen inventory
lists

174
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,540
from where we're talking about talking
thousand applications

175
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,670
different applications so you really
don't want to spend

176
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:36,330
at least two weeks for each application
if you do want to

177
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:39,540
if you want to do that I'm just give me
a phone call

178
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:44,339
I'm get trying to hire some some people
answer of course we need an office in

179
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:46,890
your company for let's say three or four
or five years

180
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,170
so really would make a good contract

181
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,890
um but I think this approach

182
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:57,760
won't solve the problem Lex approach

183
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,880
if sent box systems sent box systems are
trying

184
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,140
to measure the behavior of an
application

185
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:10,310
this %uh some kind of rolled home
activity

186
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:14,040
um other signs for back to Los

187
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,740
netbook activity what kind of
information is from

188
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,190
communicated over the network about

189
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:25,000
normally this sent both approaches are
dedicated to never analyzed

190
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,760
so they're looking for a typical
behaviour

191
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:33,750
of Mayville that might be useful for
detecting targeted attacks

192
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,150
or back door a but

193
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,660
to me it doesn't help to rate the
security

194
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:44,160
of course of of its about

195
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,570
mob detection or understand what the mob
is drawing

196
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:52,750
and implement from countermeasure

197
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:57,079
last approach other

198
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:00,630
housing is in alt school technology to
find

199
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:04,520
arrows software so it's about fault
injection

200
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,930
was fault injection you can I'm cover
for example

201
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,980
viability like overflows are integer
overflows

202
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,140
on maybe some from offspring

203
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,709
from vulnerabilities a other kind of

204
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:22,220
arrows in the application thought

205
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,480
it's not it's not about some stopping

206
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,930
francie user interface a.m.

207
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:32,829
during the power of two binary and press
the top button

208
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:35,890
um for the actions needed to

209
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:39,630
make the public work so a trough if
there's

210
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:43,680
some kind of net network support
protocols that are used in the

211
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,970
application

212
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,730
the protocol must be fast

213
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,780
for public protocols you must understand

214
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,920
the protocol if it's a cheeky based

215
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,750
okay no problem a at least download RC

216
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,150
on read specifications

217
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:06,420
implement the father which is too
time-consuming

218
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,579
a I'm but frost and a protocol maybe
they are already

219
00:15:10,579 --> 00:15:13,699
a defined father public script of others

220
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:17,870
that you can use but what about proper
Terry

221
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:21,040
protocol um that are implemented

222
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,819
um by different vendors umbrage at some
kind of reverse engineering of

223
00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:28,829
a protocol um when you're

224
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:32,949
were hacking or attacking network
admission control Francisco

225
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:36,480
I and that the take quite some time

226
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,079
to figure out how the protocol is
rocking

227
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,120
and it was a little bit proper Terry
about

228
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,350
a not completely you invent the protocol

229
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:49,589
so maybe you have to deal with protocols

230
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:54,280
that you don't understand and don't have
any kinda specification

231
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,770
and then again you up you have to go
back to reverse engineering

232
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:02,459
the protocol now to understand I would
rocks

233
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:05,480
afterwards you can implement your father

234
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,959
so that's true a lot of work and

235
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,819
there are other hearts that must be
tough for example

236
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:16,069
user interfaces where user can

237
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:20,110
and to any kind of input or 54 minutes

238
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:24,470
its application process estate up
loading pictures

239
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:27,540
documents whatever and its

240
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,650
it again same user interface might be
quite easy to implement

241
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:35,900
because you can't see the user interface
you can see what kinda input is expected

242
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,540
it

243
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,670
but I former if almost the same problem

244
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:43,970
as the protocols ever to text based five
former

245
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:47,810
might be easy to analyze and a construct
a father

246
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,089
but if it's the kind of binary
interfaith for this useful 5

247
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:55,220
a binary file format definition and
again you have to stop some kind of

248
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,600
reverse engineering to understand

249
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,940
but I from it construct working follow

250
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,319
so again we have a very time-consuming
process

251
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,589
and same us will

252
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:11,419
about engineering units kill people that
the able

253
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:15,579
to do that there are a lot of having
frameworks outside

254
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:20,240
for doing some kind of basic publishing
yeah but it depends on the software

255
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,240
you're trying to a

256
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,560
to rate in the security context so

257
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,780
the actual approach earth from my point
of view

258
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:35,080
I'm not really helpful and the press
context

259
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,710
it's too time-consuming cost too much
money

260
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,870
are and skill set

261
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,919
X is extremely high so

262
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:49,010
i'm new very very skilled people that
you normally don't want to hire

263
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:53,600
intercompany because all they do is
housing rose engineering and all that

264
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,080
stuff

265
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,640
so there are a few companies arm

266
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,560
that have this kind of people but
normally you don't

267
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,240
and into expensive too high or

268
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,880
special companies by the R&W to do the
reverse engineering for you

269
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,080
I'm almost payable

270
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,620
okay so what can we do

271
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:22,470
the alternate approaches trying to
measure

272
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,700
something and construct a metric

273
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,690
the pics to some information cannot
trust the software or better

274
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:33,100
how trust wealthy is a software but I
want to use

275
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,880
all that I'll that I'm already using um

276
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,100
in my corporate network

277
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:45,050
why a metric metrics are

278
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:48,560
white the roost for example

279
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,460
from companies that do some kind of
production um

280
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:57,030
from want to do some kind of quality
insurance and

281
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:01,360
they are not really you about kind of
nearly discover of

282
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,080
the security context so arm

283
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:10,140
responding more more people um thinking
about metrics

284
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,570
but can be used for doing some kind of
rating

285
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,740
the terms of security in the terms of
computer security

286
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,600
so they are few books available a some
concepts

287
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,230
on some for quite in your topic

288
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:30,160
but um why a metric if the metric is

289
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,910
quite good can really help to measure

290
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:40,020
something for example security metrics
can or should be com- parable

291
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,170
I want to measure some kind of
improvement

292
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:48,360
that's pretty interesting because um if
the metrics metric tons of some kind of

293
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,300
bad result

294
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,810
so far I want to use to process my data
not rough

295
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:57,370
so about functionality is so interesting
that I really want to use a softer

296
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,940
so that I can a talk with the vendor
okay I'm

297
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,960
we think you have really big security
problems you have to improve your

298
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,600
software

299
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,080
a Ohio some unskilled people

300
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,780
make it better and if you're a able to
do that

301
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,420
let me buy the software to a halt and we
are willing to buy the software

302
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:22,480
on arm let's talk again let's say into a
three-month so now the people are

303
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,860
from trying to improve his offer other
coming back

304
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,970
okay years wasn't sure and a.m.

305
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:34,710
I do the same measurement again getting
your results

306
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:38,660
I'm gonna have to see okay has a softer
improved or not

307
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:43,050
so good metric must be comparable

308
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:46,560
um to see if the earth a

309
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,610
any kind of improvements in terms of
security

310
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:55,650
the metric can help to make some results
understandable

311
00:20:55,650 --> 00:21:02,220
even for managers a um I'm other often
talk about some kind of traffic light

312
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,060
approach

313
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,250
I'm that every manager will understand
if there's a green light

314
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,300
go on it so the red light stop a

315
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:15,500
that's quite easy managers are able to
understand that so love for my part

316
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:20,260
my point of view arm the metric must be
easy to understand

317
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,580
even for people that I'm not really
involved

318
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:27,090
in security and especially in the
technical part security

319
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:30,790
another bomb touch Prometric

320
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:34,580
is they can be automated I want to save
time

321
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,090
I don't want to spend a lot of time for
doing reverse engineering

322
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:42,760
from if possible I want to press a
button and get a result

323
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,880
a and all the other stuff storm

324
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,810
an automated way so if I can Richards
goal

325
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:53,010
it's time to effect the but

326
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:56,630
if the metric is really helpful depends
if

327
00:21:56,630 --> 00:22:00,540
of the stuff that I'm trying to measure
or if I can measure

328
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:06,920
this information in a reliable way and
if it's meaningful

329
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,070
so doesn't make any sense

330
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:13,130
to measure stuff so that makes your

331
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:16,340
book metric in this context and

332
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,920
lets this what I'm trying to implement

333
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,240
with this approach so

334
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:27,730
let's stop with the next chapter we want
a rep trying to

335
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:31,230
rates the security of close of software
so I think

336
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:35,540
one of the most important act what
others think that we can measure

337
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:40,890
the security context because

338
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:44,890
there are a lot of my dears from

339
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:48,170
for Windows software are I thought that
was when the software

340
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:53,460
a.m. another point is when this offer is
widely used in the enterprise context

341
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,000
on the client side a sometimes on some
aside

342
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,350
so wrong does a lot of potential are a
lot of meats

343
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:06,290
even for operating this kind of software
the things we can measure

344
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:09,660
some ideas I was thinking about

345
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:13,190
frost this compile our and drink options

346
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:16,440
that are you when compiling the software
I'm

347
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:22,190
I would go into more than 20 on the next
flights

348
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:26,470
the development environment for our
students

349
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,890
of from are detectable can measure it

350
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:33,650
so I can a/c different old garden is
used

351
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:36,750
or knew about

352
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:41,470
from mob to analyze this signs her coat
application

353
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:44,480
are there any kind of anti reverse
engineering

354
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,630
techniques apply are there any kind of
and tidy back

355
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:52,090
techniques applied a um

356
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:55,340
the idea behind that is okay a.m.

357
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,440
if you're using anti reverse engineering
and tidy bugging

358
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,070
a maybe you want to hide something

359
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:05,070
so that's normally the reason for code
obfuscation

360
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:08,240
um have a look at the input table

361
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,370
the parts that are interesting in the
input table also on

362
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:14,410
one of the next flight and from

363
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:17,840
a metrics that I'm already using when we
are due in court

364
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,010
audits um coat quality metrics

365
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:25,740
make a and health stuff I will also have
a slight a

366
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:31,970
for that later on and of course
vulnerability scan

367
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,090
if I'm able to do that so let's have a
closer look

368
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:40,360
at this ID earth for of compiler and
linker

369
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,010
Microsoft for example is improving

370
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:48,420
the security features each version of
Visual Studio

371
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:52,810
so um their new features

372
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:57,990
implemented new ideas to make this offer
more secure

373
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:03,580
and to help develop both to produce more
secure software

374
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:07,060
looking at Microsoft Security
development life cycle

375
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:12,010
thus one step I'm the life cycle rather
say

376
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,450
ensure a at every time that the youth

377
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:19,700
the actual version on the development
environment means

378
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:23,270
if this was still your 2010 is avaible
use it

379
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:27,050
to because maybe there are new security
features

380
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:32,420
you should use to make that a softer

381
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,550
so

382
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:40,700
having a look at the garden that is used
for compiling the software are

383
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,470
at least can't control the perfect if
this

384
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:47,580
pop all this a requirement of

385
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,790
Microsoft Security development life
cycle

386
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:54,010
youth another thing is this

387
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:58,000
um DP Sr

388
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,840
safe Seah all all some kind of us were
off

389
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,510
that our youth for doing some kind of
buffer overflow protection

390
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:10,120
we have hot where are the two parts the
PE

391
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:17,120
and operating systems supports a

392
00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:43,820
trooper

393
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:50,820
books again okay

394
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:57,990
okay for the time the mic wasn't working
that was disclosure you

395
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,950
okay I so we already have some

396
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,050
thinks we can quite easy measurer

397
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:09,880
especially when the software and of
course concepts like

398
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,780
p or as a law also a waiver in

399
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:20,780
from binder is falling ok of mac os x
that's not just when is related caught

400
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:21,900
up with cation

401
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,550
Pekka of trip to Las

402
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:28,850
for example that of Maine

403
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:34,370
earth mother contacts can be identified
for example using sick

404
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:37,640
just that puts a waiver that are trying
to detect

405
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,340
if a some special packed house like you
PXR

406
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,650
remedy or to or something else are you
so

407
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:47,670
sick Chopra based approach as possible
to detect

408
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:52,180
Picasa trip to us and you also have the
possibility

409
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:56,740
to take you like some kinda entropy
tough to make a judgment

410
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:00,000
the binary is hey or not

411
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,090
so apec binary

412
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:06,230
today means there someone

413
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:09,900
want to hide something may be some kind
of

414
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,840
intellectual property

415
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,600
would but would be okay I'm doing that
was my I'm

416
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,919
dotnet binary s I do coat obfuscation so

417
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,970
and I wouldn't pass this check my own
software

418
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:27,240
arm but are want to

419
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,059
to protect our intellectual property
when releasing

420
00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:34,399
two routes that I want to release
without salt

421
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,710
other signs of we can look for

422
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:41,580
of for example the input table the input
table

423
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:46,029
contains archer unloaded from libraries

424
00:30:46,029 --> 00:30:49,799
and took a sign

425
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:54,269
for the do the trick pick us yes that
impart a bit this

426
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:58,600
really shot to show off to be a
realistic one

427
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,230
so but another approach him Patel

428
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:07,139
too short obviously divine respect
all-pro skated in some way

429
00:31:07,139 --> 00:31:11,129
um you can also have a look and import
table

430
00:31:11,129 --> 00:31:14,990
if they are typical function you

431
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:18,470
to detect the bar girls like is are
present

432
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:21,580
so that also signs of

433
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:26,649
that a some kind of anti reverse
engineering anti debugging techniques

434
00:31:26,649 --> 00:31:30,619
are you import a burden

435
00:31:30,619 --> 00:31:34,210
them itself Microsoft

436
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:38,230
released years ago a a list of so-called

437
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,490
paint functions functions develop our

438
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:45,299
should never use in this of like

439
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:48,309
of course spring crop East rink at all
that stuff

440
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:53,869
um maybe you can spots

441
00:31:53,869 --> 00:31:58,659
this functions input table they are

442
00:31:58,659 --> 00:32:02,889
a implemented in libraries so if someone
is using string copy

443
00:32:02,889 --> 00:32:07,490
drink at on /url has to go to library or
link

444
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:10,499
the library into this program so

445
00:32:10,499 --> 00:32:15,279
shook of dysfunctions import table there
are some exceptions

446
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,369
spot a long will it work so if you're
fine

447
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:21,509
this kind of functions bent functions as
important a ver

448
00:32:21,509 --> 00:32:24,570
we can assume that they are you

449
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:29,779
so well and develop our still using
string copy today

450
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:33,789
both printers secure softer are you
agreeing

451
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:38,899
good I'm happy okay

452
00:32:38,899 --> 00:32:42,580
a other things we can check and import
table

453
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:47,850
network functionality if the same
concept have a look at the input table

454
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:51,519
if network functions that for APIs

455
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,649
our youth the bets

456
00:32:55,649 --> 00:33:00,779
choice to use net for functionality with
a

457
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:06,809
yes 01 with us know

458
00:33:06,809 --> 00:33:12,680
pencils of

459
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,470
tried a but there are other examples

460
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:19,880
well network functionality as 12

461
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:25,360
for example sometimes clients office of
clock must communicate with other

462
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,600
so having network functionality a

463
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,750
is not bet a but a

464
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:37,500
maybe if you are expecting no network
functionality

465
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,720
that it might be better a

466
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,200
same is true for registry access and

467
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,470
for example some kind of create pilots
functionality

468
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:50,780
it depends of

469
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,840
of cough if there are some kind of
backdoor activity

470
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,190
then they were here with this harks ever
tried to troll whole

471
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:02,630
there will try to access the registry
for example

472
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:07,270
a.m. to implement some kind of awful
start options that ever tried to

473
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:10,679
creates hyatt's for example arm

474
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:14,300
return known this kind of lessons from
promove analyzes

475
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,940
that a typical a to be good behaviour

476
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:21,909
of Mata accessing the network excesses
registry

477
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:26,020
accessing fired straight fights all that
stuff but it's not that

478
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:31,800
sup depends on the context coat quality

479
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,230
I'll from my point of view it's quite

480
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:38,619
interesting to talk about quote quality
because

481
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:41,960
a we have some kind of a

482
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,909
spreading brought at yard w/

483
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:49,010
if you want to make something secure

484
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:52,129
you have to keep it simple
understandable

485
00:34:52,129 --> 00:34:55,389
so a counterpart if

486
00:34:55,389 --> 00:35:00,810
complexity truth they are called quality
metrics babo

487
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:04,650
that I use to measure our coat
complexity

488
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:08,570
make some kind of judgment if the coat
this complex

489
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:10,370
or not

490
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:13,880
I'm the most famous one is make a

491
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,840
or from earlier called such a met the
complexity

492
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:22,470
and another one that is from my point of
view

493
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:26,120
not so well known hopes to what

494
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:30,550
of kind of metrics a measuring all what

495
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:33,770
but do they count make a pound of
decisions

496
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:38,050
and the application hey if that counts
operators and operands

497
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:42,280
for different approaches how to measure

498
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,400
complexity of the software hats that has
also

499
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,410
another interesting a for

500
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:53,240
well you Colts number of estimated box

501
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,840
which brings a string I'm number is
quite high

502
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,590
it looks like this offer is World Cup so

503
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,780
love those pretty low

504
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:06,380
maybe the developer at least in the
context of complexity did a good job

505
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:09,660
of that's one problem

506
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:13,620
measuring code quality a you have to

507
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:19,260
measure or count the number and you have
to count the number operator

508
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,540
operan how to do that her

509
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:27,480
so again you have to disassemble the
binary

510
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,930
to have some kind of a cold you can view
Ruth

511
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:35,080
the account that stuff so at least you
have to reverse

512
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,220
or disassembly over binary thoughts

513
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,910
I think this can be automated

514
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:45,930
used to produce this kind of metric but
it's an additional step

515
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:52,270
each single binary must beat the system
viability scan

516
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:57,400
years ago they're also

517
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,320
script for one of the most famous

518
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:05,350
from some loss I dot I am it was called
back

519
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:09,340
scam was done by hive of a very very
cool guy

520
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:13,570
a one of the best guys doing rough
engineering disassembly

521
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:16,950
I have some some a

522
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:20,080
things I can remember I'm RAM Madhav are

523
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,200
was looking at this assembly is and

524
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,470
at the point was really frustrating for
me

525
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:30,470
crossover talking about times a from
text of

526
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:33,560
I was thinking about or would take one
through three days

527
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:37,250
the other car another guy said 0 that
would take

528
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,560
30 minutes I was saying what so long

529
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,590
five minutes enough was crew

530
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:47,240
I will talk with him today

531
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:51,650
for and he implemented some kind of
approach a plugin

532
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:55,620
scripts I'm to look for typical buffer
overflow problems

533
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:59,120
this is some so scruples working

534
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,890
a or like looking for string copy
functions

535
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:07,480
and the Colts and trying to follow on
the date on the disassembly

536
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:11,550
stick reconstructing the strict estate
and discover if

537
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:15,450
I'm arguments are passed through the
sponsor a function

538
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:20,750
that a maybe overflow any kind of office
or bounce

539
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:25,180
but yet approached you have to
disassemble the Software

540
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,630
and then run the script and you have to
do that for every single binary

541
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:33,100
so there are approaches to do some kind
of

542
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:37,970
vulnerability scanning and disassembly
and

543
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:41,230
I am I talk with arm FX

544
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:44,660
for one year ago a month

545
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:48,010
he and take Richard Phillips are working
on some

546
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:51,480
kind of stop how to discover
vulnerabilities

547
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,680
some so um may be in your

548
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,920
approaches defined by the abilities will
arise in the future

549
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,940
and kept the youth up

550
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:07,460
again we have to generate the certainly

551
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:12,500
each binary to do that and for
automating this kind of process

552
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,570
we need some kind of locked in

553
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:20,560
the dust fallibility scanning some okay

554
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,490
I that all things so far

555
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:27,940
from but the can measure

556
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:33,580
a maybe there will be new ideas
hopefully

557
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:37,540
happy through find or hear about you are
you um

558
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:43,040
but doing this kind of checks across
must produce some kind of

559
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,480
thought like one and 0

560
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,830
owning does not improve a security
rating

561
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:55,980
in any kind it's like check for you one

562
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:59,570
Inc improve security rating that's
pretty

563
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:04,460
is up just some definitions I

564
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:09,100
but talking about this kind of checks
there may be some

565
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:12,299
problem checks I'm

566
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,630
this kind of tax relief help

567
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:22,630
to make some rating of security must
await the results

568
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:26,740
because for example if you look for DP

569
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:31,430
a full of a %eh link version then we can
assume

570
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:35,050
okay if these from

571
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:39,870
options are present security is approved
so this cute ready must be better

572
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:43,290
if you're talking about called
obfuscation I already mentioned

573
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:46,670
intellectual property really don't know

574
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:50,570
doesn't have a security impact I we're
dealing with ma girl are as a company

575
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:52,810
trying to protect intellectual property

576
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:56,270
we don't know network functionality

577
00:40:56,270 --> 00:41:00,810
we already discussed the problem thought
if there's network functionality

578
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:04,550
of course that will be began to text of
faith

579
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,840
so will have

580
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,440
much more if so

581
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,060
what we have to do is we have to rate
value

582
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:16,330
of each checks of check and Tom of

583
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:20,510
security and bus check improve security

584
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:26,080
for the binary in any way some checks
are more important than of

585
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,470
I was thinking about okay how

586
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:33,660
how I could do that I'm off to that the
kinda easy way

587
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:38,010
I'll ever complex no one came

588
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:41,060
to the waiting so um again

589
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:46,750
I have a small a a some of

590
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:50,010
possible value one mean

591
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:53,110
may have some impact on security

592
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:56,260
to being K

593
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:00,570
improve security and three innings
significantly

594
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:03,700
improve security so

595
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,810
later on we have a full

596
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:09,980
of look at different checks

597
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:13,170
and what's my point of view

598
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:18,900
wait for some real I i right

599
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:22,830
reliability another problem

600
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:26,200
if if implements this checks

601
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,460
we have to take care about the
reliability

602
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:34,400
a to get the proper result for example

603
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,790
bring a viability skin doesn't mean that
we can't discover its fun ability

604
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:43,360
that we fought positive ever before
negative so

605
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:47,210
how reliable this check are um

606
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:53,440
I already mentioned dupa as a law to
detect so his checks are quite reliable

607
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,010
but there will be other so again half

608
00:42:57,010 --> 00:43:00,120
three possible values 14 low reliable

609
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,420
liability that means the movie a lot of

610
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:07,490
I'll false-positive on makeup to

611
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:10,840
media reliable reliability really hard

612
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:16,220
3 hi reliability high reliability means

613
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:20,970
a overview almost no

614
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:25,820
fault how to make it possible

615
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,830
both quite easy I already mentioned

616
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:33,730
a to make a good metric approach should
be limited

617
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:37,620
just 324 of the checks

618
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:42,390
but I already mention have the focus
sometimes a witness of

619
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:46,250
but I can also brought some kinda
viability scanning optical detection

620
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:50,040
on the looks of on Mac all six of so

621
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,550
from I just have to ensure um

622
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:56,830
that I'm I'm doing the right checks
photographer rating system

623
00:43:56,830 --> 00:44:00,380
a and over checks

624
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:05,080
comfort some types must be replaceable
one check doesn't fit for

625
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:09,180
a Linux binary muster replace buy
another one

626
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:12,490
or I just threw fewer checks

627
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:17,590
your text about a few checks also means
they reside

628
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:21,830
not so reliable finally um

629
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:25,720
I define the range

630
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:30,140
of possible results to make the metric
comparable

631
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,310
evening independently operating systems

632
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:37,070
sold the timescale in approach

633
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:43,150
is from a now through 100 the metric it
so

634
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:46,280
frost

635
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,500
let's define checked the way

636
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:54,330
and reliability from to take some time

637
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:59,100
I won't want to discuss from its second
tho

638
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,510
um thats weight and reliability

639
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:05,600
among that I think that are

640
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,270
pretty good well use for different
checked DP

641
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:13,140
it significantly proof security

642
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:17,120
FTP support it means of 10b

643
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:21,500
reliable reliable detector are
thoughtful reside owners

644
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,210
as a result yet same applies for ethanol
say

645
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:29,120
%eh linger check I secondary check

646
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,290
is not so easy through detects

647
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:36,280
arm they are contact on the white house
implement

648
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,470
approach how to detect it suggests flick
is yours

649
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:43,340
for compiling top but there's room for
false positives

650
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:46,870
so reliability just through

651
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:51,010
but if we detected are if just like if
you lost

652
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:54,910
it significant proof security

653
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:59,520
not packed check the wait

654
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,460
a it may have some impact on security

655
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:07,760
I don't know that yet a detection

656
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,330
this media reliable um

657
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:14,860
that will be false positives

658
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:17,870
nope and part scheck

659
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:21,150
from if no bent functions are you

660
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:25,370
significantly improve security of also
room for

661
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:29,460
false positives of false-negative and so
forth

662
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:33,680
so I was defining rate and reliable
liability for its check

663
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,340
and if you checked are at it of course

664
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:42,920
bait and reliability have to be defined

665
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:47,780
some of not too difficult

666
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:52,410
the final result must be calculated so I
was constructing

667
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:56,660
smartphone law a additional freight and
reliability

668
00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:00,460
multi multiplied as a result possible
possible without

669
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:04,760
up from a now 26 one example

670
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,560
EP wat signif

671
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:11,110
security can be detective reliable

672
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:14,960
so if EP check

673
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,940
positive if the PSU we get

674
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:22,120
a value of six three plus three

675
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:26,380
6 mud one 6 the result if

676
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:33,000
0 get a 0 assuming

677
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,690
positive results so every trick hi we
can calculate

678
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:41,770
from

679
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:45,340
the results the primary site for its
check which is 6

680
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:49,640
6 safe Seah I am it depends

681
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,849
from

682
00:47:51,849 --> 00:47:56,859
from it might improve security so we
don't have a weight of three-year

683
00:47:56,859 --> 00:48:00,859
from primaries I does not fix its five
again the link objects

684
00:48:00,859 --> 00:48:04,569
six again next step if from a ride

685
00:48:04,569 --> 00:48:08,010
value 6 love 6.5 perfect give

686
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:11,829
23 and that's 100 percent

687
00:48:11,829 --> 00:48:15,060
one other person of possible

688
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:19,440
positive results of course

689
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,609
the next up this doing all the checks
and

690
00:48:24,609 --> 00:48:28,210
summarizing he soon as I it's in this
example

691
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:31,319
okay the peas in a pod as a lot as a
neighborhood

692
00:48:31,319 --> 00:48:34,839
a safe H is not

693
00:48:34,839 --> 00:48:38,520
joost so we have a zero you and

694
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:42,290
feeling corrosion is OK um I was
defining

695
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:45,329
goodling abroad as version a

696
00:48:45,329 --> 00:48:48,359
on your voter that mean

697
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:51,510
a business to do your 2005

698
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:54,520
2008 and upcoming

699
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:58,160
2010 so again we summarize

700
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,160
the stock will gets eighty

701
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:05,050
and no some percent speculation

702
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:08,109
a was hot stuff to remember that from
school

703
00:49:08,109 --> 00:49:12,290
for I was calculating

704
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:16,200
the results almost about 78 percent

705
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,760
however stripping down 2 percent sold
the final result if

706
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,849
78 thought 26 and

707
00:49:22,849 --> 00:49:26,170
we're pretty close to 100 percent so

708
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:31,010
doesn't look like a value that to bed
and I was looking for for a name for

709
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:31,970
that stuff

710
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:35,680
and because I'm always from stumbling
about TTY

711
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:40,540
I think TDI not too bad and that means
two months struck both

712
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:43,880
index a.m. if there will be some kind of

713
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:48,250
rules for for better name

714
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:51,920
I would take some just but for now I
call it TDI

715
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,480
but 0 I

716
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:03,480
okay for the name is fixed okay we have
to her arm

717
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:10,630
I I

718
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:14,500
a good argument okay

719
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:18,930
um to together understandable

720
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:22,060
interpretation of the result a

721
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:27,329
I've done small table with some
information how to

722
00:50:27,329 --> 00:50:31,930
top the result if you are better than

723
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:34,880
67 about sexism that mean

724
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,100
the traffic light is green remains

725
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:43,070
you can process confidential data with
this application yellow

726
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:46,930
it's between 34 and 67 that mean

727
00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:50,990
and the company context you can protest
public and internal data

728
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:55,230
and of course if you lower than 34

729
00:50:55,230 --> 00:51:00,130
conditioners Rep this application is not
rough um

730
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:03,390
again one thing for youth

731
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:06,720
the metric this way

732
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,490
across some kind of that that the
classification your company

733
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:14,520
so we must be able to say okay that's
internal data that's confidential

734
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,940
otherwise it won't work but we assume

735
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:21,360
a the company's there will always be a
data classification

736
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:25,670
I okay I good

737
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:29,260
soap also brought anytime

738
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:33,210
um little bit teary some ideas

739
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:36,900
from as I said its version 1 a only got
one

740
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:40,130
so maybe the forming over change

741
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:44,060
the future a across must proof

742
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:49,000
that it really has some value in
practice what I'm trying to do wat

743
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,850
getting my hands on some binary on from
Temple

744
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:55,860
a ants articulates

745
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:59,740
GTI so the cost approach false

746
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:01,609
um

747
00:52:01,609 --> 00:52:04,930
pick some software up from and
anti-virus program

748
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:07,990
pick some virus strong

749
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:11,350
really XK system through direct 3

750
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:15,940
and also collect some boundaries from a
Windows 2008 Server

751
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:19,330
so let's have a shot look about the
result

752
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:22,570
um because in a version of the poor

753
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:29,570
is already available 50 I check

754
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:34,869
we r checking a whole directory is
actually directory

755
00:52:34,869 --> 00:52:38,050
no the antivirus program directory

756
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:42,420
on to program link above seven top-10

757
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:46,020
too old a up not appalled at the P not
support

758
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:49,270
its a if report that wats

759
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:53,910
a gives of 21 look good link about

760
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:57,410
sick all yell stop not support

761
00:52:57,410 --> 00:53:00,410
euro having a look at

762
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:04,200
XP subject for euro

763
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:08,200
this Act 9.0

764
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,890
a philosopher of the TP supporter give
us a value of

765
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:15,260
about 78 so

766
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:18,990
you already see some improvements
Microsoft it

767
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:22,240
when everything goes topless pics and
forcing

768
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,790
DP on a set of support and

769
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:29,200
fine line scanning the binary of

770
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,960
Windows 2008 Server I

771
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:38,020
air from one and/or likes libraries a

772
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:42,290
but at least have story to tell

773
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:46,800
from 2005 of environment as a lot of
support

774
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,030
AP supporter again we have seven about

775
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:53,200
a same applies for Saab a

776
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,270
exit I'm

777
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:58,920
interesting a program

778
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:03,250
butthead a good result

779
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:06,550
on XP for you on to sell

780
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:10,690
a why because the UPS not support

781
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:15,820
your interesting so

782
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:18,860
with this program you just can't resist

783
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:22,500
public at went on a date up

784
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:26,250
next idea walls

785
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:29,840
okay that this a binary

786
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:33,830
a hold of Scott

787
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:38,770
Brock with Maga we assume

788
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:43,630
that if the concept is quite poor
Maharashtra pin- not

789
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:47,550
trough right why

790
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:50,580
I don't know okay let's have a look

791
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:56,319
so I was picking up some a MAV s some
boats

792
00:54:56,319 --> 00:55:03,020
let's have a look at the results

793
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:05,830
I'll check is running on a directory
called

794
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:11,360
ma bell just a few sample with a bill of
sale

795
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:15,450
we think on Flickr arm

796
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:18,280
0000 looks good

797
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:23,670
of 26 which still means not trust
throughout the day

798
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:27,059
a of

799
00:55:27,059 --> 00:55:32,130
why the truth that we receive some point
because

800
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:35,220
actual ocean Linda voz use

801
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:38,490
but itself 26 a

802
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:42,710
points and if not really mob at what at

803
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:46,579
we r a but of course

804
00:55:46,579 --> 00:55:52,130
right a boot if you know the metric ever
to construct Mogo

805
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:55,660
a that would get a result 100 percent

806
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:59,359
for now I don't look at Pecos

807
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:02,859
trip to us if I detect ripped off

808
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:06,440
there won't be able to to reach 100
percent

809
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:11,589
but for now it works without this

810
00:56:11,589 --> 00:56:15,240
reliable

811
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:18,500
talking about the results I think

812
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:22,960
the pitfall pitfalls

813
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,440
in stop would like to measure

814
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:30,020
for example what about effect of

815
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:33,119
and culture notes about implement from
now

816
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:36,390
I don't have a check to detect that but
maybe

817
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:41,950
the future other we've checked what
about find abilities the captain

818
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:44,040
mitigated what about

819
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:47,530
cleartext nit-pick communication how to
detect that

820
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:51,580
without using and engineering approach
what about

821
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:55,119
compliance requirements I don't know
their

822
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:59,200
or cut measure compliance requirements
maybe

823
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,349
it ok why us that all data is

824
00:57:02,349 --> 00:57:07,490
stall encryptor its own

825
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:11,520
an approach to measure the security

826
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:17,300
automated way what about detailed
security assessment Kendry

827
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:21,030
replace detect security assessment with
this approach

828
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:24,339
attitude security assessment would be
fit the result

829
00:57:24,339 --> 00:57:30,430
what the more time money and

830
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:33,670
I think we are not really able

831
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:37,380
to do with it security assessment
application that is used in our company

832
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:37,720
net

833
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:41,800
so there are pitfalls it's not

834
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:45,560
100 percent approach but I don't want
thing

835
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:49,940
the power of don't go for 100 percent
whenever Richards

836
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:53,220
try to implement an approach for this
years ago

837
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:58,670
for now I think this approach you
advance the truth

838
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:04,560
we can do kinda either rating of
security assuming

839
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:08,520
or trying to protect it's a program of
the developer of

840
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:12,310
our security if we are and

841
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:16,530
developing the software are faith on the
principal

842
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:20,290
of secure programming for example can
detect so

843
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:23,300
don't need to deter assessment minutes

844
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:26,410
save time and money we have

845
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:29,520
no legal problem when Ross

846
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,640
engineering Sophia some vendors on not
quite

847
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:35,920
neuwirth if you're stopping a rough

848
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:40,220
3 never

849
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:46,660
I'm we know its application must develop
a security in my aunts

850
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:49,960
which is a really important tech to
improve security

851
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:54,570
on thinking about security always
improve security

852
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:57,710
and to be honest from

853
00:58:57,710 --> 00:59:00,849
who is really doing detailed security
assessment

854
00:59:00,849 --> 00:59:04,070
office of top

855
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:07,550
improving the results

856
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:11,630
I'm just finishing a as already
mentioned

857
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:16,849
its work in progress so if we can do
more reliable check

858
00:59:16,849 --> 00:59:19,980
that significantly improve security
River

859
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:25,980
get better and more reliable result more
checks all to me

860
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:29,480
that less important if just one check is
failing

861
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:33,339
it's like different from there if i'm
following

862
00:59:33,339 --> 00:59:36,960
the most important principles of
security among

863
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,040
I can a it's also okay

864
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:43,349
if I support one special option a

865
00:59:43,349 --> 00:59:48,540
due to some requirements of don't

866
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:51,680
option myself um

867
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:55,540
the concept of the software has to prove
its practical use

868
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:58,770
in more assessments for now

869
00:59:58,770 --> 01:00:02,180
the results are promising maybe I will
stumble

870
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:05,670
about more pitfalls in the future I'll
among

871
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:08,700
I must say okay I see this offer is
really on

872
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:12,150
secure and the metric to it was a good
result um

873
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:15,830
than I have to improve the concept and
of course

874
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:19,300
the true must be approved for now it's
come on time-based

875
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:22,750
a only some offer plan checks are
implemented

876
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:25,820
um I will implement more checked future

877
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:28,900
from to be usable

878
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:32,089
the company context maybe we need
something to stop like

879
01:00:32,089 --> 01:00:35,520
user interface and the report section
about

880
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:40,170
from a South the book program okay

881
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:44,630
finishing almost in time it's time to
question the ninth

882
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:51,630
thank you very much

883
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:58,760
I would be wrong for questions if you
want two of them later

884
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:05,760
bro

885
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:15,130
about to

886
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:18,059
it's not a lot of data for now because

887
01:01:18,059 --> 01:01:21,259
from I just finished a true through to

888
01:01:21,259 --> 01:01:25,240
from automates medically operating

889
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:30,019
for I didn't have much time a the
checkered on cutting us off

890
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:33,910
I'll check that on some some boats like
with its operating system

891
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:40,910
mafia and up time no

892
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:48,160
not yet published today

893
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:55,820
good

894
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,680
it depends a because of that I'm doing

895
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,910
one check I'm doing a lot of checks

896
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:26,160
so and I'm trying to

897
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:30,040
to make a judgment about reliability how
important this is check

898
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:34,600
if the call quality is good is it really
hope for operating security

899
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:38,400
yes or no a.m. I can judge it but it's
not

900
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:43,310
3 may improve security but it doesn't
significantly improve security

901
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:47,930
so from the wait is quite low so it's
the checked his past

902
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:51,480
of failed from thousand

903
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:56,030
a change the rating too much there are
other texts that are more reliable have

904
01:02:56,030 --> 01:02:56,890
more weights

905
01:02:56,890 --> 01:03:02,180
and if they fear or pass a they will
change rating

906
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:09,180
more

907
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:51,250
that but just trusts us one of the
checks what a wonderful possibilities

908
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:54,570
ever checked a maybe they proof that up

909
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:58,570
not useful so don't receive

910
01:03:58,570 --> 01:04:01,710
we don't do you see any more the the
concept is

911
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:05,930
the checks are replaceable if a check is
not cuts we don't do that anymore

912
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:10,080
and you also can implement new new one
if someone writes some pretty cool

913
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,090
accrue true

914
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:14,540
from that is able to take effect also
cover channels

915
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:18,170
yeah we given that waits iraq
reliability

916
01:04:18,170 --> 01:04:21,540
and implement it we don't change the
final result

917
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:25,410
but the result itself is more reliable a

918
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:30,020
we have a better chance a to make a good
judgment this offer is trustworthy of

919
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:36,050
that's the idea okay thank you very much

920
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:40,860
up

921
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:44,240
long are in

922
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,420
Co
