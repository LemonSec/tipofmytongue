1
00:00:01,689 --> 00:00:03,590
okay we just needed some time

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,830
p change the laptops and the

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,830
exact ready now so a make

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,590
talk I think we ought to be very
interesting and the

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,050
you can always a go back to the to keep
it today because

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,619
cook de Gea already talked about it on
every into to grabbing

7
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:27,039
so and now would be a get cum you
commission about 10 or integrate good

8
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,229
identify track countries came to your
desk your manheim

9
00:00:30,229 --> 00:00:34,910
at work and dad I i think is working on
some kind of 10

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,769
strategies and all that of and so he's
okay

11
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:42,629
you can't for you attacked that can be
done

12
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:45,679
against take fed by the 646 help you
track

13
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,239
thank you phone gonna the night
introduction

14
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:52,420
and welcome to my presentation about
return or integrated

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:57,559
and athlete a hundred and I work for the
University of Mannheim

16
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:00,809
right now which in where I am a PhD
student

17
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:05,239
and what I'm going to present to you
today is actually what I

18
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,220
and research when I wrote my diploma
better 1 year ago

19
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:14,600
and yet today I'm going to show you at
home eating onto programming works

20
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,060
what's it all about so that the best
part of my presentation

21
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,660
and i won we've done that we can dig
into

22
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:25,080
certain domain in which we need that
kind of new

23
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,280
attack to by Pat that the protection
schemes so

24
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,740
and I'm pretty sure that many of you
have already had

25
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,080
be expecting you to enter into
programming especially after it wont

26
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,020
presented all clean the keynote today

27
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,670
and with the pretty hyped topic that
wall discuss

28
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,700
then many presentations and

29
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,190
past year security conference in such as
black head on back on

30
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,910
and and in the beginning at all

31
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,080
batted in 2007 well

32
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,300
full of shit and wrote his baby 30 on
the field in a complex on the bone

33
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,070
returning to the the without can't
recall so long

34
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,679
as always some crazy hacker dude had
already had them in idea

35
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,820
beforehand bad let's just say that

36
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,790
this what kind of the beginning of the
entire hype about returning to

37
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,720
programming no

38
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,770
on if you would not be what reconnoiter
program you call a bad I would say that

39
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,960
it's about how to ride program that do
not have any on call

40
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,360
until me an a few years ago

41
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,890
everyone had to do something that if you
would want to execute your own

42
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,910
computations on a computer then you
would need to happen

43
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,030
are you on cold back to Intec into the
system

44
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:46,290
and executed in Conway bottom the 4th
kind of the fourth time that we will be

45
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,710
all that the Phantom is not kind of true
and especially from the security

46
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,340
perspective

47
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,690
the problematic than many protections

48
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,220
rely on that certainty think that of

49
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,900
and using on called in the fifteen you
fed up in Tekken on called into the

50
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,430
system

51
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,660
me too abuse already it fits the are
cold-blooded

52
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,069
that all around the main memory and we
try to change this code together

53
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:16,330
to make it to arbitrary stop and when we
meet we mean

54
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:22,770
outreach stuff usually mean militants to
to perform

55
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,810
I tell you had written on to become
actually work

56
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,190
it might be wise to take a look back
into the three of up to new booties

57
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,260
especially to take a you can being

58
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,849
what I call it king of of a woman
abilities which is battle with your

59
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:38,310
attack

60
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,590
and battle with nobility

61
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,930
which polled the lot of headache too
many

62
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:50,050
security researcher and its I with the
steel multi one of the most widespread

63
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,830
on your abilities that you can find in
software

64
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:58,160
than multiple doctor that you run on
your computer is the written and feed

65
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,040
and as we all know the same on tight day
programming language

66
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,640
between with ultimate that did death not
have

67
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,700
any included databank tech and

68
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:14,630
to the idea bob beckel simply that mi
abue thief using data bone steak

69
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,129
20 and 30 baton and then we can also all

70
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:21,150
override country fare includes they
don't doubt

71
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,370
that %ah somewhere in the memory and
hand we can

72
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:30,529
died a pecan pecan this is actually what
most of the past

73
00:04:30,529 --> 00:04:33,919
and warmed moffett effecting wave that
we saw

74
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,919
are you blocked the one point continues
to bubble

75
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:41,249
unit he would he since they wanted and
many other many other local did

76
00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:44,559
looking at my baby baby can

77
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:47,699
schematic animation appalled how what
overflow work

78
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,039
not assume we have been batboy on the
left side

79
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:54,879
who could be when anything

80
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,279
who could be a with the long one

81
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:01,539
and some actually happened to track to
are in fact

82
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:05,719
this website any politically incorrect
reckon on the right side

83
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:08,729
which can come back to my brotha and
that we all know

84
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:12,740
on the brought the is loaded into memory
when it is executed

85
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,759
did programs loaded into memory when it
is executed

86
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,360
and by the operating fifteen so we have
to get mainly on the right side

87
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,249
with a beta back soon we're told all day
beta

88
00:05:24,249 --> 00:05:27,639
beta area which we need to me at growth
that

89
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:30,740
regressed into the computation and we
have a code area:

90
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,839
in which we home simply keep balking

91
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,379
let the two-minute ACA sent this HTTP
streaming

92
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,819
on Twitter I'm gonna pick include
Italian code

93
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:44,749
and he's been to data packet to direct
them

94
00:05:44,749 --> 00:05:47,889
and across the recommended to block the
the regret and hand

95
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:52,550
could data coming from memory so we end
up with cutting data which can be

96
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,930
controlled by an attacker

97
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,249
which is the memory and let's just
assume that we company

98
00:05:57,249 --> 00:06:00,400
but the overflow happen why brought the
thing this week with

99
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,039
which mean bad on the attack right now
able all

100
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:07,150
by watching the concrete wall and what
happened with that

101
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:12,110
the CPU chum somewhere from the cold
texan into the state affection

102
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,360
and from this point on your basically
own bacall game

103
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,900
now the attacker can do whatever you
want in your system

104
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,469
to having talked about Nicollet Mall are
we not really happy

105
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:29,150
think I'm all complemented an SEO mobile
a little touches

106
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,139
simple programming at and the old them
from the fact that

107
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:36,719
India and we have communion who program
all cold and

108
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:40,529
human to to iraq especially when they
are under pressure

109
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:44,069
with two day your happening all the time
when you

110
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:47,069
work in a productive environment where
you have that lines

111
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:50,839
which you have to stick to me and one
idea mate

112
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:55,020
might be too simply educate program with
its like don t want

113
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,479
my picked up when you called certain

114
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,569
possibly on the 19 in there

115
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:04,610
with there the compiler it been called
one in which that

116
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:08,430
that please don't use this function Q
use all per se

117
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,930
and a fun too that and a point when I do
and what I think most of the other

118
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:17,199
thinking at all to do with between thing
I do with I debating this morning

119
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,509
between I definitely do not want to tell
anyone

120
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:23,909
I do not want to be told what which
function I to do them which thank you I

121
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:24,759
didn't you

122
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:27,759
because I kind of grew up you think it's
nineteen

123
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,110
also if I want to happy particle called
Ben

124
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:35,089
that can be kinda problematic because me
the and thank you

125
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:39,379
and funky an economy and operating
fifteen

126
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:43,240
no and it may be a bad idea and more
appealing approach might be

127
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,979
to can be fine technical belushi so why
should we rely on

128
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:50,539
yurman which on are bong to do every

129
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:54,179
when you can quickly find a technical
solution that will I am

130
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:57,599
fend off any battle with low attack you

131
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,699
and with some not the the 50's by many
people

132
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:04,219
on how we can and defend of up against
Buffalo cloth

133
00:08:04,219 --> 00:08:08,349
that where the keepin' that could be
protection type in which you put them

134
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:12,919
random random value between punt return
to the memory

135
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:16,929
so that you can detect when on think we
all written and

136
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:20,319
punt returns and being tempered with am

137
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,710
they're all taking people integrity type
of protection

138
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,069
but in the end they all have will the
shortcoming that

139
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:32,560
they have some impact on a bomb negative
impact on performance

140
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,940
and you definitely do not want this to
happen

141
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,039
I wouldn't that be one promising
approach which has also been introduced

142
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,300
in the keynote

143
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:46,360
which is them on executing a breach and
the hat idea behind that it kinda simple

144
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,870
because of them if we look again at all
memory

145
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,949
on the right side then we can see that
the

146
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:57,079
a very simple committee come me

147
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:00,420
the girl called a memory look but I
think that we have company paid every

148
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:00,880
two

149
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,190
and we happen another cold region which
we keep all called

150
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:09,709
so and why would we want to let the CPU
execute called from a day to

151
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:13,880
region which can't possibly be meant to
contain any cold

152
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,920
in let's say ninety nine percent of all
cases

153
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,120
you do not want to you do not have to be
have been executed and made the region

154
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,290
because you do not have any coding your
day to reach in and

155
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:28,259
so why would we why do you do we allow
the CPU to do that

156
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:32,319
there are some exceptions to this mean
such ethnic just in time compiler

157
00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:35,410
and actually white Saab does not happen
such

158
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:39,470
protection implement it but that's not a
topic and I think that for 99 percent

159
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,339
located

160
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:44,009
it is not and necessary to have been at
the beautiful day to fix it

161
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:47,199
however there is still a them kind of
the problem

162
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:51,690
which is that traditionally on NT it is
to impossibly to do that

163
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:55,190
we cannot tell pic used if you if we
only you Houston

164
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,329
and you picking mechanism we cannot tell
the CPU

165
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:01,500
Tomoka memory return at

166
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,839
from readable but not executed me

167
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:08,209
and you definitely want to date
addiction to be readable some

168
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:12,079
there was nothing we could do until a
few years ago

169
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,610
went into a name default solve this
problem and introduce the so-called

170
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:19,940
XP in Eq and enacted this is basically
the same

171
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,319
include just called another way then AMD
to

172
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:28,000
when into an anti introduced its bid
with it was actually possible now

173
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,379
to mock suddenly tend to be non executed
me and is it with

174
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:34,379
what also is called date W Forex abroad

175
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:37,470
which means that you can't have a memory
v2 which is

176
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:44,470
rideable and execute a ball at the same
time

177
00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:48,699
so what do we do now I had a conflict
tech

178
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:52,920
in technical into memory a level of home
when you want to execute a cold

179
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,440
this get detected by the CPU and
expectant

180
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,660
of your own which means that at

181
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,079
this is not a perfect solution because
we feel happy programming error since I

182
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:03,959
don't paint

183
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:07,069
but weekend deal at least we won't get
own

184
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:12,550
because an attack I won't all be able of
executing its own instructions

185
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:16,589
hidden it is likely that the problems
with the cracks will have to be thought

186
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:17,639
of it like that

187
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:22,769
but at least a attacker and do whatever
they want on your PC

188
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:26,879
this long thing to be co kinda promising
approach and that's also why it was

189
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,459
implemented by Microsoft

190
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:32,519
athlete thing called a tactic you can
prevent in which you probably got up

191
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,190
DP it was introduced in Windows XP
Service Pack 2

192
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:40,410
at the top 10 feature which means that
you would have to explicitly

193
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:44,990
unable on enable it if you would want to
use the photograph that

194
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,060
and in window with the 64-bit

195
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:52,240
it's an opt-out Peter with me that you
happy misleading lately

196
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,930
and %uh people to run with the EP by
default

197
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,110
I mean pick to win gold in the following
because the and in

198
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:03,160
be dominant the them especially for
malware and

199
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,829
they're all I wanna operating between
but certainly not be a

200
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:10,350
the neckwear and have also implemented

201
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:13,839
similar techniques song Monica to beat
back

202
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,129
has already been implemented for many
other operating

203
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:21,470
and in the end the only they all rely on
the Mon executed

204
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:25,319
it provided by employer and in the
minority

205
00:12:25,319 --> 00:12:29,569
I all breaking through the fall and as
you can imagine

206
00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:33,089
but beyond that no because my talk is
not gone and here an

207
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:36,240
will be intuitive idea on all that
echoes am

208
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,949
have gotten and that yet a kind of idiot
know everyone that

209
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:43,500
to think the bald the problem that we
now have am

210
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,379
you in gap and you know it that effect
of infecting any

211
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:51,860
own called into the system why don't we
test abuse existing code in the system

212
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,579
because we have plenty of cold are lying
around somewhere memory

213
00:12:55,579 --> 00:12:58,709
because we have library which are loaded
into memory

214
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:04,019
sector the thano library are we have
operating fifteen like to read

215
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:07,870
loaded into the system and we also have
to program called which is number in the

216
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,660
memory in

217
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,660
full wanted me to PB abuse this cold

218
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,180
to lead do good dirty work for us

219
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:19,199
and to show you all yeah kinda youth

220
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:22,629
on wanting to take a look at the
thinking completely

221
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:26,420
if you'll have already programmed in C
you might know what did a

222
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,050
while the other two and to kind of
simple point in which is provided faulty

223
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,050
to them

224
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:34,639
and what he doesn't it takes one
argument which is a

225
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,980
normal screen and it then

226
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,560
execute the on Union the

227
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,410
program all the documents provided in
despairing meter

228
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:48,959
on the cell you on the Linux with them
on the dotted to

229
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,100
take the document and execute basha
whatever cell with it

230
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,519
no on let's assume we have to think
through somewhere in memory

231
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,170
we know where death instead of on
infecting alone called into the system

232
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:06,490
we could complete a on provide only the
para meterse

233
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:09,930
am which is in that case the W get that
point at all

234
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:13,670
left bought point of bought which as you
all know to

235
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:17,069
download from binary from the weapon
executed and people like this

236
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:21,779
para me to come around the back with the
and only time to the system function

237
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:25,540
then what would happen if it will get
executed and all up to you

238
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,889
detection letter DP won't get any notion
of that

239
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:32,269
because we did not provide any cold we
simply can't why did a

240
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:36,170
simple beta 3 and

241
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:39,399
windy and what you able and what we're
capable of it

242
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:43,129
we can executes arbitrary binary nobody
left

243
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:47,189
anti-peace completely useless in that
case hidden

244
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:50,879
means what actually is called return to
the

245
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:56,649
the attack

246
00:14:56,649 --> 00:15:00,819
1 p.m. went me know what utilities

247
00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:03,870
and we are not far away from returning
to programming the

248
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:08,120
to don't get it but want me not return
to the the and act like that in return

249
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,180
to lift the

250
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:13,509
we look at fine-tune which means that we
can if you don't repeat the banks into

251
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:14,300
doing

252
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,790
all the workers and no imagery to
northern programming

253
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:21,290
we sipped from Franklin to certain
instruction sequences

254
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:25,339
concept of dumping to function which
untruth instruction sequences

255
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:28,730
and we try to tame the instruction
seeking to together

256
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:32,649
to come sequentially execute them

257
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:36,639
an the idea is that if we have enough of
these instructions treatment that

258
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,949
saying look they we have an instruction
sequence that can perform in at

259
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:41,089
operation

260
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:44,610
and another instruction not Ubuntu
construction people to

261
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,339
that can perform and multiplication an
alt not like that

262
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:52,129
that %um connecting these actually need
in an think that not to implement

263
00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:53,589
high-level languages

264
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:57,300
and when you get an upbeat instructions
you can do we can actually do

265
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,720
arbitrary computation which means that
Mia at

266
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,120
powerful at any other am compiled called

267
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,410
the only requirement that be too happy
we to control the back

268
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:11,939
what we can do that anyway we have a
couple inability

269
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:15,170
and even if you happen to people with
Claude utility

270
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:22,170
corrected me and always will be in which
you can finally on both their

271
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:26,740
on on going to show you how would
exclude actually worked on your computer

272
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,079
and before I do that I took have one
multiplied

273
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,230
that explain all call Detective executed
on

274
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:37,309
intellect 36 computer am go at it at an

275
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:41,230
every other Architektur we have one
instruction pointer

276
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,269
and by the name of the IP in this cave
which

277
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:48,529
point to clear memory instruction
indicate your POP pointing to

278
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:52,870
come runnin' instruction but I think the
pic and Kim random binary

279
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:56,189
the point in Phx compact

280
00:16:56,189 --> 00:16:59,639
and when it get back to that inflection
point increases on to the next

281
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:00,399
instruction

282
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,230
and flaunting we have a pic sequential
execution of infection

283
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:09,500
the construction in the normal paid you
could have a common threat in between

284
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:09,970
there

285
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:14,160
but italian mom called get executed on
your computer

286
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,480
in when it comes to reconnoiter
programming things are a bit more

287
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,440
different

288
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,040
this animation should give you the big
picture on how it works

289
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,050
let us do we have a woman rebel
fine-tune and

290
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:28,830
which hath a bottle with low inside and
that's something that's called in from

291
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,180
Matthew Haggart right

292
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,240
to am exploit a vulnerability

293
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,630
in order to do a v10 oriented attack
again system

294
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,160
we have two nickels banking on the left
side with the instruction pointer

295
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,520
22 the prologue on the right thank you
can see the back

296
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,000
area which it uninteresting at this
stage

297
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,330
let the thing we bball be depression
pointer

298
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:53,850
and finally comes to me both know the
bottle will happen

299
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:57,300
between that we know are in talks all
with back

300
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,460
you can override yet the arbitrary

301
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,490
information back and in that case you'll
me over rolled

302
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:08,190
ain't return point tool the property
call

303
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,910
with no point with the instructions
sequined

304
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:15,550
eighty dole this is than the memory
address of

305
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:18,550
with respect to beaten you and memory at
local

306
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,800
reconstructive treatment and Paul no

307
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,190
and and to me being

308
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,300
normal function return nothing happened
on

309
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:32,950
if it reaches the standard return call
return instructions to make they depict

310
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:36,670
on it will then load been well you

311
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:39,680
all the data being pointed to but use P
into the

312
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,910
instruction pointer cool but we have it
yet the back pointer pointing to do that

313
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:47,150
modified bacteria and Beth

314
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,940
mail you know get loaded into
instructing it would be instruction

315
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,550
pointer

316
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,970
which means that didn't belong to or
instruction sequence a

317
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,700
some instruction a getting executed we
happen next week on

318
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,990
sequin the next return threaten with
already told you how these instruction

319
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,060
sequences look like

320
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:07,320
the all and in an return inspection when
we have not only to threaten

321
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,130
at that point was automatically
increased and

322
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:15,110
we now point to me the instruction
sequence be

323
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:19,160
between that now be get executed the
next meet on Flickr com

324
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,120
and along he didn't call returned with a
broken actually

325
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,650
actually look like in your PC if you
would be back a return on to program

326
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:33,450
in the back a been what you with the

327
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:36,490
to summarize on controlling the back

328
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:40,680
it absolutely sufficient to perform
arbitrary con people

329
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,730
modification and if we have enough be

330
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,900
useful instruction sequences we can even
do arbitrary computation

331
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:54,900
and be a test that powerful at any other
on normal compiled program would be

332
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,350
business and kind of where I started my
my work

333
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:03,410
because what i'd thought you had already
been been researched

334
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,740
am in the what people did I mention
where

335
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,140
home menu the complete scanned and a
good thing

336
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:14,040
of you live tree pollen and such would
be constructed between

337
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,040
and what he did was he took loaded into
defender

338
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:21,220
and for any an instant action sequence
12 constructed treatment

339
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,220
that would let him to perform in Addison
that we

340
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,360
let him to me the modified back pointer

341
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,930
because we need that to implement beaten
want to come because in

342
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:34,710
in our situation at that point a adopt
the role of the instruction pointer

343
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:38,250
and stuff like that you really a tooth
that down in

344
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,870
Holiday Inn at a specific the library to
do that

345
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:45,310
and his decide what that and bacall one
the

346
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,820
library which is around a few megabytes
what

347
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,020
sufficient to allow for arbitrary
computation

348
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,720
and got them all he also introduced the
name get it

349
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,800
which is nothing but a return when two
people called

350
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,380
that performs a specific task I will use
to

351
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:06,280
his name on the net flight you time

352
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,400
to get into that they a bunch of 10
together

353
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,250
are you constructed sequences that can
ask to variable

354
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:18,910
I think that modify the stack pointer

355
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,020
this is where I thought it might and my
my work

356
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,980
and the problem at this stage a kind of
want that

357
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,510
it was all proven to work in theory some

358
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:33,830
it was beaten that I think that Lutfi
had enough intricately painted to do

359
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:34,350
that

360
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,950
but and no one had ever showed that it
actually works in practice

361
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:42,170
and their really walking all domain in
which you really need it

362
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:46,350
desperately-needed written on to
programming because we could all

363
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:50,040
still do defendant returned to the
p-type attack and for instance

364
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,820
if you want to attack it spend untold
brought that from the outside

365
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,820
which FTP enabled on what we can do for
included

366
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:01,430
began to return to the the attack again
the system function

367
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:05,210
that it will within the operating system
that can be disabled the P

368
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:08,880
so the op with being that I would do
when I want

369
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,290
if I wanted and and an attacker I would
simply to to

370
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:16,430
thought with a return to lift the attack
a call this function today will be P

371
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:19,750
and from then on I can do what I want I
can fully take my own called

372
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:24,340
song this is kind of and yeah boring
because we don't need

373
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:27,860
return to bring commit all lebanon
returned all terrible

374
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:32,090
am some situations in which it is really
on the on the

375
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:35,980
to you can happen to me and mount them

376
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,720
some type of attack and that's what I'm
going to talk interesting

377
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,190
my presentation

378
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:46,450
on it too little tipped and away from me
tonight a programming

379
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:51,120
into operating system security and if
you were cute

380
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,210
if you only record operating system you
might know that

381
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:57,530
operating system a separate your
computer into two

382
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:00,970
different pot which is you the land and
conlan

383
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:04,060
and the reason why did done it simply
because

384
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:07,430
all that the to you do you study we
don't calculate a

385
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:10,870
and there is some programming airing
your calculator then you definitely do

386
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:11,630
not want

387
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:15,670
cool net that programming error dress
your entire PC

388
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:18,900
so you don't want too happy the screen
of death just because

389
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:23,210
they want to be seen by fear or whatever
and because why

390
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:28,050
the operating system at the break been
proven its and non pulitzer area

391
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:31,190
unproven it's cold such as the window
calculator

392
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:34,540
cannot access all of the memory B two
things with them

393
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:38,440
and he's can point then not and directly
communicate with

394
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,340
the hardware that if the copy driver and
the operating company itself

395
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:47,160
we have to operating colonel and Ubuntu
private which run with and what a

396
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,610
beautiful

397
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:51,140
proven it to between that they can do
basically do whatever they want

398
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:54,450
and we have other mom called mama broth
that

399
00:23:54,450 --> 00:24:00,140
simply and have gotten restriction in
what they can do

400
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,290
while taking a look at it and it's a
beautiful perspective

401
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:06,400
we know that a compromising all a

402
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,650
are proven its component in the written
is company worst-case scenario

403
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:14,010
because when you manage to do that but
you manage to do that

404
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,610
you can now do whatever you want with
them and you can do all the net did

405
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:18,350
doctor

406
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:22,920
hiding brought that the hiding network
connection

407
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,950
in other words you can really program a
need kid

408
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:29,250
mmm which is something I've been
thinking uncommitted

409
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,830
back again the Windows operating a
company operating could be unintentional

410
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:37,410
no on some people thought about how we
could defend herself against that attack

411
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:40,910
we could at least on prevent attackers
from

412
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:44,580
execute the they're called in
three-minute

413
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:49,070
operating in privileged mood between
that at that new people to have a ball

414
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,310
came within a call me

415
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:53,890
that and the idea what that even if you
had arbitrary

416
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:57,100
and your ability in touch in three
minutes

417
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,880
component and an attack with to be
unable to me

418
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,280
on week like these will not believe he
to let the

419
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,360
tolerant kid there were some papers
about this issue

420
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,580
and the mall the two most important Mon
all

421
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,340
it I'm day technical and the second one
will take whether

422
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:20,810
B-thirty program which I am broken by
the US to put you in contact melon

423
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:25,230
and what they do with on they all rely
on them kind of hyper like that brought

424
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:28,400
which meant that to happen a dedicated
component which is

425
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,260
even a ball a common component and from
this I politely

426
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:37,420
mmm Bay and Paul to properties

427
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:41,300
I want to paint eases them no I'm riding
on a critical priority

428
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,540
between that it is not possible point
ECA to override

429
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,940
live in its cold in the fifth and then
executed and it all to not possible to

430
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,760
Intec

431
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,540
a new code to some other on other area
in the system

432
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:57,950
and then execute you did we own you
talking about units called in this case

433
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:01,110
you can't do do whatever you want you
the land

434
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:05,040
and at the end of a kind of very
interesting attack a mani

435
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,520
between that we can have an attack a
Mitch may have already owned

436
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,660
everything in the usual and between that
under Windows he can happen

437
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,600
administrator

438
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,280
ride related and on the Linux you can
have repeatedly to

439
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,770
furthermore we'll all arbitrary
vulnerabilities in the con-

440
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:24,960
and bill on the teeth to them on

441
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,720
it is not possible for m.tech one attack
a to attack mcconnell itself

442
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,890
at least that's what they see so

443
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:36,300
am in the end it but both teams of input

444
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:40,650
have somebody whitelisting approach in
which you'll simply specify

445
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:43,680
the specific on and private

446
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,730
which you are allowed to be loaded into
them and everything else

447
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:50,940
any other cold is then prevented from

448
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:55,810
being executed in your system for let's
just have a quick meeting the Queen

449
00:26:55,810 --> 00:27:00,190
to see how it works from a technical
point of view

450
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:04,250
you click the extension of the QM hot
%um hypervisor

451
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:07,610
and which your kind of people it

452
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:12,120
modern reproductive of system but more
people come to Britain

453
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,290
got you need to have %um running and you
you need to have a completely emulated

454
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:16,970
if you

455
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:20,480
for it to work however when he darted
did

456
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,250
keep the copy of the entire political
guest memory

457
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:27,340
when when you have a will to them
running in %um more than it

458
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:31,700
simply copy you he couldn't memory
inside the hype a lighter

459
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,560
copy memories call to settle memory and
it did not

460
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:39,950
acceptable from within the guest
operating system

461
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:43,930
and what did not know is that every time
when an instruction is being executed

462
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:47,880
it compare the instruction again its
counterpart in

463
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,050
personal memory when both been
threatened

464
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:55,270
the second match then everything's okay
the interconnect acute it

465
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:58,450
am however here the instructions not
Matt

466
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:01,600
band it generate them get a pic Becton

467
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,620
and which could have been because

468
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:08,780
Naughton to the nephew in which it might
happen the first scenario is that

469
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:12,050
and you try to get loaded and when that
is the case

470
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:15,090
it right to of a ride the private to by
computing

471
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:18,450
a simple hash value over the code
section and

472
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:22,660
when this have to do with inside
Whiteley it to copy the code in the

473
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,480
federal memory

474
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,720
and continued execution and in the
second case

475
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,270
but they an attack a detective called in
the system and wanted to execute it

476
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:36,140
it didn't the case band the system we
often try to authorize the cold

477
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:40,120
about you cannot happy matching actual
value which is unlikely

478
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,220
which means that an attacker cannot have
yielded

479
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:47,430
attack Nick lit up with implemented for
Windows and Linux

480
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:50,540
on a typical conflict that then and

481
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:54,870
the interesting thing now is that we are
entitled to them

482
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:58,840
which we cannot exceed in which you
cannot detect and execute a single own

483
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,070
CPU instruction

484
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:03,720
with a few in threatened Piedmont
elementary thing you can run in a

485
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,460
computer

486
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,760
and in this case if you can rank well
and we can

487
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,100
we really cannot execute a single own
instruction

488
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:16,110
and this is somewhat big payoff
attacking target way we can go into

489
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,330
programming attack

490
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:21,020
because now we cannot completing began
to lick the of and

491
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:24,820
completed able protection because
protectionist within the hyper white men

492
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:28,400
and we cannot accept the hyper Micah I'm
a on now we can

493
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,400
do try to mount all return when to
attack

494
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:37,160
and a what it was all about

495
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,360
now we have a lot to them and let

496
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,050
in the beginning we have to think about
which employs to retake

497
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:48,110
to let's say program a meeting on to
defeat because they routed

498
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:51,740
be kinda party made attack against the
company and what I wanted to do at that

499
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,570
date won't

500
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:56,440
I wanted to maybe maybe look return we
didn't get that runs on a nickel or

501
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,400
thick wider

502
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:03,120
artificial that the city-county that
they make can be submitted

503
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,710
am what could we do we could do the same
being that cool water founded in it but

504
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:11,580
that paper which it we can think the
fire about the family

505
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:15,200
manually scan at this thing called for
the construction people that that we

506
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:15,580
knew

507
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,300
that we need then we can taint even try
to keep it together

508
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,580
to form a a complex scene kid that the
they

509
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:25,790
hi to brought the or hide network
connection

510
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,910
that'll like that webcam you can imagine

511
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,340
I did not want to spend and that the two
months on

512
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,610
Kenny in your copay that's because

513
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:39,410
didn't really time-consuming work and

514
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:42,510
on really boring and time-consuming work

515
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:46,990
and furthermore there is also another
problem which it that let me be happy

516
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:50,400
done that attack again one company
against one pt

517
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,830
and it actually works and we cannot
compete on POF

518
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:57,300
the cold that we have to another system
even if it meant the same operating

519
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,400
system gotten

520
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,590
because you have a completely new set of
private being loaded

521
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:06,430
which means that there is other cold
which you made 120

522
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:10,030
with you might want to abuse for your
attack and all cool

523
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:13,120
on you might have a different operating

524
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,680
at like two different operating system
working to went on a Linux

525
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,350
when you have an operating could become
one distribution and it's probably

526
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:23,770
the cold you could be different than in
another distribution because

527
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:28,590
they have compounded with different
black up with some other stuff in it

528
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:31,990
and that simply because yet but the
reason why

529
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:37,090
business and some kind of yep at a
parade am

530
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:41,830
what we needed we need to me actually
automate return oriented programming

531
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:45,490
and we actually need some tunes that do
all day

532
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:48,570
on all the knack to work with

533
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:51,920
that in the end weekend broke a mean kid
just not comfortable

534
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,200
as we would program any other meet cute
in a

535
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,670
standard high-level language at st. doc
I to three-peat we have two problems

536
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:04,950
and a very very environment copy to them
it's going to have to tone copays

537
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:08,700
and we definitely want to you that many
instructions that you can find in the

538
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,660
memory

539
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,940
and the second point is that they're
walking all return

540
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,990
oriented compiler at the state on

541
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:19,380
there were only in benetton pilot that
let you compile be called

542
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,940
on but all what you can put up to it in
the end they all produce

543
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:27,320
Missy independent cold and that
definitely not what we want

544
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,340
we want to have fun to compile a that
generate the back a location

545
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:34,450
that we need he did to return address
that we need to

546
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:38,150
mondo attack and what we did is we

547
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:42,060
created a framework that facilitated the
development of conflict between 12

548
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:42,840
called

549
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,930
artist pringle capital 3 major component
which I'm going to show you the

550
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:47,510
following

551
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:52,350
and it was implemented for 32bit Windows
operating between

552
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:55,730
good than the predominant

553
00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:01,130
that thing that you can even while

554
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:04,240
gonna take a look at the freemen
overview we have for the first component

555
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:04,890
which is

556
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:08,010
the constructor and what the contract
about this

557
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:11,860
it 10th a given that of binary for
instructions deep into

558
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:15,630
when I love hate we took and the
operating could become

559
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:18,810
which is anti-western not act on the
window they took

560
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:22,020
live in %um window last 2 332

561
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:27,200
directory along with on the other
private that a load in the system

562
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,240
which is and the by on the date

563
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,900
but at the win32 okay up with the driver
all the

564
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:39,510
by the contrived and whatever privately
confine which are loaded in the system

565
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:42,740
home constructed 2nd 2010 practice he
pleaded

566
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:47,010
effect extract them all and what did end
of the it right to me automatically

567
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:47,580
compute

568
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:51,900
a certain set of getting thought nothing
we have a well-defined could've gutted

569
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:55,350
we need one gets it cool perform in
addition between two variables

570
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:59,110
we need one get it to rule on performer
be beaten by

571
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:02,130
between two variables because we need
late and you that

572
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:06,330
to implement a lot high-level language
to the concert constructing what

573
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:10,300
with community Twitter with some not
control because it might be a bit too

574
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,060
complex

575
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:15,659
but them in the end it happens don't you
think because 13th record keeping the

576
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:19,649
can be found quite often in the cold and
campaign people put up in the cold

577
00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:23,679
and it always try to me and you laid
edition

578
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,220
yea on the T you could point that you
can immune emulate a modification

579
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,429
what you have in addition and a looong
and stuff like that and because of that

580
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:33,060
right to do that actually

581
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:36,899
at good at that can so the open of the
instructor is

582
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:40,520
a little get it which we constructed
from the given code base

583
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:45,409
and these gadgets I've been taken at an
import along with a high level

584
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:48,690
ballpoint let file written in a
dedicated language

585
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:52,300
into the compiler we have our own
dedicated high-level language

586
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:56,220
which is very similar to other
high-level am thank you to which

587
00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:01,440
really allow them to program am just as
comfortable as we would program

588
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,040
in the CT confusing the company

589
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,080
which I'm going to show you and on the
next flight

590
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,430
thought this was the second component
and but then a compiler and into

591
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:14,440
but paid all we need

592
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,680
we have to lower component which is
nothing but a you like to read

593
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,930
which is supposed to be linked again an
exploit because at the state of

594
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,080
compilation

595
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:27,560
we do not know the final memory
addresses to the instructions repeated

596
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,910
and it's banned from the fact that and
every time

597
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:33,790
drive I get loaded into the two main
memory of course when you put it with

598
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:34,390
them

599
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:38,550
and it is loaded to threaten papercraft
and it made the trip contains

600
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:41,770
whenever you want your whenever you
people you through them

601
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:46,070
depend and on you the awning the order
in which you go to private

602
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:50,160
and we really need these basic threatens
into them

603
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,730
good otherwise we do not know be fine
memory at retton

604
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:57,310
we can find instructions to complete
that we want to jump you

605
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:01,420
with a loaded up the it pictures the on
the compiled code

606
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,920
on and simply at the papercraft all the
molded

607
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,110
crimes

608
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:11,770
a new unit have an example on all I
guess it might look like

609
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:15,280
let's say we want to have to get it that
perform the net operating between two

610
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:15,880
variables

611
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,570
so that we can make a youth game and
operated no high-level programming

612
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:20,580
language

613
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:24,100
let assume and we have the following
instructions even

614
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:28,790
with your phone by the contractor on you
might be arranged in the following way:

615
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:31,810
and 10 then together to construct

616
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:36,680
before we get it what we continue right
I did

617
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:40,260
my point on because the poppy TX back

618
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,570
and infection treatment I omitted

619
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:48,070
return and trucked in from the right
side for the sake of readability

620
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:51,570
but you can view this is what action
actually will be on the back

621
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:54,870
in the end we will have a and track to

622
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:58,760
15 threaten to cancel were here and
wanted others and it load

623
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,970
on a pop the memory content

624
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:05,430
into East TX which is on the back alone

625
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:08,660
can be happy return address and in the
neck field

626
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:12,530
me dispute and the content that you want
to load into the act

627
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:17,250
in this case it's just a blank line and
what happened bennett and we have a BB

628
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,060
for rent

629
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:21,410
which is wheeled into PDX on the memory
being

630
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:24,590
pointed to by you TX up next

631
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:28,340
seven feet see what we can do with the
twins naked weakened old memory

632
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:28,840
well-used

633
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,720
internet is this and we do that white
because we have a

634
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:39,070
on operating with to operand to do that
again with the Act people well you into

635
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:39,790
your neck

636
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:43,090
and then be before and it and then being

637
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:47,660
assuming the phone such an instruction
sequences that an effective treatment

638
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:51,580
which performs in and between to
register on we now have

639
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:54,880
being recalled in your act and what we
can do it we took

640
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,440
right back that we thought into home
another memory variable

641
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,190
we didn't get the night before we can on
the act concept actually

642
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:07,870
constructing and getting because they
really come between

643
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:12,230
expected by you can check

644
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:15,750
on it to people with an attitude you can
talk about the compiler are you can

645
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,750
finally see you

646
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:21,350
something real from compile a cold I
think that it was all done in an

647
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:24,420
dedicated programming language because
than

648
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:28,000
demoss from tweaks that we face

649
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,640
in which are very own but the pic to
meet in order to broaden

650
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:35,460
ramming so we thought that it might be
wise to implement on programming

651
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,240
language

652
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,540
instead of simply modifying an existing
compiler of latte AC compiler

653
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:44,210
but in the end it all I am you a quite
like sequel

654
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:47,900
what we have here it we have a import
statement

655
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,510
which means that we can actually park
thank you three mixed on cold

656
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:55,790
so in this case we took him for the
printer 12 from me 30 TD allow

657
00:38:55,790 --> 00:39:00,080
which with the bennett library on the
window and between thing now with that

658
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,440
we can now actually called it function
4690

659
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,500
me would have been the plot line is that
it into print all day have a wealth

660
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,170
than statement on the console and the
reason why we

661
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:15,390
can when we have actually implemented b6
come function called is that

662
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:19,170
and the cable the company other chronic
Paul

663
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:22,760
the entire teeth and I'd like to read
and we definitely do not want to

664
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,640
implement

665
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,850
let's say 3 copy all the time in Olympia

666
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:30,770
cool white why would you would you want
to implement it when we can be fine

667
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:34,540
the thing called in the already existing
cunning panel

668
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:38,900
you can so what you can do it you can
really I'm call the common cold is kinda

669
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,580
cool

670
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:43,270
you can declare customary abled

671
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:46,780
that at into not like that %um into two

672
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:50,640
character and structure that all three
basic

673
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,360
on your basic data types and you can too

674
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:59,340
the Grattan St wouldn't feel people's
what's going on to do with you can have

675
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:04,140
game yeah publicly arbitrarily complex
expression

676
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:07,140
better than the last line where you
happen I plucked the

677
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:11,230
might indicate a bike be like that they
didn't seem all connected thank you

678
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:15,119
but an actual implementation quick login
or programming language

679
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:19,480
thing but you can see on the topic if
not the entire code I left alt 1.2

680
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:23,580
because that would be would have been
too much gold but with a computer

681
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,660
you can actually do stuff like and week

682
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:30,590
democratic function called no language
so you can actually call and quickly

683
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:31,840
from within quickly or

684
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,160
you can declare function much wanted you
want

685
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,619
you can simply call the concorde I
already told you that you can acquire

686
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:38,970
new

687
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:44,230
they can be arbitrarily nested you can a
week only method condition

688
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:48,650
you can you combined a conditional
expression

689
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:52,640
it is very obvious that business beauty
really comfortable way to

690
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,830
a program called an did not far away
from

691
00:40:55,830 --> 00:41:00,570
to moms deprogramming now we are
actually able

692
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:05,510
formulating only kid in a high-level
behind the language

693
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:09,180
and and you did not accompany oldest
actually look like a memory

694
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,900
soldiers and to compile you thought on
because back allocation

695
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:16,100
sold at that point in the entry point
into me

696
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:20,500
from be element in memory what you can
see that %um

697
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,990
most businesses simply am because
returned to action

698
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:28,230
after the treatment effect on many of
them simply reappear because we always

699
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,100
need them

700
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:32,360
its record-keeping to two-year-old
memory values and directed at them

701
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:36,210
like that and in between you can also
find complete ban

702
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:39,470
and which other way you that you need to
pop into me directed

703
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:43,000
to the dance hall and the real finally
return rate it cold

704
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,070
actually look like

705
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:50,450
on just one thing about gloating I told
you that

706
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:54,850
me too use of the basic threatened and
in the final stage because we need to

707
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,920
know where private loaded in the memory

708
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:01,070
and lucky did am in beginning I thought
it did could be

709
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:06,030
quite a big problem because am me to do
that from the nine people it's called

710
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:09,450
because we need to prepare our tech from
the cockpit area

711
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:12,680
and we do not have actor to the memory
v2

712
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,760
in in which the driver private all
laundered

713
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,270
I thought that it might be hard to
actually get define it written

714
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:22,300
but was not to be and under window

715
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:26,200
we have to standard and I'm to buy
private functions function provided by

716
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:30,000
been by my people and what it's come to
da truth it can be returned

717
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,920
although to try both with their base
address and you can call this country

718
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,290
from

719
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:39,140
even on people it's called me indicating
you really have no problem

720
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:43,350
and interest in need of a weapon the
Linc gonna knock you can be to act a cat

721
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:43,640
on

722
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,300
I think Blackrock left what do you think
something like that

723
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,550
and if not then returned to make the
graph below two drivers I don't know why

724
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:53,600
y de implemented it because I don't see
any

725
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,390
situation in which really need to know
old debate addresses motor driver

726
00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:00,390
in Montreux that's called and your

727
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:05,050
paid it's just there

728
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:08,330
before I saw you are very lucky that I
and program

729
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:12,860
to them talk about the toothpicks are
talking about the constructor

730
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:16,260
on the interesting question though is
that and

731
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:20,560
doctor is to construct a capable of
constructing all necessary get it

732
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,940
fall to cope be in which we work with am

733
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:27,700
because a knife that the constructor
connect with certain implications in a

734
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,630
fountain

735
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:32,110
and what we did is we'd have to the
constructor in 10 different machine

736
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:35,560
running didn't Windows operating system
question and we did why

737
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:39,630
one with Google com paid which mean that
related run

738
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:42,640
over them pain and all older drivers

739
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,080
and in the second can we own the
considered

740
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:51,290
the company file it along with being a
Windows 32 33 driving

741
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:55,280
became these two components always have
to be loaded into has been

742
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,470
you definitely have to call into them
and you definitely need a win32

743
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:04,650
driving 250 an get the pic with myself
look when kinda cool

744
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:07,820
if my partner with you that in all cases

745
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:11,780
the constructor with capable of and
constructing all necessary get it

746
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:14,840
and agree on have all necessary get it
we can

747
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:20,030
youth all me the functionality at
provided by the programming language

748
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:23,800
you to form from but it think you can
thank you

749
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,830
in case of and written reciprocate

750
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:30,360
United XP those between environment you
have in your own good

751
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,440
22,000 return instruction and that is

752
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:38,800
Baldino who actually capital necessary
getting

753
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,980
another anything that we measured was
the runtime overhead

754
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:45,040
of program complete an order program

755
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,990
created created with all framed it to
implement it be two different questions

756
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:49,990
a quick thought

757
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:53,550
that way through to the people polled
and we didn't see and in

758
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:57,830
only turn on to become that which the
algorithm call typically the fame

759
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:01,490
me that it's all five hundred policy
random integers and

760
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,560
yet the repugnant kind of game

761
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,940
significant we had a floating by a
factor of

762
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:10,980
135 for return on the program

763
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:15,050
I don't know why this is the case but I
assume that it has something to do with

764
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:16,640
catching up to my face in

765
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,490
because as a own showed you in one could
be replied

766
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:25,110
mommy called get executed sequentially
you have sometimes

767
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:29,100
in your cold blood you have been called
company code quality

768
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,680
and but with returning to programming to
three different

769
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:36,320
because you have the truck and deep into
at very different memory addresses and

770
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,490
you always something with you

771
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:41,980
between them and I think that it might
break that the

772
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:45,200
kasinga something but anyway

773
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,640
the flow yet but still if you let the

774
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:53,660
program aid kit then you definitely do
not happen any time consuming top

775
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:59,650
golden not much of a breaking point

776
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:03,590
to a computer real and you could become
that I did and

777
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:07,200
we'll have an experimental to double
play room you have a Windows XP system

778
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,230
makeup unwinnable private which I
instantly

779
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:13,260
difference but it's nothing personal
it's just the driver that

780
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:17,390
export in yet by which you can buy two
for you the space

781
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:21,410
and when you record at bio them
hopefully it'll happen and we can all

782
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:24,520
exploited people walking to execute or
repeat

783
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,360
from you be I wanted others

784
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,760
it room at the brothas little been told
and remove with the plot that within

785
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:32,460
that

786
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:35,460
our list so that we can hide both

787
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,720
and I'm not gonna show you the entire
called

788
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,660
but the truth just the paddle p meet
Kate that actually

789
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:46,470
remove on LinkedIn element from the
problem what we have is

790
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,950
on here we can call the external window
thinking which

791
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:53,100
U-turn the hat pointer to be brought at
least

792
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:58,350
tooth PS get canned broth and then beat
it happen while loop in which he

793
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:02,230
could not believe anti-foreign entry by
the name of both but actor

794
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:06,240
and if you find that entry on we simply
and think it by

795
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,300
sweetie the you pointer of the nearby
element in the list

796
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:14,619
and if you have done that then at the
break with effectively hidden

797
00:47:14,619 --> 00:47:18,130
these attacks have been shown in many
different have been

798
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:21,210
he's going to many different make
tutorial multiple that

799
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:24,700
like that for nothing to talk about and
how you can actually

800
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:29,970
program you repeat solar come to them
and he I prepared a

801
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:33,050
younger XP workstation

802
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:36,660
work making

803
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:43,660
thing ok

804
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,290
mmm maybe I should have brought my clan

805
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:54,650
tickets

806
00:47:54,650 --> 00:48:00,880
am ok

807
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,720
what he appeared with the girls brought
in which is to think about it that

808
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,440
that nothing but incremental number and
then printed on the console

809
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:13,060
and if we know by Rob being

810
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:16,880
caskets on the right side and we can see
that gold-plated

811
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,510
number in there i think is this entry on
its own up in that happen it is it that

812
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:22,310
the other problem

813
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:26,130
ice on in the department mention when
I'm gonna do now is

814
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:31,119
I'm gonna beauty which

815
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:34,540
wins tonight in I'm hoping

816
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:38,220
about five little to drive in the system
and

817
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:42,790
ban exit and then exploit that when you
build it from within

818
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:46,170
being are you have paid and high
temperatures

819
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:49,420
with the past that was it

820
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,970
and when you can t know if that

821
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:56,800
be on people what is running implement
number imprinted on

822
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,810
but on the right side you do not see the
gold

823
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:02,920
anymore with completely hidden and yet
we have done that

824
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:06,540
without executing any own instruction

825
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:10,310
within 20 company could I all cooling

826
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:13,950
implemented another reputed an

827
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:17,890
and which actually hired and

828
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:21,950
network connections and which notice may
be the most

829
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:25,930
interesting point did mines

830
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:32,810
mutual

831
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:39,810
my presentation okie

832
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:44,880
in in

833
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,300
am yet that the person could ultimately
to think he could

834
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:52,250
which actually hooked into the the
technical system call judith was kinda

835
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:53,240
part because they were

836
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,990
really many technical problems that
needed to be fall

837
00:49:56,990 --> 00:50:00,250
and I had about two months ago green
screens on the windows

838
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:03,910
me in the end it actually worked thing
you did

839
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:07,020
in threaten me into thinking it really
possible

840
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:11,350
to hoop into a practical are you need to
I mean we cannot condone alright any

841
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:12,620
called you can a pet into

842
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:15,830
called what is going to happen one point
at which point to

843
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:19,420
a function that lets say ahead with the
enumeration

844
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:22,540
all me know second which it all which

845
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:26,460
is the pact then if we took over right
this one point a and along with

846
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:30,760
can kind of get it we can hook into the
country more and be content with return

847
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:31,270
where you

848
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:36,880
and actually alternative am

849
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,980
know that but I so too hard works

850
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:43,200
and I think I have to tell you holding

851
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,980
we can depend on top against it so in
the end when I didn't tell you

852
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:50,190
and you know what there is a thing
called at its base in my state in which

853
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:50,610
you bring

854
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:53,750
no and because from what if the return
of the broken killer

855
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:57,540
and the problem is that when I that with
below to

856
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:02,200
that me feat heck not this and device
drivers funky

857
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,750
then our entire attack would basically
be be hotter

858
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:08,960
significantly harder and really and
reliable

859
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,000
because we would have to get memory
attractive from the outside

860
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,110
and if you have a decent team has not
met his basement my face in

861
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:20,870
and it would be kinda impossible an
since we only have one shot

862
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:24,600
we only have one cry to load and get
into memory and if it doesn't make me

863
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,500
will be detected

864
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:30,630
see an it is a good thing but i think in
the end it

865
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:34,060
somewhat tracked I'll abroad and and

866
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:37,570
thereafter economist at the country to
not to be mean in the end the third at

867
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:38,770
the same condiment

868
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:41,810
that you can see you with returning to
meet the

869
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:45,110
thinking so let's come to the conclusion

870
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:48,830
and we seen that we can order baby
programming it matter

871
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:52,380
theoretical being and it is actually
possible

872
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:55,420
to create real return oriented called to

873
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:58,680
that come to bless you can create any
other called and

874
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,010
we have shown that is is actually
possible to do to have an automated get

875
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:02,840
it conceptually

876
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:07,970
am and that number called that we have
within the memory which you can abuse is

877
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:08,750
usually cool

878
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:12,010
on so big that it not big Rep

879
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:16,910
modern you brought me to automatically
create you get it even by using very

880
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:17,510
simple

881
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:21,890
something begin and in the end yeah the
fine thing is that

882
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:25,560
what has already been shown in the
keynote

883
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:30,120
with that and the actual problem that we
might happen in a system is not on a

884
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,190
little cold blooded

885
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:34,280
minute to complete 80 and detecting
likud computation is

886
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,900
and way hotter top 10 pick detecting
Mexican

887
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,260
okay that with it

888
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:48,260
thank you for your time and have you
taken Press Inc

889
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,940
match thank you very much interesting
talk and getting up at the basal

890
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:56,640
at they have word Christian over UTEP
you should remake

891
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,000
an well the

892
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,450
yes it is very possible have take I am
it would

893
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:07,110
I'm thinking about it from you're happy
you know but I

894
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:10,190
really a happened have I didn't have the
time to do that

895
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:13,400
it I think it might be right and
completed

896
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,400
and I think it's already a curious to to
pay regular

897
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,790
say okay other questions

898
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:26,790
me

899
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:40,210
yeah

900
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:46,260
that's a good question what that mean re
problem

901
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:50,900
your ride in you have to you know me on
the between what you have a limited

902
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:54,220
spec model back which is on the window
Yulia

903
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:58,470
a few coming by to pick you up to can
abide on the respect what it could not

904
00:53:58,470 --> 00:53:59,350
be connected to you

905
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:02,860
beyond what I did in the what you want
the demo did and

906
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:05,869
you too Canon thought most stop at the
beginning

907
00:54:05,869 --> 00:54:09,470
which allocate memory in in the clinic
tomorrow

908
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:13,220
copy too cold to that location which can
be a bit early big

909
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:16,800
and then you too you at that point to
that location we don't have to point to

910
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,280
the actual

911
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,300
back in KC you can to be by Pat this by
and way

912
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:27,300
to using a small spot which Ben and Kate
you can be to the family

913
00:54:38,429 --> 00:54:42,779
and yes there are certain okay and to
you

914
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:46,269
construction on x86 but I don't it only
modified

915
00:54:46,269 --> 00:54:50,319
game black so what you need to do with
you have to compare instruction

916
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:53,799
then you have to read all the flak from
back back register and you can do that

917
00:54:53,799 --> 00:54:54,319
by

918
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:57,420
there is one threatened which was
tonight I think it will

919
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:00,619
and a 8aa which and copies

920
00:55:00,619 --> 00:55:05,119
the exactly deflected into the expected
to

921
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:11,529
and which can do then is am to implement
and operate in what did i do I think I

922
00:55:11,529 --> 00:55:17,089
it to you simply you have an accident to
do the and operation

923
00:55:17,089 --> 00:55:20,279
human condition wanted to do and
integration between result board

924
00:55:20,279 --> 00:55:23,869
operant and then you can take this
recalled

925
00:55:23,869 --> 00:55:27,049
at an index into a timetable

926
00:55:27,049 --> 00:55:30,089
3 menu that the perfect pointed to that
timetable that

927
00:55:30,089 --> 00:55:33,429
that's what it actually is I can show
you better than later

928
00:55:33,429 --> 00:55:40,429
few you too no question

929
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:51,829
into everything it stands for the the
return of gold

930
00:55:51,829 --> 00:55:55,130
and then it looks backwards with me fine
quality

931
00:55:55,130 --> 00:56:02,130
you you

932
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:10,710
if you haven't been able if he somewhere
in your

933
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:14,480
I politely banya but normally it's not
possible

934
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:18,140
it's only possible if there is something
beauty to communicate with the

935
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:19,300
hypervisor and then

936
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:24,180
but they all right before their if you
happen to be honest you have any back

937
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:30,210
inside that much like the people okay

938
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:35,690
more questions I think the eighty
possibility

939
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:39,050
a step is rockin units breaks to make

940
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:40,120
again thank you very much
