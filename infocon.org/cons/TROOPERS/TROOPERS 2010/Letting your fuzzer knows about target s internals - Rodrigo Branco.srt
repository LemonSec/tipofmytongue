1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,560
minutes a call we deter mined it does no
good can or cannot be exploitable

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,440
and why this is so important a I think
everybody who is here

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,019
oregano and understands the talent that
we have in our days

4
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:16,460
a in the group presentations in the Keno
to everybody was discussing in talking

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,910
about Paul Deighton two minutes

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,039
noted that our new gonna be that don't
have a

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,810
don't have a patch but the nobody really
explain it to all

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,289
okay how do we detect this kind of an
affiliate how the researchers are

9
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:28,939
working

10
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:32,540
and what the companies are really doing
a with thats

11
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,899
that kind of information so let me try
to talk about

12
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:39,160
what is the further than nichols'
misconceptions about pleasers

13
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,420
I would try to explain how it works for
this offer close works

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,700
hold me analyze the targeting colonels I
we explain the implementation details

15
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,000
and

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,460
that showing us as much as they can and
everything sixty minutes

17
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,800
show a bigger dog the objective oh what
a

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,469
really want everybody to understand from
this talk it every time

19
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:04,559
you are opening a 50 you are basically
giving remote code execution in your

20
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,199
machine

21
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,530
that the main proposal to stalk I really
want everybody to understand

22
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,369
that too when you have I resume me that
you just received it

23
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:17,360
and that when you're just double click
it has risen me you were just

24
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,810
executing a shell parted remote attacker

25
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,030
so called that's how we work air why did
through work

26
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,920
is the main pit bulls up to stock what
is important is

27
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,150
the fight for what's called a star
really complex

28
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,159
just falters I really really complex

29
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,409
so as you can see I opened there is a
meander there is a mi papa adults to me

30
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:44,509
ups the ante okay why

31
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:48,299
because Adobe Acrobat either has bucks
these bugs are being constantly

32
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,399
exploited exploit that

33
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,799
if you are using Internet Explorer and
you have that they play a game

34
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:56,979
you are going to be exploited if you
don't have that the group began

35
00:01:56,979 --> 00:02:00,049
you are going to be exploited as well
because you are passing

36
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:05,229
very complex piece of software every
time you have a complete complex parser

37
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:08,879
you are going to have a little bit and
we are security researchers are looking

38
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,979
for durability you're fighting then

39
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,870
you know that their money for it can be
exploited or not and your writing

40
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:19,170
the effective exploits to prove the idea
sometimes

41
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,870
the bad guys are doing that custard NS
unfortunately they have much more money

42
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,020
with more research with more time to do
that

43
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,019
the motivation for the bad guys is much
bigger than for the good guys

44
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:35,580
so they are usually faster than this but
we are also doing that

45
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,480
that's important to our important
message another important methods

46
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,060
well ask something that they learn it
when I was this cooking with a friend of

47
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,560
mine

48
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,750
this friend of mine who is a developer
in a security company so he develops a

49
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,769
good product

50
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:53,150
and that you know I came to him really
motivated hate hate

51
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:57,330
I just found a bug in the public to just
believe that and if you look at the mint

52
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,050
cake while you were happy with that

53
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,150
annotating I don't know it my drive I am

54
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,870
both to be happy when I succeed in my
job right anything that comment

55
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:09,810
every time you plan to prevent it you
are disappointing the guys here writing

56
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:10,430
the softer

57
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:15,550
right go big I spent a lot of time
trying to create a good falter and we

58
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,140
just

59
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,819
you know in couple of minutes couple of
callers sometimes couple of days

60
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:23,840
just might have been a minute and the
guy welcome at his appointed

61
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,400
who will be no cut electric motivation
that's really funny because

62
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,739
you could date back to the one in a
minute is fed up they called

63
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:35,099
the attacker which may some they're
giving even more motivation

64
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:39,420
because %uh crusades K every time we
patch or other time look up something

65
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:39,849
new

66
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:43,409
you spend even more time with you can
get a bit so

67
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:46,409
that it that a kind of but not

68
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:50,810
airport the guys were defending because
they don't have the motivation that we

69
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:51,319
have

70
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:54,970
where there is some creamy really think
that so that

71
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,510
a kind of interesting that's why I like
playing with my dog so

72
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,560
everybody knows that's occurred to
nowadays

73
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,629
could rise of buckets of tears being
deployed you know everybody trying to

74
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:10,209
develop as fast as possible because you
want to be the first one in market

75
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:14,060
everybody works to not expend a lot of
money with really

76
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,350
at best a developer so I threw both both
ways batter

77
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,690
and everybody went you know like a
beautiful interfaces for development so

78
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,430
they can develop in really quickly

79
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:28,100
and well we know that we know this is a
matter that's why you're here

80
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,139
my ideas to show call we are going to
hold it this assistance and how you're

81
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,400
going to find them in a bit and try to
find it

82
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,710
as fast as possible and as much as
possible keeping the quiet

83
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,500
so basically we all know that in the
beginning

84
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,330
it a a warning to spread it took like a
long time

85
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,770
it took a long time where they've been a
bit was really that recovery working

86
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:50,460
exploit

87
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,280
you know they ever keys much faster and
why it's so fast

88
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,930
we don't we now have like a a know if
the critical memory we have address

89
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,370
space layout randomization

90
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:04,090
it was the bomb attribute even more dick
pics too great an exploit

91
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,680
but then abruptly with what we see is
like dick might there be developed even

92
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,550
faster than they were in the past

93
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,550
why's that because the Packers are
professionals

94
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,560
they have the right tools to analyze the
vulnerability and that this kind of

95
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,919
tools to analyze expert community up
some kind of wooden cabinet

96
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,020
is the kind of thing that the security
community needs to develop

97
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:27,770
and the need to start to share so just
to kind of get to a question that they

98
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:28,750
like to ask

99
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,630
home home any time do you guys think I
we're going to remain

100
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,850
like a see them from the public an
all-out

101
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:39,380
things fit what sparked filed by
somebody an old eight so that's a big

102
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,400
arnold et the a pickup soccer

103
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,620
I ponder whether to believe it and a I
don't tell anybody

104
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,310
I just keep hoping to to wait for how
long does not believe they're going

105
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,889
through

106
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:54,280
taken to somebody else phones it and
publish it home and do guys think

107
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,639
an all-day remains all day

108
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:01,990
how long give your number and in under

109
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,810
10 days more than pay the

110
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,069
when the year good

111
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:12,850
when monk when the year school

112
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:16,090
what the numbers say this the operate
its

113
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:20,060
almost one year okay a this short this
time

114
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,639
it's at least three months so what
you're saying is

115
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,919
see somebody finds them in a minute it
takes a lot of time

116
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,639
until somebody else find it so the guy
has a plenty of time to negotiate to the

117
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,560
vulnerability

118
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,389
in to get the best backcourt that's
pretty interesting

119
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:40,770
that's pretty cool to know so it's
working but I think that because you're

120
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,130
doing your research

121
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:45,550
that if it even if you find something
you don't do anything with the

122
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,509
information you have because you don't
know

123
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:51,520
how to get money out of this information
is too it's going to take like

124
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,680
at least one year for you too figure
I'll take

125
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,720
now I know how to make money all talk
minutes

126
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,639
at in fact we have like a nice guy when
he's not there the note that goal but at

127
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,520
least we hope

128
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,680
that they're really is investing a lot
of money fighting with an ability

129
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,190
because you know they have a whole
business model

130
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,500
I'll take that so ok

131
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,539
what is the further they could a deal
closer it's

132
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:18,030
that the that the really busy ordered
that everybody is talking about poor

133
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,940
thing nowadays everybody knows that

134
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,280
it pretty hard told that the court
should just looking to the same

135
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,110
restrictions

136
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,380
so everybody faith hey let's pause let's
pause let's first

137
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,389
but the a what is really

138
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:34,400
for the softer Wednesday DI and what
it's quite what is wrong with

139
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,539
what everybody's doing why dip for
example Microsoft partners

140
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:41,919
are not fighting I'll give it a bit safe
microsoft also has

141
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,039
others right microsoft has a lot of good
researchers they are deploying a lot of

142
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:47,319
machines and they are

143
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:50,560
causing as well so what Microsoft is
planning firms to

144
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,440
all the research for fighting from other
steps why it is so difficult to for the

145
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,389
softer

146
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:58,629
because the softer than really really
complex complex

147
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:02,580
peace you know ok something as everybody
say they're ready

148
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,099
they want a bill it is just you know you
think it's called like machine

149
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:09,810
the different way think then it was
supposed to be use it

150
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:13,039
so it's pretty hard but it's also
important to note that the first thing

151
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,690
that commission itself

152
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,050
is %uh kind of were lacking are the kind
of quick

153
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,560
so there is some they don't need the
conditions on that so I got

154
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,810
this further definition from Wikipedia
and a

155
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,960
if you're looking to the definition they
do. for thing is

156
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,219
if the program fails with affected the
same problem

157
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:35,919
but the what did the president don't
fail at all

158
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,640
or what did the president failed because
of something you did in the past

159
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,190
but this just appeared like two hours
later

160
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,220
holder in all what they needed that
really didn't manage to to press the

161
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,279
application

162
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:52,440
so for the if not I think bloody as
everybody think that is

163
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,800
also we need to remember that defined
parameter pretty cold like nowadays

164
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,450
so when we talk about like a gold which
is just a printer and firing mode

165
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,250
attacker

166
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:05,010
it's not just because I don't want that
to be afraid turned a remote attacker

167
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:09,060
they don't wear did I'm sure they don't
but what is happening

168
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,500
because they have my computer is
infected in PDF documents they had like

169
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,019
a cold climate system being managed by
PBS

170
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:18,440
they have encryption they haven't
golding they have multiple layers open

171
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,140
golding

172
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,970
ever be supported by the commission by
the format so the fight for what they're

173
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,240
pretty complex

174
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,390
and because the big go but it's really
like complexes that

175
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:31,990
Google expert palsy I HTTP bash in just
using compression

176
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:36,310
sold to imagine the life of the IPS
guides grating IPS to protect the

177
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,519
default network

178
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,730
whenever pink box paper I said it's
going to be really kind

179
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,850
I really hope Google menace to have
everybody using it

180
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:49,040
okay so the pink with this office
complex

181
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,560
the comp the computer power is growing
the network power is growing

182
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,860
the only ones who don't take advantage
of that are the IP expanders

183
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,560
because the a point there growing
working faster than

184
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,019
the IPS machine so it's almost
impossible to talents

185
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:08,450
to really expected this complex planned
for months

186
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:12,220
okay so we know that by the promoter is
called like try I hope everybody

187
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,420
agrees with me feel going try to read
when up the specifications and if you

188
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,730
understand from the first three

189
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:22,279
it is you are a genius bar and drank but
they think you probably going to get you

190
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:24,230
the understanding 2-for-3

191
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,950
but there is other mistakes in the way
people are closing

192
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:32,160
so just because the name was means there
is no real

193
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,430
are doing that don't mean that you need
to do attaching to that

194
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,709
Rondo and pipe it to your application
unit requests we think that it's easy to

195
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:41,529
understand why the application is doing

196
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:44,980
and you need to understand that just
called call bradley's nothing

197
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,300
maybe work over in ninety percent of
your cold

198
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,540
but the defender think that you are
leaving not go over it

199
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:56,360
is where the cabinets are so what you
went to strip over 200 million cubic

200
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,019
you don't care if you work over the
whole softer or just where there's going

201
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:01,350
to be anything that softer

202
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,800
so that's also important and the

203
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,750
well most of the closer bit putting
solutions are trying to have some

204
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,690
information about called the target is
behaving

205
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:16,899
but usually it's like after the crash so
like for example

206
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:20,649
a in cuz they we developed like a closer
for wart

207
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:24,050
soul becomes like 200,000 crashes the
boards

208
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,899
failed to 300,000 homer hope home much
of this

209
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:32,279
I real would have been its what can it
be really exploiting or not

210
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:36,380
its pretty hard to get their wine in
this weather is just you know

211
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,860
dumping the crash while end the day at
not exploitable

212
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,930
feel of pics but I believe doctors in a
minute

213
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:46,529
for those who don't know what is there
not exploitable

214
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:49,829
I rebooted other Berto machine and then
I'm you explain what it do not exploit

215
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:51,079
me but basically

216
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:54,709
not exploit vote is an expense report
the windows debugger that microsoft

217
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:55,589
provides

218
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,839
that will help you to analyze it for
women ability can or cannot be

219
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:00,040
exploitable

220
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,630
and the they don't they tried to do some
kind of thing tonight Isis

221
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:08,190
I'm not saying it's bad I'm just saying
that to her

222
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,930
at least it is open for so nobody can
really complain when a softer is open

223
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:12,950
for it because it can

224
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:16,209
in the worst they can prove it but the
what what what what it could really

225
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:17,560
doing is like

226
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,970
welcomed the real within a minute that
faith Ono or not to exploit a

227
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,200
them a big review it boggles they do say
it expired of course because it's pretty

228
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:26,940
obvious

229
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,170
but a lot of 100 face it's probably
exploitable

230
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:34,680
or not soul in and you cannot recall
going from Asian

231
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,700
acting like this is really ok putting so
it's pretty hard and it spurred

232
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,480
pretty through this challenging to
really analyze governor bill it

233
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,980
so let me let the machine booting while
I i cant I keep talking

234
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,200
so what is the act or state so everybody
is

235
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,930
trying to rule in some way at great new
ways to put might their way through

236
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:55,839
first

237
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,889
so basically when you were quoting
something you need to understand that

238
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:03,420
there is a protocol being respected
publication

239
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,810
difficult maybe like a network protocol
for you need to find a specific back at

240
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,160
him a specific order

241
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,310
to really test the application for
police to go into their

242
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,790
parsers up the application but then you
also have like a

243
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:19,540
fighting for my car all their stuff that
you don't have access to the network

244
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,089
so not always when you have a crash you
have a minute

245
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:26,790
it but network softer if you have a
crash out there you have it and I'll

246
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,700
tired to write its network softer but
when you are talking about like for

247
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,470
example

248
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:36,589
a doubleheader words not because I have
a crash occurred in a bit

249
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:40,000
maybe just press is difficult if it
means nothing actually difficult for

250
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,220
future of walks he works pretty well

251
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,699
so even a few it closes all being
Facebook of the guys not going to meet

252
00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:48,050
the current anyway

253
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,279
soul you cannot faith availability it's
just a crash

254
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,250
so hell we'd appreciate that it's
something that is important

255
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,810
and that well the some guys greater the
ideal you know

256
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:03,880
Nick Tate for my no good data so you got
some data that are used to be good

257
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,769
any required to change in play with the
four-month and the factory

258
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:11,920
past Tuesday to the application it's a
network application you got some package

259
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,790
captures

260
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:16,269
you change it and you'll send to the
application it's for example word

261
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:19,779
you get a really complex procurement
with a lot of link them and what's

262
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:24,470
you change what did going for example
greatly help former the object and then

263
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,570
you open a port

264
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:29,079
and try to see how it works of course
some salters are

265
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:33,029
easier true less than others like a
network server

266
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:36,130
well exit polls through handle a lot of
connections

267
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:40,010
so it's the perfect victim for closing
right that's why everybody talked about

268
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:40,769
closing

269
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:43,850
network applications because it's pretty
easy and

270
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,459
ever crashes than a minute but what
about words

271
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:50,940
word big I don't know pensei construe
sparked

272
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,610
and I really good machine I really up to
meet the guy

273
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:58,589
but word thanks a lot of time so holding
it in to rate them opening word

274
00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:01,649
dinner it another way to open another
where generate it

275
00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:05,639
really time consuming 44 think the visa

276
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,250
so whatever the ideas that I greater

277
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:13,440
is a fed-up generate different ain't
roots I'm trying to change

278
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,990
the way the target is really behaving so
for example

279
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:21,339
if I know some kinda people nation I
have control over the information

280
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:24,389
I will change the way that private
behavior it's when it received a

281
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:25,860
regional information

282
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:31,320
so what is the idea

283
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,240
let me get through the petition for
example Rica I did the same level went

284
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,120
up occasion

285
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,920
and to just go but we are just comparing
the parameters for the application and

286
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,930
you're tripping

287
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:45,290
equal okay if I know I could do that but
entered

288
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,430
I piggly the result of this operation nm

289
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:52,639
closing and i notice joke if I really
avoid the traffic and getting to within

290
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:53,320
a minute

291
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:58,259
I know I can do that I don't need a true
generate value your input for the

292
00:15:58,259 --> 00:15:59,120
application

293
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,019
say they report to the application again
and the hold up it's going to be a pic

294
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:04,209
of that revenue

295
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:09,089
already know I can do that so how it
will work

296
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:12,490
let's get do the application for example
it's an

297
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:16,209
a pot a duck alt so that the case is
just that and arguments

298
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:19,769
and experiencing a help methods if you
don't have the right argument

299
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:23,250
okay so what happens if I run this
application

300
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:27,740
and attacking the point where is this
Jen I just fell to the application hate

301
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,009
I want you to jerk no matter what is the
value I know it going to the value

302
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:31,750
anyway

303
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:35,139
so I can do that because I'm going live
tonight it's gonna wait

304
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:38,639
I am analyzing the target I'm looking
harder targeting behavior in

305
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,459
so we sped up doing that changing deal
the the guy who is creating the Packers

306
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:47,180
I'm doing the changing the target itself
because i know im day and

307
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:51,180
I really control that why did the small
change is important

308
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,339
because basically closing in fast the
softer

309
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:57,620
it certainly is a problem that you
cannot school with a deterministic

310
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,930
algorithm

311
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:03,100
right but they can we do this kind of
stuff and we can change that time but I

312
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,110
got itself

313
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:07,559
we can create a cluster of machines and
then recover

314
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:11,990
and the tournament victory machine to
sell limited and determine its problem

315
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:16,520
so that means the problem can be solved
this means that we can really

316
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,809
sold their brother novak software
testing

317
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:22,839
just doing that so in this case as you
can see

318
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:26,860
the application even not receiving their
argument that location is going to say

319
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,589
hey

320
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:32,010
welcome I just bypass that the the
application itself the way the petition

321
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,220
behaves internally

322
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,309
so cool going back to the not
exploitable

323
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:42,510
so here we have like I'm award-winning
to be in it okay

324
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:46,919
and a.m. here we have like a did not
exploit bolt with doctors want to delete

325
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:50,299
I really don't mind if everybody gets
the address is then and then try to

326
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:52,490
replicate what do they want to be in it
because it is

327
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:55,640
does one a pretty complex running thence
so if you find it

328
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,740
good luck went well basically what I did
not expect with faith

329
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,190
they with a minute with negation is
unknown why

330
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:09,640
because the Fokker stop it in a Inc 3

331
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,850
okay the salt and pepper then that the
booking commit

332
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,309
so what the heck defectors it up into
the bugging correct

333
00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:19,679
according to not exploitable

334
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,190
really going it very indication that
maybe an attacker stepped in to try to

335
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:24,760
get

336
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,590
but anyway breaking point are not
supposed to appear in pictures of the

337
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,220
right

338
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,130
but what is that they're begging to read
too that appears in Ringgold

339
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:37,030
recall intercept Effect 3 up Windows XP
the fact that the

340
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:41,910
any lingering protection indicate and
you think you protection 23 good

341
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:46,770
it generates a breaking point so
basically if not recommend that it's not

342
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,789
supposed to appear but

343
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:51,679
think fact that computer polls immediate
K it's a clear

344
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,150
the show it clearly showing there is a
hip good thing you're

345
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:59,580
a hip problem okay so you're overwriting
scourges overheat

346
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,780
if you're looking to the cat do they
stack up this process

347
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,870
you are going to three its related to
like always

348
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:11,370
HTML parting this in this case XML
parsing

349
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:15,200
East Side word itself okay so

350
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,890
a it it I kinda Ingrid think because the
something so big

351
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:23,770
that even the guys were doing actual
research in Microsoft

352
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:27,650
a recommended something the guide for
okay doing research there

353
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,880
in are trying to quit but thanks for
doing something else and that the two

354
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,470
weeks

355
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:35,400
are not reflecting because they they
can't BS past does this stop there is

356
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,679
growing

357
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:41,179
it's a talent for that and it's a talent
for everybody else really trying to put

358
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:42,220
back to the

359
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,799
there the companies and finding them in
a bit

360
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:52,330
so you can we use to discuss gun on his
tour any feedback the further and

361
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,720
achieve this goal rate

362
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,500
but the covert of real peach that we
really want to go over not

363
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,120
the cold cold we go where trip over the
whole record we just want to know

364
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,580
where is the Bucks I don't care if there
is a crash

365
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,880
sorry I I really don't I it's not my
problem

366
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,750
right if they're the processes you know
you the more memory than it is supposed

367
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,250
through

368
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:17,669
I really don't care but if i cant force
that situation in a remote server

369
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:21,210
that nearly triple the night of Feb then
it's my problem so then I

370
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:25,450
having Christine C so there yeah it's
like

371
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:28,700
all the upgrades are you going to
further us changing

372
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,090
my plate is using to target be changed
at

373
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:35,730
okay when I really know I called
information

374
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:40,179
so does explain a little bit about what
men working group and scholar towards

375
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:44,640
white for important well the member to
help your YouTube units are going dollar

376
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,510
it's decreasing

377
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:49,600
okay but it's still going to be the 33
we see in the warmth

378
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,049
it is true that were noted that somebody
use it to an Google

379
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:57,010
right everybody read it revealed while
dramatics were gonna be that left long

380
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:57,730
ago

381
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,470
and that's all other companies in the US
or whatever because these two

382
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,640
well why Google was using Internet
Explorer

383
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,309
that think yet because they went to that
great and

384
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:12,340
for commander the kitchen that's why
there and looking for

385
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:17,030
okay so basically we know that the day
and the low level 130 the cruising but

386
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:17,590
few

387
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:20,780
they are the most important works
there's through

388
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,270
really important because it will give
you access to the internet work with you

389
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:24,950
know it's

390
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:29,070
usually masti it will give you much more
pressure priority when you

391
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:33,230
getting to or for example if you're used
to like a wet winter to get active in

392
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,700
both ever you weren't

393
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,330
took evidence to retract a story need a
low level we're a bit

394
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,580
to really increase your power inside the
machine

395
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,900
so women recoverability a

396
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,490
usually people say K the bread and
repress what that's not true I think

397
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:48,860
they'd

398
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,490
sometimes you have a problem you ever
write that pointer for example in the

399
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:55,169
memory so it means there was a memory
corruption

400
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:58,640
but this point there's not going to be
used that at the food

401
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,780
or never in the program unless you have
another condition

402
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:06,200
so we need some way to really understand
what we are

403
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,280
over right and what you're not so

404
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,549
because its golden old row above member
can rip Sam

405
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:15,840
it for you here it's just a game you
overwrite this

406
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,659
that group we override the return other
perfect there is nothing else to the

407
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:21,429
memory of the application right

408
00:22:21,429 --> 00:22:24,750
the petition going to anything you the
people there you should applications are

409
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,429
there just to be exploitable

410
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:31,590
right know we know it's not true so I
think it's really good it to the

411
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:34,820
this occurred guy just go up to
simplifies to

412
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,370
okay didn't have been if they're not
force people to exploit the there is

413
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,010
much more stuff there

414
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:43,580
okay the class goes back over people's
does not exist anymore

415
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,860
okay forget it whether to go yet

416
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,950
but okay Kirk but well

417
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:54,380
okay so what we had basically reviewer
for the publication we have an

418
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,600
obligation that they think

419
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,490
normal behavior read okay well when we
have any kind of direction

420
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:04,070
II I don't know with kinda the richer
but let's suppose we have a kind of

421
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,240
corruption like a memory corruption

422
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,690
the application can changed your Crisco
state

423
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,799
are it can be you know like crash is
parent can be

424
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:18,010
it crashes it very easy you just know
what they're just not by the packard

425
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:21,059
sorry no white crested it's pretty easy
to analyze

426
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:25,840
usually it's going it this one is there
the no best swear that they went to find

427
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,929
right because

428
00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:31,179
quickly you can at least know what
Crestor then then you can for drama

429
00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:34,580
are do with them and it isn't people can
exploit the peer pressure is like

430
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,429
sometimes the men behaving

431
00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:39,960
look bad to be up behavior re okay

432
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,789
nothing really normal but defaulters
were cute didn't crash

433
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:47,750
how do you respond it and well you can
we have like a

434
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,370
all their up all these kids should
really using this data that you're just

435
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:53,830
cooperate with parental date or whatever

436
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:58,740
then you can cover crash and then when
you look into the crest a wave crashing

437
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,350
I didn't

438
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:03,049
do anything that supposed to press the
president but the

439
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:06,909
actually or did you just don't keep the
track right because it's

440
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:10,470
an explosion up to the nation's so the
father cannot kick kick that

441
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:14,340
tracking up everything it's going okay
what you can do is like

442
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,659
right okay produced all the steps again
saying

443
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:20,679
you start to lose the productivity of
the further right because

444
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:24,370
it all the time you have a crash turn
into a hotel there defense is the game

445
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,140
for you can figure out with Professor

446
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,270
generated the initial direction you are
going to have a problem

447
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,630
so okay okay we know that maybe week

448
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,929
week travel like a a kind of critical
data corruption and we

449
00:24:35,929 --> 00:24:40,210
don't have like the coal projects or
you're going to have in many cases the

450
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,059
move the cursor

451
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:45,250
for example there did the address
pointer is going to resurrect the cold

452
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,539
triggered something grazing the memory
and the

453
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:52,100
the up because I didn't crash
replication is if you're running

454
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:56,549
it you're just a baroque the yet be so
you got the call to but you don't know

455
00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:59,760
earlier further don't have any way to
know right your place is just thinking

456
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,590
back I just

457
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:04,860
so the biggest effect is a good company
crazy and then the application crashes

458
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,740
later

459
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:09,830
and there you have no way to know
because your test didn't predict them do

460
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,990
it didn't got the cauldron because your
father is not going to exploit

461
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:17,929
that will do everything as you wish
deposit just sending information

462
00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:21,150
of course when you have the crescent
formation and he'll do all down and it

463
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:21,590
says

464
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:25,240
so does the same to understand which
customers are going to understand what

465
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,760
kind of information you can grow

466
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,770
what you can override what you can't
call that the case is behaving when you

467
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:31,630
are a good writer

468
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:35,340
specific piece of information then maybe
you can have like

469
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,429
the real paper highlights so basically

470
00:25:38,429 --> 00:25:42,120
did tons of the father is remaining like
called the way

471
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,950
didn't poet give you information that
will really help you incorporate them

472
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,529
working exploit

473
00:25:48,529 --> 00:25:51,580
and then make a while you went to work
and exploit because

474
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,590
when you are old eating a faltar like
work

475
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:58,200
you are going to find like two hundred
thousand problems

476
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,909
and you really go work through spent
200,000 advisers to Microsoft

477
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:07,320
because they're not going to Pat anyway
so why do you need if you really need to

478
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,529
class yEnc

479
00:26:08,529 --> 00:26:13,370
what can and what cannot be exploitable
exploitive so

480
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:18,620
so what a let's just say that true

481
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:22,220
you can we had a report for us to really
cold through a

482
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,490
called to really exploit the
vulnerability we need

483
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:28,799
to take your for more information about
the punitive

484
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,679
using so for example it we really
weren't again like it did

485
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:36,799
Commons Attribution or whatever the
cursor arbitrary the cushioning assault

486
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:37,390
her

487
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:41,529
this alternate to use the data that we
are sending to the application

488
00:26:41,529 --> 00:26:44,580
is come walk think they don't care
branch

489
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,220
for call returning we using the
information in this effect but

490
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,840
somewhat this kind of this information
that we are spending to the softer

491
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,570
mix reveals that otherwise we don't have
that core group information

492
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:59,860
okay sick when we went to the term I
need expert opinion

493
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:03,640
we went to No what this falters Dec
three it going with the information we

494
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,100
are thinking to the softer

495
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,929
so to really know what's going on inside
the softer

496
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:12,409
we need a bugger right we cannot just
graft

497
00:27:12,409 --> 00:27:17,390
we did a burger and that the book and
it's a give us the information

498
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:20,539
so I can thank me say that any data

499
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:24,490
that an attacker or somebody else to
interacting with the falter

500
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:27,600
generating to the softer any data

501
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,770
cannot be trusted so we know that the
guy in putting something to your softer

502
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:36,710
and you are softer really like this
information used that as the return

503
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,140
address

504
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,370
it something wrong with the softer we
know there is a problem a security

505
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,480
problem in this falter

506
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,270
food aid is like we need to keep track
of the information we are sending to the

507
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:46,929
softer

508
00:27:46,929 --> 00:27:50,909
so that call 10 tonight if it starts to
play

509
00:27:50,909 --> 00:27:55,039
so they'd up in tonight if it's any kind
of impressed that

510
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,880
data week we are going to market we are
going to track

511
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,890
and we're going to see how old is data
are changing the behavior

512
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:06,049
of the softer so the father itself

513
00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:09,649
is important it is because it means to
generate the information it blah blah

514
00:28:09,649 --> 00:28:10,149
blah

515
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:14,870
but what I'm focusing your if which kind
of information did the burger

516
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:19,529
are going to provide to the Father in
order to really have a smartphone user

517
00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:24,070
a father that you can say evolutionary
okay not just something that you would

518
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,559
generate new packet

519
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:29,640
okay Davies like we need to keep track
of this data

520
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,250
we need to monitor the brother the
kitchen in the cold is date is passing

521
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,690
through the program

522
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:39,529
and the of course we need to track it
but this information is going to be

523
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:41,529
using something that are critical

524
00:28:41,529 --> 00:28:44,880
or is going to ever write something that
the problem really

525
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,529
so how do we do that first of all it's
important to say there is other

526
00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:51,289
real-world applications for can come and
assist

527
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:56,570
so did guide to show he explained that
he did to an analysis using a paint box

528
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:57,539
machine

529
00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:01,190
so he said like a boxing later if you
want to buy the book from waco to keep

530
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,340
track of the rest there's

531
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:06,210
and wonder what what what is going on
and if you do that then tonight if this

532
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:10,409
to get their meinhold critical
information I remaining the memory of

533
00:29:10,409 --> 00:29:11,360
faulkner's

534
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,820
so prologue for people who thought you
but your password in Math Center

535
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:19,590
so mapping don't think take yourself
with the messenger senator

536
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:24,679
soho log record nothing to our clients
are keeping your password into memory

537
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:27,789
after doping case for there is no why
keep the password right

538
00:29:27,789 --> 00:29:31,549
so they did an analysis and if ever and
they thought they use that thing tonight

539
00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:32,289
versus

540
00:29:32,289 --> 00:29:35,980
to keep track up dude information and
its cool overs where really cool

541
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,250
most of the softwares you know just
keeping formation

542
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:43,120
that company that we will need to care
as well because if we can have a good

543
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,919
idea that we can force them in a bid to
become a format string together to be

544
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:47,630
late

545
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:50,870
because recall drink the firm it's going
to be fenced truth from fiction

546
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:54,450
weekend that critical data from the
memory and we don't need called the

547
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:55,710
kitchen at all

548
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:00,690
sobil matter secondary school basketball
quantification protection or not

549
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:04,480
its really not important the pic and
their all the passwords from the memory

550
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,220
itself

551
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,520
it's okay for me okay good

552
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:13,240
so how do we do that victory we always
need a kind of the

553
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:18,770
half-a-million later and well Baldwin is
one open source alternative a good dog

554
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:21,279
send a private plane trip other options
like a

555
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,390
be mad by the guys going right now mix

556
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:29,350
you can use paint at Balkh and just
modify it to talk on Thursday

557
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:32,620
anyway you can use the best part witty
the

558
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,659
do the same for library that II and one
of the guys who wrote it

559
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:40,159
it's pretty old going to use it I don't
use it till I don't recommend you to use

560
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:40,580
it

561
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:44,090
but yes anyway it and I think a

562
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:47,659
emulator what did they do this kinda
emulators why we need to use this kind

563
00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:47,909
of

564
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:51,929
emulators big Rideau were three pars
before the same language

565
00:30:51,929 --> 00:30:55,649
we went to simplify the view of the same
language so it can recover but it took

566
00:30:55,649 --> 00:30:59,039
me through actions and those countries
are doing exactly the same thing

567
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,350
internally for the product we want this
to be simplified for us

568
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:05,610
and also we went to read the report do
the same Lee

569
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:09,200
machine a true all other kind of the
place where for example it works but

570
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,690
you're gonna be reclaiming tell

571
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:14,309
x8 think they want also to explore the
military man Italian

572
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:17,830
64 whatever so this kind of

573
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:22,010
emulators are almost I always breaks
forming the future

574
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:26,230
true art in permit hate language that
where you go to use throughout the

575
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,950
greater the pen to attack

576
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:32,630
so holders it works so pick you up to
date up from the further

577
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:36,110
the data for the further east saint in
is being thanks to their

578
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:40,880
target application of handball let the
boldest I get the pic 800 always copying

579
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,860
this information from a network to have
my luck at work there whatever

580
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:48,919
and that you know we know this data
there is some data that we don't go

581
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:52,070
trick or triple that suppose it might
look at the location is a pic so the

582
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:52,820
location

583
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:56,539
we don't bigger the better of this I got
the location with me through Geico the

584
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,320
data

585
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:01,070
inside the book for itself okay think so

586
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:04,659
we know that we need to keep track of
this and Beta Beta

587
00:32:04,659 --> 00:32:07,690
it because this information week old
Russo

588
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:11,610
you break a gate that they weren't and
if this information is being quoted to

589
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:12,529
another Booker

590
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:15,850
we need to check a good book for as well
because we started calling code is

591
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,909
better as well

592
00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:19,909
so we need to break a gate what we
called for and what we don't

593
00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:25,659
so it up any point we had any kind of
weird behavior in India and application

594
00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:26,100
I grew

595
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,730
show Hall brewery Inc always get their
mind what is weird and what is not

596
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:33,059
we just came back to information to the
Father for example

597
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:37,010
if there is an I've condition that I
told that does that condition is

598
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:37,830
avoiding

599
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:41,600
up for example but never paid to happen
because there's the night condition

600
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,659
a group that to the target to bypass his
eye condition if I know that the data

601
00:32:46,659 --> 00:32:50,240
that their use an Indesit condition I
crave control over it

602
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,320
you have going to I don't need good old
to read it that the tide no I told you I

603
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,340
just bought by the tiger to be sure

604
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,940
the overflow is happening at Gilbert
most really happening I just send

605
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,970
information back to the president's 88

606
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:05,289
if you send it back yrd Richt is much
the cation

607
00:33:05,289 --> 00:33:10,789
you are going to achieve a bitter blow
for example

608
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:17,220
so grateful often been a some problems I
am Not sure if you guys are the No like

609
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,360
to introduce the same belief 30 and

610
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,559
call to school did kind of machine and I
did just that with defects favor

611
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:28,200
is the first big really really real
problem in the computer world

612
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,710
it was the first problem that the guys
who the true bring everything possible

613
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,710
to decide

614
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:36,789
so where did the idea a let's get to the
CBO case

615
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:40,409
ahead a a the pick up information about
I call great

616
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:44,559
I'm prepping a into has 38 X

617
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:48,350
I know I call to react so he act is now
being think that

618
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:53,480
if I copy a text to be be is a piece of
information that they also called also

619
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,809
be is also painted

620
00:33:54,809 --> 00:33:59,240
pretty simple know hopefully solve this
situation

621
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,070
I could really be but they don't pay
clear the contents of PBX

622
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:07,809
why do you think good p is being added
3bx

623
00:34:07,809 --> 00:34:12,230
do I called the reactor I don't

624
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:15,770
what do you guys think the pretty thing
for example

625
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:21,280
right are partially coterie BX but the
battery pack is in addition with if you

626
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,050
actually try also don't want to

627
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:27,570
the white gold ring wake if you text or
not and you know it it's such a great an

628
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:28,589
explosion

629
00:34:28,589 --> 00:34:32,879
any good efficacy Rebecca K you could
really be axed what's going to happen is

630
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:37,470
you are going to have a lot of Poulsbo
through so you going to say you can

631
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:38,909
exploit computer to can't

632
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:43,149
so this is one of the biggest challenge
call to get their mind

633
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:47,950
this kind of situations and the
basically I and II am going to explain

634
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:48,899
how its

635
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:53,599
working now X so that they can get that
it needs to keep track of the present

636
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,050
state

637
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:57,149
that kinda all be used only to know what
is

638
00:34:57,149 --> 00:35:01,210
where with can update these where if
some data that I called within the

639
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:05,480
memory channel dedicated to their of
members for me to kind of market

640
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,099
so I met you want a good memory right
then tack

641
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:13,960
for violations so let it boil I am
writing to the memory

642
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,950
you know better folded Booker was
allocated and a provision that a cold

643
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:18,320
drink

644
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,599
its writing past his book for sites so I
know I have an overflow

645
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:25,940
that something pretty that i can reply

646
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:29,170
but that's a bold it got disintegration

647
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:32,210
you have a with your noting you

648
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:35,400
you have called drink anywhere anything
duke's

649
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,770
a with be we truly Google Group

650
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:44,270
so it be is 0

651
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:47,300
you don't break will be right

652
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:51,510
it's clear not I had a cold drink a I'm
use them

653
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:55,260
angel poration with been I and all that
big

654
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:59,859
is zero it means that I don't take
everything kept is in operation

655
00:35:59,859 --> 00:36:03,450
so every move the tent what it could be

656
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:07,950
is one

657
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:10,970
I can't or don't it could be

658
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:14,010
is weren't I know that these were a

659
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:17,150
I know is that better than a cold room
and there's that and

660
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:20,230
operation between a Mb

661
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:23,780
like older there it's ok to do the
persian

662
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:29,720
sure I do that's great so I need dynamic
analysis to the to do that to know that

663
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,359
because if I don't know that big

664
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,170
if you're a I really never know with a
cold or not the result

665
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:38,450
I'm a glass and say hey I called her but
I don't

666
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:42,550
so it's impossible right we went to No
and the famed

667
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:46,119
this same rule applies to any kind of
wood and operations

668
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:50,720
okay X or more or okay you always got
something to think my

669
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,810
you might call girl why not but with
dynamic and I did you can see

670
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:58,619
great where did the information came and
then you can really that they're minor

671
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:01,400
what is the result of this operation

672
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,740
and I think I used them in the binary
runtime:

673
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:08,369
so if there is going to be a I've
condition I know that I called through

674
00:37:08,369 --> 00:37:11,030
everything that is used for this
condition

675
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:15,359
to happen to be true for example I know
it going to read so I can deter mine

676
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,589
if I think they cannot be terrified only
the program to just run

677
00:37:18,589 --> 00:37:21,760
in the Middle Way and then change the
packet

678
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,490
find a new packages start that word
again and then try again

679
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:30,300
I don't need to do that they can just
pass it on the fly as a shield

680
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,900
good so how do I keep track up this
information

681
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:38,290
basically there is like four different
descriptors when it to you that memory

682
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:42,010
so everything that the pressure is using
the mammary it's what I call you that

683
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:42,700
memory

684
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:46,140
so if I know there is some bar been
cooperating someplace have the memory

685
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:49,700
that you good memory there's also the
Corporal memory

686
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,180
the can't remember if the information
that I care more

687
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:56,710
right because it back up your taking
over the cultural memory

688
00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:02,280
with and which bravely I'm having cold
drink over to cook the the cold itself

689
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,710
the cold remedies for example if there
is a call

690
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:10,240
the faded the favor return at the return
address is going to be favored

691
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,320
into memory in the spec so busy area
dislocation up the stack

692
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,260
I mark advocate for memory because I
know if I haven't

693
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:22,329
overwrite the old disfavor the raster
we've got data that a cold drink

694
00:38:22,329 --> 00:38:27,349
I'm no lawyer having quarter over this
occasion of the cold

695
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:32,040
that's cool so the same part favor the
rafters return addresses

696
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,990
so for example say the rafters if I know
there is like for example

697
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:39,200
the depiction began in the start the
pension

698
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,180
the contrary savings from Castres and
and and and

699
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:46,760
it's getting back to the better to the
original resin returning to the cali

700
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:51,270
okay if I haven't ever like a pic
overdid Miller area where this

701
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:55,400
raptor red favorite I know that I called
reply cable we be act

702
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,810
in the country because any pics or
return to visit

703
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:03,079
did after that i overwrote no are being
used by the cali

704
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:06,859
so I know that I have I have a colder
over disaster so that's why we need to

705
00:39:06,859 --> 00:39:08,339
keep this track

706
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:11,500
good also I need to keep track about the
program

707
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:15,410
state that fell so what what what is
where

708
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:18,920
right attitude really understand what is
the location of the information into

709
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,760
memory

710
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,520
and what its cool ways like at the
borders provide everything for you

711
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,210
okay a state aid I just need to keep
track of their

712
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:31,599
but it comes like easy and the end and
it is because all the bug is provided to

713
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:32,990
you that's why the debaters

714
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:37,980
really exist to provide information and
well there is a special case for the pic

715
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:38,790
memory

716
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:42,060
because the hit man were due to the keep
memory protection is then

717
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:45,359
the way did you know that if the
inhibitor holes nowadays behave

718
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:49,109
you really need a special patient for to
hit because it's not just because

719
00:39:49,109 --> 00:39:51,079
whoever wrote the cultural memory

720
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:54,920
related to the heat that you have called
me over to system because sometimes

721
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:59,119
did chunk of memory are not going to be
freed or are not going to be copied to

722
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,010
somewhere

723
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:03,770
that you can really achieve is it called
education so

724
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:07,180
to pick trek up the hit man where you
need to put trigger crack over

725
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:11,890
all the calls that the medical aid the
memory so like for example if you have a

726
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:12,880
little sister

727
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,119
you're going to keep track of all of
them i lock in three you are going to

728
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:18,520
keep track about everything that is
really using

729
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,579
decade of the sister there is

730
00:40:21,579 --> 00:40:25,010
breakup different way then there is
another tenant with me thats

731
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:28,660
big applications kravitz own trip
implementations

732
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:32,030
so I don't know if you guys ever had the
american today

733
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:35,030
I dunno send a cold gmail paid

734
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:38,030
word not called right but

735
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:41,490
worker or getting ready for whatever
good

736
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:45,710
all day big big implications faggot
phone locator

737
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:50,339
white performance reasons so you need to
get crackin

738
00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:54,200
better understand it can't do the
locators itself will usually called

739
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,069
we'll do that

740
00:40:55,069 --> 00:40:58,640
basically you need to have a past winner
ability to build a set them to you

741
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,210
plastics but the ability to understand
I'll go look at the works and then

742
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:07,109
you start you update the formation of
the Pokes

743
00:41:07,109 --> 00:41:11,010
so for it goes through ice Kitchener

744
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:15,369
right into the memory address then
rebuild his memory address is being used

745
00:41:15,369 --> 00:41:17,900
by the application itself would have
been right

746
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:21,609
it's being retarded we know there is
some information that needs to be in a

747
00:41:21,609 --> 00:41:22,119
readable

748
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:25,400
area why did kind of information is
important

749
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,160
goes for example they did client would
have been eating Linux it was

750
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,490
perspective appear within a minute but
for you to exploit it would be too quick

751
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,010
for you

752
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:37,089
you were over like a true true specific
pointers that you need to point to

753
00:41:37,089 --> 00:41:41,640
why did the men were areas because that
pic sent is reading it is areas

754
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:46,680
before it really return so you never got
colder over the kitchen at this point

755
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,440
there's no point to a real memory area

756
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,839
how do you know that now you can debug a
tmobile it there

757
00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:56,530
every time to be a mentor stuff for you
can just keep track and want to pick by

758
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:57,410
conciliate

759
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:01,930
there's too many areas that I need ivory
taxes

760
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:05,470
her did every time there is an i right

761
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:09,030
you can do is write is happening on
memory area there right coltrane

762
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:12,410
you think michael Davies I know there is
a member David short

763
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:16,690
that day easiest way so I can just speed
back at the president say hey there's a

764
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:17,970
memory corruption

765
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:21,630
but from time to time it's going to
happen that the memory area that you're

766
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:22,720
writing to

767
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,750
are just another member you're going to
use at least

768
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,770
so that's why the program is always
growing okay

769
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:33,099
that's why I'm not think this is the
depicted there the

770
00:42:33,099 --> 00:42:36,319
folk and I think the supreme solution
it's just

771
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:39,760
part of the process of getting to the
solution

772
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,630
so for again re

773
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:47,349
we going to do okay think you're
stepping okay

774
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:51,940
I if you do things that by: the clothing
you're going to cure your cell

775
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:55,550
because you're not going to find edited
by the greater

776
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:58,619
okay a we went through

777
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:02,000
have the perfect day so what we do is
like

778
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,250
every time that we really need to stop
the application to look into the

779
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:09,170
called applications behavior in then
with earth that can I was just to see

780
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,230
what's going on in the future

781
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:14,880
that's like imitation is so important
because then we can say hey there will

782
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,160
be a temp condition

783
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,550
there would be something here that they
need to avoid go there when the

784
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:23,410
there the echo board should continue we
don't want it all

785
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:27,079
to break the application and dues
fingers tapping or whatever

786
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:31,160
so a specifically talking about the heap
information

787
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,170
you can integrate a hip new so

788
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:37,800
/url many bankers I don't know if you
guys ever make it into the security

789
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,210
appliances but I'm sure there's one guy
here who already looking to secure the

790
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:41,960
prices

791
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,460
but thank you dispatcher for the
fingertip licensed you're going to see a

792
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,339
lot of Bruno

793
00:43:46,339 --> 00:43:50,210
weird behavior you when you really have
a stumpy being overflowed

794
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:53,609
white because most of the sicker today
North dick

795
00:43:53,609 --> 00:43:57,310
kind of kept iraqi of did you know
unknown located

796
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:01,470
spaces in the memory so let's suppose
you are a security Maynard who are like

797
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:04,859
for example of firewall Kompany and the

798
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:08,329
you have a really huge project okay you
are currently

799
00:44:08,329 --> 00:44:13,150
a lot of packets you go work then all 24
get through for some pointers

800
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:16,210
because his memoir you are not 3 are
going to know

801
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:20,200
through case your machine in the long
run your machine are going to stop to

802
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:20,800
work

803
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,530
so this mainers also have a ship
implementations and they have a kind of

804
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:25,490
trip built

805
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:29,710
call can you even write a hit you the
same way that the guys are keeping the

806
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:30,960
protection

807
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,490
basically what they do it every time
there is then returned to the

808
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:37,839
to the block list you can check the
cannery up to read

809
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:41,390
right they don't create a real cannery
decade

810
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:44,770
because it's going to be really time
consuming to relieve your fight that

811
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:46,119
every time you are free

812
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:49,569
so it's gonna do that there just
verified the pointers are really pointed

813
00:44:49,569 --> 00:44:50,970
to by the addresses

814
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:54,630
but what you can do with you can just
Infect Dis cannery

815
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:58,680
so if the car you conner is being over
it and then you need to look into it

816
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:02,869
and the well there is other projects
that are already providing like hip you

817
00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:04,540
like core security really that the

818
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:08,010
up your game for Windows the burger for
I don't remember exactly

819
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:11,520
that its second provides the oldest ship
built so you can

820
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:16,990
easily get what they did and just you
know mode 5k why do you need

821
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:20,700
yeah good Golders copyright so

822
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:23,859
also if you went to have this visual of
what what's going on

823
00:45:23,859 --> 00:45:27,690
with the hip so you can detect it is
mainly mixer or other kind of problems

824
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:28,780
that usually

825
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:34,130
don't go to the corruption images in
immediately

826
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:37,619
so for I think they'd we can't win with
you

827
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:41,839
we meet I will take the target so I can
fold the deterministic problem

828
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:46,290
good if it what it failed it seem like
something running the kernel

829
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:49,589
can I will take the target us also
running the kernel

830
00:45:49,589 --> 00:45:53,849
yes it is possible the roster the burger
is an example of a debugger running

831
00:45:53,849 --> 00:45:56,970
kernel mode just using pattern hoax
inside the kernel

832
00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:00,500
so yes it is possible even if you are
debugging like internal mould

833
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,530
not in earnest arlene user mold

834
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:06,599
so I'm a bit the over things that are
going to be the third

835
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:09,960
the news that in into the brought and
watching what you're learning you know

836
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,520
what it terms for demolition I refer the

837
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,220
and the subfolders and other stuff like
that

838
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:19,970
and of course we need to move through
grape tomato and could crack you up all

839
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:21,440
the call dependences

840
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,910
that's why redeploy ger I the I really
great

841
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:28,240
because big help you to do that you
don't really need to called everything

842
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,310
you can just

843
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:34,060
you know use what they already provide
for you

844
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:38,920
another problem that you can soldiers
like conditions that don't exist in the

845
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,369
pool with elation up the softer going to
default configuration

846
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:45,720
or into the blood corporation you are
testing soul

847
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,040
that supposed to have a little bit but
this winter but it just happens it from

848
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,640
a specific feature of this offer is in a
bit

849
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:55,140
you really are going to spot that
because you're going to see there's an

850
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:58,500
conditioning the softer that you don't
have to call girl here

851
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,660
so why you don't have a good trip over
this condition may be because its

852
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,890
condition is coming from Fort Berthold
Fido

853
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:07,609
a configuration file so you can easily
keep track up the configuration file has

854
00:47:07,609 --> 00:47:08,940
been greeted by the Psalter

855
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:12,050
and then you can score over in a bit if
they can in different configurations

856
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:14,050
then they went through the flight

857
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:17,530
this is especially useful when you all
did he makes ever softer

858
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:22,460
let couples were told that the pack how
many out there that fast track

859
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:25,099
how many corporations different
configuration options do you have for

860
00:47:25,099 --> 00:47:26,359
potash

861
00:47:26,359 --> 00:47:29,520
whole deal really for the posh

862
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,059
it's pretty crazy your it for really big
soccer with

863
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:36,380
pauldrons up options for integration
options

864
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:40,290
and that well it doesnt bear important
to have the patient the target because I

865
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:40,920
specific

866
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,410
so is that okay said while I was held it
in a poptart

867
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:48,369
server soap operas servers are specially
interesting

868
00:47:48,369 --> 00:47:52,079
because usually you don't interact you
don't fare

869
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,220
email to the popular sever right you
said they mailed to the SMTP server

870
00:47:56,220 --> 00:48:00,450
who kindly will parse it going to save
it in your mail to your mailbox

871
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:05,579
right and then the pot 37 21 when the
user login to the pub 37

872
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:09,290
at the Ford is emailed a popular senator
we've got the email and original to the

873
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:10,390
user and whatever

874
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:14,339
right the corporate governance report
minutes to do with politics that

875
00:48:14,339 --> 00:48:18,030
so if you're going to give you got to
recover for example if you create the

876
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:18,890
cash

877
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:23,339
about the information it's reading why
because when you have like a male deer

878
00:48:23,339 --> 00:48:27,410
for stricter you know that the public
Golden Globe different directors for it

879
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:29,900
email because its performance wise right

880
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:34,920
but to really parks all that good
directors and find where is the males of

881
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:35,710
the user

882
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:39,450
effect complex piece of software so what
why they don't they create the caching

883
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:40,400
mechanism

884
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,170
that you always keeps racking up the
latest read the email

885
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:48,119
you don't really have control over def
cash who is really writing to the cache

886
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:49,040
file

887
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,119
it's not a few out that Packer so how do
you force a

888
00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:56,270
whether to write to the case file it's a
pretty difficult that's good right

889
00:48:56,270 --> 00:49:00,270
USA in an email let's suppose you are
you think email as the SMTP

890
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:03,520
gmail can parse the pirate can remove
something that you already

891
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,230
thanks you don't know you never know it
for the mail servers going to parse it

892
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:07,980
or not

893
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:11,569
gmail is going to save their the filing
did mailed your directory

894
00:49:11,569 --> 00:49:15,630
the book to read senator you reply when
the puck through senator will save the

895
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:16,319
file

896
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:20,960
in the cache directory in the cast file
what is interesting is like usually

897
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,430
because up this occurred twice the pot
37 redraft the privileges and

898
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:29,290
when a true really write the file it's
the right thing to fight a lot

899
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:34,339
your user right it always try to ride
the pilots your user

900
00:49:34,339 --> 00:49:39,099
soul with me that the user if they have
like a local access to the machine the

901
00:49:39,099 --> 00:49:40,390
user can create the final

902
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:43,849
straightforward so your pen you know

903
00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:47,109
the user can interacting with bit parts
for all

904
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:50,230
they're catching files directly without
busting

905
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:53,589
to the writing into the reading but up
whether

906
00:49:53,589 --> 00:49:56,680
called you do that you really ought to
make that we got closer or touring

907
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:57,260
exported

908
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:01,140
happening in this case how do I spotted
well I read article

909
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:05,260
it's her a pretty straightforward way to
bill that includes three

910
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:08,650
open source software but how do you
really do that in

911
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:11,829
girls that curse of the hell do you spot
what this alters reading

912
00:50:11,829 --> 00:50:15,950
the only way to keep keep track of how
the information is being used and what

913
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:16,930
is optional

914
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:21,859
and why you are never controlling some
specific kind of information

915
00:50:21,859 --> 00:50:25,160
so group a white gold round

916
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:28,809
well vulgar I discuss north of tools
that Britain

917
00:50:28,809 --> 00:50:33,420
pretty cool it has a lot of the
everybody who's Bo ground pepper fiving

918
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:36,680
everybody whose blog right to the tech
mainly christa

919
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:39,900
and voted part 6 page showing the
plodding

920
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:44,089
and well it provides building permit
hate language with his backs

921
00:50:44,089 --> 00:50:47,180
we desire it could be that language so
it's cool with provides everything that

922
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:48,150
I knew that

923
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:51,470
the only problem is it's not so portable
out they weren't that

924
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:54,730
so I I created apartheid version for
Windows

925
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:59,210
with is not that pretty ass I went dead
but the yet

926
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:02,260
it it works it works between the burger

927
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:06,589
so I think they did there is the need
for the intermediate language but I i

928
00:51:06,589 --> 00:51:09,630
not being really could hear why did
israel in a that

929
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:12,720
well you need intermediate language
because the finger languages the

930
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,150
predefined lingers

931
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:18,099
that's why everybody loves it soap how
it works let's suppose I have a question

932
00:51:18,099 --> 00:51:18,859
you react

933
00:51:18,859 --> 00:51:21,880
so well with the fee paid very to write
them just saving a value

934
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:26,220
into the top of the stack but the
question your ex credit you access

935
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:31,290
you know XP separator but there tomorrow
parents that are in place to hear

936
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:35,490
making you work decreasing defect
pointer you are using the spec points or

937
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:36,910
2.2 publication

938
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:40,940
and to say the value of he acting to
that that location in the memory

939
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:44,980
so the finger language it's pretty fun
is pretty easy simple

940
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:48,089
but the you got a lot of people with the
stuff going on

941
00:51:48,089 --> 00:51:51,119
so some cases are being watched by
themselves but they're going on

942
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,869
if you don't see it the intermediate
language are going to provide just got

943
00:51:54,869 --> 00:51:57,390
up information for you

944
00:51:57,390 --> 00:52:01,180
so bouldering I don't okay it's with a
couple for

945
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:05,119
hold if I'll repeat beauties work with
the Rebbe really fast because it's not

946
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:08,349
you know the most important step what is
important to understand that

947
00:52:08,349 --> 00:52:11,020
although the Burger King's you're
providing the same kind of the

948
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:12,260
persecutor for you

949
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:15,839
so you can create produce for either or
produce for weed a burger or whatever

950
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:16,599
you want

951
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:20,510
it back to your shoulders makeup the the
read a burger

952
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:23,589
ok but not the moment but so basically

953
00:52:23,589 --> 00:52:26,680
their well-read you can credibly argue
physician for sure that we'll do

954
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,450
whatever you want them in my case it was
cut the handlers

955
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:33,109
and it provides good defender for
whatever you work actually the day

956
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:33,760
workers are

957
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,390
pretty cool in that so for example you
just weren't true

958
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:40,400
it to see when a member is going to be
returned when it's

959
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,589
it is what just returned when there is a
system call

960
00:52:43,589 --> 00:52:47,740
when somebody's changing like a a
protection up a member area

961
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:52,240
with somebody's remapping mapping
cutting BRK straightforward or drift

962
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,069
just using

963
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:57,180
the malloc implementations so well we
provide everything you need

964
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:00,660
and all the burgers are going to
providing the same

965
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:03,800
for also you can easily form and so

966
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,329
they dub instrumentation revoking the
second the call that I just sold is

967
00:53:07,329 --> 00:53:08,050
acutely

968
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:11,559
that you can look into account for
example you have the effect is pictured

969
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:13,119
with his related to attack

970
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:17,099
you know it's going to jump basically
what condition you can just say okay

971
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:20,430
turns just jerked you are unconditional
jump for example

972
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:23,869
and it will do that for you you don't
really need to care about size of

973
00:53:23,869 --> 00:53:26,349
restrictions or whatever talents you
have

974
00:53:26,349 --> 00:53:30,050
okay as much as you are with work and
rigorous gonna sing

975
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:33,069
exactly the same way okay

976
00:53:33,069 --> 00:53:36,180
so why don't do that like for example
decade

977
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:39,470
real just using like a pretty molding up
libraries

978
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:42,670
there's some weird to me some tools that
you didn't bring loading

979
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:46,180
well first of all when you are using
Perl old a

980
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:49,930
trip if trek up to be calmer law career
mark or whatever location

981
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:53,730
interview went to keep track you are
missing the live pictures

982
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,740
sometimes there is the line of control
sometimes there is a straight forward

983
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:58,349
calls to the system call

984
00:53:58,349 --> 00:54:01,670
so I they say that a lot of big projects
are calling

985
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:04,670
this the BRK skirts border a Cali

986
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:08,040
underline a very consistent thread for
them they don't count on their

987
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:11,160
a Shipmanagement up to pray consistent
so

988
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:14,930
it's the problem also the other problem
is your breaking the Heisenberg

989
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:16,300
principal

990
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:20,280
with me with say that the debugger
cannot tend to be favored internal

991
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,980
behavior of the application

992
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:25,540
which means when you have like Britain
holding up lovers you are training their

993
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:26,849
loading avaricious

994
00:54:26,849 --> 00:54:30,550
all the libraries okay so you don't want
to have it

995
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:33,800
so that the buggers the best option or

996
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:37,000
other thing today the biggest the
challenges call to

997
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,339
got this problem that's under under 10
minutes get pregnant

998
00:54:40,339 --> 00:54:43,619
and the Soviet in such a way that we can
really

999
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:46,829
greater than the term its commercial
aimed to solve in under 10 minutes good

1000
00:54:46,829 --> 00:54:47,619
problem

1001
00:54:47,619 --> 00:54:51,390
think how do we do that basically the
idea is like you've got up have liked

1002
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:52,270
the address

1003
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:56,230
of think we're off to a future that you
are changing our districts anywhere

1004
00:54:56,230 --> 00:55:00,680
testing and of fact so what we do is
make up like an old others

1005
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:04,750
as well so basically the the big ideas
like a weekend

1006
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:09,130
really with the lies the problem became
a great a lot of mucins running good

1007
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:11,170
ball machine is running towards

1008
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:14,549
in eight of these machines are opening
the of 250

1009
00:55:14,549 --> 00:55:17,880
it he took these machines are part of
the cluster and I know what

1010
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:21,210
were much in the past that's all I don't
need to test it again

1011
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:24,790
okay the other questions are really
going to do the the work

1012
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:28,920
thinks I'm just bored wine the
information all the targets are not on

1013
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,880
the closer on the reason it's ok

1014
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,450
it much easier to distribute the problem
I don't need like

1015
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:38,480
three machine is generating drug can 10
machine is received I can just have the

1016
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,579
machines

1017
00:55:39,579 --> 00:55:44,170
with the target application running I
don't need to say that

1018
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:47,839
there's thousands of problems thing to
synchronization step right

1019
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:51,170
cool a others say that

1020
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:55,670
there is such holders order like a
decision all britain's being used

1021
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:59,510
metal riff 6:30 algorithms a lot of this
test and

1022
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:04,250
their output is not pretty sold just to
have an idea they don't build

1023
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:07,819
with its something like this

1024
00:56:07,819 --> 00:56:12,020
so a as you can see it not exactly a
text file

1025
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:15,530
it is supposed to be loaded into an
interface but they had no time to finish

1026
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:17,650
things are facing time to present here

1027
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:21,720
but the what if they don't the old coot
so this is basically the same word wanna

1028
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,250
be in it if you're looking to

1029
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:27,440
into good things through into the fold
districts in Excel

1030
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,010
see have it here yes but we don't

1031
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:34,440
yes so I don't have the 46 in but you

1032
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,849
is an ABC this is the 14th fiction
because

1033
00:56:37,849 --> 00:56:44,849
group

1034
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:49,510
will

1035
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:53,740
yes here in yes

1036
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:57,060
okay so I think I sell

1037
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:00,319
what did a booger what show is like at
the bar like a

1038
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:03,440
there at the hip ruling interconnection
and

1039
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:07,589
in the middle of the people occasion
routine the program just stop it to work

1040
00:57:07,589 --> 00:57:11,109
right that's why the debugger was
showing so just to see again

1041
00:57:11,109 --> 00:57:14,619
the butter showing okay there's a
breaking point

1042
00:57:14,619 --> 00:57:18,990
for some reason that cutting a break
mister Chen if you look into apps

1043
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:22,430
into that it to the burger to the into
the

1044
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:26,470
case into the stack information you're
going to see hate

1045
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:30,270
there there's really had a good breaking
point it was in the middle of some

1046
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:32,060
routine allocation will train

1047
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:36,819
and that well you can see it came from
all and a method to my library but well

1048
00:57:36,819 --> 00:57:41,400
what really happened it's pretty
difficult to really understand the right

1049
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,640
holodeck bracket hold weight go back and
say hey

1050
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,839
what really happened true true to the
cold so

1051
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:52,240
basically the information that I have
here's what's clear

1052
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:57,140
of course it's not that work could be
right there

1053
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:01,260
but no for it pretty clear to think that
the cave movement a bad it just

1054
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:03,210
specifically positioning the memory

1055
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:06,730
at that well it kind of pointing to
invalidate right

1056
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:10,990
so then I need to get their mind if it
isn't valid pointer

1057
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:14,770
it's something that I call drew the DI
it's something that I call drew

1058
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:18,140
okay I'm receiving information hold 100

1059
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:23,190
okay didn't where it's pointing I know I
called her something that's being

1060
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:27,619
repinned to some someplace but I really
don't know if I call to where it's being

1061
00:58:27,619 --> 00:58:28,270
Rican

1062
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:32,220
that's what they did to that their mind
if I could go grow drink where it's been

1063
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:32,660
written

1064
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:37,520
I have like a overflow okay iControl
something I can write

1065
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,790
so my breasts it's partially because I
think I can see it

1066
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:44,609
d I'm not a DI so I partially cold drink

1067
00:58:44,609 --> 00:58:47,670
and address right it's not a billboard

1068
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:52,230
it was a double word overflow for sure
if the code is a cure Senate

1069
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:55,510
pretty the well who work now that's not
the case

1070
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:58,650
okay it's just awarded with Paul so
literally

1071
00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:03,240
inward were different for every word II
promise it was not a purple

1072
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:08,420
so it's really cool as well because look
into whether Penn tonight is cutting me

1073
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:12,010
K there's some kind of wrote in it sure

1074
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:16,670
changing the behavior of your report
well that's pretty cool there is a two

1075
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:17,450
hour

1076
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:20,579
so I know we tried went to really
exploit this vulnerability

1077
00:59:20,579 --> 00:59:24,010
I really need to buy passes to lower
call so

1078
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:28,750
a if you look into the size of the words
and if you're looking to the size of the

1079
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:32,190
information that they're the 10 tonight
it is really gave to you

1080
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:35,190
you are going through agree with me it's
much less

1081
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:39,000
what if you look like a commission that
you need to do with okay

1082
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,569
so of course that's what to add the word
that giving a lot of it you know

1083
00:59:43,569 --> 00:59:47,740
really nice information what missing
hours the graphical tool that will help

1084
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:49,030
you to really

1085
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:52,440
exercise that and the okay

1086
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:55,970
new c3 know that what else we have

1087
00:59:55,970 --> 01:00:01,540
so met do a case study right let's get
some good lovin it that's what everybody

1088
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:02,319
works right

1089
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:06,380
okay so basically every are you are
reading through cases but I think they

1090
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:07,010
flight

1091
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:11,359
and work 830 where you just feel dick
white working to recover care plan right

1092
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:15,000
couldn't so they could but it is writer
publisher get a minute

1093
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,210
but the well you what you are going to
understeer

1094
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:22,800
why it's important okay so Solaris is
the key operating system I like

1095
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:23,869
selectors pretty much

1096
01:00:23,869 --> 01:00:26,990
so I decided that for my room what's
going through looking for him in a

1097
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:27,420
minute

1098
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:31,490
and a okay so fed me is like a dream on
you

1099
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:34,510
led by blah blah blah blah blah to go
get this allows operating system

1100
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:38,220
I i don't really need to know why did
salters unit for I don't need to know

1101
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:39,740
the Salters there by the full

1102
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:45,119
soaked a big-league me and some resident
guys who have his ride security group

1103
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:49,329
we usually play different course that if
you guys use map exploit for sure you

1104
01:00:49,329 --> 01:00:50,490
step that we did

1105
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:54,599
a and well basically in October did

1106
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:58,950
up 2008 we really don't like when we
gonna be in it predicting

1107
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:02,980
working exploit straightforward for
domestic flights

1108
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:06,200
because there's one of the guys in the
group with actually I'm a pic but

1109
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,130
developer

1110
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:11,119
so he parted it shitty exploited to be a
knife thematic

1111
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:14,910
like the worm really beautiful we could
work it pretty well and help

1112
01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:19,119
what it might be like sometime later ago
show you the timelines

1113
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:22,930
sick gone yet really that to order her
to be in it what the heck

1114
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:26,549
take a look at it in defense of her that
real deterred and the pope could have

1115
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:28,089
driven a minute that we didn't

1116
01:01:28,089 --> 01:01:32,200
I was repeated with that with well there
was no details at all

1117
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:36,280
with its money right well I really the
little bit if you don't give details

1118
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:39,760
I don't like it but well that the
behavior of the corporations like

1119
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,890
4k it pretty big like a the pig roast
care life

1120
01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:47,750
7.4 remote people were killed at their
went up in a bit okay

1121
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:52,710
well why it's 7.4 because it turned
green burned expert ability level

1122
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:55,720
with me sick when it didn't rollet an
exploit right

1123
01:01:55,720 --> 01:02:00,430
that's cool the realism in a bit but
they don't know if it can be expected a

1124
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:04,410
also there's another wondered whether
they think is overpaying and i can text

1125
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:05,819
but the village level

1126
01:02:05,819 --> 01:02:09,520
was then prove it every well-written
money they pay to the complex governor

1127
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:10,960
had agreed to work really hard

1128
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:16,579
written bill really but better so what
are heading to the advisers it affect

1129
01:02:16,579 --> 01:02:17,049
you that

1130
01:02:17,049 --> 01:02:20,109
they don't provide any details right go
how old are you

1131
01:02:20,109 --> 01:02:23,319
find the one to beat it and in the
beginning I said hey come out

1132
01:02:23,319 --> 01:02:27,010
the do think that if it can it really
that the same going to because we do

1133
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:30,880
I don't know I don't think so right so
we didn't fact that the kennedys

1134
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,369
critical and that would have the word it
wasn't exactly the same fiction

1135
01:02:34,369 --> 01:02:39,020
that's beside me much more right because
ever gonna be through planted money

1136
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:43,190
in your account right because the
Confederate people pay the price paid to

1137
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:44,210
pinpoint pay

1138
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:47,549
causing pay another a a lot of companies
pay and they

1139
01:02:47,549 --> 01:02:50,920
the group that we live in a beautiful I
don't like to know

1140
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:54,520
not fit everything the current picture
back

1141
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:58,520
so I decided to collect from going up
there tonight if if India in the country

1142
01:02:58,520 --> 01:02:59,010
again

1143
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:03,250
tumor why I can export doing everything
now that I have something better

1144
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:06,910
so basically we think there's a call to
a specific occasion

1145
01:03:06,910 --> 01:03:09,930
and it's using a value that the recall
doing so

1146
01:03:09,930 --> 01:03:12,930
I recall that the painted value okay

1147
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:16,730
ollie north using because well there's a
push up this value okay so i know im

1148
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:17,920
just gonna they're using

1149
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:21,569
okay in fact disclosure there is another
you know

1150
01:03:21,569 --> 01:03:25,220
pushed upward you pro another better
that I go to a store and pick a good

1151
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:26,079
thing to parents

1152
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:29,540
so I called it a bit the first better
for the call did better with you that in

1153
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:33,589
another information in the area the
memory so I threw more like older with

1154
01:03:33,589 --> 01:03:36,760
and then there is another call show
another rating

1155
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:40,250
this protein if you think dependent
value

1156
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:43,589
ago but under for the next go what is
the next goal that

1157
01:03:43,589 --> 01:03:46,630
pretty interesting it on a location
function

1158
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:50,460
so let me try to understand it's right I
call great been

1159
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:54,520
sizeof KK Sharma that it's pretty cool
weather

1160
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:59,010
go called legal to decide it's a header
information

1161
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:02,619
but what do you think the Heather thing
to like a decisive them

1162
01:04:02,619 --> 01:04:06,720
ending the data itself I can do it a
hundred

1163
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:10,369
well pretty cool with going to cut a
hundred bucks

1164
01:04:10,369 --> 01:04:13,700
is fed up in spiked 50 for

1165
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:17,549
well pretty smart her ok it is marked

1166
01:04:17,549 --> 01:04:21,560
right so bigger they are cutting a
portion they are reading

1167
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:24,910
the date affection up the packet and
they are treating and curing

1168
01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:28,960
achievement sold everything and copping
a Booker but the allocation of the paper

1169
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:29,869
can spend their

1170
01:04:29,869 --> 01:04:33,210
Heather of the package don't think like
pretty smart

1171
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:36,630
so pretty funny pretty easy to exploit
people

1172
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:40,079
so let's go to the conflict were rightly
the first one with fifty

1173
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:43,630
ok let me to call like a so /url

1174
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:47,020
bed gonna they're could vary from bad as
they are looking at your hotel there's a

1175
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:48,560
location waiting again

1176
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:52,890
sorted whole cover her you think it's
going to be a location broken again

1177
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:53,599
maybe

1178
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:57,010
soap there's a revocation big get the
current size

1179
01:04:57,010 --> 01:05:00,390
they get their game decides to Heather
okay

1180
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:04,069
so we going to decide their fate decides
to Heather so you're painting you

1181
01:05:04,069 --> 01:05:08,210
the get the books five goals for product
rather so that got through cycle to have

1182
01:05:08,210 --> 01:05:08,579
their

1183
01:05:08,579 --> 01:05:12,280
and white girl that really beautiful
they'd make flight

1184
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:15,380
35 got a cold drink

1185
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:19,349
that's a really beautiful where they
look into decided they no like this

1186
01:05:19,349 --> 01:05:21,060
either going to be bigger not

1187
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:24,670
but think they way they are using
decided to go back to be able to pick a

1188
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:25,210
ser

1189
01:05:25,210 --> 01:05:29,839
sort by provide like to large-sized
becoming like a pretty small size

1190
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:34,640
so again pretty the through export them
to really explore

1191
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:38,330
so not too happy with that they decided
to have a looker

1192
01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:41,640
into Solaris and the I found is going to
be that I

1193
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:45,310
expected to be published so they're
ready but it's just two months

1194
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:48,369
with you guys are sure going to see

1195
01:05:48,369 --> 01:05:51,440
this little bit to in the

1196
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:55,270
make small being really that maybe I
just wanna be perfect solarz

1197
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:58,640
it to be ok sam a act redistricting

1198
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:01,859
so it means it's locked India at they
had me

1199
01:06:01,859 --> 01:06:05,859
it's not enough AFL if that they had me
because I figured mean don't use

1200
01:06:05,859 --> 01:06:08,970
if opinions at the end so large the
excellent work

1201
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:12,660
but what is really cool looking for a
minute well period expired already

1202
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:13,849
secured to the K

1203
01:06:13,849 --> 01:06:17,400
just think a ticket fails here's dick
but the red is the color that a good

1204
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:18,630
just doing a less

1205
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:22,849
okay just in case but the key you stop
the exploit

1206
01:06:22,849 --> 01:06:27,069
Group Inc the colors machine

1207
01:06:27,069 --> 01:06:30,790
well it's being so

1208
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:33,950
I have distillers machine humming
running here

1209
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:40,950
and the

1210
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:46,340
so over just as acute the export and the

1211
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:50,230
well I replaced the name refer actually
play

1212
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:53,470
the but yes open remote Eric

1213
01:06:53,470 --> 01:06:56,850
forget well night Heidi route

1214
01:06:56,850 --> 01:07:01,290
because look at TTC chair Adam it's
pretty cool if you guys want to go to my

1215
01:07:01,290 --> 01:07:03,650
password is getting reports it's really
cool

1216
01:07:03,650 --> 01:07:06,860
you're going to go over to VMware kar

1217
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:11,870
okay so a didn't have it is not
important to record a I def

1218
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:16,310
show it because they're it's good to see
you hate holders it were connected

1219
01:07:16,310 --> 01:07:18,260
really he's got it found that is

1220
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:21,330
not really as you stroll a shoulder like
a

1221
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:24,440
really big 500 with a lot of a family
called it back into

1222
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:27,990
say it's not really the but then it is
really for

1223
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:31,940
that's for sure and the well we have
much more motivation are they thinking

1224
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:32,560
the beginning

1225
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:36,550
because I've mara they fix as more time
I'm explaining

1226
01:07:36,550 --> 01:07:40,650
finding it so it's critical gun-related

1227
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:44,520
brother just in case if you guys really
want to understand more and I really

1228
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:45,070
want to

1229
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:48,440
through you know like deal more with
this kind of information

1230
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:52,450
there is also a presentation by cuz
think by being naggy

1231
01:07:52,450 --> 01:07:56,430
up causing hope well

1232
01:07:56,430 --> 01:08:03,430
that the projector attack

1233
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:09,220
aka who there is also a presentation by
day nag drinkers think

1234
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:12,880
about this more data believes that a
iight ordeal that

1235
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:16,199
because they incur have the proper told
her

1236
01:08:16,199 --> 01:08:19,819
this weather station old is a different
one is not related to just two hundred

1237
01:08:19,819 --> 01:08:20,350
thousand

1238
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:23,759
so believe me everybody care

1239
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:27,739
through wind would have been at the
rewards and that so

1240
01:08:27,739 --> 01:08:31,440
a the method here they can't foresee the
future

1241
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:35,710
I know everything is improving but her I
don't know

1242
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:38,859
or it's going to end I'm developing a
lot of stuff

1243
01:08:38,859 --> 01:08:42,480
related to that and really happy through
country within to extend information

1244
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:43,589
with other researchers

1245
01:08:43,589 --> 01:08:47,359
even more because every time you're told
that the differences then it's a

1246
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:50,489
different alan is a different location
retain a different way

1247
01:08:50,489 --> 01:08:55,020
up the system work so it's pretty cool
with the you guys work with exploitation

1248
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:59,020
it's critical to keeping gault and a I
think they'd the Falcons

1249
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:02,739
up his research into the burger itself
so that

1250
01:09:02,739 --> 01:09:06,009
that that was my methods I'm here for
questions

1251
01:09:06,009 --> 01:09:09,589
and also different anybody wants to
paint beer

1252
01:09:09,589 --> 01:09:16,589
real success kirker ok

1253
01:09:19,870 --> 01:09:23,389
anyway

1254
01:09:23,389 --> 01:09:26,540
thank you very much that newsweek like
away

1255
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:31,549
thank you do you have any question yes

1256
01:09:31,549 --> 01:09:38,549
please

1257
01:09:48,569 --> 01:09:52,890
yes yes a didn't do this actually really
possible

1258
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:55,930
is not something that I am doing because
well

1259
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:59,720
for football I'm not sure exactly which
can affect everyone to see

1260
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:03,170
right when you were construction a
father for the first time based on what

1261
01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:04,240
you have is like

1262
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:08,600
the specifications of the current not
always the parameters open like a

1263
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:11,690
there is word project that started
before deployment was open

1264
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:15,500
when the payment was open then it was
much easier but there is a lot of

1265
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:17,830
plaudits for much but through don't
really understand

1266
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:21,190
call you can create files to really
achieve what you want

1267
01:10:21,190 --> 01:10:24,720
soul we we went something that you will
pay ten will grow

1268
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:28,390
according also I really the word through
great company that through

1269
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:31,690
too much dependent I want to know to
make it the

1270
01:10:31,690 --> 01:10:34,840
the bigger side fees of possible

1271
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:38,020
you know like growing out that's offered
roles and understanding how the

1272
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:41,090
application works with old have a
dependence of the application itself

1273
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:44,380
but the if you look in in there old
people

1274
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:48,120
the two in the end it's basically giving
you all the kids traces

1275
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:52,950
soul you know what what your cold busted
through and what is changing your call

1276
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:56,640
school in the end you have to think I'm
Asian but I don't great information

1277
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:03,640
previously i'd give you later

1278
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:12,050
yes a when it went off the is Marcus
think to assume you anywhere

1279
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:16,100
buzzing is like a for others not from
train through the guy

1280
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:19,949
the notary give try that guy just press
the button okay so

1281
01:11:19,949 --> 01:11:23,929
not nothing that couldn't call on our
just kinda buzzers are not going to find

1282
01:11:23,929 --> 01:11:25,520
stuff they are pretty basic

1283
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,830
but they're not going to find the kind
of stuff that I am interested all which

1284
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:32,310
is the call between ability so basically
it what I i assume

1285
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:36,190
is like the guy who's going to use it
Sun an analyst will have experience and

1286
01:11:36,190 --> 01:11:37,800
who knows what he wants to do that

1287
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:41,670
so for example and its allies gonna be
to just show old I knew what is that

1288
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:46,460
functions that I went to past I knew
where is the problem because the paper

1289
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:49,820
is using the park thinking something
different to that deals with networking

1290
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:51,369
a picture that deals with the pile

1291
01:11:51,369 --> 01:11:54,449
so I know this is the range of
information that I really want to

1292
01:11:54,449 --> 01:11:55,150
understand

1293
01:11:55,150 --> 01:11:59,460
and desired information that I am taking
care no of course if your crap

1294
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:02,830
the resource to relieve the because
they're running like because i think is

1295
01:12:02,830 --> 01:12:03,280
running

1296
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:07,790
didn't step in 16 machines with hundreds
of your call what's changed

1297
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:10,909
okay so of course you can just leave it
running

1298
01:12:10,909 --> 01:12:14,800
but they're what I'm developing forties
like to get on that specialize in the

1299
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:18,480
guys who really pointed into the places
where there is even a bit

1300
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:22,869
the idea if there is also that you can
easily create and exploit called

1301
01:12:22,869 --> 01:12:26,730
a school with come by to release a patch
so my ideas like a KU

1302
01:12:26,730 --> 01:12:30,230
you got the patch you pins if the
Patrick the regional binary

1303
01:12:30,230 --> 01:12:33,659
you got the where is that would have
been if you put this information

1304
01:12:33,659 --> 01:12:37,310
on the 10 tonight isn't think it will
show you how to create the file so you

1305
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:38,250
can exploit it

1306
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:43,080
they did like exploiting creation really
fast for well-known going to be a little

1307
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:46,650
every time picking a really something
with all to give details we can really

1308
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:47,440
something with

1309
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:51,639
all the details every time for tonight
going me something with all details the

1310
01:12:51,639 --> 01:12:53,290
golden release the public exploit

1311
01:12:53,290 --> 01:12:56,330
so we are going to remove this you know

1312
01:12:56,330 --> 01:13:01,489
business behind security okay

1313
01:13:01,489 --> 01:13:05,199
due to the only time it with a few take
a question them can take it for you

1314
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:08,780
and directly I'm pretty sure he will be
arraigned record there

1315
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:12,320
okay to call yet no then entered a
coffee break

1316
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:15,469
and tabby going to continue in about at
twenty minutes

1317
01:13:15,469 --> 01:13:19,179
I guess way
