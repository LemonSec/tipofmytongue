1
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:44,820
I own top of the company distancing up

2
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:51,820
currently up

3
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,170
thanks for the invitation and thanks for
coming

4
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:13,060
from and thanks for the introduction I
would say that

5
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:19,480
although this is a very special topic
it's important for everyone

6
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,690
because SAP applications I would like to
use

7
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:26,920
think so who knows SAP

8
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:33,160
by daily experience not not that much

9
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,810
up we are very close recipe headquarters
here

10
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:41,010
and I would say that

11
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,990
although headquarters some somewhere on
the countryside the impact of recipes

12
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:52,920
tremendous soul all fortune 500 company
saw almost all use SAP and

13
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,030
yeah the impact of liabilities

14
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,380
in SAP coat this

15
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,119
higher than a vulnerability in a simple
factual

16
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:09,830
of cost because if you have for example
the supply chain management

17
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:15,280
solution and this something goes wrong
the trucks will stay up to Frankfort on

18
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:15,860
the highway

19
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:22,860
that's really physical impact that you
have a

20
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,760
few words about our company

21
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,230
so we to SAP stuff since 2001

22
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:36,989
as freelancer send we r we became a
little bit most serious

23
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:41,610
in 2006 friend the teamed up from

24
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,780
two to three people up to 12 people s we
have the team today

25
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,799
our headquarters here in hyde

26
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:52,269
rockets the after hyde print building
here

27
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:59,269
behind the threat train station we to
SAP for

28
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,810
over nine years now and we do nothing as
today

29
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,330
so we narrowed our

30
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,510
application security expertise

31
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,930
to exactly one domain which is SAP
programming

32
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,570
SAP programming today s I ever

33
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,950
Java programming richest when you want
to click on something

34
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,250
traffic you I but the real

35
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,600
powerful stuff it's written in recipes
own proprietary language

36
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,459
caught about Sherman a pop in English I
don't know how to pronounce it

37
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:41,750
in English correct

38
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,910
so also written

39
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,140
to win which is a static analisa that
can

40
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:52,230
detect security defects enough up quote

41
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,280
just s

42
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,790
most of computer science for to simplify
our own life

43
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:02,360
and getting rid of manual called he was
entering

44
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,850
that pushing yeah we do

45
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:13,110
SAP audit scope review and we r last we
have published

46
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:17,480
which is currently and unfortunately
only available in German

47
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,530
a programming which is the first topic

48
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:27,260
and today and I about

49
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,460
what can go wrong in

50
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,980
applications I so know it think I love
to know

51
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:39,250
the OWA sp top 10 ranking of
vulnerabilities

52
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,250
so I consider that as a very typical

53
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,150
benchmark and I want to relate that to
SLP crow

54
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:50,090
programming and to show you some
examples

55
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,810
life things can go wrong and what are
the reasons and word

56
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,780
last on what you can do about it

57
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,950
it's not simple but I

58
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,590
want to give you an idea how this looks
like in

59
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:11,590
SAP and what's the challenge

60
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,730
about that language I would say that
more than ninety percent of

61
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,480
or cold in SAP

62
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,240
environments this written up so whenever
you hear that people

63
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:32,070
right things and shop they are the
minority of I said from about history

64
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,540
powerful language for people who have

65
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,610
a business background

66
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:43,020
and expressing what they want to do in
terms of business process

67
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:47,340
in a programming language its not the
programming language that

68
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,400
usually right fences you I

69
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,080
Texas

70
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,550
yes which is

71
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:04,430
since we can assume have language

72
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:11,430
and started like but this upon purchase

73
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,980
that too half a very Crone language

74
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,040
that supports I know at least

75
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,710
eight different programming how the
times at the same time

76
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:25,060
so it's not really easy to see

77
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,430
whether guy this writing up in object

78
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,960
or is writing something it's and

79
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,490
about into protec understand anything

80
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:40,710
but from a security perspective

81
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:46,520
that's in my matter have separate
different program very interesting thing

82
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,400
also is

83
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,000
with cue so

84
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,760
you can name variable

85
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,190
and call it message of

86
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:01,280
program or whatever you want

87
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,580
which doesn't make it easy to to
understand what really happened it's a

88
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,080
very

89
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:13,630
contexts and which very special thing
about

90
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:17,070
up state depends on a database

91
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,230
had has is in sick was dialect

92
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:24,550
depending on the database means all

93
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:28,410
the programming language as for less
that a tax thought

94
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:32,800
in a database yeah

95
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,140
and development environment

96
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,810
in contrast

97
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:45,870
to other programming environments for
you have to local repository of coat

98
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,230
you usually excess your other Colt

99
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:53,720
on the remote link find

100
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,940
and its recites on the which

101
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:04,940
allows United I have is

102
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,490
in the so-called trent laos

103
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:13,070
very professional and

104
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:18,030
efficient software logistic having a
test system

105
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,340
where you develop whatever you want than

106
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,580
this that the process is called
transport

107
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,380
moving cold from the development system

108
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,290
in a standardized way to quality
assurance system

109
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:35,870
way it wont the testing and then it will
find

110
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,130
transport with the productive productive
system

111
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:42,280
in theory sometimes

112
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:49,280
juicy different implementation

113
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:54,140
what has different up the coat

114
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,490
when you are SAP Customer

115
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:02,610
you kept the complete called in clear
text so

116
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:06,270
the snow shipment of binary code kept
the complete

117
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,160
source code of the standout in

118
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,810
each SLPs nation so

119
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,890
what SF shipping the so-called

120
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,690
SAP stand out and whoever

121
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,150
told you with that you can use the
standard and Cole

122
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:29,720
is a liar a you have to happen the

123
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:35,110
invest make USA system running like you
want

124
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:38,480
run which can be done by

125
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,540
configuration trusting the business
processes

126
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,670
or you can in

127
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:52,670
complementary approach you can right on
top

128
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,070
yes with box that's a lot of development
going on

129
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,820
and why

130
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:05,210
we have so what can you do so.

131
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:08,500
you can copy the standard coach you can
rename it

132
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,640
modified sold you have a certain program
in the standoff

133
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,740
want to change it trust copy it into
something

134
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,840
that's called

135
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,230
so SAP speak for that

136
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:31,230
modification modify but you also can
write your own

137
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:37,530
in order to it up customizing

138
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:42,170
you can develop

139
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:47,040
cold for non-standard business processes

140
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,990
think he has about to run for different
industry solutions for

141
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:57,010
oil and gas intro and suspect because
pharma companies

142
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:00,540
production processes and so on but if
you are

143
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,150
not happy with those 100 Senate
solutions

144
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:07,840
unlike you on or by

145
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,330
very

146
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,460
powerful environment for

00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:25,550
with things

149
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:30,430
stop to to took it us

150
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:33,970
when SAP opened its back

151
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:37,340
and monolithic 3

152
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,850
to the Internet which happened by 2001

153
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:43,890
and

154
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:47,170
not implement

155
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:50,250
technologies and open the process

156
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:54,080
to offices but also to infer on

157
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,210
we all expect today the classic

158
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:00,880
all

159
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,190
when you re strange names like or

160
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:11,650
this is very typically step this concept
like

161
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:16,410
wide network x11

162
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:20,690
but S&P gives it a different name so

163
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:24,040
you see established concepts have a
different name and you have a

164
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:30,650
proprietary implementation a tune from
means that you have

165
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:34,020
to say interface for beck and call

166
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:39,370

first step what

172
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:05,350
today

173
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:10,029
development on most stop see it

174
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:15,140
widely used as of today on

175
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:19,700
hot electronic shop was is still based

176
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:26,700
on yes

177
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:30,580
page the concept

178
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,720
having something like chase

179
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,720
people your HTML page

180
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,710
and include their your native uphold

181
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:45,340
you have several programming

182
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,700
also very

183
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:53,110
quick and dirty programming to this

184
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:58,280
verified yes because

185
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,940
and very he seen the of back

186
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:08,940
and second process US

187
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:14,970
which is always

188
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:21,970
right user interface you are device
that's actually

189
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:28,010
so I can point-and-click

190
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:32,300
and then I can say I want to use it on
my

191
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,490
a want for hours I want was it

192
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,840
rabbi want whatever I said yes implement

193
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,740
as a device and interesting

194
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,120
yes really point your you I and

195
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,070
and the only thing you have creche

196
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:54,840
this actually started as a job I'm

197
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,970
fermentation but then when the

198
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:02,080
about team learnt

199
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,500
about technology that took over and a
overtook

200
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,040
challenge today Upton

201
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,800
up the more mature technology and

202
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,530
as I know it today most secure
technology that SAP

203
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:21,520
the frame completely

204
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,250
rent at by SAP standard

205
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,560
so there's no way theoretically

206
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,090
to impact Euronext him and

207
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:38,530
for that reason to usually can't cross a
vulnerability like cross-site scripting

208
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,870
since the frameworks 3 encoding likes

209
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:45,800
caveat here

210
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,660
you also cannot provide because the
framework

211
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,690
so if the framework haz

212
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:56,560
a problem you have it too and best
nothing

213
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:03,560
except ok

214
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:09,370
okay nothin we

215
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:13,139
which looks like

216
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,670
sup we artist displayed a process

217
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:20,699
earlier implement

218
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:25,139
yes today we have lucky and

219
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:28,939
many many other ways how you can
interface

220
00:16:28,939 --> 00:16:32,899
and SAP cost white

221
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:36,399
do you was ok take

222
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,100
job ride

223
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,839
top another pic you can

224
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:48,230
that's not

225
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,870
request its recipes name for

226
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,930
remote procedure call call it more

227
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,519
half Adobe Flash

228
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:05,519
s was a nowadays whatever you know

229
00:17:13,639 --> 00:17:16,779
whatever you need to be sure that SAP
has it somehow

230
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:21,289
can email you can to FTP

231
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:28,289
and steps all kinds of technology

232
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,420
soul that's the introduction recipe and

233
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,960
you can write interfaces

234
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,370
the call for disc the so-called

235
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:47,440
applications which is part of

236
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,790
SAP Basis or

237
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,450
since the days of Shire it's quite nifty

238
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:58,340
the bus actually collection of
technologies

239
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:03,620
that contains database abstraction layer

240
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:07,660
the operating system actually help of

241
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,950
recitation management and many or

242
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:14,610
the application single sign-on

243
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:21,610
security very interesting by

244
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:26,960
less the domain

245
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,050
if you have any sub-domains not really

246
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:35,040
need to configure changes and

247
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,630
defied neither age only

248
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,080
Sep 26 you to change that

249
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,779
on to make

250
00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:52,730
you can write your own age we see people

251
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:58,129
but you i text I mentioned before

252
00:18:58,129 --> 00:19:01,489
we

253
00:19:01,489 --> 00:19:05,070
always recommend not to implement
college

254
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:09,200
and and too many things in a wrong way

255
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,029
which is generally court rule of thumb

256
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:20,029
in SAP environments never two things on
your own which are already implemented

257
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,880
the configuration can be done by
so-called

258
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,350
profile government has failed to change
the configuration

259
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:36,460
where you

260
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:40,390
which French name

261
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:43,760
range number

262
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:50,720
know the right transaction

263
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:57,720
which communication

264
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:09,150
nice thing here the indication
sponsorship

265
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,710
plexus his that contains certain

266
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:18,080
patterns like script other

267
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,390
at thinks that we know it's not perfect
that happen

268
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:27,520
and an extent

269
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,060
okay

270
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:33,010
today i won show you some exxon how
things

271
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:37,770
wrong by focusing on the business other
pictures really

272
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:41,390
like and ice I would say that the
exposure

273
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:45,650
of yes application very high why's that
will be

274
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:51,660
here chest your help at

275
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:58,660
yes substring SF

276
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:05,330
yes

277
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:09,270
get more than

278
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:12,930
more than 80,000

279
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:17,870
and yes example and we do with

280
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:21,370
yes interest like

281
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:24,740
by hide

282
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:31,740
ok well we are here

283
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,180
so you need

284
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,860
to from take a point to understand

285
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:48,860
play

286
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,730
and

287
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,730
I want show you tweak some how

288
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:59,290
OWA and vulnerability this relate to SAP

289
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:03,200
that start from the book why I

290
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,510
not

291
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:11,570
because the

292
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:14,940
second system that it just not this and

293
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,370
ever messaged that

294
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:22,850
even if your program Astana backdrop
back writing

295
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:26,280
username and password in the error
message

296
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,110
we have seen that you can stop such
behavior

297
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:33,580
by suppressing the error message and
instead

298
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:37,120
locking it to unlock that's why

299
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:43,000
we don't serious problem session
management

300
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,370
in it in yes happy and if you don't
implement your own

301
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:52,310
session management should not tool you
have no issue

302
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:55,940
a cryptographic same

303
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:01,950
yes and I that communications also

304
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:05,400
done by means of on configuring

305
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,010
prop and URL excess

306
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:12,130
the restricted by configuring the system

307
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:15,970
tool so this has nothing to do
programming

308
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:19,380
which is really good

309
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,830
saw them many things can't go wrong

310
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:29,830
but checked

311
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,150
and

312
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:41,040
whatever you know and top 10

313
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:45,080
10 and many more things that can go
wrong

314
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,370
we have longer list

315
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:51,400
compiled a longer list and compact that
to

316
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,310
the Suns 25 but

317
00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:03,310
today we want to focus on inject you
tonight yeah

318
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:10,070
so

319
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,650
best practice for

320
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:16,860
preventing scripting I don't know

321
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:23,720
thank everybody knows stand out as

322
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,909
encoding and escaping so

323
00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:33,909
the SLP CAI implement there's a couple
of encoding

324
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,289
in a class called

325
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:40,840
which standard bystander shipped
attorney he was a dick

326
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,679
in PS page

327
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:48,500
10 simplify that by special page

328
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,210
and

329
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:55,610
also so-called

330
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:59,730
tactically that allows you with
predefined tax

331
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:04,390
no HTML page which both process revenge

332
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:07,490
protest look like

333
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:10,710
in in the cold

334
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,870
so as I mentioned earlier

335
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:18,340
yes like chase HTML pages

336
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:22,500
with some include at about Colt

337
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:27,559
top and

338
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:33,200
that value of lead

339
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,720
page this is a classic attack

340
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,740
injury something from and at a later
point in time

341
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:48,700
it's written back yet him as how the
court looks like

342
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,929
guess

343
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:58,929
name

344
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:03,640
and for and propped

345
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,880
actually where

346
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,190
went old and

347
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:17,190
don't to anything this is the first take
away message

348
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:21,070
your don't care about secure programming

349
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,910
US crude since all the known

350
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:28,320
and popular that attacks also

351
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:35,320
standard you life that

352
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,830
really that because to

353
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:42,140
to get your hands on love on ticket the
single sign-on

354
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,780
ticket with a cross-site scripting

355
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,880
and if you happen open ticket to the SS
all

356
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,800
you can access on the back in the name
of

357
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,070
want no nice thing about SAP

358
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:03,490
twist if you have session you know all
the standard transactions reports

359
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:09,690
that's no secret because they have
standardized in contrast develop

360
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:12,840
station many things go wrong few

361
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:18,650
cast

362
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:21,820
yeah and solution play next

363
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:27,770
yes yes one

364
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:31,960
and way and

365
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,820
that yep

366
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:40,890
except having strange

367
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:47,890
or put on the page that's what we want
in terms of security

368
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:54,960
so you can in quote depending on the
context

369
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,159
HTML is it

370
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,400
in child URL

371
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,630
thing and you cannot with that

372
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:10,480
another and here 55 its bond-purchase

373
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,780
very comfort in a very comfortable way
prevent

374
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:20,090
XSS attacks everything

375
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:24,700
called and and to understand what to do
with

376
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,539
use right function to the incall

377
00:28:28,539 --> 00:28:32,750
yes very high

378
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,919
error prone and

379
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:42,919
develop don't know what me

380
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:48,349
okay in other presumably more
comfortable

381
00:28:48,349 --> 00:28:53,929
paycheck that

382
00:28:53,929 --> 00:28:57,749
all parameter up

383
00:28:57,749 --> 00:29:01,429
escaped so there's nothing that you need
to talk in the cold

384
00:29:01,429 --> 00:29:06,499
but

385
00:29:06,499 --> 00:29:11,739
the problem is only fine one value per
page

386
00:29:11,739 --> 00:29:16,070
elect him get

387
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:19,499
but no your Travis

388
00:29:19,499 --> 00:29:26,499
coding that's the best thing here

389
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:31,389
yeah and this is an example

390
00:29:31,389 --> 00:29:36,149
how it works its human that

391
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:39,450
special tact life

392
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:44,129
where you can also you

393
00:29:44,129 --> 00:29:48,230
you can withstand attacks

394
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:51,690
and

395
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:55,129
him things so

396
00:29:55,129 --> 00:30:02,129
enable encoding with hermit you

397
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:10,980
so

398
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:15,000
Kb by detective you activate it

399
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,240
so mostly if you want to secure some

400
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,520
you need to security I

401
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:29,520
not enough ok

402
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:35,280
to end attacks in SLP

403
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,540
are also possible SFPs its

404
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:44,860
own sequel dialect which is quite

405
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:49,350
ok which is internally convert
statements which is a good thing

406
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:53,490
security so

407
00:30:53,490 --> 00:31:00,490
statement separate and unification
select a

408
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:16,300
from take at credit card transactions
right

409
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:23,900
in the past and

410
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:29,690
in the quote effect

411
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:36,690
watch trace you're sick the

412
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,340
variables nothing can go wrong

413
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,950
and

414
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:48,860
I would fight at to pick two

415
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:54,770
always true statement to the con but

416
00:31:54,770 --> 00:32:01,770
ass piece of the daytime nothing would
happen

417
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,750
that thing yes namic

418
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,769
see the difference here

419
00:32:10,769 --> 00:32:17,769
that pandemic

420
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,649
computer that see

421
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:26,750
that way can find that out

422
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:30,269
if you Provo a that input

423
00:32:30,269 --> 00:32:37,269
which here by I can accept

424
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:45,100
saw

425
00:32:46,899 --> 00:32:53,750
attack I know no I can detect same
application

426
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:58,960
all credit card data

427
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:04,419
however I implemented that of

428
00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:08,220
like and means month

429
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,820
kind in SF database yet

430
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,740
and if you at some like

431
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:18,919
me on a date where signed

432
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:21,990
something you get I'd

433
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:25,990
because and you see that

434
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:29,779
in dynamic sequel in

435
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:36,779
at with the reptiles

436
00:33:39,619 --> 00:33:41,389
yeah

437
00:33:41,389 --> 00:33:45,589
easily no encoding

438
00:33:45,589 --> 00:33:48,669
you can in check

439
00:33:48,669 --> 00:33:53,479
the people statement so that's a very
simple answer

440
00:33:53,479 --> 00:33:56,879
yet not Habsi will inject

441
00:33:56,879 --> 00:34:02,749
text don't use an Amex that's a very

442
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:06,309
very sad for for

443
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:09,639
develop want a ride

444
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:12,730
very smart coach which is pandemic and
generic

445
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:16,289
and you can't do that to

446
00:34:16,289 --> 00:34:19,619
you're right shin Eric nice cold

447
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:24,970
usually so

448
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:28,010
what we covered in this short

449
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:33,700
injection which by the way

450
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:39,089
don't only depend on the price and also
have for example a sequel injection

451
00:34:39,089 --> 00:34:42,250
sup we we have two

452
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:45,289
required that because sometimes didn't
believe it

453
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:48,460
sector can have I correct which

454
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:51,849
and signal injection sup we I'm

455
00:34:51,849 --> 00:34:55,760
this is possible if you want to see it
trust

456
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,329
come to the table and I if you're shot
them all

457
00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:02,809
yet take away

458
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:07,539
a

459
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:10,819
you have very nice the front and
technologies

460
00:35:10,819 --> 00:35:14,859
in SAP we had not much time to talk
about

461
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:18,589
all of them did not have much time on

462
00:35:18,589 --> 00:35:22,839
yep but I hope

463
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:25,920
if the impression that SFP programming

464
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,180
also very important security topic and
even if you have done

465
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:35,829
everything right enjoy infrastructure
firewall detection systems

466
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:39,059
a and have and everything proof

467
00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:43,520
the efficacious still and a half defects

468
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,329
and since much custom code is written in
SF

469
00:35:47,329 --> 00:35:51,270
project you usually don't know

470
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:56,350
very scary

471
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:59,470
but

472
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:00,930
so

473
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:07,470
need to understand how next step

474
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:14,470
SS understand what to do and what not

475
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:38,390
i close X

476
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:06,750
are these Co
