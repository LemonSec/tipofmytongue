1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:04,110
everyone in this room has heard the term
Federation in

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,549
in some shape of all and

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:12,490
I think I could the last three years so
I I spend a lot of time

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,960
implementing Federation whatever that
means become 20

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,670
much better definition may be a later um

6
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,609
in various areas like him small
companies

7
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,330
enterprise the thumb of enterprise

8
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,699
companies that want to sell a software
to

9
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:34,160
the consumer space things like that fell
by the greatest

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,100
the idea of that talk if arm to give you
like a an overview of what is going on

11
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,040
in this area

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,510
what is interesting for the consumer
space was interesting for the enterprise

13
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:44,940
space

14
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,170
and she tell you what a

15
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,730
the technologies that seemed to win in
these areas

16
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,539
which are like the the best bet if you
want to start implementing something

17
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:55,949
like this

18
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:00,520
and some security concerns I'm

19
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,460
just came across them while looking at
these protocols and just something to

20
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,210
keep in mind

21
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:10,360
when when thinking about such
technologies so within a set time

22
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,210
I'm a former and beer employees well I
mostly focused on breaking stuff

23
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,920
then I changed yes and now I'm focusing
on fixing stuff are

24
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,000
even even better building stuff that if

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,650
kind of same from the start um

26
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,200
I work for a small company causing tech
job I'm doing I

27
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,850
security a consulting for in the
application space by another

28
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,990
network I i'm gonna network al-anon

29
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,820
operating system guy I'm a an
application got I the last seven

30
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,409
that's where I if most of the time I

31
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:47,790
a set up the whole identity management
thing justice password

32
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,560
is what keeps me a arm on the run I'm
the last year

33
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:57,100
and just to you know Priya preempted II
mostly a Windows guy and with it but

34
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,070
that guy so

35
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,180
I'm not as cool you know

36
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:06,119
the unique I the most important part
here is really

37
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:09,610
that's my email address if you have any
questions regarding whatever

38
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,170
arm topic that is somehow related to his
talk at least

39
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,500
I write an email and that's my blog well

40
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,610
a lot of the stuff if also replicated

41
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,459
some fall called the medically I want to
start with

42
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:26,810
what is that for the rated entity thing
why would I care about it

43
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,860
how does it work I have a little
comparison between

44
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,040
typically use the chess and what I think
of security considerations to keep in

45
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,390
mind

46
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,560
so what is identity well

47
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,330
I guess but there are so many did
definitions about that I think the

48
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,090
mostaert

49
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:47,060
interesting one is what you say about
yourself of thing about you you sign up

50
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,340
for debate Google whatever

51
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,980
that's basically your identity or sign
up your name your email address in

52
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,489
that's not verify item you may not even
be a person

53
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:59,739
a real person to other end of the cable
yeah for that that if the something what

54
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:00,950
you say but you fell for

55
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:05,730
identify what %uh say about yourself
it's usually more trust that I am

56
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,870
and technically speaking when you off
indicates to an application or network

57
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,980
identity means that you can prove you
are valid

58
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:18,040
them directory entry okay so if you can
authenticate against a beta

59
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,800
your you just saw then you have an
identity in that system

60
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,890
what is federated entertain

61
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,920
well typically just the

62
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,450
the idea of taking your establish
identity that you

63
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,180
established with your home realm somehow
whatever that is like

64
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,090
your domain aw on like even your local
in the car maybe

65
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,269
I'm and be being able to take that to
another security domain

66
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:48,840
and with security domain I don't mean a
silly ADD or something like this: just

67
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,099
another you know compartment with
security information leftwich's

68
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:57,019
separated from the the compartment where
you come from

69
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:00,330
okay and

70
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:03,799
quite typically especially in the
enterprise scenarios

71
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:07,390
desis to all the Donnan single sign-on
style meaning

72
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,439
for example you log on in the morning to
your domain

73
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:13,890
and being able to access applications
that live outside of the network but not

74
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:14,530
being of

75
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:19,750
again for your password okay but that is
basically what we're talking about

76
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,460
method used arm mickey you cannot

77
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:30,139
identify two spaces that interested in
these kind of protocols I think the most

78
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:32,030
important one for for us at least

79
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:37,479
is the enterprise space forget there is
some you all have an application and you

80
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:38,020
want

81
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,199
that application to be accessible by
external people

82
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,050
like your custom us like um like your
arm

83
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:49,080
business popping off I think that the
canonical exam is always supply chain

84
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,310
management for example things like that

85
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,680
um and you want them to be able to talk
to your application but you don't want

86
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,880
to maintain their accounts

87
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,820
their accounts should be maintained from
where they come from and not at your

88
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,720
place

89
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,789
okay you don't really care about that
has spurred

90
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:08,570
arm and you don't want to maintain his
pass for TWO

91
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:11,979
Jeter direction is basically I'm you
having

92
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,020
outs of externalized applications and
with

93
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,310
with the whole you know clout a
discussion I'm

94
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:23,430
you you know you could fire up your
application that Ms on aw

95
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:29,070
and Asha all you you use an external
application out other like 500 youthful

96
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,060
offender status

97
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,520
I'm do you want that your employees have
to reoffend decade every time day at

98
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,910
Hawkins application

99
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,400
probably not okay again death doesn't
interest

100
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,770
that them in the enterprise area you
have your domain logon and you can take

101
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:44,770
this long gone

102
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,570
to look into them arbitrary application
living somewhere

103
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:52,430
outside of your own domain

104
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:56,139
are better for our of even even more
interesting aw

105
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:59,410
well or a side effect of that if some

106
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,800
that companies large a company's stock
to you

107
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,030
Federation technologies to federate
internally I am for example

108
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,030
when they like like bought and the
company

109
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,440
and you know in in the best case

110
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,539
they have to same technology running
like Aten Aten

111
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:20,470
so if the admins are brave enough taken
to a cross you know cross trust the

112
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:24,199
forest whatever thing call these days um

113
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:29,150
I of justice company may use a totally
different technology like for example

114
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:34,000
one on one of the guys use a you know i
dnt believe the other guys is 80% of

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,569
novel accident or whatever

116
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:39,770
and then you confidently connect these
two networks to get a

117
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,150
from and that's why we need protocols
which

118
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,690
are you know um vendor independent

119
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:50,530
which %uh standardized and can be used
to connect the things to get out without

120
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,539
you know

121
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:54,949
that the SIR directory services which
are typically you know

122
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:58,400
kind of legacy already and you can
change to easily I'm

123
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,440
which they cut okay but as one pot
disturbed at the pod I will focus on

124
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,960
because I think it's the more relevant
part:

125
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,860
um especially for the audience but also
in general

126
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,539
and that the consumer space and is kinda
easy

127
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:17,370
to explain you move around the internet

128
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,400
there are note the furu thing and maybe
a

129
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,150
you think like why do I have to log on

130
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:28,360
every time again and again and again and
why do I have to fill out

131
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,630
every time these forms again and again
and again to register

132
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,780
at least technically speaking it could
be easy a

133
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:40,389
I am my my observation is that typically
did a small used for less hot thai with

134
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:42,539
applications and not for real

135
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:46,220
no real applications which them way can
earn money with

136
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:51,650
so I'm I think one of the biggest youth
casesa

137
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:55,849
I'm for these kinda things like when you
leave a comment on your blog

138
00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:59,430
I'm so they can show your full name next
to the common without having you to type

139
00:07:59,430 --> 00:07:59,979
it in

140
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,110
things like that on Twitter I is another
driver

141
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,280
in that area but yeah I will talk about
that more

142
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,410
second of and any other interesting
space here is

143
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:12,930
somewhere in between its menu up
building software and you wanna sell

144
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,590
that software to other people

145
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:18,360
and we have to the traditional model
where you sell your software and

146
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,289
it is installed on-premise India on
death of oil

147
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:27,020
and it becomes part of you know d active
directory for example

148
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,629
that is one noted that the predominant
model maybe

149
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:35,260
um all you want to adjust software plus
services of software-as-a-service

150
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,089
type Architektur where you have thought
the running online and you want to be

151
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:39,769
able to

152
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:43,130
sell the two companies and they should
just be able to connect to date

153
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,480
reused yeah identity to have in in the
corporate

154
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,399
and then the big problem you happiest
when you work indisposition

155
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:55,700
to you and now have two support eighty
and Novell and IBM

156
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,300
native Lee or do you want to have some
protocol which sits on top of that and

157
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,550
can do these things

158
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:04,930
in a you know vendor agnostic way so if
you depend

159
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:08,779
to whom you want to tell yourself that
you but I'm as I said

160
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:13,130
as a nicely you typically have to adopt
be a custom us and it would be nice to

161
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:18,100
if they would be one way of doing that
and not you know 15

162
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,570
okay for this brings us to

163
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,959
the term federated authentication for
the idea was really

164
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,959
I'm how can I make cross security domain

165
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,260
of indication happen and if you lol you
know

166
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,970
were interested in authentication
protocols that's a a tough chop

167
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,269
of indication because itself when you
have some sort of context you live in

168
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:45,709
already tough to implement and to the
sign but

169
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:49,519
crossing domains and again never ever
think of

170
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,990
eighty when I say domains it just
basically you know different

171
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:57,700
environment 3d then even hotter

172
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:02,570
okay and have cost we don't want that by
replicating accounts

173
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:06,320
right I mean that's that brings us back
to we are at the moment really

174
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,089
where you know your phone up an admin
for hey can you create an account for

175
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:16,160
bop out and then Bob obviously if the
company at some place and nobody tells

176
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,800
the admin to

177
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,870
to remove the account things like that
you have to count you have all these

178
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,760
password

179
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,399
synchronization problems especially when
you can you can control both ends of the

180
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,290
wire

181
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:29,579
and 2 1/2 also we don't want to
replicate account we want to be able to

182
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:34,649
move my account my existing account to
another domain

183
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:37,839
and if easy as possible

184
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,970
notice these protocols which I talk
about the second half

185
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,890
varying decrease of from a feature

186
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,540
okay so I'm for example sometimes

187
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,560
um the only thing that what the thing
that would be enough

188
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,260
I'm is that after the authentication
step

189
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,839
at the end you have something like a
stable identify of the use of the when

190
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,890
he was a comes back to application

191
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:06,029
she has the same idea and you can use
that I D to hang of

192
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:09,399
you know personalisation information and
and business information

193
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:13,010
to I am a little bit more tricky if

194
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:17,040
well I mean we've a statement coped
identify and meaning

195
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,810
for let's say for example to pick
applications federate like a or

196
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:24,230
use the same Federation provide Alexey
Bay and ms on

197
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:28,329
and you do you what you don't want is
dead email you have to fame

198
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:32,839
identify Essen Amazon right because that
can be used to correlate information

199
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:35,260
between you and and your account

200
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:39,079
for example let you be an am/fm join
that at some time or all day

201
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:42,399
secretly checks to exchange information
so the idea if you're

202
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,959
to have I'm that that you forget and
identify at

203
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:50,540
that if stable all with the same but
goal to the application he's talking to

204
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,639
so he will it have have a different idea
D-day

205
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:56,829
and in addition whatever them but all
with the same for these applications

206
00:11:56,829 --> 00:12:00,720
that is one of the the things 54 cause
wanna do

207
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,029
in the enterprise space I'm we typically
go one step further and say okay

208
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:08,320
we don't want or we don't not only want

209
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,810
an idea we want to know who the guy is
in what department he's working what is

210
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,310
telephone number what is even address
the

211
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:19,790
I the costs and the think they are and
we don't want

212
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:23,420
to of some thought of directory

213
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,440
service about information but that
should be like

214
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,089
the outcome of the of indications step
if you can that this information is

215
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:31,019
available

216
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:35,829
in the application itself and there are
a buncha for a Cause out there

217
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:39,920
which have exactly that purpose of
establishing that kind of indication

218
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,000
relationship

219
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,940
and there are again I i try to subdivide
that into into the context where they

220
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,149
are mainly used

221
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:51,279
okay which doesn't mean that there are
maybe some thought of you know

222
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,769
blurry lines in between sometimes but
mainly a

223
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:58,060
in the enterprise space we are talking
about um

224
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:02,889
the WS da that Emily a protocol like
that Federation W trust

225
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:06,839
ws-security internet service world and

226
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:10,360
afsane called the family token

227
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,709
and defend the token is basically I am
away how the trench cost

228
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:18,170
information I talked about earlier that
also think all the family protocol

229
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,399
I'm and out so in in a second what's the

230
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:26,329
distinction between these two I'm in the
consumer space death

231
00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:31,040
one big drive and I guess everybody
knows that it's ok my dear

232
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,829
so open even authentication system um

233
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:38,579
and a quite simple want to be honest

234
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:42,730
um and on top of that they have support
for

235
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:46,410
of the protecting resources using a.m.
00 idea

236
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:50,680
you look in awe authorization data for
out of the of indications that

237
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:56,089
and that if because 00 of which is the
station mainly driven by Google

238
00:13:56,089 --> 00:13:59,430
and Rep which is like a simplification
of view of protocol

239
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:03,680
and again more about that later for the
whole idea

240
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,779
how federated authentication works is
typically

241
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,690
that they use up all the first offender
case authority

242
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:14,500
festival or I'm the

243
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,760
the application above want to talk to
have to establish some form of trust

244
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,350
with a thing called a security token
service for yet there with them that

245
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,209
ball

246
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:26,560
I'm authenticate with a security token
service

247
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,970
and he could authenticate using for
example Integrated Windows

248
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:32,500
authentication or client certificate or
his past but whatever

249
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,529
something that makes sense in his side
of the world

250
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:38,720
yeah and then he in return gets

251
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,660
thing called a token okay and DEF token

252
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,550
is typically a um signed

253
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:50,589
and then he can fend if token onto the
application and

254
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:54,079
because of difficult study application
can find out

255
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,649
if you trust the token okay so just
putting that into

256
00:14:57,649 --> 00:15:01,130
more perspective that could be i like
you home

257
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:05,610
network and that could be a business
partner you at man establish trust with

258
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,649
this talk is over

259
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:09,699
and it is typically done by just
exchanging extra excitement

260
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:14,630
difficult and then I could get a token
from the tone from the token service

261
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,839
youth that token to authenticate the
application the application

262
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,019
verifies the signature put out
information that inside of it

263
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:26,260
and then I am locked on okay of cough
that fear 0 is always and

264
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,829
audit despotic what kind really help if
that step hero is that you have to

265
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:31,290
establish trust you

266
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:36,310
now and that has to be done on paper and
not you know in bits and bytes

267
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,639
I am

268
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:43,290
from my task know how is that different
280 well it is not

269
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,660
very much different 280 also in eighty
you have a thing called

270
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:51,600
think you told service you know what
that is calling they devote

271
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,240
the domain controller okay I

272
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,440
and you feel you can other establish
trust in eighty well

273
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,490
but that that that that the fundamental
differences that in eighty world

274
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,509
you establish trust between networks
there is he a

275
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:08,990
you typically step is trust on an
application basis okay

276
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:13,440
so you don't have to know much or to
across forest trust whatever

277
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,459
it is totally sufficient and independent
of

278
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:20,329
eighty law or Tivoli whatever to
establish trust

279
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:26,329
that that this application trust talking
to come from just talking

280
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:29,350
okay let's look at um

281
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:34,570
the enterprise space in more detail and
to see how difficult work

282
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,630
and Cody don't work sometimes so

283
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:42,170
affect day in the press if there are two
really big players here

284
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:45,480
and one is called the family 20 protocol
family

285
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,870
and did basically I'm

286
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,160
dinner for that coming in from the early
days from

287
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,170
I'll Liberty Alliance for example where
they had to say that they did a

288
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,180
specified

289
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,839
I'm an XML format how they could
represent

290
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,250
identity or a user okay and I'll show
you in a second how this thing looks

291
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:04,900
like

292
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,390
am and taking up a we think all of them
a token type

293
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,959
and around that time a token type to
build a bunch of protocols which up

294
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,000
mostly in based on HTP in XML

295
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,380
and have various local profiles

296
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,360
I'm which makes them on 15 growth a
friendly on on the other side

297
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,400
friend before like things like so arrest

298
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,120
and if you can see a these other big
play FPS on our as a an IBM and as you

299
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,710
can

300
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:35,610
maybe match in did more like to sing in
the job of

301
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:39,940
okay because fine if the big driver and
in that area

302
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:44,049
and then there are other W starr I'm
protocols and their friends

303
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:48,340
and and history buy microsoft idea and
every sin and as you can imagine in this

304
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,280
case did have more like the dotnet way
of doing things

305
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,320
monthly if you have to you know arm
maker

306
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,299
a black wife division here re have if I
IBM

307
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:02,929
day day day just wait I guess the which
which then that wins and and I'm

308
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:06,280
on the right one and again

309
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,419
needed to get the idea the idea is
simple: you have because one

310
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:13,610
if I'm for medications which makes them
prone to friendly

311
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:16,679
and one family if format services which
makes them

312
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:20,620
soap friendly and the difference between
the two really if

313
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:25,860
that these guys don't mandate a special
token type to just say

314
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:30,809
you can use whatever talking you want
but typically also to them a token type

315
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:33,940
okay both decks

316
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,780
rely on a bunch of other stuff like HDPE
lol

317
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,280
XML encryption signature the info said

318
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,360
if anything okay

319
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,380
is how a token FM a token looks like
okay you can feed as a

320
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,400
a so-called several assertion it live in
a certain namespace here

321
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,880
and then you can basically put and
arbitrary number of key/value pair of

322
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,720
um in that token that describes the use
of so I use idea

323
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,720
I have a name I i've a department that
would have been email address and so on

324
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,590
and he thought the things that fall out
or that you get in return when you

325
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,770
authenticate with the security token
service

326
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:16,390
okay for you authenticate you think for
example

327
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:19,539
arm cover of to the token service

328
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:23,360
the token service goes to a defect with
all these values and package them back

329
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:23,990
in Fenton

330
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:27,270
XML toca okay and

331
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:31,610
as you can see he s signature that make
sure that a

332
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:34,760
the token competent but with on the
Transitway

333
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,120
and be that the receiving end know if

334
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,780
who issued just token okay and it is

335
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,860
when you have a look at cover of that
it's very very thing that will help

336
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,110
cover us works

337
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,620
the only aw the two important
distinction here %ah

338
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,620
the cover of poker format is fixed so
the only thing you can put in to cover

339
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,910
of tokens are basically

340
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:58,070
the user is idea and a list of the main
crew

341
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:02,299
think that the vast number of here you
can put arbitrary stuff into the token

342
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:06,280
which makes it much more flexible the
second thing is the cover of typically

343
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,030
relies on two metric East this guy to be
said

344
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:12,860
relies on on certificate based
encryption but that

345
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:17,330
from the idea they are very very similar
I am used to call it cover of using and

346
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,870
the brackets

347
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:23,890
okay so that give you a quick rundown

348
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:30,400
how effing looks like so this is called
the WS Federation PEF profile and

349
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,409
passive I means that typically

350
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:37,330
data a passive client and more and that
is a cat a browser

351
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:40,730
why is this guy passive well because he
doesn't have that much logic

352
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:44,900
on its own I am but thing that works
with brother is sending sending him

353
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,120
around in the world by by by using them

354
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,409
HTTP redirect so your dearest the user
tries to lock onto an app

355
00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:56,980
which by the way in in diff part of the
world is called relying party

356
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,450
okay the Family Guy college service
provider

357
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:04,110
it's basically an application so they

358
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:07,350
11 a law get to the application

359
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,510
deprecated okay you are not
authenticated yet I V

360
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,980
redirect you to a token service okay

361
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,470
so they do a redirect here to login page
for example

362
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:22,159
and in dictionary string they send sense
as and Ubuntu information

363
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,169
that is down important aw relevant

364
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:28,330
I'm football they say hate this is a
fine in message

365
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,679
could be other find out messages if you
want to federate find out

366
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,470
another part of the story really and
they say and

367
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:41,549
by the way I am this application here so
that that a symbolic name called a realm

368
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:44,980
and this realm is basically used by the
token service to look up

369
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,770
in this database they okay a its
application is register

370
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:52,070
I notification I I know what type of

371
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:56,390
token information they need and what
they also typically do with

372
00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:00,039
they can associate a public here with
this round

373
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:03,890
that the youth to encrypt the token
sending back to the application for just

374
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,210
you know

375
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:09,700
that only disguised can the crypt the
token so basically now

376
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,669
of indication is happening here that
another quite important point for

377
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:14,400
takeaway

378
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,220
the application itself doesn't have any
authentication code anymore

379
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,720
okay all the of indications happening
now on this guy

380
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,260
which you know potentially you have a
lot of them

381
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,450
streamlines the whole

382
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:32,659
problem of you know having
security-related cold floating around

383
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:34,210
the internet were quite a bit

384
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:39,090
because you can concentrate and isolate
the dangerous stuff

385
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:42,630
on the server okay the big now

386
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:45,630
of indication if exceeded and what
happens if basically

387
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,990
def seven-year postback a form

388
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:52,429
and into in fed up of that formed as a
and input name

389
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:57,020
that w without and the federal effort
not just showed you is the form value

390
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:00,299
of post okay and then

391
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:03,590
given your browser supports JavaScript
they do it automatically for you what

392
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,440
about that but nothing like postback

393
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,809
but ok okay

394
00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:13,940
make sense of fun okay

395
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:18,780
quote and then last the best if effing
flows back to the application

396
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,240
then you have some form of them a Web
Toolkit sitting there

397
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,470
which extracts the token from the farm
verifies the signature

398
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,500
are make sure Dassin existing trust
relationship

399
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,860
with that server and then times that
testing into some you know

400
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,450
technology-specific rip a representation
of

401
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:39,230
identity which in the butt network
before somebody I principal interface

402
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:44,450
but it's just implementation

403
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:51,210
coat um the pic you showed up

404
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:54,929
I have written I'm a token service that
you can download

405
00:23:54,929 --> 00:23:58,190
if you're interested on which outlines

406
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:01,980
you know them necessary steps in Cote

407
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,320
the necessary so it basically what I'm
doing here is I'm triggering the

408
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,490
redirect to them

409
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:09,990
to the token service just might we r

410
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:14,140
furtive as he conceded a different URL

411
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:20,140
even sitting on the internet here and
then all the of indication logic is now

412
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:24,360
behind that that metformin okay so and
as you can see it

413
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,789
def guy implement on password and client
certificates

414
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:32,940
and the epic a test doesn't have to now
they don't care really

415
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:39,870
and then I can say okay that his client
certificates

416
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:43,299
and now I'm back on my local machine
here I know that that's the

417
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:47,580
also the on line 1 and basically what
what has happened is that

418
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,890
the application is open to them a token
verify the signature and pulled out all

419
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,659
the information you need to talk to us
have put in death

420
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:57,210
and I i just showed up on the screen for
the Deaf the idea

421
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:00,830
okay it's all based on redirect and

422
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:04,870
that's how it works

423
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:09,220
now

424
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,230
there are some things to keep in mind
here okay so

425
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:16,180
technically it is all good and fine of
Kos

426
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:19,580
the whole thing has to happen over SSL
I'm pretty sure

427
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,650
I don't have to specifically mention
that to I am

428
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:26,320
but cause a you are sending around
information and

429
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,330
death one special thing here in the
browser world

430
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:33,400
is that the browser is not very if not
capable

431
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,440
of doing some thought of heavy crypto
which basically means

432
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,510
the the seventh and defective XML token

433
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:43,760
which maybe encrypt it or not but
whoever

434
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,320
has teeth token eat up because he's

435
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,150
like to legitimate use all because he's
eavesdropping on because he has a Trojan

436
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,430
running on your client whoever has this
token can authenticate right

437
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:58,120
if I own this token I can authenticate
so

438
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,910
trend for protection becomes an issue
here hopefully a

439
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:05,420
it is always yeah but his he it's
definitely an issue

440
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:09,980
and also the application should
implement their own replay attack

441
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:14,050
meaning every token has a lifetime and
an idea

442
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:17,180
which is a great and what the
application should

443
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:20,770
implement and what to get wickets to if
de um

444
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:24,700
look at the lifetime and cash to you
without it the token ID for a lifetime

445
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,370
of the token

446
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:28,980
and then if the token church should
arrive twice edification

447
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,560
it is rejected okay this is something
you have to do if you would like to

448
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,470
implement it yourself

449
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:37,990
now important point really and of cause
and effect if

450
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:41,500
should if much really go away satellite
it doesn't really make sense

451
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:46,580
okay India

452
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:50,290
that fell this world things a little bit
different I'm we have much more

453
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,680
intelligent clients

454
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,140
at least from you know Tati perspective
um

455
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,980
and yet it did he was pretty simple but
this time we are not

456
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,660
trying to talk to a web service and this
guy sent us back but

457
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:05,880
typically the claim no up front where
he's talking service

458
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,400
so he talks about the to talk the talk
in service defusing the WF trust

459
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,820
specification which specifies

460
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:16,030
did the data exchange here between these
two guys and he sensed something 'cause

461
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:19,830
the request security token package and
again

462
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:24,500
death like I am and identify of the
application to token is faulk

463
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,930
now and because we have much more
possibilities he began or the Fe

464
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:31,110
and by the way that's def a typical of
tea application

465
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:34,160
and this weighty am toe conservative

466
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,980
also authenticate the identity a after
of the receiving end

467
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:42,010
and then pullout this privately start
public enum

468
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:46,570
to encrypt the token and what comes back
from this request your

469
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:50,200
if again and an XML SOAP package

470
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,480
and if time the family first embedded
into felt

471
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,440
response for fame idea just different
you know protocols on the cover of

472
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,770
and then the client for what's the token

473
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:03,830
using them the folks a cutie had a okay

474
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:07,550
fame I DM I am and dis

475
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:10,930
may look terribly complex but

476
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:14,740
once it's set up it's quite simple arm

477
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:18,590
not too hot how many people are writing
code in this room but I think even if

478
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,220
you're not

479
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,520
just kind of simple code you'll create a
proxy to your

480
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,550
to your arm ok service then I said
credentials and these are not the

481
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,720
credentials for my third base these
other

482
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,750
the credential from a token service
right because this guy

483
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:36,630
um a is in charge of of indication

484
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:41,760
when I open the proxy and I make a call
and that fit baby I'm just returning to

485
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,020
the claims or the information in the
token back to the console

486
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,990
arm to prove that we really made a round
trip

487
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:52,340
from declined to talking to me and back
to

488
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:56,690
this up because my ass was sleeping

489
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:03,340
this may take a minute up in a minute
but and eat eat eat it did either

490
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,880
the same people up information that just
in the browser

491
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:13,880
now India into into soap world really

492
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:18,660
and here because

493
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,070
the client if more capable and have more
AP I've

494
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:27,320
we can make things much more secure so
this is very very similar to how cover

495
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:27,650
of

496
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:31,230
service tickets work so the idea is
really when you

497
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:35,400
request the token first of all that w
trust mandates that you encrypt the

498
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,280
token there's no way around it otherwise

499
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,530
you would have to him quiet manually

500
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:44,770
turned on all kinds of or of security
controls data

501
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:48,060
into gonna call sup basically what they
do with

502
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:51,740
arm you are making that request

503
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:54,930
and you give to sever I one-half of a
key

504
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:58,430
okay that is called client Entropia

505
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:02,090
Anders the service out the token service

506
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:05,390
text generates I'm get a half of that
key and

507
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:08,640
that key together if you have time to

508
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,960
to generate a session key in and
efficient he will be embedded

509
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,680
into family token okay December talk

510
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:23,100
encrypt it for their for the recipient
of the token you get the same copy of

511
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,770
that session key in your response
message so big now you have to session

512
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:27,120
key

513
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,060
and the same session keys in the ticket
and for those who look at cover of that

514
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,340
it is very similar

515
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:36,700
now you with that session key to assign
the message which goes to

516
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:41,700
am to the application which basically
means if you can find the message using

517
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,640
a session key which

518
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,880
which is part of that encrypt the
package and then you can prove that you

519
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,790
will do you repair request of the token
in the first place

520
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:53,160
okay that is called profession and
disarm

521
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,850
there are legal situations where you
have to do with

522
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:00,070
such things I have a custom over they
did it with them

523
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:03,660
make software for lawyer for example and
a need

524
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:07,390
proof of profession of tokens when they
make the transition between the

525
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:10,990
lawyer company and for example the data
center

526
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:15,420
okay so if if technically much more the
QR

527
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:20,580
I'm bout as we know like that service
and that application to like 80 20

528
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,010
percent I think of the use case these
days but

529
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:27,070
you know just have to be aware that this
gives you better security by default

530
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:27,420
Paris

531
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:31,070
riff that application we have to think
of Bharat tokens which basically means

532
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,930
you have to talk and you can
authenticate

533
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:37,080
and to join the only thing you can do
there is really to head to keep talking

534
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,070
lifetime shot

535
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:41,520
and make sure that you using a fully
protected and two and transport

536
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:46,990
between all the parties okay

537
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:50,600
now what are the common scenario

538
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,970
for these technologies as I said I'm
behaving like

539
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:58,610
your company here with your employees
and you having partner of

540
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:02,790
customers and so on and when you wanna
make cross

541
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:06,770
domain federation work what is typically
done if

542
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:10,860
that you have a token service often
called like

543
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:15,290
identity provider because it is the guy
that establish the identity in

544
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:18,340
the form of all of us after some token
and

545
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,380
the company you're talking to have a
Federation gateway

546
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:25,150
and these two guys have a trust
relationship with each other and trust

547
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:25,850
in this case

548
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:30,720
technically again means that she can
validate a signature of the token coming

549
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,020
in

550
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,330
in the system so when when bach

551
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:38,030
I'm pretty sure its popular unit he has
no name yet I'm

552
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:41,060
want to talk to the application he first
them

553
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:44,600
authenticate with this local identified
a

554
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,850
token service gets back a token this
token defined by him

555
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:52,560
and encrypt it for the Gateway okay

556
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,750
and then he for what the token to the
Gateway

557
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:59,430
because they have a trust relationship P
they take they can now

558
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:02,830
at check your signature and he gets back
in Utah ok im

559
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:06,490
from the Gateway which if signed by him

560
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:10,430
and encryptor for him okay

561
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:13,730
and now in the last step taken for what
the token

562
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:17,880
to the application and because these two
guys have a trust relationship now

563
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,310
he can logon without having to maintain

564
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:25,130
any thought of you with our account of
this guy on that side of the world

565
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:29,400
okay and is basically how is really

566
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:34,250
done by a lot of companies if the if
what's the good thing here

567
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:38,240
well if bop leaf the company what

568
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,110
what happened in the old but all but up
to what should happen or what did not

569
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:44,200
happen in the old world a federation

570
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,700
nobody ever called got a

571
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,980
Bob left the company of public the
building at I'm

572
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:56,370
so you might end up with that the county
a if in different area pop

573
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:59,760
leaf the building it is much much how
did the

574
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,090
the potential is much much higher that
they delete bach

575
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:07,080
on their side of the world like dade
disable the eighty econ for example

576
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,110
if Bacha Khan authenticate with this guy

577
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:13,850
he can get a token for any kind of a of
indicate here and conquer come get it

578
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:15,580
open and kinda indicate here

579
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:18,590
okay so it's almost automatic like to
hold trust chain

580
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,940
I get stopped automatically just by
disabling

581
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:25,570
Bob account in his own domain okay

582
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:28,670
and just basically a set and a very
common scenario

583
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:31,810
just a

584
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:35,870
okay

585
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:36,960
coat

586
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,879
and now way out this application
physically lifts

587
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:44,019
is almost like you know doesn't matter
anymore it could be on premise of this

588
00:34:44,019 --> 00:34:45,079
application app

589
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:48,619
of dis company here it could be in the
cloud could be wherever

590
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:53,529
as long if this application can validate
and X 59 signature

591
00:34:53,529 --> 00:34:56,970
it's good to go okay

592
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:59,970
and it is much much more lightweight

593
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:04,099
then establishing trust at the 80 level
here okay

594
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:08,329
one

595
00:35:08,329 --> 00:35:11,910
typical issue you runnin

596
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:15,269
when you establish such an I and
architecture

597
00:35:15,269 --> 00:35:19,039
is basically I am for let's say I'm you
are

598
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:23,250
this company here okay and you have
trust relationship with this guys but

599
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,869
you ought to have more trust alleged

600
00:35:24,869 --> 00:35:27,890
with other you know partner and so on
for now

601
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:31,710
when a when here comes to your

602
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:37,180
lot inside hiya how today know where you
are I'm came from in the first place

603
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:42,269
okay so discard home ground discovery
and that's just something

604
00:35:42,269 --> 00:35:45,819
you have to think about so for some but
if you look into that the Microsoft

605
00:35:45,819 --> 00:35:46,549
Partner

606
00:35:46,549 --> 00:35:49,890
from website they say okay you can log
in

607
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:53,269
but you have to tell me are you and
apart now

608
00:35:53,269 --> 00:35:56,450
with an external account are you a
Microsoft employees

609
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:59,490
50m cover up log in or are you alive ID
with a

610
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,589
okay and then you have to click one of
the free links and they send you to your

611
00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:05,380
life ID to the internal

612
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:09,759
you know I'm find inside 480 ought to
put up hot enough

613
00:36:09,759 --> 00:36:14,890
fine inside I'm the problem here if that
you might

614
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:19,680
not want that your customers can see we
fool you have Federation relationships

615
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,589
right

616
00:36:20,589 --> 00:36:23,849
so that's the diff might not be that the
best way of doing it now

617
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:27,130
I'm in that case it it doesn't matter
really

618
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:31,700
I am so what you have to think about it
especially when you're feeling about

619
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:36,009
multi-tenant applications and these kind
of things is that you have some sort of

620
00:36:36,009 --> 00:36:37,160
URL define

621
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,640
where you way I'd like you give out that
URL to your partner

622
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,859
and when he tries to extra advocate you
think that URL

623
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:48,000
you note to which sign in fighter with
to redirect him here

624
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,059
okay things like that I've just been
gone

625
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:54,500
going wrong into in the past that you
have to think about

626
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,609
justified okay

627
00:36:57,609 --> 00:37:01,349
so is how it works I

628
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:05,839
hero a bunch of products that you can
use to implement this thing

629
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:11,109
um yes the the Microsoft Active
Directory Federation services 2.0

630
00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:12,039
features like

631
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:15,240
currently in its release candidate stage

632
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,660
I'm to be released next for weeks I
think

633
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:22,109
um this is basically a fing

634
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:27,569
which blocks into ates and is able to
issue token for your eighty you with us

635
00:37:27,569 --> 00:37:32,279
okay so if you're you with us have an
eighty accounts they can

636
00:37:32,279 --> 00:37:36,019
talk to this thing and get get back a
token and from that point on they can

637
00:37:36,019 --> 00:37:37,920
use the token in any shape or form

638
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,130
I just showed you okay for the disaster
Microsoft's way of protecting

639
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:47,079
they are corporate identities into that
the Federated world

640
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:51,900
okay and of course the same thing
happens on the IBM sidestepped it at

641
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,319
that he will be for the race matter

642
00:37:53,319 --> 00:37:58,509
on fame idea but the plot into whatever
they call it after the race service

643
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:02,839
now I get it started ft I'm

644
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:06,609
and a fun open sooo have cost us that
fun on talk to Todd

645
00:38:06,609 --> 00:38:11,809
to the question aren't they you stay out
for the cost acted at the 720 protocol

646
00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:12,279
stack

647
00:38:12,279 --> 00:38:17,619
on by the way and might have put a key
ADFS can translate between W estar hand

648
00:38:17,619 --> 00:38:18,079
them a

649
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,180
so that that's a good good thing too
uniform in 20

650
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:24,710
and RCA in Nevada to and there are

651
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:28,359
arm toolkits which you would you

652
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:32,539
at the applications which want to
confuse is kind of token and that

653
00:38:32,539 --> 00:38:35,839
most difficult one at least in my world
if that but not

654
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:40,519
um incarnation debt I love on data PHP
one that there are many more

655
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:46,650
really buddy that it that the free
declare any question that before I moved

656
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:47,000
to

657
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,269
consume %uh side of things with it also
meet you at the end

658
00:38:52,269 --> 00:38:55,349
if you wish okay

659
00:38:55,349 --> 00:38:59,230
so disaster area which I don't work that
much

660
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:02,569
actually but I'm I'm it still kinda
important to them

661
00:39:02,569 --> 00:39:06,309
interesting to know how it works and
that that comes con su MySpace

662
00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:10,160
and have cost is like to the the vet to

663
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,339
whatever version here on or service tag
even from

664
00:39:13,339 --> 00:39:17,470
kind of world EVA Flickr a

665
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:20,789
these things way it seems to be very
very important that you have

666
00:39:20,789 --> 00:39:23,829
only one lakh on yeah I'm

667
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:27,390
and Open ID is really like them

668
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:31,589
the most popular way of doing Federation
in dis open-world

669
00:39:31,589 --> 00:39:35,190
I it has a lot speaking in complete
community

670
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:39,410
um it is based on easy to use because
HDPE year

671
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,839
we are extremely strings these kind of
things I am

672
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:46,180
I thought a little bit of limited
especially by the sign

673
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:49,220
and usher in the second one with that um

674
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:53,569
and a all arm which is basically a an
API to

675
00:39:53,569 --> 00:39:56,609
kron except with all those eyes i sorry
I am of

676
00:39:56,609 --> 00:40:00,539
I give you a.m. and assemble in the
second make it much easier

677
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:04,150
but this is kind of what to open I D
word looks like

678
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:07,930
on typically a many companies started

679
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:10,940
being just a normal website like Google

680
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:14,130
and then they introduced like a lock on
I

681
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:17,700
and I think all the first look on with
Gmail the gmail account

682
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:21,210
okay then they had more services like

683
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:25,640
analytics and a a Google Docs into one
before of

684
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,089
and they need a way to share that
account across the product

685
00:40:29,089 --> 00:40:32,329
and have caught the Federation right
sold a youth

686
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:36,079
something which if easy to use and make
sense for them and they chose Open ID

687
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,440
if you have a Google account you already
have an opening the account

688
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,019
okay if you have one of the other guys
here you already have an open ID account

689
00:40:44,019 --> 00:40:48,789
and from the idea if they did really
everyone can be coming over ninety

690
00:40:48,789 --> 00:40:49,739
provide

691
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:53,210
okay if that really make sense I'm not
sure bot

692
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:57,099
that's the way it is okay so

693
00:40:57,099 --> 00:41:01,089
Open ID that fights if they have $1
billion active account and

694
00:41:01,089 --> 00:41:04,569
a approximately 50,000 native website

695
00:41:04,569 --> 00:41:08,220
that's what operatic I say so maybe
kinda behalf but

696
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:12,819
if that a lot now them of adoption here

697
00:41:12,819 --> 00:41:16,390
the how does this work I Open ID

698
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:20,009
well it is a little bit different and
that the mindset is different

699
00:41:20,009 --> 00:41:23,640
with from WS Federation and family and
so on

700
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:29,690
them typically AM always steps hero boss
that you somehow establish trust

701
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:33,640
okay so if you from recall my slides

702
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:37,859
I'm the first that was always that the
application trusts to provide

703
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:41,579
and and that if I commend you will out
of Penn step you do first

704
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:46,170
okay and debt and that in turn means
that the provider

705
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,220
also know about the application okay
that that that that that that the

706
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,069
tighter

707
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:53,029
one to one relationship between
providers and application and that makes

708
00:41:53,029 --> 00:41:56,190
total sense in the enterprise space
because they typically know each other

709
00:41:56,190 --> 00:42:00,230
okay with Open ID it's different by the
sign

710
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:03,569
every application can except every Open
ID from

711
00:42:03,569 --> 00:42:08,119
any Open ID provide and if you can
become your own openid: the provider you

712
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:09,480
have to ask yourself

713
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:13,430
how trust that I def Open ID

714
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:17,160
okay so the first step in

715
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:21,549
in Open ID well if not establishing
trust us to provide a

716
00:42:21,549 --> 00:42:25,029
the first seven open even if that that
that you provide something like this

717
00:42:25,029 --> 00:42:30,239
and open ideal ok on and then they did
they have come up with a name scheme

718
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:33,670
that should begin means I'm use our
account

719
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:37,619
dot Open ID provide a okay so in my case
my my youth icon

720
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:41,400
privilege and to provide as my opening a
calm okay

721
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,430
for now they have from the spec at

722
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:48,450
to describe that how'd it turn def into
a server name

723
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:51,549
okay ability day cut the first part to

724
00:42:51,549 --> 00:42:55,869
DUP DUP DUP a at HEB f/2.8 and then they
talk two diff

725
00:42:55,869 --> 00:42:59,650
other okay and the route

726
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:03,210
the route back page of that Selva must
have a special link

727
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:08,799
in his HTML head element which tells him
with the login page

728
00:43:08,799 --> 00:43:12,930
okay so many ways to into fear of that
stuff

729
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:17,190
um and ended with the human at it
diffie-hellman key exchange

730
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:20,989
to I'm have a shared key which they can
use later on

731
00:43:20,989 --> 00:43:24,219
to assign the message is going back and
forth between

732
00:43:24,219 --> 00:43:27,420
these two guys here

733
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,630
there's a fundamental difference here
too I'm with the

734
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:34,339
W Federation a um protocol types

735
00:43:34,339 --> 00:43:37,430
all the redirect but on via the browser

736
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:42,829
which means that that token service must
only be available

737
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:46,710
via of from from the browser meaning you
could happen

738
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:50,489
and Internet token service which talks
to a public website

739
00:43:50,489 --> 00:43:55,619
right hiya as you can see that the
application must be able to make an

740
00:43:55,619 --> 00:43:59,430
that direct connection to do the talking
service which means that they must be

741
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:01,009
available on the Internet

742
00:44:01,009 --> 00:44:04,680
okay again def just a fight effect of

743
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,000
how to open I D Justin what the signed
like pecan open

744
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,119
provider for potential for you know the
vet 20

745
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:15,969
community okay for now

746
00:44:15,969 --> 00:44:19,230
he no threat and login pages because

747
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:24,039
security guy and then fanned I'm a GET
request

748
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:27,589
22 this login page if you can see yes
Meyer

749
00:44:27,589 --> 00:44:31,640
my idea I am yes to

750
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:36,279
the diffie-hellman key I'll at least a
derived version of that

751
00:44:36,279 --> 00:44:39,989
that can be used to sign the request
then there are

752
00:44:39,989 --> 00:44:44,529
optional value if they wanna know about
me from that server

753
00:44:44,529 --> 00:44:48,809
and where should be returned to when we
are done with the authentication

754
00:44:48,809 --> 00:44:52,529
that's how it works okay and then when I
authenticate and

755
00:44:52,529 --> 00:44:56,630
all that stuff work then they again for
another cat request

756
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:59,989
going back to the application they
didn't know where to go to from here

757
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:03,400
and here you can basically see here
again if the I'm

758
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,089
the the age makes our 256 a key Devon on

759
00:45:07,089 --> 00:45:11,099
a interview with Tia and yep if
information about the youth of basically

760
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:11,739
think that

761
00:45:11,739 --> 00:45:15,039
work very very crested here okay

762
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:19,520
that's basically how to: my D&G

763
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,069
nope the only trust that you could do
with

764
00:45:23,069 --> 00:45:26,489
to say I'm do I trust if part of the

765
00:45:26,489 --> 00:45:30,020
name right $3.6 billion lock it down to
only

766
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:33,609
one except you know but by the sign

767
00:45:33,609 --> 00:45:36,739
this is not what ok money was meant to
be right if

768
00:45:36,739 --> 00:45:40,579
it's basically like the the plurality or
provide us

769
00:45:40,579 --> 00:45:43,839
and and consumers really map

770
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:50,420
saw I can do that too I am

771
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:53,539
baby what I've when I wanna written and
again this is maybe something

772
00:45:53,539 --> 00:45:58,719
interesting to one of get a guy is a and
Open ID 2w Federation bridge

773
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:03,190
basically what I'm doing here now is I'm
and typing in my opening the name

774
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:07,569
but at least privilege my open idea dot
com

775
00:46:07,569 --> 00:46:11,400
and now been agreed to stiff negotiation
happened under the covers and I'm

776
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,299
redirected to the open idea

777
00:46:15,299 --> 00:46:19,509
sign in page and you can see there um

778
00:46:19,509 --> 00:46:23,079
some of them like my Open ID date they
do quite a good job for example they did

779
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:24,579
allow you to associate

780
00:46:24,579 --> 00:46:28,109
client certificates with your account
for example you don't have to pass would

781
00:46:28,109 --> 00:46:28,759
have

782
00:46:28,759 --> 00:46:32,769
anymore and funny leeanne

783
00:46:32,769 --> 00:46:36,509
there used to be a a picture of Mia
where not where now says your personal I

784
00:46:36,509 --> 00:46:37,269
can

785
00:46:37,269 --> 00:46:40,219
and that was again for preventing
phishing attack so they basically when

786
00:46:40,219 --> 00:46:40,910
day

787
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:44,710
create Open ID fake and you I can is
missing

788
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:49,140
this should be a phishing attack so on
given that I met

789
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,400
in North conferenza maybe shouldn't have
been might happen I am

790
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,829
I well whatever to the Condesa

791
00:46:55,829 --> 00:47:02,829
anyways not very important arm

792
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,549
i neva trust any environment

793
00:47:09,549 --> 00:47:12,799
if I learned at some point maybe it with
you

794
00:47:12,799 --> 00:47:17,430
top okay

795
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:20,640
another whole thing goes back to my
application and here are

796
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,250
if the information that no Open ID knows
about okay

797
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:27,400
I'm death another provide a

798
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,410
arm if you don't if you're you know its

799
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:35,030
thereon that there are many provide us
in effect a

800
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:38,569
so big it another one which seems to be
quite popular these days

801
00:47:38,569 --> 00:47:42,770
is I am re-sign lips

802
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:47,040
not show up when I'm wanna make love and
often became the weather which have the

803
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:47,500
name

804
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:51,460
peta in this product African theme

805
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:55,270
but at least using X and validation
certificate

806
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:58,480
which the better version of the and
depart

807
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,990
so yeah a fat the focus is different I
have

808
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:08,010
I guess the focus is primarily a that
I'm death left friction when moving to

809
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:11,210
you know to pick him up applications
where you don't really

810
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:14,329
you know can get harmed in

811
00:48:14,329 --> 00:48:19,230
in a big way least so

812
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:23,260
last piece of information

813
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:27,250
just that you have heard of that and I'm
not going into detail if the so-called

814
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:31,670
simple delegation scenario so for
example in the states and

815
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:34,920
what is very typical in the state is
called Bella talking

816
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,609
so valet parking is basically you you
try from the restaurant and you give

817
00:48:38,609 --> 00:48:39,859
them the key to your car

818
00:48:39,859 --> 00:48:44,319
and say a have fun okay sorry you can
see the problem here right

819
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:49,109
I'm giving some other Sharia guy a key
to your car

820
00:48:49,109 --> 00:48:53,190
okay what they introduced in the state
interestingly is a valid key

821
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:58,010
for baby that's a special key way we can
only drive two kilometers with that car

822
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:01,619
and trunk is locked okay so

823
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:05,079
think of 00 of of litigation as kind of
a velit

824
00:49:05,079 --> 00:49:09,500
Villa Park in key for the Internet so
and finally if you look at that but the

825
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,599
official specification of the protocol

826
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:15,460
deak sample yes for let's say you want
to print some Flickr photos

827
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:19,970
okay and you won a gift that printing
company access to your Flickr photos did

828
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:23,240
do you want to get them to pass what do
you think your account obviously not

829
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:27,650
for benefit me how to TT original spec
start introducing the problem

830
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:31,140
okay for that pic to show with in which
area

831
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:34,530
yeah we are working for get here if this
you log on

832
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:39,220
you authenticate you get a so-called
delegation token think of this token s

833
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:40,450
your ballot talking key

834
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:44,319
okay just talking to scope to certain
with authors a que

835
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:49,299
certain Flickr pic just from and if time
bomb meaning you have one day and then

836
00:49:49,299 --> 00:49:50,309
to talk next by S

837
00:49:50,309 --> 00:49:53,809
okay you pop the token onto at a
printing company

838
00:49:53,809 --> 00:49:56,799
and to bring to come to you if the token
to access your pictures and print them

839
00:49:56,799 --> 00:49:57,750
and send them to you

840
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:02,640
okay that is to of protocol family just
in case you excited and now a new one

841
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,510
what it's about

842
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:08,160
okay but thats as much as I go into
detail so

843
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,760
just two rounded up from the consumer
side

844
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,640
Wacken Open ID be you also aware that
the part where there are

845
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:20,540
there are all kinds of things that you
can see it dotnet job of PHP Ruby

846
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:24,619
pearl Google of coffee support for it in
in in the engine

847
00:50:24,619 --> 00:50:29,329
ever said the prime rib that the primary
drive all of these things today is cool

848
00:50:29,329 --> 00:50:32,329
but they are really interested and
Facebook

849
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:35,329
ma'am saw B between 3rd

850
00:50:35,329 --> 00:50:38,660
to the last part I think we have like
five min to something that's the enough

851
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:42,059
from what other problems here

852
00:50:42,059 --> 00:50:46,339
so I think we have to

853
00:50:46,339 --> 00:50:49,410
to look at these problems from from you
know to with

854
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:53,650
one is like them the psychological
problem and one of the 10 to technical

855
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:54,339
problems here

856
00:50:54,339 --> 00:50:58,119
and I i kind of for I get more love

857
00:50:58,119 --> 00:51:01,630
data so if you no Facebook

858
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:04,950
then maybe you don't want to tell
everyone that you bought it for gas

859
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:06,420
mowers 1500

860
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:09,480
especially large employers and a family
member

861
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:12,869
part story um saw

862
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:16,700
basically a I'm I'm in the last week

863
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:20,280
preparing for his talk I i spoke to you
know normal people

864
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:24,020
yeah like normal could use of computers
I said

865
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:27,329
I do you think is open I D stuff and it
was a

866
00:51:27,329 --> 00:51:31,690
what and the other what ok mighty okay
are all white

867
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:36,660
by will you step okay and I think death
death one

868
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:40,540
problem here that these protocols
inferior %uh secure enough

869
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:45,890
body who understands the protocol okay I
mean we have so many things in Indian

870
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:46,410
youth

871
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:51,329
dis preach in debt problem and I think
typically use of typical non

872
00:51:51,329 --> 00:51:56,960
technically bust use of de rata say I'd
like to keep my own identity a

873
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,049
and a single account for every page I'm
going to and I have a a little you know

874
00:52:01,049 --> 00:52:04,349
text 5 ever my past but I N okay

875
00:52:04,349 --> 00:52:08,650
for that stay out few of the world and i
think thats totally valid

876
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:12,630
okay again it is all about trust

877
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:17,240
map um

878
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,690
in the enterprise based at the store is
different okay in the press space you

879
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:21,319
you

880
00:52:21,319 --> 00:52:25,430
don't have a choice right i mean your
identities owned by your company

881
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:29,230
okay and your company make a decision
before you make trust relationships and

882
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:30,279
I think that fine

883
00:52:30,279 --> 00:52:34,440
arm so day typically they already have

884
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,819
interest in things that minimal
disclosure I and so on and typically

885
00:52:37,819 --> 00:52:39,660
they also have interest in tight

886
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:43,369
trust relationship so as I said I'm the
whole

887
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:46,410
psychological thing only exists and I am

888
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:50,329
in my opinion in the userspace and

889
00:52:50,329 --> 00:52:53,809
aside a I think that's a valid concern

890
00:52:53,809 --> 00:52:57,220
on technical issues I see with just
because

891
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:00,710
but first all the a complex as you've
seen arm

892
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:04,710
they're not liked like a single thing
that gets request an enduring

893
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:08,480
um it I wouldn't recommend

894
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,500
trying to implement yourself okay so

895
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:15,510
you should go with a proven Menda

896
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:18,799
that you trust again now and you the
live re im

897
00:53:18,799 --> 00:53:22,250
I'm that that implements the think Sam
the next them

898
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:25,290
the next problem I see if caught now
that

899
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:30,069
a user has a single account which gives
him access to many applications

900
00:53:30,069 --> 00:53:33,339
this single account becomes much more
attractive for you know

901
00:53:33,339 --> 00:53:37,809
attack a right and

902
00:53:37,809 --> 00:53:41,700
tested St side fish tank maybe you know
that

903
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,950
arm which basically a

904
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:48,089
money towards phishing sites and

905
00:53:48,089 --> 00:53:51,589
I'm just the last three days I look for
some of them

906
00:53:51,589 --> 00:53:56,040
and they are still online so we have to
Facebook

907
00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:00,470
login page here well arm

908
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:04,640
we haz gmail

909
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:08,029
and they didn't even you know pic like

910
00:54:08,029 --> 00:54:11,930
funny domain names to its just page
which affect gmail your

911
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:15,540
on of one of the biggest

912
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:20,069
Federation provide us maybe the biggest
at all all of them

913
00:54:20,069 --> 00:54:25,099
this guy okay so if you are a collar and
gets stolen

914
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:29,049
for one of defied you are typically in
big trouble

915
00:54:29,049 --> 00:54:32,660
okay especially since Microsoft make
this unfortunate mariage

916
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:36,970
of having life idea to lock onto

917
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:40,190
blocks and managing your corporate a.m.

918
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:44,609
windows licenses for example a MSDN
account and the things that

919
00:54:44,609 --> 00:54:47,640
which you know which brink

920
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:53,680
back to point to some time to go to make
sense to separate identity

921
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:57,410
okay so fishing is a is a is a much more
attractive

922
00:54:57,410 --> 00:55:01,010
attack and if in this world crossfire's
request forgery

923
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:04,910
is a much more attractive attack in this
world because now you get transparent

924
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:07,760
access to many sites and if you can
trick someone into you know

925
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,640
making get requests a post because
without being stopped by some looking

926
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,510
screen in between

927
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:16,809
you maybe have a more efficient in doing
your tech

928
00:55:16,809 --> 00:55:20,130
that the other thing in my case the most

929
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:23,450
to the biggest concern I fear that Indic
in

930
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:27,380
in in the typical applications based be
out talking that application not web

931
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:28,420
services

932
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:32,970
and defense applications the prowess to
if the driver of the protocol

933
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:35,990
right so we making redirects HCPs

934
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:39,710
all these things and you know that

935
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:42,770
process gives you the choice if they
wanna am

936
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:46,069
except the site or not I'm so all

937
00:55:46,069 --> 00:55:49,910
known and unknown attacks against
process a totally in place

938
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:52,930
and death differ knife

939
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:58,000
to recall as trip now way but just strip
of himself from from the Y are

940
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,549
from which brings back to the point that
you should additionally encrypt the

941
00:56:01,549 --> 00:56:02,549
tokens

942
00:56:02,549 --> 00:56:05,670
and not just rely on SL doing the job
for you

943
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:09,150
and I am the last word I have here if

944
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:12,410
that in individ services about we don't
have teeth problems

945
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:16,230
luckily because that's so is this them
don't have to if screens like do you

946
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:17,000
wanna

947
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,500
continue regardless if tooth as the
certificate if

948
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,950
no fishy somehow yeah

949
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:26,960
saw I think it to tread rev it up

950
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:32,170
arm into enterprise spaces tremendously
powerful tremendously useful and I guess

951
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:35,400
I don't know any the company with
western fought about it yet

952
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:39,049
maybe they didn't use the restoration
for it to but somehow do you have to

953
00:56:39,049 --> 00:56:39,569
share

954
00:56:39,569 --> 00:56:44,770
accounts yeah um in the country myspace
I don't really care that much

955
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:48,680
um I'm I see Open ID having a certain
value

956
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:52,960
I am did implementation is a little bit
West simplistic in my mind

957
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:57,529
my opinion am and

958
00:56:57,529 --> 00:57:02,040
I think you just shoot give it a try if
you have any questions like for a Cause

959
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,630
how they work to other other concerns

960
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:07,970
I am here um for

961
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:11,940
I think the whole day I was writing
email and I think

962
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:18,940
enjoy your lunch

963
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:25,120
the question was them

964
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:30,060
if Sr will drive people to call I'll

965
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:34,320
asha is a platform you can do with them
along that you can do w ith whatever

966
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:37,840
you can to open idea I don't see why
Asha itself should

967
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:41,080
you know triumph because in that case

968
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:44,670
its it's much like asking a will Amazon
ec2

969
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:48,410
try to call if the platform pot

970
00:58:48,410 --> 00:58:55,410
1

971
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:04,119
yeah

972
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:14,530
well I mean 11.2 haven't talked what
specifically is

973
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:19,460
that the whole clout thing Federation is
an enabler for the clout

974
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:23,110
because if you think about it today if
you have already serve the sitting out

975
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:23,480
there

976
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:26,770
in in the old world would have to look
on separately in each one of them right

977
00:59:26,770 --> 00:59:29,990
every time so yes for for making a

978
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:34,820
a successful cloud service you need
Federation eat up because you don't want

979
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:37,170
to employees have to type in the
password every time

980
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:40,050
all you don't want that your customers
type in the bath every time because it's

981
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:41,530
also a selling point right

982
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:45,470
and saying hey we can reuse your account
one example is a

983
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:49,360
hosted Exchange Microsoft a so you can
make a deal with Microsoft

984
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:52,610
that you host exchange at their in Asia

985
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:56,020
more or less not yet but soon um and

986
00:59:56,020 --> 01:00:00,180
that you can use your locate the main
account to talk to you Exchange mailbox

987
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:03,800
and of course that's a big selling point
for me because I don't want to type in

988
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,780
the effort every time I'm already locked
on

989
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:12,090
now so coming back to your question I
think Asha on ec2 or engine

990
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:15,300
will be try bus full of some sort of
adoration

991
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:18,910
but which protocol they will use it's up
to them

992
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:22,330
given that Ash I might have mostly

993
01:00:22,330 --> 01:00:26,390
Microsoft custom us ten yes David W W
Federation NWF trust

994
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:29,650
but def not technically a limitation of
doing

995
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:32,950
something out to you you can run a

996
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:39,950
tom cat on asia I mean there's no that
the debt that the reason why wouldn't

997
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:51,520
absolutely

998
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,329
yet

999
01:00:52,329 --> 01:00:56,050
I know

1000
01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:56,760
70

1001
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:00,320
I I mean yes am as I said

1002
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:05,570
from any any thought of clout strategy
will involve Federation because

1003
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:12,570
no you have to somehow connected
applications to

1004
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,720
well

1005
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:32,260
and im at my my customer base it is

1006
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:35,960
really I am that may be the reason
because

1007
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:40,480
you know ADFS version 1 was like very
early in the game

1008
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:44,160
if you look at the specs and stand up
today

1009
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:47,870
if all only like two or three years
until a stable life stride

1010
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:51,070
to even DDD industry can now um

1011
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:56,620
say we have WS Federation and we have to
assemble 1.1 token type to do that if

1012
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:57,220
things which

1013
01:01:57,220 --> 01:02:00,370
seem to work now okay and now I see a

1014
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:07,370
you to run on these technologies

1015
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:13,080
well

1016
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:20,080
just the one to I just talk about a

1017
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:29,100
well of course and day and then they
bring in guys like you are

1018
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:33,230
guys like me and and a day on their way
to and we talk about a

1019
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:37,230
I technically did because the fine now
arm

1020
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:41,460
just be keep in mind that typically if
the browser

1021
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:45,130
that that is involved so the process a
problem now arm

1022
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:49,530
but because themselves are fine and they
are just based on proven things like

1023
01:02:49,530 --> 01:02:53,030
the signature us encryption I am

1024
01:02:53,030 --> 01:02:56,800
tokens so that that that is no new
technology

1025
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:00,820
by DA I mean your item companies are
starting thinking about it

1026
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:04,230
at least thing about in practice yeah

1027
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:07,420
but I think you will see a huge

1028
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:14,420
attraction to do things

1029
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:35,609
are the Co
