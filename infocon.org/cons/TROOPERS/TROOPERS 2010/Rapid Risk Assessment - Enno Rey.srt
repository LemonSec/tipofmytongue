1
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,930
thank you for it but are good afternoon
and welcome to everybody

2
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,890
I asked for a try to introduce your

3
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:36,759
on to avoid introducing myself kind of

4
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:40,740
might be that might have looks

5
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:46,009
a bit hilarious some my name is an ally

6
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:51,100
some of you my Tori know me I'm going to
talk about rapid risk assessment which

7
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,909
is

8
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:56,149
kind of a methodology we r

9
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:59,759
especially my pasta develop the DR NW
where r

10
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,470
methodologies solnce more sophisticated
than this

11
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,670
background of to stalk yes that

12
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,810
I aunt by me doing so

13
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,569
some other guys at the on W we have a
strong focus on there was space approach

14
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:15,690
to in for a sec

15
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,440
discussions in for a sec suspects

16
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,819
and the I

17
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:27,019
say experience any what outsider us

18
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:30,239
that even tho we keep reaching their son
we

19
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,280
feel like oh we have a message a little
under this

20
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,519
rest base and for sidewalk is sufficient

21
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,850
in for Sat walk at many times

22
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,250
the find a situation that this is not

23
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,959
other way InfoSec this handout and lots
of organizations

24
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,790
sign I want to give some insight why
this is the case

25
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,630
what could be done about it and I

26
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:01,769
provide some case studies from recent
project where we try to introduce so

27
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:02,310
there we

28
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,670
fast a that like all grew up it

29
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:09,139
risk assessment approach I was get this

30
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:13,799
this is mainly a here forty for your
lack of the printed material

31
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:18,160
the agenda I S I mean obviously we need
some Thompson definitions

32
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,660
what is a risk all what we understand

33
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,049
a as for the time risk I'll

34
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:28,239
what is worse assessment what does risk
assessments of awe

35
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,609
why maybe doesn't walk in

36
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:35,519
many organizations at least not the way
it is intended to walk

37
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,680
where room for improvement can be
identified to where the

38
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,110
a thing that we do but we call our air
up it was assessment is different

39
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,599
and set some case studies provide

40
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:53,189
for us let's talk about it time risk

41
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:56,930
risk has different meanings some for
different people

42
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,230
the most simple definition of risk

43
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,730
that I came across at some pop at some
time in

44
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,150
from that has some sympathy for being
our

45
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,849
simple a its exposure to loss

46
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:16,810
still the Evo rapidly all realize that
this one

47
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,750
country we use the in the

48
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,360
InfoSec going for a sec governance
process us

49
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,580
that might be lots of from assets that
can be exposed to Los

50
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,610
that loss can ask different forms and
meanings

51
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:37,099
and this might leave out some important
aspects

52
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:41,430
which are covered in this definition the
probability of a fright

53
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:45,099
overcoming security control its
assistance to apply it

54
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:49,300
exploit a vulnerability that was out in
a loss this is a very good

55
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,840
very pointing definition problem s

56
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,140
it's far too complex to be

57
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,390
I use far-right daily I'll

58
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:03,610
in for saying life our daily handling of
risk

59
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,630
assess obviously lots of Parliament
House in

60
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,240
that have to reconsider that to walk
according to this definition

61
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,419
I so 27 all five

62
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:17,570
which is regarded as the main stand out
on waste management

63
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:21,909
from the isometric 27 on family
describes an information security

64
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:22,710
awareness

65
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,969
as a potential that a given frat

66
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:31,370
will exploit vulnerabilities of an asset
up with of assets and thereby cause harm

67
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:37,260
to the organization I'm Oct sometimes in
a rat and those sweet I'm so we'll have

68
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,409
a sudden meaning

69
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:41,960
doing the talking and as for the method
that we

70
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,620
I used to quantify and to estimate the
risk

71
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,620
it's about rats it's about my abilities

72
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,100
and it's about hom cost an organization

73
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:57,870
it's what impact and this impact usually
is we got it as a negative impact

74
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,060
there are so quite in a way to

75
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,509
arce help discussion and some risk
assessments of those

76
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:09,449
about the concept that we r I call the
concept of

77
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:13,470
we wat like not only focusing on the bad
things

78
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,850
that can happen but a also on the
positive outcome

79
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,900
but again this is a very innovative
approach I will not cover this

80
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,220
so let's keep this in are in mind

81
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:30,270
it's about threats one abilities and
Hall

82
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,150
it turns out that many people use
especially in

83
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,990
say on common daily life

84
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,050
the times risk and traps

85
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:46,530
somehow interchangeably they say
although did you consider the risk of

86
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:49,789
an earthquake of lot tying up whatever
our

87
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:53,669
and what they really mean it's a frat

88
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:58,270
are just to clarify afraid to something
bad that can happen

89
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:02,220
we got less of Terrell Owens a meteorite

90
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,340
getting kind of frat still

91
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,810
I as Hume that most so he'll I'll

92
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,440
sleep well a most nights some

93
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,610
depending on the number of smart
torrance you might have but

94
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,840
recites this surah you don't Bowie

95
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,039
too much about met her all rights that's
a frat

96
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,020
that might not be a at least not
irrelevant whisk

97
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:31,400
so what is a risk a risk is a certain
view and frats

98
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,840
arm by some dimensions how likely is a
frat going to happen

99
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,470
that the probability if it happens

100
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,849
if say enough to lay earthquake happens

101
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:47,460
will it affect us that's affect all that
we call the viability

102
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,410
while effect aunt in case

103
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,720
it happens and we are susceptible

104
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,610
are to the events on how hard will it
hit us

105
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:03,250
what harm will it cost that's the impact

106
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,770
looking at the frat from the sufrir
perspective

107
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:10,310
then it becomes a risk I West

108
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,050
sell what call for the InfoSec life has
to tackle

109
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,919
hostile to walk on

110
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,520
mainly due to the fact that we saw says
hi limit

111
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,560
so far somebody up being in love

112
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,449
information security it's not like one
house on limited we saw some limited

113
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:33,140
money on limited amount of time

114
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:37,329
to say elevate the state or increase a
stay or a state of

115
00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:40,690
information security we saw some lim et

116
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,760
sold a challenge s the best with limited
we saw says

117
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,040
and this is upon term risk a some very
important piece

118
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,750
in those steely & governance process

119
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,060
there is our 2002

120
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,300
published I so document

121
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,370
that has some definitions some risk on
that one

122
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:09,370
defines risk analysis ass a systematic
use of information to identify sauce and

123
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,470
to estimate the risk

124
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,760
I throughout the remainder of my talk I
will use the times risk assessment and

125
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,660
risk analysis

126
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:20,130
interchangeably home kind of the same

127
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:24,100
as for to perspective my talk this I am

128
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,680
might collide with very academic all
very strict

129
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,110
definitions of those time some I leave
this aside

130
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:35,980
so 10 I use risk analysis that's not
their friend from wisconsin

131
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:39,140
appall five-a just call our way

132
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:44,040
for you and we've yet to fall so it's
about a systematic use its about a

133
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,880
systematic

134
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,689
on process to to evaluate him to hand
the risks

135
00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:54,589
and terrorists are quite some approach
us quite some too

136
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:58,269
it's quite some methodologies out out to
perform this

137
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:01,570
process called risk assessment of risk
analysis

138
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,570
towers so-called quantitative well as
qualitative

139
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:08,779
approach a sweat a quantitative approach
us walk

140
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:13,829
for exactly a to find number us like the
probability of one of placating I'm

141
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:17,760
workers so whatever IDAs that can be a

142
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,560
of figured out by looking at a possible
yes apostle 500 YES on

143
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,730
a looking at Sawyer say some some data
from

144
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,910
well what's whateva up

145
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:34,180
this is supposed to be I'll post with a
qualitative approach that dot

146
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:38,390
does not try to exact number us but what
on a scale

147
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:41,579
well with high and low and I must get an
ideal for

148
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:46,750
Wireless has begun another one on but we
don't need no exact numbers for this

149
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,850
in in for a second I T and general
usually to qualitative approaches heels

150
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,290
ass it's quite difficult say to figure
out the

151
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,670
I xx probability of a virus outbreak
happening

152
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,670
of the hall haha to failure

153
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:04,420
happening I mean you can collect our
state are and try to

154
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,740
to work on the apostate to

155
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,290
kind of get future date up but arm

156
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:14,480
source lots of Rights why this will
either mobloc

157
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,220
all the way with yari extensive amount
of walk

158
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,740
which then again might be inhibiting
factor

159
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,350
there was a number of methods away level
the most common one saw

160
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:32,310
I'd say octave and in Europe especially
in france out there are so

161
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:36,829
method called me Ali there was two lists

162
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:41,820
on the most common one at least from my
perspective scram

163
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,820
soul that might be

164
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:49,740
waste to packed a lot to perform a
process like risk assessment

165
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,740
and ass we will see if I mean deceiving
either 27 all

166
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,060
5 published in 2008

167
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,490
there's lots of benefits of the
following risks risk

168
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,720
analysis risk assessment

169
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,190
the first one is some communication it's
always a good thing if people talk to

170
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:08,680
each other

171
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,720
about saying for a sec

172
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,769
of topics on I'm

173
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:17,870
the following risk analysis using these
people got to get our

174
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:22,089
try to figure out what r what bad things
can happen how relevant are those bad

175
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:23,510
things

176
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:27,130
I and so talking about risks talking
about rats

177
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:32,680
usually provides but I insights and into
an environment into things that can

178
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,540
happen

179
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,990
and so by itself a risk analysis

180
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,820
hasset see you us are usually an

181
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:45,029
boasts what I call exercises like people
getting together

182
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:48,360
talking about risks there are some
moments like all

183
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,300
I never thought about this and

184
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:57,279
sold after going for the exercise just a
better understanding and this might help

185
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:57,950
on

186
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,959
the state's overall state of information
security not directly

187
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:06,600
this kind of our risk analysis so I I
call this discussion

188
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,930
discussing risks and are trying to
figure out

189
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:14,519
what is right and what is not I risk
analysis might suffer as a basis for

190
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,230
decision take

191
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,490
like there was discussion some within
the project

192
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:23,260
should we go with technology a always
technology be

193
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,820
and a turns out that

194
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,160
this question might be on site by means
of risk analysis

195
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,980
lets try to figure out what other whisks
to what degree are those risks

196
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,589
say arm modify it

197
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:45,480
by going this way on by want to go we
are they modified by going that way

198
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,790
and trying to find some this out

199
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:55,050
mate might help for the decision taking
okay we go this way all we got that way

200
00:13:55,050 --> 00:14:00,519
a usually in this kind of mode of our
risk assessment

201
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:05,519
that in a very strict although it well
organized in for a sec cycle

202
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,320
can because and governance malt fly in
for a sec

203
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,560
overall governance it is necessary at
certain points to take decisions and

204
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,260
those

205
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:18,410
decisions are taken based on insight
into risks

206
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:21,750
that's why it's called governance Malton

207
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:26,050
pretty much always performing a risk
analysis

208
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:29,670
sauce to on-site question on

209
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:33,570
to answer the question like this way or
that way of

210
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:39,540
on what happens to what degree is our
risks I modified some

211
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,649
if we take some architectural change

212
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:47,610
soul finding alt the appropriate
question

213
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:51,579
is a crucial part when performing risk
analysis for this pop

214
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:54,740
its like not just discussing stuff but

215
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,350
the taking decisions with all the
consequences

216
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,720
decisions might have based on risk

217
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,470
on understanding of risk there's more
benefit some

218
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,860
when performed correctly risk analysis
saw

219
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:15,940
see immediate side-effect of documenting
the process of decision taking

220
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:19,050
risk analysis I of then

221
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:23,589
subsea risk management mites off to all
people accountable

222
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:28,399
like you perform the exercise so you
came to those conclusions you took that

223
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,880
decision our sole simply said don't
complain of the wats

224
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,009
as you were involved in the exercise

225
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:39,220
usually just means the right mix of
people we have fun

226
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,300
say some authority a has to be present
India

227
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,339
in the exercise or exercise usually
means people gathering

228
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:48,350
either by posse are in the conference
call

229
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:53,040
and discussing filling out a ver serving
tables with number us

230
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,620
and drawing conclusions from this and by
the way I said twenty-some all one

231
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,639
strictly mandate for risk for risk
assessment

232
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,540
so whenever a you organization

233
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:09,670
tries to be tries to follow the ISO
27000 of

234
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:13,800
fine for a sec management a risk
assessment place major all

235
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,649
so are what some that question I mention

236
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:24,070
government small in the motel risk
analysis of to take decisions

237
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:28,519
that question plays a vital role and how
could that question

238
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:32,490
are usually be formulated at stores
Toolman

239
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,740
are examples Force 1s up something like

240
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,730
what's occurring say the interest in our
environment let's sit down and try to

241
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,550
find Allah term

242
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:45,339
are usually based on a so called friend
catalog desk catastrophes that can

243
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:45,829
happen

244
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:49,320
there is human failure to send the board
actions there's hopper failure status

245
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,130
attacks let's have a look at all those
frats

246
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:57,160
rate rate their associated West's

247
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,389
draw some conclusions for example let
you put that we saw sis

248
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:04,429
which are the most relevant risks are
that we have to put the money we don't

249
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:05,709
have to spend money on

250
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:10,510
knots all relevant risks this is usually
performed

251
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:13,790
on a regular basis say every 60

252
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:19,419
12 months and uses the same frets every
time it is performed

253
00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:24,760
this can be found in quite a number of
innovations

254
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,000
not so much driven by say the InfoSec
people

255
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,169
but mostly driven by either Wisconsin

256
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:35,630
management department so which depending
on the industry sector might be present

257
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:36,340
anyway

258
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,760
off by business continuity management

259
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,250
and this malt taking your front cut the
lock always looking at the same frets

260
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,409
at regular intervals I call a

261
00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:50,429
inventory malt an inventory moat

262
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:54,800
mainly soft lawn service xx questions
where do we stand

263
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,940
right now compared to say twelve months
ago

264
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:03,780
and where do we have to to put say
future we saw sis

265
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,149
there was a whole different type of
question and this is the 1 I'm

266
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:10,200
I'm going to focus on to something we
that s

267
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,950
hol 2008 asterisk landscape shift

268
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:18,020
if some change happens if we introduce
virtualization

269
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,370
what does this mean follow-up overall
risk for

270
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:26,520
a subset of assets are if the outs of if
you go to the clout

271
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,780
what does this mean as for the risk

272
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:34,230
this is a whole different type of
question and usually

273
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:37,409
the frets and and that scenario

274
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:42,149
do not derived from the frat cuddle it's
not that doesn't make sense say

275
00:18:42,149 --> 00:18:46,210
to Ansar a question of from

276
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,440
sure we introduce a virtualization on
autumn

277
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,730
tool right there was a couple of quick

278
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:56,129
and that might be risks of my pet rats

279
00:18:56,129 --> 00:19:00,490
I'll arising from much like nation like
a tax on the hype allies are

280
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:04,590
that have not been covered so far in the
front cover

281
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,429
so decide to a completely different
types of questions and

282
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:12,919
different types of associated risk
management or risk assessment

283
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:17,040
a if I go on I want to summarize tests

284
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,419
many free modes of a risk assessment

285
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:23,710
there were swapping just hot inventory
mode writer like Thomas

286
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:27,500
for a cuddle up there was discussion
most people talk to each other

287
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,590
and there's governance malt in an
InfoSec cycle decisions are

288
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,609
take me based on risk

289
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:38,139
get to support place I'll

290
00:19:38,139 --> 00:19:42,030
and hopefully so far

291
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,290
you could understand obviously a risk

292
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:48,470
assessment top-secret managing those
risks

293
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:52,510
something we has obvious benefit and its
even mandate

294
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:56,060
by ice a 27-hole 1 so question s

295
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,369
wider hella in so many organizations

296
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:04,320
on this s not done correctly it is not
at all

297
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,580
I just are now only partially at the
summer so wrong to Los

298
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,790
why is it that risk assessment as an

299
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:17,510
what I think obviously

300
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:23,109
paramount process far efficient InfoSec
management

301
00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:28,540
is not widely deployed and from all
alterations I mean we have been

302
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:32,379
doing this type of stuff what quite some
years now

303
00:20:32,379 --> 00:20:36,849
I'm a fan of indoor space approach since
about 2001 when I first got in contact

304
00:20:36,849 --> 00:20:39,409
with be established 7.9 at the time

305
00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:43,500
which stuff at process of law I saw 27

306
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,619
thousand 2&1

307
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:52,859
that's what accounts and not some and it
on solid starts a set of common problems

308
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:56,820
usually does we saw some time
constraints I mean this is a process is

309
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,990
a process that

310
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:02,349
might be time consuming this might term
we class some expertise

311
00:21:02,349 --> 00:21:05,800
not available within the organization
which had to be brought in

312
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,020
from external parties

313
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,460
this might be a problem the law
prevalent

314
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,550
problem from my perspective this

315
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:19,369
usually people getting into whiskas
asked like understanding

316
00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:23,690
hope this can be helpful for me and my
organization

317
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:27,020
they strive for a holistic big hits like
all

318
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:32,280
yeah now let's have a look at the frats
& then it turns out that way out

319
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,369
looking at the frat some there was
different types of

320
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:39,919
impact does impact on availability
impact on confidentiality may be impact

321
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,260
regulations

322
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:46,970
and then to find out what I'll there
might be network related risks but those

323
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:50,179
depend on other are risk of rats

324
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:54,700
like him talking about

325
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,540
the frats of physical access a lot of
Pol of a network switch

326
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:03,129
might mean on to look at the physical
security of the data center at all

327
00:22:03,129 --> 00:22:06,349
are the overall supply of power

328
00:22:06,349 --> 00:22:09,409
%uh so people go for it and that they
try to tackle it

329
00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:13,149
and it grows bigger and bigger more
dependency some all aspects

330
00:22:13,149 --> 00:22:16,679
and they never get to a point of
finishing a simple

331
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:22,510
single exercise I and even if they
manage to assemble a group of people

332
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:25,659
flaw a1 one day so a dolla

333
00:22:25,659 --> 00:22:28,790
a five people

334
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:32,540
exercise in the end of today don't have
always sought they postpone

335
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,800
I and they never really proud to use

336
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,639
any meaningful say we saw

337
00:22:39,639 --> 00:22:44,190
this Assam what happens very often

338
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:48,149
combined with the fact that people
confuse that different modes

339
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:51,570
arm terrorists people who understand
like

340
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:55,060
all risk assessment means we discuss
ways yes but nights

341
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,530
there are others might be business might
expect a

342
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:02,099
okay if you perform risk analysis could
you please pull right we saw it so we

343
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:02,570
can

344
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:07,429
take decisions on that all well we we we
we just want to discuss it

345
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:10,929
and really a unfortunately we have not
finished the exercise

346
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:14,330
on a mite confuse inventory malt

347
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:18,159
like yeah every perform risk assessment
once a year we have the gates of

348
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,840
and we go for that right had a lock yeah
nice you do that but

349
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,090
how does this help when on so the
question is what allies Asian

350
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:31,190
are should the to what degree does what
lies Asian as a technology a change your

351
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:31,929
risk

352
00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:35,139
there was no benefit so

353
00:23:35,139 --> 00:23:39,349
the side a common problems and as for
the government's fault

354
00:23:39,349 --> 00:23:43,050
the one say mode of risk assessment that
is

355
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:48,659
that can be used should be most as an
essential element

356
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:51,909
and now walking in for a sec process
there was

357
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:55,710
one main critical success factor that is
some

358
00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:00,020
what I call practicability a I've never
come around with a better translation I

359
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:04,460
part is just back from from John and
party coming to tape some

360
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,500
are so far I i tryed usability

361
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:12,010
and and different stuff from I've not
found about Tom

362
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:15,580
what it should express s whenever I'll

363
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:19,490
one performs whisker assessment and
governance mort

364
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:22,770
as a basis for taking decisions not just
talking

365
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:26,599
and not just for the feeling some
compliance requirements

366
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:30,940
while that is like a once-a-year you
have to undergo a risk assessment

367
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,359
for a catalog talking about after exxon
you would say yes

368
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:39,540
but real practical walk taking
intelligent decisions

369
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:43,149
that is governance malt on 20

370
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:46,450
to reach this goal it just absolutely

371
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:49,820
paramount on to deliver our

372
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,980
a certain we sought in a certain time

373
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,599
and this might even mean that the scope
is now a lot

374
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:59,869
on a number of frets: aznar alt audit
discussion s

375
00:24:59,869 --> 00:25:04,240
somehow I strictly steer

376
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,109
its I'll I have experience risk analysis

377
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:13,369
sessions so where I was so acting as a
moderator

378
00:25:13,369 --> 00:25:16,649
and I told people like I'll wait okay I
I know it's lunchtime

379
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:20,710
um and I know everybody is hungry we
won't leave does rule until this is

380
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,050
finished

381
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:25,690
and then a people got back to me how can
you expect to get a meaningful

382
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:30,280
we sought out of people take putting
putting them under pressure

383
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:35,599
exploiting they are them being hungry on
my own so usually a sa

384
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:41,030
even if this we start worse generator
with say unfortunate

385
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:44,169
conditions it's better than not having
we saw

386
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:49,750
is better than not having an ESA
transparent on number base as we will

387
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,750
see

388
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:54,060
I estimation of risks

389
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:58,429
so this is what i do. body rapid risk
assessment comes into play

390
00:25:58,429 --> 00:26:02,589
I it's an approach that we at TRW

391
00:26:02,589 --> 00:26:06,280
kind of developed and use for governance

392
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:10,429
mode risk assessments which again we we
got us the most

393
00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:13,820
of bones crucial ESO de la

394
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,839
to perform so in a timely manner

395
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:20,040
what we do and they're up a risk
assessment is not rocket science

396
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,919
speed just he was a very common approach
a very common methodology

397
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:28,089
I'll the main difference to

398
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:33,589
other say methodologies the we find out
our song we do not walk in the rapid

399
00:26:33,589 --> 00:26:36,440
risk assessment usually be to mop up
with generic frets

400
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,359
we focus on those frats that might be
relevant to

401
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:43,909
given scenario which then entire week
why us

402
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:47,070
some the way for experience and maturity
a

403
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:50,450
as high risk assessments by one sis is
given

404
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:54,000
on this stuff can turn out what we think

405
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,339
tremendously helpful it's about

406
00:26:57,339 --> 00:27:01,230
all assets about what that we focus on
relevant risks on

407
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:06,099
its wikitable on tweet try to stay on us
a business reasonable

408
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:12,099
ground as for time resource consumption
doing to process

409
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:15,369
what we do so. essentially what

410
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:18,869
I said 27 all five which does not expect
it just

411
00:27:18,869 --> 00:27:22,010
just pre of describe the methodology but

412
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:25,159
some I to $27.5 a

413
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:28,899
sup base on PS other sign

414
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:33,490
doubles 7793 and Tia Australian you see
that said that forty

415
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:39,679
pre sixty so one can get an idea of what
they think is a good approach

416
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,399
on that it's an approach that many
practitioners have been

417
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:46,700
using anyway which is a quantitative
risk assessment

418
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,440
so not working if exact numbers but on a
scale from 1

419
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,080
well you know to what 250 hi and

420
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,669
free affect us coming into the overall
picture of a risk that this whole

421
00:27:57,669 --> 00:27:59,070
problem Allison event

422
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:02,070
whole Wireless given scope

423
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:09,070
to any event and the impact and usually
it's a simple tables like this one

424
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:14,580
up having a list of rats looking at the
frats were from

425
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:19,740
Sutton a barometer us writing a
probability viability an impact

426
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,460
multiplying does number us and in the
end of the day one gets our

427
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:27,589
now must which give an idea that
obviously this risk

428
00:28:27,589 --> 00:28:31,159
is higher than this one and I

429
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:34,320
maybe a some of these risks are

430
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,369
be law are a of a sudden press hold

431
00:28:38,369 --> 00:28:42,129
like okay we don't have to tackle any
West some performing this

432
00:28:42,129 --> 00:28:46,190
methodology usually 20 yes I suppress
solid very commonly

433
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:49,950
use which gives everything below twenty
is not

434
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:53,020
looked at all Asus we gotta not

435
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,179
relevant risk are

436
00:28:56,179 --> 00:28:59,669
so it's not again not as I rocket
science some

437
00:28:59,669 --> 00:29:03,820
having some frats looking at them from
different angles

438
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:07,679
and those three anglers sought a
probability again usually that one is on

439
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,450
a scale on

440
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,750
from 125 like the other parameters
well-run

441
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,580
one I up to five are defiant

442
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:19,480
at some place it's not completely
subjective like a one slow

443
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,740
yeah what what does it all mean lolol
might mean

444
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:26,010
less than once in a year and fall might
mean the

445
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:29,270
more than once in a month something some

446
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:32,589
event knocking off the doll I

447
00:29:32,589 --> 00:29:36,589
explicitly use the time knocking at the
door lock

448
00:29:36,589 --> 00:29:43,589
us in this free paramita based approach

449
00:29:43,609 --> 00:29:46,770
our wifi up

450
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:51,470
buy nor will it effect of usually
looking at the probability means

451
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:57,330
that one does not consider existing
controls

452
00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:00,659
I sayin approach like okay to might be
that people

453
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:05,440
trying to get into our data center but
thankfully they don't get in as we have

454
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,849
a good access control that's a wrong way
of tackling

455
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:12,010
mom this some are the probability just

456
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:16,339
describes how often will it happen that
somebody shows up at a data center

457
00:30:16,339 --> 00:30:18,700
trying to get in

458
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:22,599
if there was good access control this
has some influence on the viability

459
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:23,780
Fecteau

460
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:27,080
this environment is not successful

461
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,460
to the frat people trying to get in

462
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:34,500
I this says so some people have to get
used to this

463
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,450
I especially those I say I'm always take
this and that is:

464
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:41,849
and a a city gal but you can't leave out
what we have done in the past

465
00:30:41,849 --> 00:30:45,300
yes we we we we can and you will see a
%uh why

466
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,839
desis a good thing to I'll

467
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:52,520
kind of split between the probability in
the viability

468
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,859
to our ability a

469
00:30:55,859 --> 00:30:58,929
gives an idea there were set that say

470
00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:01,990
a junction of Tom's threats and
vulnerabilities

471
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:06,250
Press bad things that can happen
viability is affect us

472
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:09,290
and a the lane that the bad things

473
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:12,869
a here materialize some like

474
00:31:12,869 --> 00:31:16,320
that's the front of theft and the
liability would be opened on the

475
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,300
security guy

476
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:22,770
this is a concept that in itself has a
lot of well you

477
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:26,669
and as particularly relevant for that
type of risk assessment

478
00:31:26,669 --> 00:31:30,800
fall so this one liability has to be a
waiter at

479
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,389
to some degree again on the scale from
one to five

480
00:31:34,389 --> 00:31:38,300
I d interesting point about the one
ability s

481
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:44,060
this is usually defector that can be
it's a modified or influence on in a

482
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,830
given environment

483
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:49,399
Yukon changed a lot bad things happen
there are people

484
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:53,589
knocking at the door and if they get in
there will be severe impact

485
00:31:53,589 --> 00:31:58,050
so you usually one con change say the
impact too much

486
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:02,820
depending on your point of view but
let's put it that simply up but what

487
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,899
one can modify from an InfoSec

488
00:32:05,899 --> 00:32:10,839
perspective of common practitioner's
perspective usually serve our ability

489
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:14,450
if they show up if they get in on not
SSL

490
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:19,310
the this is some say expressed in the
viability effect

491
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:22,740
which can I'll missus I

492
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,909
fairly generic scale to be found for the

493
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:29,550
forty-one 2551 mean some there was
extensive controls

494
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:36,169
a sold at the front can only materialize
if multiple failures circle inside

495
00:32:36,169 --> 00:32:40,300
and the Fifers so if there was any
controls at all

496
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,760
on they are so weak that they can easily
be succulent

497
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,770
by either by an attacker are I'll

498
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:50,089
Sayyaf quake um want try to build a

499
00:32:50,089 --> 00:32:53,480
book building in a way that a soft quick
proof but

500
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:58,169
a could have we such as shown that the
approach was a long one if enough

501
00:32:58,169 --> 00:32:59,859
pictures up to building a break

502
00:32:59,859 --> 00:33:03,050
than while Realty also Sobia Fife

503
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:06,379
even told hours controlled place

504
00:33:06,379 --> 00:33:12,089
same thing for the impact the impact has
to be wait it's on a 12 fifes K

505
00:33:12,089 --> 00:33:16,290
arm does different approach just trying
to out to

506
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:19,859
break down the impact on on that 125
scale

507
00:33:19,859 --> 00:33:22,879
ass some people might some

508
00:33:22,879 --> 00:33:27,480
try to differentiate between Olympic on
availability is a completely different

509
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,480
thing than

510
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,169
impact on see i'd it stands for
confidentiality and integrity

511
00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:37,609
of impact on compliance and a sense of
our

512
00:33:37,609 --> 00:33:40,780
I'll violating regulations

513
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:44,050
while I certainly agree

514
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:49,020
that are looking at the impact from
different angles

515
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:53,280
availability was confidentiality makes
sense

516
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,950
from governance point of view this
usually means

517
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:00,619
that one doesn't

518
00:34:00,619 --> 00:34:03,849
stay on time I'll which again

519
00:34:03,849 --> 00:34:07,379
makes the whole effort than while class
so

520
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:10,970
there was some debate on this one but
the year

521
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:15,490
that common sense ass try to break down
the impact

522
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:19,109
even if that one is so from

523
00:34:19,109 --> 00:34:23,929
completely different angles in one
number

524
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:27,369
%uh so how does sound and the to:

525
00:34:27,369 --> 00:34:30,639
famous a rapid risk assessment walk
which

526
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,740
again a justice and application mort

527
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,859
of on the stuff being around anyway

528
00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:42,129
%ah the epic risk assessment

529
00:34:42,129 --> 00:34:46,730
kind of describe some a procedure that
stocks will form

530
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:50,070
okay try to assemble the right people
arm

531
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:55,589
might be in a room usually one of the
advantages of the RIAs

532
00:34:55,589 --> 00:35:00,940
dollar-some exercise can be a form a
fond conference calls

533
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:04,079
so in a given amount of time

534
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,640
this week while some pre walk which
means some parameters

535
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:13,329
I'll this them in a second have to be
agreed on before

536
00:35:13,329 --> 00:35:16,750
I and and I'll one goes into that the
meeting

537
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:20,119
into the exercise into the conference
call to start to table and

538
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:23,540
deliver so we saw what's the stuff from

539
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,680
that is absolutely necessary to do so

540
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,690
and reasonable way

541
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:33,920
this may be one discipline not to get
into lengthy discussions

542
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,320
also fuel left try to perform risk
assess was in the past so those of you

543
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,820
line left in

544
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,990
in for a sec in large organizations

545
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:47,930
know that say discussions were for some
in for a sec people some

546
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:51,200
people from business unit some people
from approach ect

547
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,930
trying to bring in some new technology
and maybe you have

548
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:58,660
compliance office on the call you have
some money from legal in because there

549
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,830
was somebody from

550
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:04,710
another organizational entity in the
call and although it's so

551
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:08,720
start discussing have completely
different Thomas

552
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,810
and in the end of today the some again
some

553
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:15,960
some conference call is over our and I
we body Leafs

554
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,260
kind of had solid to next meeting and
some

555
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,880
I as a feeling of okay what what do we
do the last

556
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,530
sixty minutes yeah we had some
discussion but did we get to the point

557
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,490
now

558
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:33,420
crucial far success of what we call the
weather was assessed Minister supply

559
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,960
which has to be enforced by what I write
our

560
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,570
I mean there are some ground rules but
those Broncos

561
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:44,360
applied conference calls anyway so stave
off in time

562
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,770
remain Golia goal-oriented at and

563
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:51,190
a for the risk assessment governance
malt

564
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:54,900
risk assessment and now a methodology
DRIA

565
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,380
its absolutely essential that one does
not issue

566
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:02,050
all weekend discusses another call no we
can't

567
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:08,040
we have together we sought out of a
given exercise

568
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,560
then there has to be some equipment on
the question you might recall

569
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,550
risk assessment and governance mode on
such a question

570
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:20,850
that can be how does the rest change if
we introduce some architectural

571
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:24,850
change is it better to goal play a or b

572
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:28,380
if the goal way be on one of the

573
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:32,160
wall which of two free give when duce

574
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,360
I'll would be the best option ask farrah

575
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,180
a risk mitigating say picture

576
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,460
this question has to be agreed on
beforehand

577
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:46,470
which usually happens outside the call
by some key players

578
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:50,640
and I am it has to be with me dollar

579
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,900
wind ups a spreadsheet to all the stuff
a spreadsheet base

580
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,290
some a terrace say field that s

581
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:01,330
explicitly labeled question to be on set
by this exercise

582
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:04,970
then on there has to be some agreement
on

583
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:08,540
I D S et itself what's what's the scope

584
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:12,160
what kind of date are I'll be looking at

585
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,210
when thinking about the risks

586
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:19,710
and what other security objectives of
this they tell all requirements

587
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:23,260
if there are any say exxon adulation
kicking in

588
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,370
and which other frats we are going to
couple

589
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:30,310
obviously fought a governance Mon
uttering a question

590
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:34,130
in most cases that does not make sense
going to love

591
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:37,560
fret cuddle like taking the up

592
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:42,010
in the appendix of I 227 all five
testified catalog there is some

593
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:46,510
the German in for a sec people you might
know there are some PC

594
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:50,290
iffy items catalog: desk on church says
so we're for

595
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:54,450
some hun that number us of so-called if
Seattle and

596
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:57,800
I which not high number of them might

597
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,450
not be well want to add a scenario just

598
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:05,800
discuss at a at a given point at all so

599
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,000
taking this approach does not walk agree
on the frats

600
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,710
which is usually done by means of a
moderating

601
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:16,890
what a way to collecting the president
wants and

602
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:20,430
picking on from some key players and
picking

603
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:24,890
5-foot-10 to be covered some

604
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:28,100
I'll again their formulation of the
question

605
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,500
that is a crucial point

606
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,800
on as an example the question might be
here

607
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,980
I guess two case studies in a sec and in
one of those case studies the question

608
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,480
what

609
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,790
was what are the main risks and the rest
Delta

610
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:46,980
between hot was a softball I covered a
case study in a sec

611
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:51,830
but this is a typical question far a
rapid risk assessment

612
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:55,280
the s at up to be protected at San

613
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,180
a to be kept in mind to do in the
exercise was corporate

614
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:03,240
netbook housing of the corporate network

615
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:08,280
well all the corporate data live anti
security objectives for DS at work

616
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:13,030
quite simple ones given that generic
nature yes

617
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:16,750
I'll what usually comes into play as
well

618
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:21,290
s formulating assumptions like narrowing
the scope

619
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:24,400
%uh in that case what are the main

620
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,840
wrists I'll between hard and soft all
San that

621
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:32,290
some environments token based
authentication was used for remote

622
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,450
access

623
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:36,500
so one had to agree on remote access for
who

624
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,150
by what kind of from laptop saw

625
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:44,210
what kind of systems by what kind of
technology

626
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:48,820
I am in the in a given sample 18 weighed
on SSL VPN so

627
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:52,440
having the same over there was probably
not be sector I V

628
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,710
to Julie might still be out there were
for that a ser

629
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:58,970
a good assumption but still it was
formulated

630
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:03,570
so it was clear to everybody in Walworth
no discussions

631
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:09,720
on say to are well you are security
posts of a given

632
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,820
of a given protocol

633
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:16,610
and up yes at some I already gave

634
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:22,320
that example I gave the example on the
security objectives

635
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,990
I this mites silent a very simple

636
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:29,670
law neglected bill believe me it isn't

637
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:32,820
think about that remote access and now

638
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,850
when I got into this PS so

639
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:39,570
there was lots of discussions in a
lengthy conference calls with lots of

640
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:41,120
people and

641
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,640
lot of confusion and they did not even
agree

642
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,030
on which security object if to protect

643
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:51,470
there were people like you're bringing
up okay well um

644
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:56,230
but then what about it did the US attack
against CV

645
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:59,320
with the end gate race which is a valid
question

646
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:02,680
but as far talking about some

647
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:06,050
the difference of authentication methods

648
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:09,360
heart was a soft holes source

649
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,490
doesn't make sense I'll to talk about to
discuss

650
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:17,560
availability of VPN gateways if
availability

651
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,880
is/are as a crucial points a yet and
that we consider it

652
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:28,150
but given this asset we we had in that
case corporate data

653
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:33,270
their confidentiality and integrity had
to be protect

654
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:36,900
again on last point to agree on

655
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,430
before going into the actual exercise
yes so which

656
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:43,970
frets are going to pick up

657
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:47,030
this means that during the exercise
itself

658
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:51,050
doing say sexy on the 20 min at
conference call

659
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:55,780
its usually it's not allowed to bring in
additional threats

660
00:42:55,780 --> 00:43:00,090
which was some I mean you're might and
your organization

661
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:03,270
you might know the was a very paranoid

662
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:07,550
some type of guy thinking about all

663
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:13,420
freaky kinds of stuff happening or what
but what if there was somebody who

664
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:17,580
rootkits a machine and we place a sua I
A T E

665
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:22,790
a PC I'll d Microsoft a PC components

666
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:26,560
that is a that that is an attack lacked
off I hot off at

667
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,990
about black hat 2010 somewhere

668
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:34,740
on maybe you are not that type of guy

669
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:38,990
point this the threat might not be too
relevant

670
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:42,030
them I P frets that a much more Island
soul

671
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:45,230
on this might be a bit disappointing

672
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:49,020
like having somebody per year but weak
tit up there was that fancy new attack

673
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:49,780
method

674
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:55,270
yes sir I'll maybe there is but a place
we agreed on before hand on the frats to

675
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:55,990
become a lot

676
00:43:55,990 --> 00:44:01,270
by some key players we won't discuss
your fancy new attack like to hear

677
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:05,620
armed about this again might cause some
disappointment

678
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:10,300
but s necessary together we side

679
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:14,050
so to give you an idea how this stuff
works

680
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:18,260
I'll tell you some notes about to

681
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:22,840
case studies so Force One guys from
environment some

682
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,960
I is somehow walk in and Levy

683
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,430
we brought this methodology and no

684
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:32,940
which is a very large corporation

685
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:36,310
obviously I won't give your name but in
their own understanding they are one of

686
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:38,530
the largest corporations of the Walt

687
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:42,110
so they a lot I and

688
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:47,580
out there are a whole IT infrastructure
are large pieces of their infrastructure

689
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:49,670
alt sauced

690
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:53,420
they are currently since two years in a
transition process from 10 it's also to

691
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:54,740
another one

692
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:58,070
they have a high degree of global
dispersion which means the InfoSec

693
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:58,600
people

694
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,660
a different time zones on different
continents

695
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:05,740
and there are I environment can be
characterized with the acronym

696
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:09,230
some of you might notice I don't see
maybe 2 p.m. entry if you want to know

697
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:10,400
what to

698
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,830
the UCA mean someone that I'll uncertain
chaotic biggest some

699
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:18,930
yes maybe I'm talking about your
organization here

700
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:21,970
arm so

701
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:26,140
reality and women that some

702
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:30,190
in itself complex pace there was a la
noche

703
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:35,470
role projects going on now walking there
from

704
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:39,590
usually in their business case for
walking on the million

705
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:43,050
all our a scale

706
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:46,290
to enhance User experience for for
remote access

707
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:49,470
to say arm

708
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:52,760
diminish the to time to get

709
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,990
email foreign

710
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:59,590
say somebody'll was not a complete
network from ninety seconds

711
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:04,290
thirty-seconds I to enhance all types of

712
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:08,070
farm remote access need at

713
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:12,240
will that be fights on Versus with SSL
VPN setup I P sec once

714
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,070
and one point win this was a discussion
shortly replace

715
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:20,500
hot token spice of talks I issue most of
you

716
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:24,640
have an idea what I mean him a hot
topless although some

717
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:29,900
I hours a style a star for giving in %uh
much we typed into soft organza same

718
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,640
piece running as a softer on

719
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:36,300
on on a laptop and obviously there were
items were in for a sec people

720
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:40,500
the paranoid one study of all what what
but wait to if it running on a PC

721
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,900
it's not that secures as a Sat been
before

722
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:47,880
which a gave lots of discussions and
there was a business case

723
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:52,090
if they do this we can save a three
million dollars a year

724
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:55,220
all which made it a bit difficult to say
the least 20

725
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:58,440
for sick people are you against

726
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,550
so are when I k man

727
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:06,720
arm on there have been lots of
conference calls with lots of players

728
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,270
lots of time had been a waste that

729
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:13,950
with all kinds of discussions and good
and bad and older attack back to us and

730
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:15,260
yet cost savings and

731
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:19,580
all the stuff there was a kind of stock
situation

732
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:22,910
and the possible brought me n was the

733
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:26,010
to some degree of by business by the
project

734
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:29,560
and by the business on us to prepare

735
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:33,640
a decision paper should be replace

736
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:38,950
hot topless pics of topless on nought of
what this that there's a risk

737
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:42,960
so be prepared an hour a all my father
some key players of tea

738
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,450
or process on free people

739
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:49,930
we had a 60-minute conference call some
email exchange so

740
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:55,550
we identified irrelevant rats and then
we went into the IRA itself

741
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:59,640
showed that in the second all love a
people and left in a two-hour conference

742
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,210
call

743
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:03,930
and be managed to get out

744
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:07,390
a failed out I risk assessments I

745
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:11,740
covering of all a farm in traps

746
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:16,050
and their risk that does a risk up
between nom

747
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:19,850
a hot tubs and now in the soft option
our I want discusses numbers obviously

748
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:20,580
day

749
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:25,860
vary from they a largely connected with
Teddy environment itself into

750
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:29,170
lots of parameters point it s

751
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:33,370
this one if the CLI up indication

752
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:36,700
I'll which of the are preps change

753
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:40,650
as for the risk and to what degree do
that double law is so it's a

754
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:44,710
just a slight change so providing this
back

755
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:49,530
to the project was immediately out for
like a look at this look at the numbers

756
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:51,110
okay there's two things

757
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:54,610
to take care of tote things that
decrease

758
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:58,250
as Claudia a security posts are

759
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:01,430
they decrease so some degree antia

760
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:05,100
contributing factors can be found here I
see impact our

761
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:08,190
face the same both fronts and

762
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:11,500
guess what business came back to us ask
the

763
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,830
like okay now we understand before you
had all that

764
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:18,450
are Foggia a discussions some

765
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:23,200
now we understand what autumn analysts
and to what degree they change

766
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:27,780
we understand that a security post shit
goes down so please provide

767
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:32,960
we still want to realize that Fri 25
million cost savings please provide

768
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,450
I get some give us some ideas on
compensating controls

769
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:40,590
provide some number us what the company
controls costs and to what degree

770
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:46,060
they change their risk scale us all we
had to be identified some

771
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:49,940
compensating controls I

772
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:53,310
I had another exercise which was easy
same people

773
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:57,050
same methodology same frets we just had
to

774
00:49:57,050 --> 00:50:01,520
to tackle some of the promised us that
was an easy go 60 min a conference call

775
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,070
and after that we got %ah lot iffy apply
to

776
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:08,580
main Tom compensating controls that i'm
happy to discuss

777
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:11,800
offline kind of I'll

778
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,380
the overall risks associated with to

779
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:19,130
on relevant right some can be would you
list

780
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:22,990
to these non lies which are worse than
the 80s

781
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:27,220
but still much better than those a solo
provided to us

782
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:32,570
a good compromise of from realize cost
savings while at same time

783
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:35,740
I keeping a reason we've never of

784
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:39,610
somebody decided on this a reasonable
level of risk and all the stuff none

785
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:40,170
last

786
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:45,420
in a transfer and way two-and-a-half
cessation take in this is exactly what

787
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:48,840
risk analysis softball a

788
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:53,390
second case study that is sound a global
manufacturing

789
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:57,210
company again it's our not a small shop

790
00:50:57,210 --> 00:51:00,500
and 18 of to business s they have a high
degree of innovation

791
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:04,170
hi I amount of we saw suspend on

792
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:08,080
research and development which means
they have a lot of

793
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:12,400
joint venture us although when Walt I
every year they acquire

794
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,320
number of smaller companies that
specialize on some technology

795
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:20,080
all which they want to get hold of our

796
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:24,680
they have a lot of hate and some and a I
have heavy participation in the FICON

797
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,510
sauce

798
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:29,619
and they have a network security policy

799
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:33,810
which state something like on if an
untrusted network

800
00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:37,380
let's connect that this has to be done
by is two states firewall

801
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:41,630
such file this might sound familiar some
of you

802
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:45,770
I'll problem is some yet this does not
walk

803
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:49,270
where we well in the possible the
business saw

804
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:53,560
there's a question which which looks on
process up to the industry PS

805
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:57,350
of the our recently acquired such CDOs
and business

806
00:51:57,350 --> 00:52:01,050
kept asking like oh wait well we have a
hundred percent to

807
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:04,230
of to share us why do we we got him a
SunTrust

808
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:08,330
I why why can't be stopped are with
their joint development process and

809
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:10,310
using development facilities

810
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:14,420
just by just because US the security
guys tell us that you want to

811
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:18,780
I'll place a double stage hire one there
with the two months are

812
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:22,520
deployment process I

813
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,660
are so business

814
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:29,050
and Colts was not too delighted for

815
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:32,700
the delay Sun tea or hassle to some

816
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:37,290
stuff brought was brought in there and

817
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:41,190
I want me to get to we suggest that's
iris pace approach

818
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:44,440
like in case an X on a netbook gets
connected

819
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:48,780
a former risk analysis and depending on
the outcome of the risk analysis decide

820
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:49,710
if

821
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:54,010
the exxon that was connected to provide
any additional controls without file on

822
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:57,830
up with a single file law we have a say
um

823
00:52:57,830 --> 00:53:01,070
a quick to connection depending on the
risk analysis

824
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:04,210
and that risk analysis performed by
means of an hour a

825
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:07,619
I'll means performed quickly

826
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:11,610
I which assessed exactly what we did so
we try to find out till

827
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:15,619
who idea relevant Parsons that one was a
bit difficult like bring the right

828
00:53:15,619 --> 00:53:16,910
process I'll

829
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:20,080
into a conference call especially as
some other

830
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:24,330
the case study here was on a joint
venture with a company in

831
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:27,420
the Emirates which

832
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,470
%ah they had some specifics as father

833
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:33,680
connectivity options and and stuff

834
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,800
I and they had a different type of
organization

835
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:41,140
it wasn't like a is he saying okay who
is your network security responsible

836
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:42,800
posse

837
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:48,520
who can tell are some give us an idea of
two stuff and be part of the discussion

838
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:51,970
up but I we have to hope that the next
time

839
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:55,650
we we need such an exercise sent I mean
there has been no

840
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:58,950
another one in the meantime this what

841
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:02,340
much faster as we had the experience of
identifying

842
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:05,700
well apostles the exercise itself

843
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,990
what's up evolved into a conference call

844
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:13,670
which went surprisingly smooth of given
they have not too much

845
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:17,970
risk assessment experience my
operational for this s

846
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:22,000
they an engineering company on and
engineers

847
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,970
tend to have a something that time allow
it to you

848
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:30,300
from the kind of numeric number based
approach of

849
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:34,700
from and and calculating started
probabilities

850
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:38,240
so that one locked surprisingly well

851
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:42,540
it gave an interesting we saw a touch on
the next some a slight

852
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:46,710
I which can be broken down the
traditional approach

853
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:50,150
prescribe a policy introduce a on

854
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:54,190
at Thomas H Y Y would have provided any
protection as for the relevant risks

855
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:58,670
anyway and the business was very happy

856
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:03,000
with the way how this was handled not
going to a lengthy

857
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:09,050
I discussion with associated process of
deploying a firewall and filing

858
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:12,130
risk acceptance in all that over hat

859
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:15,300
I'll and was like um

860
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:18,420
we try to identify the ten main

861
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:22,910
frat saw a those of you who are very
accurate

862
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:26,380
some familiar with the methodology might
know term

863
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:30,470
the Sun not very exact rats we had to
formulate a min away

864
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:34,790
people understood to I assay

865
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:38,050
network connection the new network
connection leading to opportunities of

866
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:39,570
eavesdropping

867
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:43,840
arms this is not exactly a frat it's a
kind of a mix of a friend in the

868
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,920
viability

869
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:49,310
but that left the site we discuss those
10 points

870
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:55,470
the figure at me put them into phnom dos
and be very immediately able to spot

871
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:58,850
where r to relevant risks arris

872
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:02,740
from the plan data connection which was
in the space on

873
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:08,000
okay targeted attacks are a leaving that
aside assess a special subject to in

874
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,290
itself anyway but

875
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:15,410
down it turned out to that the
engineering data that was some

876
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:20,200
flowing between the two entities I

877
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:24,290
I was on encrypt that a it was exchanged
by means of

878
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:29,170
FTP Chace and it was a I mean it was so
some kind of from

879
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:32,850
a prepared engineering data but all this
levy

880
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:35,990
transporting this full some laying

881
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:40,290
can some other condo real are what we
got it

882
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:43,960
us dangerous at a sane

883
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:48,170
time out to be the case for on the white
laces our regulations

884
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:51,250
some say that we detente

885
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:55,160
I'll a professional background of some
engineers had to be a

886
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:59,480
on transfer out to the Emirates and the
Emirates a snow-covered

887
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:03,480
by at time and they are still not

888
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,490
covered by your you'll

889
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:10,970
I'll a crop protection as for personal
date are

890
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:14,520
and given that was a joint venture that
was not the installment of so-called

891
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,810
binding corporate rules and yeah so now

892
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:22,450
arm what up what it what effect would
have fared at the bus 85 while

893
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:26,040
hat on on these threats on on these
relevant risks

894
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:29,180
non still on on it but that

895
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:33,400
are I am connection

896
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,510
of course one could have quit that could
say okay

897
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:40,890
Iowa way for some BPM capabilities but
then again discussion about costs and

898
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:44,830
and whatever up take the course a point
loss

899
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:48,170
we've already identified a relevant
risks and

900
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:51,920
rapid way to understand okay if you do
this

901
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,630
we have to take care of our these pieces
and all this happened

902
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:58,500
I mean there was some pre walk but all
this happened in a two-hour conference

903
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,869
call

904
00:58:00,869 --> 00:58:03,960
up there was some lessons lon some

905
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:07,220
ice get to those quite quickly

906
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:11,790
I it turned out that joint understanding
of the scope and yes it is paramount

907
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:17,240
I all I mentioned this already but we'll
on death some

908
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:20,350
there's always people who have not done
their homework even if

909
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:25,740
in at once of an exercise we we sent
like okay yes architecture diagram yes

910
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:28,400
the classification of data

911
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,840
people don't weakness and then it is
like one is in the conference call into

912
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,980
there was somebody all yellow but once a
day to process

913
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:39,990
you got an email address and I can find
the right now can you show this

914
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:45,550
and then the pre cent of on the starts a
sightseeing and some local Chace

915
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:50,500
and this circus time at staying on time
is crucial

916
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:55,350
so having all this for the present I
like it can't pop up immediately

917
00:58:55,350 --> 00:58:58,690
okay yesterday that has vacation yes and
have a diagram

918
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:02,050
I outside the same as for the
methodology

919
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:07,400
at all like providing I'm a simple
diagram KVN this stage we talk about

920
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,890
some

921
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:12,380
frats that's a bad thing that can happen
after this we talk about the viability

922
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:13,730
saw a given

923
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:17,420
to buy or build effectively given frat
on

924
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:20,990
on one page Shah that can be faded and
immediately

925
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:24,200
arm turned out to be useful

926
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:29,330
same to some degree some underlying
material to rate the likelihood of a

927
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:30,050
fret

928
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:35,160
how likely is it that say some
application exit gets exploited at

929
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:38,920
doesn't happen often does not happen
often August of

930
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:42,010
have it pre paid out and have it in the
hands of the

931
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:46,950
present our that was one of the main
lessons we learned of

932
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:50,830
these exercises so to summarize risk
assessment

933
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:55,640
I hope you got the message is a central
many organizations fail to implement it

934
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:58,680
in an efficient usable way

935
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:02,590
and what we call the Riau which in
itself as for the numbers in Taylors

936
01:00:02,590 --> 01:00:07,800
s nothing special a spell might be a bit
particular see approach

937
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:12,200
of breaking down to relevant rats and to
prepare it in a way that it can be

938
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,900
handled in the 12 conference call

939
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:18,220
this one was seeing a late development

940
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:25,220
thank you for your time

941
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:30,300
so I don't want to serve as a bad
example of going over time

942
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:35,650
arm still I mean it's our coffee break
knowledge soul

943
01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:39,760
I'd say Canada take two questions so if
there are any

944
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,980
but i'm happier as you can imagine I
know on anyway

945
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:46,310
all the time so feel free to approach me
and that I whitman

946
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:49,380
at any given point of time I'll

947
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:56,380
okay to sell question victim

948
01:01:01,810 --> 01:01:04,810
yeah I mean it's a usually up there was
some

949
01:01:04,810 --> 01:01:08,470
say locations where you can choose us
they are

950
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:12,880
I'll part of the process anyway on

951
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:16,810
that was the case in the first case
study that those eight to 10 play us

952
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:21,270
in the conference call I'll we could not
exclude anybody like okay you you

953
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:24,310
khan contributed and we should bring
about a opossum and

954
01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:27,820
a in that situation that was not
possible

955
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:32,180
on pot to have a good a number of us

956
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:35,170
I mean it depends on the say
communication skills and communication

957
01:01:35,170 --> 01:01:36,450
discipline especially

958
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:40,270
conference cause of the people aiight
say I

959
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:44,410
law then but an on

960
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:48,260
might not be helpful depends on the time
on my

961
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:52,490
one can easily assign okay we have 12
people we should assume there's more

962
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:53,900
questions more discussion

963
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:58,869
even if we try to streamline this there
is always people who lives on that

964
01:01:58,869 --> 01:02:02,849
not being used to being streamlined are
you shouldn't do so for political

965
01:02:02,849 --> 01:02:04,150
reasons

966
01:02:04,150 --> 01:02:07,440
so then the planned freal us a set of 2

967
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:11,210
I'd say six to 10 people at maximum

968
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:14,420
as a good number there should be some

969
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:19,450
obviously a somewhat somebody percent in
the information security perspective

970
01:02:19,450 --> 01:02:23,960
them must be somebody a at least

971
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:27,570
usually two to three persons
representing the business perspective St

972
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:28,930
InfoSec guys

973
01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:33,750
tend to get lost in their own power
unlike discussions somewhat have our

974
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:38,599
and it helps our if there was business
people saying that yeah I guys by weight

975
01:02:38,599 --> 01:02:44,040
wait wait wait we want to do we want to
I get this deployed and three months

976
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:47,339
and we want to realize some cost savings
are

977
01:02:47,339 --> 01:02:51,390
I'll please so we can say they are all
angle and this one

978
01:02:51,390 --> 01:02:55,609
so business some I in for a sec

979
01:02:55,609 --> 01:03:00,580
a legal our compliance on depending on
the kind of data that this is cost so

980
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:02,109
this is very important

981
01:03:02,109 --> 01:03:06,800
and I mean depending on the environment
some might be different

982
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:09,980
entities like a outsourcing party a
business units

983
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:14,480
this is the usual mix there was not a
question

984
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:21,480
was that one okay

985
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:28,589
yeah I mean on there is some depending
on the organization

986
01:03:28,589 --> 01:03:31,700
find the right people so they have a

987
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:34,830
authority that we site is considered to
run

988
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:37,859
a ballot that SL crucial point I mean

989
01:03:37,859 --> 01:03:41,330
it's not so it might be easy to get a

990
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:45,560
a people on some birds upon the exercise

991
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:49,960
but to have the to resize have
credibility

992
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:55,290
and not being like I'll but ramallah
business unit nobody was a

993
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:59,359
was stale that's why we don't accept the
this are we saw it on

994
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:04,490
that is a crucial point aunt the
question trying to figure out the

995
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:05,109
question

996
01:04:05,109 --> 01:04:08,330
reminding people like what we do here

997
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:12,450
