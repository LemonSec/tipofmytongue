1
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,080
thanks very much in a and thanks for
having me so

2
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,320
you can't and I'm not feeling nervous
because I'm

3
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,690
speaker for the defense track without
trying to get through this as painlessly

4
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,420
as possible

5
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,620
so today's talk

6
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,230
it's going to be about social
engineering now

7
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,699
before I love you decide to get up and
walk downstairs

8
00:00:47,699 --> 00:00:51,199
to the attack track a please note that
I'm

9
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,260
very sensitive about these things and if
you must walk away

10
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,979
delay my back is turned otherwise I
might start crying but

11
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:04,040
a so social engineering is actually a
very important part

12
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,940
of this presentation you will see why

13
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:13,479
as we go along because because of the
nature of the BlackBerry device itself

14
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:18,630
okay so social engineering as a love you
are probably familiar with is

15
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:24,159
up that's the clever manipulation the
natural human tendency to trust

16
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,409
so as humans we are naturally a

17
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:30,600
we naturally feel like trusting the
other person

18
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,109
social engineering is a way in which you
manipulate the person into

19
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:39,740
either giving information that you
require or into doing something

20
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,009
that you want him to do nice thought a

21
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:48,539
to talk recently by British journalist
misha glenny where he give the technical

22
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:50,159
term for social engineering as

23
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,280
there's one born every minute so
essentially this is true because this

24
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,829
this extends to there's a sucker born
every minute so a very important point

25
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:02,630
you know as as all of us in the IT
security community no

26
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,829
social innings probably regarded as the
hack that

27
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:11,350
works every time arm because no matter
what kind of secure device that you have

28
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:15,480
or secure device that you use a there's
always a chance that you're gonna get

29
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,800
own right a you can have the most secure
device encryption somebody comes up to

30
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,500
you your family with the gun and knife

31
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,720
you gonna give me a password so there
are various

32
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,290
stages obviously social engineering but
it's important to keep in mind the this

33
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,410
this hack pretty much works every time
okay

34
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,500
so I want to start off by telling into
the

35
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,630
bit of a story but when I did this story
at

36
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,330
Malaysia um everybody came up to me
after that

37
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,710
said you just stories six-story really
sucked so I'm not gonna go into the full

38
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:52,630
full details a bit a just way looking at
a picture of Singapore Airlines plane

39
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,250
it's because

40
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,800
last year I lost my blackberry in
Singapore Singapore Airport

41
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,750
and I'm not obviously going into the
details because

42
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,090
people don't seem to like story anymore
I but a

43
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,100
just just for the record I i did. own

44
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:12,800
and a I lost my blackberry into and just
got me thinking with even though I'd

45
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,030
replace the phone and

46
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,740
a matter of two days five six hundred
dollars the data

47
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,360
on my phone was actually something that
mattered a lot

48
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,960
to me at that point sure I had a backup
maybe

49
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,250
it was about a week's worth of data that
I lost um

50
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,090
but the these days I mean

51
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,190
especially in the last year was the end
of the last year in

52
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,580
obviously this year mobile computing is
getting a lot

53
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,110
a lot of importance um it's more
propellant

54
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,320
I'm people tend to live their lives I
live my life from my blackberry

55
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,900
and I'm effectively cripple because my
roaming with data roaming doesn't work

56
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,010
at this point

57
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,270
feeling a bit weird but I'm coping

58
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:59,580
but the the whole point is a people tend
to

59
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,390
to do everything on their mobiles and
with this talk I'll

60
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,470
I want to bring some important stewards
um

61
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:09,500
E some

62
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,890
some threats that you can experience
you're gonna

63
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:16,289
encounter a using a mobile and

64
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:19,669
some things to think about essentially
okay

65
00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:23,530
so as you've probably establish I'm a
big fan of

66
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:29,080
the BlackBerry device itself arm I
mainly like it because

67
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,900
a few features that ago um its it's got
push email

68
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,030
obviously everyone knows that a no I
don't know what kind of penetration

69
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,090
blackberries have is a is a E

70
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:44,460
is it more on the individual side or is
it more cooperates that it's in Germany

71
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,210
corporates have year

72
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,620
because in in no in Indonesia I'm

73
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,680
I'm originally from Sri Lanka but I live
and work in

74
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,949
in Indonesia in Indonesia you'd find
16-year-old girls having blackberries

75
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:02,960
a its huge people people use it a lot

76
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,580
for a for the messenger the building
blackberry messenger

77
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,539
I there's a lot of attrition for the
individual known in in Asia as well just

78
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:14,259
wanted to get a feel of what it's like a
big here

79
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:18,009
I'll so a a that that's

80
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:22,389
not really too much of a concern but
once a wanted to start picking up

81
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:26,169
you should be aware the threats that
League

82
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:29,310
okay so push email let's one thing I
like about it

83
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,509
when my mail comes and I get it like an
SMS I don't have to pull the

84
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:36,069
mail server every 30 minutes it's got a
very nice keyboard

85
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:39,520
want to get to know it can type pretty
fast

86
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,449
keys a good to and more to the point of
this stock

87
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:48,029
Rd granular security controls transport
level security

88
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:52,900
and the device encryption which I'll go
into in a little bit more detail

89
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,419
okay I'll started with granular controls

90
00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:00,210
no the BlackBerry device

91
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:05,849
comes with a lot of built-in capability
to secure the device

92
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:09,719
here talking from a individual
perspective not a blackberry connected

93
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:11,419
to the enterprise network

94
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:15,060
um one of those things which you can do
is

95
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,610
allow for the night access two programs

96
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,860
let me rephrase that: allow or deny
programs to access

97
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,669
certain areas if your data so if you
have a set of applications that you want

98
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:27,330
to prevent

99
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,919
accessing maybe your contacts maybe your
email you can do that its built-in you

100
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:32,120
don't have to do anything

101
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,699
extra a similarly

102
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:39,990
loving an application to work with
another application so for example if

103
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,770
you had an application that wanted to
access your phone application in with

104
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,259
your Gmail application

105
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:47,930
you can prevent it from from doing so if
you so wish

106
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,289
lastly is the connectivity so

107
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:54,550
here upset Internet connectivity is all
it also applies to Bluetooth

108
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,629
connectivity

109
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:59,719
so you can a lovely night permission for
applications access

110
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:04,529
you the Internet or any other sorts of
connectivity

111
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:09,210
no I'll again this comes built in you
don't have to really

112
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:14,249
by any separate tools to do is that this
is one of the reasons why

113
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:17,909
iight and to favor the BlackBerry more
no

114
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:21,439
moving on to transport security

115
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:25,169
um so

116
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:28,680
normally when you access the Internet

117
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,620
on a blackberry your

118
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,900
traffic doesn't go directly to the web
server itself

119
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,139
as a matter fact it takes the spot where
it goes through your service provider

120
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:45,089
down to a server farm in rem the makers
of blackberry

121
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:48,349
and it's the servers in those server
farms

122
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:52,120
in that some fun that accesses the web
server for you

123
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,680
then it brings it back reformat it to to
your screen it sends it back to your

124
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,210
blackberry now if you notice

125
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,319
the circuit between your hand held in
the room server farm

126
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:07,020
is encrypt um this is a good thing

127
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,569
because obviously anybody in between

128
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:14,009
you and the server farming and cannot
see

129
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:17,129
your requests that you make your any of
the data that you're going through

130
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:20,210
and this is applicable even to http a

131
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,219
connections so I

132
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:26,949
in that sense I'm safe in the knowledge
that the telecom

133
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:29,210
doesn't know

134
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,560
what I'm browsing what I do in terms of

135
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:38,339
accessing my blackberry know I know the
Canadians can probably see it a

136
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:41,459
if they've so wished I know there have
been cases have been doing that

137
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:44,410
but I really don't mind the Canadians
looking at my email because I mean let's

138
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:44,890
face it

139
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,140
when have you ever heard of a Canadian
starting a war or

140
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,660
a Canadian coming up to you right so a

141
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,870
I'm okay with that the third

142
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:00,980
point iOS device encryption

143
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,459
no most people don't enable this but

144
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:08,510
you could if you wanted to you can
enable the device encryption

145
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:12,770
on your BlackBerry so that your data a

146
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:16,640
remains effectively remains only on your
device

147
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,880
if you try to move uninterested

148
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,880
micro SD card to another black
reiterated if

149
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,540
encryption and is an able you won't be
able to do that similarly fierce

150
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,020
your phone is stolen and they try to
take it apart chip level

151
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:35,160
and maybe read it that way still no good
because they won't be able to get past

152
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:35,660
the

153
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,920
the encryption that is built-in so

154
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,140
these are pretty much

155
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,209
well the the reasons why I tend to favor
the Blackberry and and and

156
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:50,380
I mean it it goes to show that the
BlackBerry

157
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,579
is one of the most secure smart phones
out there on the market

158
00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:57,529
today arm I A

159
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:01,270
want it all to maybe do a comparison
with more and more popular phones out

160
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:01,610
there

161
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:05,899
so I picked the iPhone last year did a
search for vulnerabilities on

162
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:10,630
each other handhelds to do a comparison
and this is what

163
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,360
I was able to come up with so

164
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,770
the to motor abilities on the blackberry
and actually one of those

165
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:19,810
vulnerabilities is not

166
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:23,370
even the vulnerabilities just the way
the handheld handles

167
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,950
alerts for certificates with no
characters in the common name

168
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:33,500
so this is a bit all the date I'm sure
this has gone up the value for the

169
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,990
iPhone is going up because I think

170
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,600
lately there was a German researcher who
discovered a bug

171
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,520
in the opening up an mp4 file so you
could have an mp4 file

172
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,720
specially crafted and if the iPhone
opened it you could take control of

173
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,320
somebody now

174
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,839
I'll so this is another point to
illustrate I mean I have nothing against

175
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:57,110
the iPhone I love the iPhone I have one
as well

176
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:00,910
but just to show you that the BlackBerry
pretty pretty secure

177
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,029
in comparison okay

178
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:09,490
so for it

179
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:13,140
to have established the security but
I'll

180
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,730
justice to go back to that fact that
people live their lives on their mobile

181
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,300
phones

182
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,000
the the most important thing you're
gonna find in somebody's phone is

183
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,110
is that data um one thing that

184
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,370
you could attack a phone for is actually

185
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:32,220
hornet and maybe try to build a mobile
booklet with the maybe that's something

186
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,959
on research in the future but for now

187
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:37,490
what's most important is the user's
personal information

188
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,680
a sure gonna bring somebody down to his
knees

189
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,070
I'd pretty much go after the phone
because it has not just

190
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,790
a maybe

191
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,230
information that users on a daily basis
in his corporate life but also

192
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:54,670
maybe his personal picked up personal
information like for example

193
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:58,130
personal pictures may be naughty
pictures with his girl a boyfriend

194
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:02,199
private text messages which maybe should
have been sending to other people

195
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:06,230
then you can move on to the corporate
side where he has emails with

196
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:11,339
contract contractual information maybe
secretary emailed him a contract with

197
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:15,510
figures boss was it such a and of course

198
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:20,770
up phone call logs who has been calling
and

199
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:25,720
what time has been making those calls et
cetera so

200
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,839
I was an attack I mean this is exactly
what I'm gonna go after

201
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:32,630
right a will leave the booklets

202
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,850
alone for now I'm just gonna gonna go
after his personal information

203
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:39,040
but to do that there are few problems
which

204
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,089
again I covered earlier I really act The
Black Parade

205
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:46,329
because there are only two well
abilities and one of them is not really

206
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:47,470
a vulnerability after all

207
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:52,569
so eagerly hackett no use for
vulnerabilities we can sniff the traffic

208
00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:53,130
because

209
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:57,920
as we've all known as we all know the
transport layer security will take about

210
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,900
problems they come

211
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,920
release if traffic you could the

212
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,250
steal it but then you know you're gonna

213
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,130
go to the point where good actually
confronting a point a gun giving your

214
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:10,490
phone

215
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,140
you know you could still much better
things by doing that and the

216
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,550
also going to defeat the purpose because
you really don't wanna make contact with

217
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,350
your

218
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:22,760
target before and also if he has enabled
device encryption then

219
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,959
even stealing in stock okay so

220
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,660
public the personal information out

221
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:37,130
its chock-full love these good juicy
bits of information but

222
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:40,540
soon as it leaves the phone it's a trip
to 10 minutes on the phone it's occur

223
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,720
but there's one point on the phone

224
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,569
a when the date is in the clear and that
point

225
00:13:47,569 --> 00:13:50,680
is when the user is actually looking at
this

226
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,209
so if we can find a way to catch the
data of that phone

227
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:58,800
when he is looking at it when it's in
the clear we can take a copy of that

228
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,970
send it to wherever we want right so

229
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,780
we don't have to worry about the man in
the middle we don't have to worry about

230
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,540
transport level security

231
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:11,170
a vulnerability is anything we just need
to get something into his phone

232
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:15,600
that will enable us to collect

233
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,079
this data from the phone and send it
somewhere else so

234
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:22,800
arm I'll explain how

235
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,459
and give you some examples of of of how
we can do that

236
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:30,610
um but first the as I think everyone is
aware

237
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,390
when you have an operating system or I'm

238
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,110
language we're going to develop
something for mobile platform for

239
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,990
example

240
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,339
your that the developer will give you
set up the PA's

241
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,670
and BlackBerry is no exception there

242
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,779
there's a rich set of application
programming interface

243
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:50,800
methods available and even though

244
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,089
the is written in Java there's a

245
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:58,180
you can go don't know pretty low level
by using

246
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,890
these APIs and while these APIs are not
really

247
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:04,970
gear to to help you spy on people

248
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:10,800
with a little bit of creativity you can
actually make use of these APIs and

249
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,720
collect the information that you want so
a cover for your peers in a few

250
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,380
scenarios and then maybe give you some

251
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,569
some demonstrations as well up for those
of you who are feeling brave enough to

252
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:21,199
try

253
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:27,240
the program that arm to suffer text
messages

254
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,150
a to imagine the scenario where you want
to collect somebody's text messages

255
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:36,660
incoming and outgoing 'em you can easily
do that by setting up what is known as a

256
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,260
message listener

257
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:42,240
so this is just nothing but a a

258
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,029
a method that will sit there and wait to
get a notification saying

259
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:49,930
either an SMS message came in or one
went out so once

260
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:53,420
you set the listener you then set a bit
of code saying okay want to miss it

261
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,880
comes and goes out

262
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,910
just send me a copy to everyone

263
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,620
right I'll and how it works is

264
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,230
you have your listener setup on the
phone you

265
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,709
let's let's assume that we've already
got a spyware on the phone

266
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:12,300
so when a message comes in basically the
listener will

267
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,750
just take a copy of it send it off to
every that to another SMS mailbox or to

268
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,089
it

269
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:20,199
email address I'll and then display the

270
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:23,380
the message on the the uses for

271
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,959
now this is our transparent if you have
this by was set up

272
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,400
you don't have to you know it's
completely transparent to you

273
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,410
the user won't even notice a copy of the
mail for the SMS going out

274
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:38,439
right so it's also very similar

275
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:42,430
a you do a similar a similar thing for

276
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:45,959
email as well we set up a mess a
faultless I'll

277
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:49,170
discover that um in a little bit

278
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:53,910
so the topic has bugs and kisses the
idea was I wrote bugs which is the

279
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:57,309
snooping part and then kisses which is
the detection

280
00:16:57,309 --> 00:17:01,169
no I don't know how many of you feel
brave enough

281
00:17:01,169 --> 00:17:06,419
to try it I will tell you how to remove
it at the end of this presentation don't

282
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:07,429
worry

283
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:10,650
arm I would demonstrate myself but

284
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:14,140
sadly a like I said my roaming is

285
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,770
acting up so I'm not going to do that
right now is anybody willing to try

286
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:22,189
because what I did was I set up here

287
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:25,449
a wallop use if you will

288
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:29,690
the most i've you know at DEFCON you
have a wall of sheep where they collect

289
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:30,549
peoples

290
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:35,130
email user names and passwords so I set
up something similar where

291
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:38,140
arm whoever has bugs installed who were

292
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,760
you know when he sends and receives
email is a pretty much come up

293
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,870
on this the message body won't come up
but

294
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:48,370
who is sending it to the direction et
cetera will come up this is what I did

295
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:51,419
some tests which I did the

296
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:54,730
yesterday and today arm if nobody's

297
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,169
willing to give it a shot I'll just show
it to you on the simulator

298
00:17:58,169 --> 00:18:05,169
if you'll just bear with me for one
second

299
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:12,730
back

300
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,340
a problem okay so

301
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,750
a this is the simulator that are used to
develop

302
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:22,200
don't mind the

303
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,840
so I'll just try to

304
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:32,840
send an email to use so

305
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:39,090
waco present

306
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,770
please

307
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:46,000
so so

308
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,590
I mean this could be a scenario where
somebody sent

309
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:53,800
sent an email to no just

310
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,610
assume you sent it to some buddies
friends

311
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,680
with a little luck

312
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:07,680
so

313
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:16,410
okay maybe that's problem

314
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,770
yeah well anyway

315
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:26,480
the idea is a it should show up to right
clearly didn't

316
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,000
something wrong but the I mean

317
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,590
the into the presentation figures wish
come over can I can give you

318
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,560
some additional like individual if you
don't want to if you don't want to try

319
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,210
trade right now arm

320
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:45,210
kits on so

321
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:50,850
this is one of the ways in which

322
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:54,140
you can have the Trojan on your on your

323
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,480
device and with the helplessness

324
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,390
you'll be able to a basically harvest
emails

325
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:05,420
SMS messages from from

326
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:10,130
anybody who you've in fact I'll

327
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:14,270
I don't know if people have heard of a
program for phone snow

328
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:18,200
anybody no

329
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,200
it after a charity be in Malaysia

330
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,620
I released a program called for snow a

331
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:28,610
he was supposed to be a proof-of-concept
to and what it did was

332
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:32,040
loved somebody to call in and

333
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,370
remotely activate the microphone on the
phone and listening to and

334
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:38,410
ambient noise around the phone re-listed

335
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:42,530
it wasn't released Lt or anything like
that but it cause a bit of a weird

336
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:46,050
reception like us. certain the
Department of Homeland Security

337
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:50,030
should a whole buncha warnings to all
the users and and people

338
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:53,930
some other people didn't really like
that I got a little

339
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:57,720
little bit of luck for the but to the

340
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,230
typically what for soap do it does is

341
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:04,750
and 1 I'll demonstrate is a it sets up a

342
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:09,480
listener phone listener things but if I
just show it to you a

343
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,500
so it's it's a Perfon listener and

344
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:17,520
it waits for a call from a specific
number and once it does receive that

345
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:23,160
a it will going a it will send a signal
to something called an event injector

346
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:29,260
non-event injectors school in the fact
that it acts almost as if the user is

347
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,640
is isn't is behind the phone so you can
you can simulate

348
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,640
any keypress on the BlackBerry by using
an event

349
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,950
so what happens is when a call comes in

350
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:43,200
the phone business is OK it's coming in
from a number that I know

351
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,890
a let me send an event

352
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:50,190
a signal to the event injector now the
event injected does

353
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:53,590
one thing first it mutes the ring so
that

354
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:56,810
the phone doesn't ring than it answers
the call

355
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:59,980
and then it switches on the speakerphone

356
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:03,220
so at that point

357
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,380
you have an open channel between whoever
is calling

358
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,780
and the victim for example so

359
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:13,260
by doing this you can call somebody at
will and listened to

360
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,380
the the conversations going around

361
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:22,210
a or the ambient noise in the room for
example so

362
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:26,880
again I have a little video that I
assure you

363
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:33,880
I'll forms

364
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,400
so this is actually an older version ove
a

365
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,160
phone snow but

366
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,280
are you get the general idea of how

367
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,160
how it will work so

368
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,690
we first start of phone so and at

369
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:04,960
at this point in time a there is only
one trigger number when I released it

370
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,960
re-release it with the ability to change
tracking numbers at will

371
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,309
so you can basically program any number
that you want so

372
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:15,870
here on the on the simulator what I'm
doing is simulating a call from

373
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:21,059
from a specific number number 313 36
here you see the call incoming

374
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:26,110
nothing happens it's like a regular
phone call so

375
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:29,429
what to do now is make a call from

376
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:36,429
the trigger number and we'll see what
happens

377
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:43,190
okay so the number of designated as 313
37 of course what else would a

378
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:46,799
its ok to use a and

379
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,510
so in that instant if you saw other

380
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:58,510
back it up a little bit

381
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:07,030
so

382
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:11,020
so your incoming call it flashes for a
quick second and then

383
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:15,190
it connects so that's the event injector
at work it's already answered the call

384
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:18,870
it says connected and then the last book
was returning it to the home screen

385
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:23,410
so that when you look at the home screen
you know it looks like a regular screen

386
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:28,230
use a want me to a suspicious

387
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:31,790
so to speak you'll see the upper right
corner

388
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:34,800
I mean people with blackberries know
that when those data transfer you'll see

389
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,830
the upper right corner

390
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:39,220
%uh you see the two arrows that the send
and receive hours but that's about all

391
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:39,940
you see

392
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,970
if we look at the the simulation you see
the call is connected

393
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:47,010
and similarly if you

394
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:51,330
press on the Send button you'll see that
the call has been connected now for

395
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:54,400
almost fifteen seconds and the blue eye
colour

396
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,210
over the indicates that it's on
speakerphone so

397
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:02,570
a this is available if you guys wanna
download

398
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:05,790
give you the link estado its freely
available

399
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:09,500
other this is again another another area
where

400
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,810
just doing this once again for you to
take a look

401
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:20,760
so create call

402
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,910
the call comes in it immediately
switches to

403
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:28,970
the home screen and it says its
connected a

404
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:32,450
so this is another way in which you can

405
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:36,170
maybe implant some spyware onto
somebody's blackberry

406
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:40,350
and a use it

407
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:43,710
to spy on the on them will

408
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:48,580
no variation to this

409
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,950
part 2 is you can also use

410
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:55,150
the media player that's built in to the
BlackBerry

411
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:58,850
a the media package and you can actually
just have

412
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:03,370
or maybe a timed recording say every
five or ten seconds

413
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:07,740
you can have the you can switch the
microphone on collect the data

414
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,870
store it may be in the night or at a
specific time you can

415
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:14,130
just upload the captured audiophiles to

416
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:17,530
a to a remote server

417
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:23,900
so that's another another way if doing
okay

418
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,590
a this is actually just a graphic how
that would be done

419
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:31,760
in this case have made use of the time a
task which is it's just a an event that

420
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,230
will run

421
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:35,820
at a specific time every everyday a

422
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,010
it would Sandham signal to the audio
recorder to switch on the microphone

423
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:42,790
and then it would store the audio in

424
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:46,310
memory and then we can get get a look at
it it

425
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:50,230
%uh the miracle of modern

426
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:55,070
cell phones has given us things like
cameras GPS is in

427
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:58,700
using the BlackBerry appear you can make
use a pretty much

428
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,330
everything so with the

429
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:07,450
Media Controller you can actually
programmatically take snapshots from the

430
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,850
built-in camera on the blackberry

431
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:14,680
so the ideas every how often are you
take a few photographs to see

432
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:18,780
where your target to your victim is

433
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:22,420
but usually when I keep my phone I just
keep it flat on the desk

434
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,840
so if you take a picture every half an
eyesore gonna give you much

435
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,050
just a black screen I'll the idea that I
had was to

436
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:33,880
arm take a picture

437
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,790
when a person receives a call because I
mean when i receive a call

438
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:41,170
ninety percent of you put it to you the
people who use new

439
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:45,340
want a so here you have like an
unrestricted view

440
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:49,130
from it to your talk like this

441
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:53,280
you're pretty much an unrestricted view
a you know what's around you and if

442
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:53,890
anybody

443
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:57,310
if anybody's like me a I walk around a
lot

444
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:03,870
so the more I walk around the you know
I'll be able to get a cup almost a 360

445
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:04,550
degree view

446
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:08,570
arm of of you know I'll give me a good
idea is to

447
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:12,670
where a person is so the idea is when a
call comes in start a time to take

448
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:13,970
pictures every five seconds

449
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:17,690
may be stored this can further be
combined with

450
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:21,080
a the GPS a

451
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:25,340
API and so you can combine the two

452
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:29,690
and say when a call comes in check his
GPS coordinates and take a picture

453
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:33,060
so even if is maybe indoors with no GPS
coverage you

454
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,510
gonna get the feel of where he is be
there are more

455
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:41,110
shop specifics it so again

456
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:45,650
home with the get qualified coordinates
method you can just

457
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:49,020
collect a person's GPS location his

458
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,020
is latitude and longitude a new contract
the user

459
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:59,020
as well um

460
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,720
another attack which I didn't actually
write or

461
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,919
have anything to do with but

462
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:10,789
thought it might a be wise to included
in this presentation

463
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:14,909
is something called Black checking this
was done it a presentation and DEFCON

464
00:29:14,909 --> 00:29:18,340
some time ago by a group called Pretoria
global

465
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,539
so the idea here is I

466
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:25,210
on a on a on an enterprise network you
infect

467
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:28,309
and enterprise users phone with the

468
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:32,400
I believe their order to a cold maybe
proxy and what BB proxy does

469
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,350
is it actually gives a gateway being to
the enterprise networks are typically a

470
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,559
enterprise network is all internal IP's

471
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,860
because access it from the outside so

472
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:45,230
with a maybe proxy what you do is

473
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:49,980
a it installs a tournament stores like a
gateway on the blackberry itself and

474
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,390
on the enterprise system you're always
connected to this

475
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:56,809
the server so by a

476
00:29:56,809 --> 00:30:00,620
exploiting this you can effectively gain

477
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:04,650
access to scan say it the entire
internal network from the outside

478
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:09,200
just by going through and infected
blackberry so this is a

479
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,880
I'll things done in 2006

480
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,260
was fairly old a but

481
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:21,419
it's also one of the want the one of the
things to to keep in mind and of course

482
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:22,270
you can move on

483
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:26,130
to a few other hacks like stealing
contact information

484
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:31,510
a if you're feeling a bit mischievous
you can also contact information

485
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:35,059
a/b switch numbers and names

486
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:38,270
sort of calling your boss you think
you're calling your grandfather

487
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:42,370
or something that you can change dates
on the person's calendar if you just

488
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,150
want to be me

489
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:47,240
are you can run up a victim's phone bill
by having a time a task

490
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,600
this caller international number every
of also I'll

491
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,350
and of course you can do what the spam
masters used to do with when the phone

492
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,590
and SMTP port

493
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:01,350
which was not protected they would use
it to spam people you can use

494
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:05,400
something similar but sending bulk SMS
so these a

495
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,580
these are some other ways that you can
actually hack a blackberry

496
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:12,610
no one thing I want told you which is
the most important part is how to

497
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:13,030
actually

498
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:16,490
hack into how to actually put the stuff
on it so this

499
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:21,260
brings us back again to the social
engineering aspects for it

500
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:26,350
I am we know we can really exploited
remotely we can send them a link can say

501
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:29,669
download this program and run it where
you could depending on how gullible

502
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:30,470
person

503
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:34,260
but one thing we can do is physically
assaulted on the phone

504
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,760
so phone is lying there in a bar

505
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,649
somewhere you pick it up just quickly
download something from a website

506
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:45,720
and you've infected or you could just go
up to the gate and say hey look i'm

507
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,140
having a problem with my blackberry

508
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,399
can I just quickly check something give
it to you install it

509
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:54,490
it's not are an expert is

510
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:57,500
developing a game which i think is too
much work

511
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,470
actually because I'm not that dedicated
so the simple a simple

512
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:05,919
simple alternative would be to develop a
maybe a bikini picture slideshow

513
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,770
a I haven't been very

514
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:14,169
discrete said porn a so you know you put
it up

515
00:32:14,169 --> 00:32:18,520
for for free downloads and people just
don't get it right free became a picture

516
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,220
of the day or something so then you have
your

517
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:24,070
slideshow on top and then on the bottom
you have this nastiness going on

518
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:26,010
collecting emails SMS et cetera

519
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:30,000
so there is another way that you can do
it um

520
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,299
the third ways to send the web push
message here you would

521
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:37,700
pretend to be like you were someone an
official capacity

522
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:41,760
you could buy credits offer SMS gateway
for example

523
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,260
arm and you could tell them look

524
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:48,610
please download this very important
patch

525
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:51,720
for continued use a few for

526
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,000
this is typically like a phishing attack
you could do arm

527
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,100
and this was actually done in the in the
Middle East

528
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:04,010
in in to buy by a company called it is a
lot

529
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:08,880
I worked in Dubai for ten years and it
worked for them for five years

530
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,870
I it's a great company but sometimes
they don't make the smartest decisions

531
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,530
so

532
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:20,270
I had already left by the time this
happened so so I did

533
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:23,460
have anything meant to do it so what
they did was a

534
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,860
they sent this this is the exact message
that they sent all their BlackBerry

535
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:31,580
subscribers dear customer always keen to
provide you with a la

536
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:36,419
yeah we'll send you a performance
enhancement patch that you need to

537
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:38,350
install on your device

538
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,820
and what happen when they install this

539
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:46,120
when the user's installed was it was
actually designed to sniff all outgoing

540
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,440
emails

541
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,010
so how did it work it was actually first
hidden from

542
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:56,240
view the applications and it started off

543
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,700
pretty much asleep so it wasn't doing
anything until it received a message

544
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,020
stop message from a either via SMS

545
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:08,379
or by blackberry messenger from the
center called customer service

546
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,820
are so they want to receive the start
message it would just collect

547
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:15,550
every single outgoing email and forward
it to an internal

548
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:19,500
place over with an internal IP address
which obviously bill on Twitter

549
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,399
now I was fortunate in the fact that I
was able to get a get my hands on the

550
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:27,320
on the Application ID compiled now
through the white paper on it

551
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,899
previously so I apologize for the way
this looks but

552
00:34:31,899 --> 00:34:36,669
a it starts off initially by checking if
it's visible

553
00:34:36,669 --> 00:34:40,159
if it is it for cloak itself I'll

554
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,639
sorry sets a flag to hide itself and
then it'll initialize a little hope the

555
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,080
radio and I do believe it's

556
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,450
so it essentially set up a listener
listening for events

557
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:52,619
that occur on the blackberry and then
it'll pretty much stay active

558
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:55,770
and every five seconds it will check for
messages received know this was the

559
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:58,109
first stupid thing that they did

560
00:34:58,109 --> 00:35:01,010
no I explained to you that you set up
something called a message listener and

561
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:01,850
then you forget it

562
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:05,520
you wait for a message to come to you
they didn't do that

563
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,400
they just kept falling so every five
seconds they would check if there's a

564
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,230
message coming in and then they would
process it

565
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:16,270
if they received message and every hour
they would send like a ping

566
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:20,770
back to the server to say I'm active on
this phone this is the IMEI number

567
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:25,150
this is the pin number and this is my
version

568
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:28,410
and of course if it's interrupted then
it'll removal hooks and

569
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:32,310
it'll stop working but this spot

570
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:36,560
is what actually caused a lot of
problems because

571
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,810
like assay was polling the message queue
and it didn't have to do that just have

572
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:41,760
to wait

573
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:48,580
for a message to come so the second
problem was a source code is available

574
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:52,440
kinda when you deploy BlackBerry
application

575
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,790
you can do it in a called from its a
specific former

576
00:35:55,790 --> 00:36:00,560
that you just caught fire these guys
also included the jar file

577
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,700
which was very cool because a JAR file
is nothing but a big zip file with all

578
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,220
the Java classes

579
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,270
you get your hands on the job a classic
into the city combined which is what I

580
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,020
did

581
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:14,210
so there was a second mistake the third
mistake was a back

582
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:17,650
in server collapse so like after Dave
deployment

583
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:22,710
the backend server stopped responding
and because this was written so badly

584
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:26,240
arm

585
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,390
the the the Trojan would keep trying the
survey when it didn't have a

586
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:34,790
a responsible just keep trying you know
it would just do it but to retrace

587
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:38,150
so here you had like almost a hundred
thousand people

588
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:41,609
retrying constantly and then just
brought the server down

589
00:36:41,609 --> 00:36:44,680
and the effect on the customer's was
that

590
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,330
they all complain that the BlackBerry
slow dough sold them noticed that it was

591
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,650
overheating

592
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:54,010
and drain the battery so like I can use
my blackberry for about two days

593
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:57,839
moderate use these guys had half an hour
from for church to

594
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,000
did that for right so lots

595
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,700
708 people I'll

596
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:09,160
so the other thing was a was weird as it
disallowed himself didn't write this

597
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,839
program it was written by a company
called

598
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:13,980
SS a which is a company based in the US

599
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:19,500
it specializes in lawful interception
stuff so there goes who you go to if

600
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,410
or governments will go to if they want
to that before

601
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:27,660
if they suspect to being a terrorist so
I mean even these guys haven't written

602
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,500
it

603
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:32,800
really properly among

604
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:38,030
so how well hidden was this

605
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:41,810
so if you if you have the applications
list this is what it would look like on

606
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:42,950
your

607
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:46,160
a blackberry that would be bugs

608
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,740
I can make it disappear just by running

609
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:53,520
these two lines of code three lines note
to let the

610
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:58,100
so all they do is a deflected into true
and I can just make them disappear

611
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:02,430
but not fully dissipated still there in
the modules but for the average user is

612
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:06,170
isn't gonna find it on its applications
so this is what one of the things that

613
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:10,190
that they did K

614
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:15,550
so recovered the hacks covered the ways
of getting back onto the phone

615
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:19,990
recovered some other bad stuff other
people did as well

616
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:24,569
so we enter kisses to the second part of
my talk

617
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:27,640
the second but the name my talk

618
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,200
I'll so I wrote kisses again

619
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,609
last October think released just after

620
00:38:35,609 --> 00:38:39,730
hack in the box presentation

621
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:44,339
a it pretty much simplifies the search
for Trojans of this nature

622
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:47,480
so it searches for hidden programs it
searches for

623
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,160
in processes um

624
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,589
I haven't really had time to a
conversion to which is going to be

625
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:54,540
really great that

626
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:59,260
that will definitely be out next week
for now this this link will give you

627
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:03,280
the older version but it's also
available on blackberry app world

628
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,410
if you wanna take you know so what cases
does is it

629
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:10,400
goes through your phone it looks at all
the processes it looks for

630
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,450
a hidden programs and in process is a
little

631
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:17,390
it won't do anything about it or just to
let you saying these are the hidden

632
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,890
processes on your phone

633
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:22,130
or the in programs on your phone you
want to reveal them

634
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:25,299
a it can reveal it if you if you want to

635
00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:29,190
but mostly it's like an information too
little tell you what's on

636
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:34,020
I'll one other thing that it does is a

637
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:37,369
just to take a step back with all these
hack said I was showing these are not

638
00:39:37,369 --> 00:39:38,170
new

639
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:41,609
they've been around for a long time
companies like

640
00:39:41,609 --> 00:39:45,330
flexes by Mobile Spy and New York all

641
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:49,369
sell this sort of thing a claiming that

642
00:39:49,369 --> 00:39:53,700
I think flexes play the the tagline is
catch a cheating spouse

643
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:57,480
right if you park with three hundred
euros they'll give you a program that

644
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,810
does exactly what I told you

645
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:04,130
that can be done with the BlackBerry so
it was no fun

646
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:07,160
emails SMS is a

647
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,170
flexes by even has like a poor man's
phone tapping

648
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:14,750
where a save somebody's on a call

649
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:18,160
it'll automatically let you in on a
conference call so you can listen in on

650
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,890
the conference call what's going on

651
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:23,510
so it's like you don't even be somebody
from the government to top the phone you

652
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,109
can just

653
00:40:25,109 --> 00:40:28,310
do it this way so these guys have been
around for a while and they actually

654
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:29,990
sell this stuff

655
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:33,589
so I didn't like the fact that people
can spy on you

656
00:40:33,589 --> 00:40:37,140
kinda paranoid that way so I wrote
kisses again I took the individual

657
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,980
signatures of this program today

658
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:43,069
put it in kisses so if you have flexes
by a bus by

659
00:40:43,069 --> 00:40:48,430
New York all um it is gonna detected and
removed

660
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:52,890
similarly a I did it for phones nope as
well because

661
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:56,049
some people don't like phones no even
though I wrote it I said look it's

662
00:40:56,049 --> 00:40:57,130
harmless

663
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:01,430
so I put phones nope in there as well so
he removes phones as well

664
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:04,540
the new version that I'm writing will
also do

665
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:08,420
something cold baselayer analysis which
is like tripwire

666
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:13,710
so it has a I have a database of all
known good configuration signatures

667
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:17,450
of the modules on a Blackberry so this
compare them and see if

668
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:20,700
any of them have been tampered with and
it'll alert you

669
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,869
if it has re

670
00:41:23,869 --> 00:41:27,900
so to wrap things up quickly

671
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:32,020
black is a very secure device I don't
work for him i wish i did.

672
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:35,260
to let you know it's it's a very secure
device

673
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:41,180
I'll the one problem is it's really
complex for the average user to use

674
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:44,990
like that screen is the permissions
Group

675
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:48,270
if you don't have at least some some
idea of what's going on you're not gonna

676
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:51,359
really mess with that too much

677
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,990
similarly you get a thing called modules
which lists something close to three to

678
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:57,200
four hundred modules on the blackberry

679
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,890
so you can do a lot of stuff with it
it's just not

680
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:04,170
the easiest thing in the world to do so
a

681
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:07,720
again next week probably release a white
paper that details

682
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,760
more friendly wave up dealing with this

683
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,140
um no I won't apply too much to the
enterprise segment

684
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:17,540
because obvious you have you ever been
to an orchard what they're doing

685
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:21,190
and they will hopefully control a

686
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:26,480
a I hope for the controller

687
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,520
what you know what good and bad can
happen to you but

688
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,390
this will be mostly for the the
individual user the users of blackberry

689
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:33,410
internet service

690
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:37,140
this arm

691
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:41,369
second BlackBerry apps and not very well
regulated you can just

692
00:42:41,369 --> 00:42:45,520
by a code signing key for twenty dollars
writer application put it on a website

693
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,410
and tell someone to download

694
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:51,080
you don't have to send it through
something like the App Store

695
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,869
a to get it look to if you want to
publish it on blackberry app world you

696
00:42:54,869 --> 00:42:55,180
do

697
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:59,119
you have to submit your application will
take a look at it and then publish it

698
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,460
but for now you know there's nothing
between you and

699
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,720
this by itself so if I wanted to I can
just put it up

700
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:10,530
on a Web site which is what I have to a
and just a people don't

701
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:14,339
free so obviously

702
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:20,330
a I think this is a given doing so
random pieces a software

703
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:23,560
again limit the amount to suffer a
blackberry it's not really the most

704
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,350
cutting-edge gaming platform the

705
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:29,069
south on the market it has a lot of
built-in tools that help you

706
00:43:29,069 --> 00:43:33,380
with your productivity but a you need to
load

707
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:39,200
screen say it was a done thing that has
or the daily bikini slate or something

708
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,049
a you should learn and set the default
application permissions: this will help

709
00:43:43,049 --> 00:43:44,089
you greatly

710
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:47,299
where you don't have an enterprise have
been to protect you as an individual

711
00:43:47,299 --> 00:43:48,380
user

712
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:51,470
this is what's gonna stand between you
and spyware

713
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:55,490
so this is the paper going to release
hopefully will be more user-friendly

714
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:57,210
format

715
00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:01,760
I'll again don't let others use your
phone

716
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,960
if they do have to use your phone make
sure you see what they're doing it don't

717
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,770
leave your phone and

718
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:09,910
unattended always enabled device
password so even if your phone is lost

719
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:11,430
or stolen

720
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:16,350
a you know that he's not going to be
able to get into your phone

721
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:19,869
and the BlackBerry of to enter your
password ten times it correctly to just

722
00:44:19,869 --> 00:44:20,980
wipe all the data

723
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:24,560
of your phone anyway for it

724
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,950
I if you need to keep up to date

725
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:31,430
I usually post my findings to my blog

726
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:35,640
alternatively you can also follow me on
Twitter cuz whenever I post a blog

727
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:40,369
II just tweet about it as well

728
00:44:40,369 --> 00:44:43,630
okay so that stand in my presentation

729
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:49,790
we have any questions

730
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:51,410
yes course

731
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:58,410
first

732
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:10,150
yes

733
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:17,410
yes

734
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:24,410
yes

735
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:31,850
yes

736
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,610
so far there on so the question was
whether there are any

737
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:38,760
group kits on on blackberry so father on

738
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,290
any rootkits as such what do you do get

739
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:45,880
is these tools is commercial spying

740
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:51,630
tools like flexes by where you install
the program

741
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:55,290
and its that's running its its hidden
this is as close as you're gonna come to

742
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:55,850
a rootkit

743
00:45:55,850 --> 00:46:01,060
Yukon infect the BlackBerry the way you
would do a PC so you can send

744
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:04,410
a you can take advantage of like a broza
buggin

745
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:08,510
introduces without the use in knowing
you always have to have user interaction

746
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:09,280
to install

747
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,510
so-called rootkit so you re the trick
the user into installing

748
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:20,510
or you install it yourself

749
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:25,910
yes

750
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:30,069
yes but by default the event injector
permission is set to deny

751
00:46:30,069 --> 00:46:35,420
on the blackberry so by default you not
going to be able to use that unless you

752
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:36,880
trick to use again into

753
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:43,880
a permitting this

754
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:56,760
it

755
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,720
its its by the last vulnerability that
was discovered his recent but before

756
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,140
that I think there's a gap about

757
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:05,790
four or five years in the vulnerability
discovery

758
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:10,140
the devices truly secure it runs a
customized JVM

759
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:14,930
I and because if the the abstraction
that the JVM provides

760
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:18,079
a it's very difficult to

761
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:22,339
write an exploiter such with bytecode
because the second thing that it does it

762
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:25,599
is it always verify the signature even
if the US

763
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:30,119
so if you're worried about somebody
giving you an operating system saying

764
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:33,510
here's an upgrade to the operating
system but he's actually hacked

765
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:37,000
in some way even that won't work because
the JVM at Harbor level

766
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,319
will verify the signatures of the
operating system a

767
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:49,319
I not that I'm aware

768
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:57,870
this

769
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,040
arm

770
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,000
yeah so the question is a.m. is it is it

771
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,170
yeah so the question well I mean

772
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:15,859
the the idea is I'm when you buy may be
used blackberry for example a new one

773
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:19,500
so the default configuration is is is
fairly

774
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:23,700
I once ate too restrictive but it's
fairly restrictive

775
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:27,430
it it prevents things like event
injection and you know there's really

776
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:28,430
bad ones were

777
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:31,630
you can reset the security time

778
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:35,320
so by resetting the security time when
you can you know you have a password

779
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,410
lock out the time

780
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:39,670
you can keep resetting that if you want
to do in the the device would never look

781
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:40,010
out

782
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:43,500
so all have those are set to deny it but
the four

783
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:49,140
so a generally what i do it as soon as I
get a black which is reinstall the

784
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:54,130
Voice anyway but that's because I like
the latest version comes

785
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:57,220
with but by default it's its

786
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:00,930
you shouldn't have anything to worry
about know if you're buying a used one

787
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:03,119
then you really should worry about the
applications

788
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,740
the third party applications on that so
if you're buying a used when I would

789
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:07,849
definitely recommend

790
00:49:07,849 --> 00:49:11,830
wiping it and reinstalling

791
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:18,830
yes

792
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:23,940
arm

793
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:27,420
the server farm to

794
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:30,500
publicly gonna tell you is I haven't
really tried

795
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,800
to take the security of that but a

796
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,960
what I hear is it's it's it's quite
secure

797
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,480
a I'm you will get

798
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,720
veering levels have access i mean you're
not

799
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,520
you're going to have a lot of
information because I mean the the room

800
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,160
keys

801
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:50,640
a two day trip to deter all within

802
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,380
within the the data center if you will
but

803
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:57,920
the server from that has the internet
but is is kinda isolated so you know

804
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:58,930
you're only gonna see

805
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:03,740
a small subset of which is the Internet
traffic

806
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:08,270
on looking for talk after

807
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:11,890
I any answered no

808
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:18,890
no haven't not have been publicized yes

809
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:33,200
yes

810
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:44,260
yes

811
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,730
yes

812
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:51,640
exactly

813
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:58,640
yes

814
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:06,080
yes

815
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:18,890
yeah

816
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:21,650
yes

817
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:23,960
yes

818
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:28,140
that's mister like the most so what are
covered here is from the perspective of

819
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:31,910
over individual user but the enterprise

820
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:35,160
is it has far more varying degrees a

821
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:39,410
security that you can implement and soca
administrated

822
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:43,529
is somebody who bikes to take

823
00:51:43,529 --> 00:51:47,190
a pleasure in other people's pain that
he could just set do not

824
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:51,170
love installations a third party
applications at all so you're just stuck

825
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:51,609
with it

826
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:55,190
default settings applications you can
install additional applications

827
00:51:55,190 --> 00:52:02,190
he can pretty much make your life help
yes

828
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:21,450
yes

829
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:28,380

835
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:28,590
we had a customer in to buy actually
that a

836
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:33,350
they actually went up to the CIO and
said look we want to install things like

837
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:34,580
Twitter and Facebook

838
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:37,720
please let us install but so

839
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:43,480
