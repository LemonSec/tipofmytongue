1
00:00:01,069 --> 00:00:03,520
so in the next hour

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,560
the stalk will will get a few more

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,200
videos and it gets a little more
actually hands-on technical

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,240
hands demo technical if you like but

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,210
so that the next Sat level that I want
to talk about his

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,800
Platform as a Service and I mention
cells will suck com

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,900
there that kinda wanted the really big
players in this

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,180
and we had a little bit of experience
with them through

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,969
that an indirect relationships and

10
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,920
the we thought we'd have a look at that
and that selling point is that they say

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,719
no more

12
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,969
socket so a they want to

13
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:48,059
post your CRM because there isn't a
business model but actually built to

14
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:49,670
provide you with the ability to write

15
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:55,350
applications I'm so that book stuff to
the service and platform as a service

16
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,280
and we had a

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,090
before getting into the peplum stuff we
had a look at the actual application

18
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,820
that they provided to you for CRM

19
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,740
um and we tested it and they had good
full treatment

20
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,979
held up and fairly cursory a

21
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:13,210
but what's interesting is that
ultimately of course like one of the

22
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,650
things that the web application

23
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:18,390
again which means that web application
security it this fall

24
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,810
a changing world is still developing new
attacks and so

25
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,650
outlets you know we try to find Ubuntu

26
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,110
these attacks and so this is

27
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:35,560
one example of things that you may see
on

28
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,729
sales force to come so

29
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:44,079
you probably you may be aware of term I
Grossman's

30
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,750
pic techno tech and pretty much all this
video demos that actually

31
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,479
cells but companies wonderful to click
Check and

32
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:59,219
now we can talk about how risky in a
tactic Tekken is and as

33
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,040
while the Westgate than are as pretty
bad generally it's

34
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,399
you know the impact this is Lester but
I'll show you what the tech is pretty

35
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:07,880
much

36
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,440
we demonstrate your heart to use a
portion of the interface in that portion

37
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:12,860
a bit

38
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,810
face talks about contacts and calendars

39
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,690
calendar events and saw and so this
shows you how to

40
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:24,940
how one might go about deleting an event

41
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,069
so we can occur on the interface and
ultimately you're going to be said

42
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:32,540
but the nature of a a pic tech attack

43
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,420
is that you get the user who comes to
you

44
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,730
people page much if you can't

45
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,120
you can probably see Justin a backrub
you see

46
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,260
you probably just like a watermark and
actually that what's marked the cells to

47
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:48,709
come

48
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:52,010
website but it's being the position so
that

49
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,510
it's transparent all but he conspired to
this case you can see what's going on

50
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,610
and that there is that you gonna get the
user to click on points on the screen

51
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,920
where actually his clicking on sales
force that call

52
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,989
but econ see sales which the comment
that he doesn't know he's taken on

53
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:09,069
cells to it so that's it

54
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:12,370
you I redressing attack is the more
formal night

55
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,470
but otherwise it's also known as attack

56
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,190
and of course the way that you would get
someone to kick around in space bury

57
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,980
them in

58
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,300
you have a punch the monkey the gable
the dots & Paykel

59
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,690
whatever I'm and but just you need a
guide to to click

60
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:30,099
what's interesting is well of course is
that with tic tac in

61
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:33,650
it's developed to the point where you
can position

62
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:37,290
that background or you can position the
the chance

63
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,290
current page whenever they got clicks

64
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,670
so actually took me to click manual
reposition the page

65
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,010
doesn't matter where he clicks seeking

66
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,080
you can get into curl I'm and then

67
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,069
with that pick in actually those pics
get pasta cells to come without knowing

68
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:54,950
of course this

69
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,049
implements changes on the cells for

70
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:01,140
com website lot tonight a

71
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,370
and why this is interesting what pic
tech news interesting is that where the

72
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,159
original

73
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:08,830
example they showed how you could
remotely enable your

74
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,099
microphone and video camera through
Ticketek without knowing

75
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:15,489
that you have done so with you know
scary

76
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:21,310
privacy kinda things happen that but

77
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,380
the point here is that sales force that
call

78
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,009
was one who is vulnerable to

79
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:31,850
and attacked that's relatively well not
what it's really well known

80
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,979
I'm and it's something that they've
chosen

81
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:39,240
not to address which by extension means
that

82
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,639
your customer relationship management
software is

83
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,430
to tackle because you're liable cells
but it took a little bit

84
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,490
more into actually what sales force that
can provide

85
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,590
their customers so

86
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,320
at the ten-year-old company at this
point so there they've been around the

87
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,880
block

88
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,960
and they started often CRM but they that
moved

89
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,490
now by quite rapidly a they're a big
company

90
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,320
over a billion dollars in revenue that
got almost 60,000

91
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,500
customers there are major planned the
cut

92
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,940
some other customers really of major
players

93
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,440
there it to me that had the system which
did CRM in the cloud

94
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,780
so it was software as a service but
increasingly what their mock tuna

95
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,070
or what they're pushing is there

96
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:29,100
for stock com tackle which is

97
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,130
the runtime environment that allows you
to right to application

98
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:39,449
within a custom code and run it on their
systems

99
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:44,130
it's an ambitious project um that got
solid names and actually the heart is in

100
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:47,380
the right place if you speak to them in
terms of securing the systems they are

101
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,229
they're quite practice with this whole
them

102
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:57,440
now if week try to relate this back to
some other characteristics that nest

103
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,400
defined for concepts is the big one here
is that its multi-tenant

104
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,229
this resource pooling the reason it cost
you so little

105
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:08,880
to run your services there's because
you're sharing

106
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,270
processes space all share price at the
time he shared storage space is sharing

107
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,250
that bad what

108
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,919
with a bunch of other people who
probably don't or use the submit

109
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,690
precisely the same time

110
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:22,130
so you can spread it out a little bit
and cost everyone

111
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:26,520
but less with Michael a and it's a
subscription model

112
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,190
so you pay to use it more you pay the
more you can use

113
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:35,150
features scale with the more you pay so
it didn't really does

114
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:39,449
I mean it fits those characteristics
quite well but what's interesting for

115
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:42,569
the purposes of our test is that they
gave us

116
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:46,479
a 3 they hand out free accounts to
develop so if you're looking to

117
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,690
write applications and what's to come
you can sign up

118
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:53,630
free today right now while visiting
that's quite a useful

119
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,660
think to to play with of course those
accounts for a little bit more limited

120
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,580
than if you pay

121
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,690
but you still get access to a lot of
cool features

122
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:05,220
they also have their idea of an exchange
in which

123
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,919
is similar to the App Store that Apple
has so you can write applications

124
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,400
full force to come and put them inside a
epic said

125
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,500
you can tell them other users so you'll
get things like an entire

126
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,930
accounting package written forced to
come which ties into the CRM system

127
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:26,880
and all others but again all access
through

128
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,210
a single web interface so when we spoke
about

129
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:33,900
cloud be an insidious this is the kind
of thing we're talking about

130
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,740
you know as a slowly grows the the
features that become available and that

131
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,030
may

132
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,560
increase your risk profile are added
without you particularly being

133
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,720
where at them this case you get to
choose whether or not to use any of

134
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,710
those that

135
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:52,160
but if you do 230 to you to do that then
you would need to reconsider your risk

136
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,300
a and so if you look at how one might

137
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,310
right applications within on
sportsbook.com

138
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,530
so there's this sort of three basic
components

139
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,780
on the one hand you can write the
interface through a language called

140
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,319
official force which allows you to
specify all the

141
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,419
cool things on call you a similar
elements but together inside

142
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:16,660
at but it's basically a templating
language that sits in the front that's

143
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,379
an example of how

144
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:21,699
been fourth ornate artificial fourth
page

145
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:26,250
might look I mean you can't its
xml-based problem

146
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,509
but the more interesting stuff for me is

147
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,140
we actually get into got to the
application and want to write

148
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,950
the stuff that sits behind the interface
and then you get to

149
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,500
a apex in the an example of a pic to
it's a Java

150
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,570
like language that Runtime Environment
is

151
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:47,660
based with a runtime environment is
written in Java

152
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,870
a man so they've got this Java like
language that gets

153
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:55,070
executed within on the force that
compatible

154
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:58,420
and you can see that it's you know what
you'd expect any

155
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,750
very complete language look like but the
last part of that that is the data

156
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,230
stores that provide you with good

157
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:08,580
faces to actually storing data you don't
there's no such thing as a file

158
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,649
it's just database you interact with
that

159
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:15,019
and you and it's quite an interesting
way that they've got it

160
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:18,440
done um they tie or

161
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,750
object-relational mapping is both into
the lead so

162
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,350
you don't have external live is to do
that stuff

163
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:30,310
objects are first-order first-class

164
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,459
typed on and so you get a

165
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:37,250
so kill and sisal the query language in
the South Sandwich

166
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,890
which basically allow you to do this
kinda

167
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:45,080
sequel like query and immediately

168
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,899
gravel that result that sickle like
query into

169
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:53,170
list of optics up so it's quite a
full-featured

170
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:58,170
languages but quite nice for the stuff
the development environment IDE

171
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:01,850
generally in your brother so they have
got a browser-based dev environment

172
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,480
is also quite cool or you can write an
eclipse a

173
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,420
plugin up to this is just an example of
the browser-based

174
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:14,329
that environment now

175
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:17,709
the language has got a whole bunch of
the features that a lot

176
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:20,950
live on the web lot look within the
clots a 4-1 it can

177
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:24,470
from within your your code you can make
an eight pick what you can

178
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:27,589
request things course they

179
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:31,279
need to be very careful about how people
use these features they

180
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,760
at cognizant of the fact that

181
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,540
a.m. the just opening up or thought so

182
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,399
new API to people also broadens the
scope for

183
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,440
compromise or bad stuff

184
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,070
a so you can make HTTP request but in
order to make an 80 per

185
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,610
TDP request a given website you need to
configure that

186
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,459
through administration interface and say
we explicitly commit

187
00:10:57,459 --> 00:11:01,269
our application to talk I could to that
site

188
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:04,959
a bit of the possible to have a
webservice and point sitting with and

189
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,079
forced to cum

190
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,870
that when it gets cold your apex
executes

191
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,630
in response to that so you can have your
code executes

192
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,820
within the cloud in response to web
service call

193
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:22,269
you can also said email so you can have
apex execute

194
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:25,899
in response to receive an e-mail there's
also triggers

195
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:31,750
and so on and when we look at the system

196
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,959
it the kindest ruckus that multi-tenancy
is

197
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,760
cool for reducing costs

198
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,089
but this is there is a problem then you
sharing space with other people

199
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:46,170
and and shared space with other people
is uncomfortable

200
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,950
especially when you're dealing with
private dater and saw

201
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,019
and so this things like

202
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:56,790
what happens if what are these guys when
he sleeps roller rink expand the back

203
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,630
can

204
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:01,300
you know it's painful things I'm and and
you would see the same on the shared

205
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,440
system so

206
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,139
you would want that to be equitable
sharing of resources

207
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:10,810
one guy shouldn't one application should
not be able to steal

208
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:14,480
want to process a time one application
should be able to take a look

209
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,519
storage and so on

210
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,139
and so in order to separate applications
I'm of the company's got

211
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:26,110
what they called governor limits and
governor limits

212
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,560
of just quotas or

213
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,579
restrictions that are enforced on your
cut

214
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:37,160
and so every time script executes it is
subject to these limits

215
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,510
and some limits global talk about
something about shortly but

216
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,420
what the limit is exceeded pretty much
application is

217
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,320
killed at that point an exception is
thrown and you can catch into it

218
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,310
dies the limits have got

219
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:55,889
what they vary depending on how much you
pay dependent on

220
00:12:55,889 --> 00:13:00,540
where the code is called prominence all
basically every time code executes

221
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,060
it's got limit the limits of course

222
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,690
very few exceptions all but other things
that that

223
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,790
are limited so for example basic ones

224
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,160
a the number of lines that script that
can be executed

225
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,639
in give an invocation code

226
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:22,010
so depending on your your account and
what you signed up for that maybe two

227
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,959
hundred thousand

228
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:28,450
statement will be executed in a given
invocation

229
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,959
or it may be things like a total size:
code in a given class

230
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:35,440
or the amount of data that is stored

231
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,779
typically it's about 30 makes data

232
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:42,029
you're allowed you also have Mexican
limit

233
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:47,130
on number eight web request number of
that emails and phone

234
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:51,329
but we also through the test you bump
into number unpublished limit so

235
00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:54,389
that they're playing a quite well in the
sense that

236
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:57,829
there they're quite upfront about all
the things that you're not a lot to do

237
00:13:57,829 --> 00:14:02,120
that would fit within the normal a the
normal parameters

238
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,790
a code that you may occur right but
they've also got a whole bunch of other

239
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:09,279
limits that they're also check in that
are indicative

240
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,329
all malicious code that are not
necessarily public

241
00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:16,389
so they're being quite transparent with
you where you are being

242
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:19,540
comes back to that so we are right in

243
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,370
code that is that on militias they'll
tell you exactly where your

244
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:26,570
code will die I'm but when you

245
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:30,690
start to write code that pushes the
boundaries been you run into limits that

246
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:34,029
they're not so open about things like
that are going to be the length of time

247
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:36,029
that

248
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:39,360
script can run the number of emails to
convince even

249
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,750
I guess there are more those just
happened to be the ones that we ran into

250
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,720
but this language does have some
limitations given that it's

251
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,589
quiet it's quite specific

252
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:56,720
to domain-specific language in this case
it got

253
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,779
it's focused on the short but the
execution

254
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:03,360
and this other mine a painful this

255
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,459
as infamous is a.m. where

256
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:10,910
you can alter the configuration up
yourself with a calm

257
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:15,139
account from within apex you can only do
it through the web application

258
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:19,570
and sought get a web app if you can get
your apex code to talk to it

259
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:22,620
own management interface through web
call out

260
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,790
well then you can kinda step around that
but there's no explicit way to do that

261
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:30,290
there's also no explicit locks in the
code is not threats there's no ability

262
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:30,930
to

263
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:35,350
poor see there's no sleep call there's
no explicit shit memories economy

264
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,009
multiple threads

265
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:41,389
talking shipments on and API call orders
also quite important

266
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:45,339
so you can call or if you call certain
API's

267
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:50,070
the offer but in from calling a York
forbidden to make it other calls

268
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:54,009
of it that just on a defeatist

269
00:15:54,009 --> 00:15:58,230
features up there system up

270
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:01,839
and so we started just mess around a
little bit and we are looking for some

271
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,399
example the pot to provide those missing

272
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,560
building looks good like many other
things all building blocks

273
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,850
a and they do something really silly
they

274
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:14,079
provide or your limited to 200,000

275
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,230
statement but an expression can be

276
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,399
I think almost 32 K long

277
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,880
you can make an almost solitary long
expression which only counts as a single

278
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,990
statement occurred I meant so what we're
trying to do was to fight outta

279
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,070
sleep Colin site that we just got a
whole bunch

280
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:36,600
cube roots chained together um that

281
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,779
take a lot of time on the process a body
count as a single

282
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:44,740
statement that been executed and so we
can it was thought to build up

283
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:49,600
asleep call I'm we can also do something
similar with synchronization so for

284
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,459
trying to get a lock

285
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:54,759
if you've got multiple a multiple

286
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:58,440
indications are apex all trying to
access it given

287
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,240
resorted to one thing we try to have the
first past the gate kinda

288
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,750
an aria I'm you can find out a lot using

289
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,819
so they do support locked in the
database and using that as a building

290
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,030
block you could

291
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,100
kinda get locks in your code

292
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,980
said member you get if you use if you
consider databases that memory

293
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,780
triggers they support in terms of

294
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:25,150
database itself thread we get back

295
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:28,280
okay so with all of this what about

296
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,789
of focuses on cells with the calm was
trying to buy pasta

297
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:37,130
governor so that the thing that protects
people in the multi-tenant

298
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,890
environment from each other okay well
let's go off to the thing that's

299
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:45,510
protected people but there are

300
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:48,350
a number of ways to approach this
problem in the way that we chose to

301
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,470
approach the problem

302
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,559
was pretty much you

303
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:56,610
through what he called eventually so

304
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:00,020
based on a single user interaction the
attacker

305
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:03,200
we wanted a whole chain execution to
continue on

306
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,940
on the cells courtside in other words he
wants to get continuous execution

307
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:10,799
going I'm without having to involve
third-party

308
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,260
at all and so that there are a couple
ways that you

309
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,809
you may be a titty think of I'm the one
is to have

310
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:22,270
a web page that calls itself through a
web service call

311
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:25,720
so I'm you have a web page

312
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,260
that is called in response to a web
service called but within that

313
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:34,770
web service call it calls its Optik how
to get a like people

314
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:37,860
invocation good but that doesn't work

315
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,360
because they have checks specifically
for that

316
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,950
a so it we want to take care of

317
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,010
the that part in tears so we did settle
on

318
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:51,799
email and pretty much what the process
that we settled on with this

319
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:56,059
a for an external party sends an email
to predefined address

320
00:18:56,059 --> 00:19:00,240
this kicks off some apex in which we can
do whatever stuff that we want to do on

321
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,070
this

322
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:05,049
round of execution background execution
is obviously

323
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:09,340
limited by it set up governor leavitt

324
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:13,030
but if it doesn't done we in certain
objects into the data storage kicks off

325
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,630
a trigger would send the email

326
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,220
back to our written email address and so

327
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:22,210
the cycle continues and what it means is
that every time we go what's wrong

328
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:25,470
the cycle we get another

329
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:30,480
set all governor limits so we can scale
does governor limits by the number of

330
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,770
times he can

331
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:36,059
get that email or get that cycle good

332
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:41,289
I'm and so what eventually we bumped
into the is the hidden

333
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:45,230
a quote on the number at received emails
in this case

334
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:48,299
but to get up to 1500 around execution

335
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:52,100
which depending on your job may or may
not be sufficient

336
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,400
but of course whatever but that job is
is up to

337
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,710
uses imagination and so we put companies
putting back together

338
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,980
we looked around and we thought well
what reasonable demo for a

339
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,360
Haqqani and the example that we chose to
go with with

340
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,120
Nick so with you probably what you may
or may not be familiar with it

341
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,020
we call the thing stepped up to the
Salesforce nectar and pretty much just

342
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,590
ported nectar into

343
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,679
the club and that exactly as you would
expect

344
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:23,830
a that we have a list

345
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:27,100
all URL's that gets Catena

346
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,570
the target website and that's we

347
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,850
plots when you know

348
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:38,070
the response matters given values

349
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,400
and so we pick up this event loop min in
every

350
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,620
iteration of the event to take a subset
of the test that we want to conduct

351
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,190
against

352
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:48,559
the target do that store the data

353
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,909
move through the next the next cycle

354
00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:57,030
question is why do you want to do this
well 1

355
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:00,909
you know there's an element of what
because we can

356
00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:04,309
but it's free so if resources are tight

357
00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:08,299
for you and you gotta you've got sales
force to come to the council then

358
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:12,320
its three witches Michael in South
Africa it may contest lost

359
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,440
depending on on where you are city

360
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,690
we don't have to load the international
badminton little that we do have is

361
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:19,760
quite expensive

362
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,960
so tell to offshore your bed with Costas
is quite a nice thick

363
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,809
a and it gives a degree of anonymity
said I just got in from

364
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:34,159
sales forces that is not from anyone
else's

365
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,309
but mostly it's just that concept
nothing

366
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:42,450
so allow me to

367
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:49,450
run this video

368
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,150
okay so I just talked through I'm

369
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:01,380
this seven parts in here so we like and
I'm just gonna say a little bit about

370
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,020
the

371
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:06,169
the config this is the interface to
Salesforce

372
00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:09,760
so you're right you're you a pic sippin
their website

373
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:15,460
I'm this is just exactly what this it's
a 15 all explosives that we needed

374
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,390
so there were a couple things as with
other testing losses in their

375
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:22,440
we also needed

376
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:27,280
custom objects in that database as well
as the trigger that could get

377
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,860
set or when you insert into the database

378
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,240
and that trigger would be sending the
email back to assault

379
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,500
this is not the code that actually

380
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,600
runs when and humid is received so that
the email address to which

381
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,610
we need to send are looped

382
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:53,610
email

383
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,080
NOP

384
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,070
the one thing that if you if you are
familiar with cells with a couple know

385
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,680
that

386
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,720
a as I said before you need to

387
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,310
send or you need to be explicitly allow
upgrade connections to web sites

388
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:13,590
a menu called do that except through the
web interface

389
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,710
there's no API to at support

390
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:20,240
to do that I'm so shoulda I'm so in that

391
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,980
the allowed and points does not contain
the fight that began this cat

392
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,970
just because at the end I'm gonna come
back and tell you that it's been added

393
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:27,740
I'm

394
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,470
which we do programmatically through
abusing their web interface

395
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:35,220
so on the site

396
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,530
we've got the attacker consul and so I'm

397
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:42,290
our only interaction with this service
is going to be by

398
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:45,340
email which makes it a quite cute
because the email can be

399
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,440
really anonymous if you you know

400
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,110
to tease hospital whatever this thing
becomes quite but hard to track

401
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:56,170
so once you've set up the initial system
within post a comment

402
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:59,210
the attacker gets to conduct everything

403
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:03,090
all these commands and and all that by
email and so

404
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:06,670
we've got a little shell script that's a
replica we're gonna be so we're gonna be

405
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,380
looking at

406
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,250
the attackers consul and you're also
going to be looking at victims up at you

407
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,840
like to see the sky and as a

408
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,960
comes through okay so that shell script
that sends an email

409
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,030
saw and we gonna start alien

410
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:28,030
logs so we specify the fight that we
want to attack me say stop the scan

411
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:32,480
and you start watching the logs and

412
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,380
this is pretty much this is real time
waiting now as

413
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,930
thus can come through and its it's not
incredibly fast

414
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:43,970
but as I say compare that to South
African band

415
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:47,170
what we what to do see though is that

416
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:51,220
the notification mail City iteration of
the loop

417
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:55,900
complete a spot and come through while
that's gone continues job just showing

418
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,850
you that

419
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:00,570
the end point was indeed added
successfully to the web interface

420
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:04,790
to before stock compensation without
having to use

421
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:08,640
the web interface so there and did not
cause the has been added

422
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:15,640
um programmatically

423
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,700
to the scanning continues and shortly

424
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:25,809
Shelby competing and soft spoken about

425
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:29,090
we get notification emails as each loop
all

426
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:32,720
that it always it's likely that
adventure continues

427
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,309
the scanned and

428
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:40,860
and

429
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:47,860
and then the final results is shown

430
00:25:49,149 --> 00:25:53,789
in emails that I receive so those the

431
00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:57,730
the results beat individual cycle and
then on the lost when we get

432
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:02,799
the overall result now

433
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,080
what's interesting about this is just
from a timing perspective you get

434
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,700
I mean within the granularity

435
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,249
minute so you can see scan starts at 125
attended one-sixteenth a

436
00:26:13,249 --> 00:26:17,350
in 11 minutes to get to scan a host on

437
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:24,350
the Internet key

438
00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:26,120
good

439
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:33,120
a and so this is an example

440
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,570
and certain example all on how to abuse

441
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:41,780
the services that are available

442
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:46,730
in the car is that a vulnerability
within forced to calm well

443
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,860
debatable probably not I'm with just

444
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,640
takin this supported services to the
edge in

445
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,990
of where they should be going which is
developing attack tools

446
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:02,490
and we're finding tricks to get her on
the more obvious limitations

447
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:06,920
so at a lot continues execution cool but
if you can cycle execution to give us

448
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,800
the illusion of

449
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:12,870
continuous execution so it could be
foster foster with a little more bed

450
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:13,830
with three

451
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:17,400
a.m. and

452
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,040
depending on on how you structure at you
you may be able to

453
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:25,360
to you leopards this into tonight
service

454
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,690
but we certainly didn't go anywhere
close to that are you also ask about

455
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:32,840
is it possible to dos health wealth that
come through

456
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,070
have been such things again that's not a
question that we were

457
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:41,270
particularly keen to on sir given all of
the issues

458
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:46,390
with testing Scott provides of course
there are many cons to this

459
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:51,280
prone to monitor his big one at cutting
language at four and this particular

460
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,600
technique is governed by

461
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:57,660
by email limits so

462
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:02,170
we said that's cool but the problem is
its accounts

463
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:05,290
we've only got fifteen hundred SEL new
today

464
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:08,600
for the count can we improve in this
well actually the cat

465
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,670
in this case the council is there a cost
the cost is nothing where developer

466
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:13,170
account

467
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:16,400
they're free mu just need to sign up for
that so instead of

468
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,650
trying to go really deep with what you
can do with one account

469
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:22,860
you could scale at reckless get

470
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:26,190
lot love to the cards and see if you can
start up

471
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:29,330
many many instances of a given

472
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:33,520
peace accord that runs for 10 minutes
and see if you can spot affect the load

473
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,790
on one machine or

474
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:41,460
on their there instead the clusters and
this is useful because accounts can

475
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,600
communicate through things like web
service calls or through email whatever

476
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:51,160
a and so wall that stopping at this
point is the ability to or to register

477
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,040
because they don't actually want to have
to register

478
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,900
thousand pounds by hand and so we have a
look at the page to see if you can order

479
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,560
it's the

480
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,990
a what you see is that actually

481
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:06,680
it sucks that go to capture and so it's
Trent that captures side

482
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,100
you know we didn't particularly feel
like breaking

483
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:14,000
the captor so we kinda looked around at
we're

484
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,570
you know doing happened security and
stuff and we looking for the easiest way

485
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:19,590
to do something and so

486
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:22,880
that images generated by PHP script

487
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,610
I'm to we just cold the PHP script annex
it was funny

488
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:32,910
Katie someone at that debug information
in the PHP script and the right at the

489
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:33,540
ed

490
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,830
someone is run print are on the
structure

491
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:41,780
that is containing the contents for
those image and actually

492
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,790
you can see that put the the text ok

493
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:49,630
the image embedded right at the bottom
of the image itself

494
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:55,130
which was a little bit funny and so with
that it was possible

495
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:58,620
adjusted to automates registration a

496
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:02,390
got tix gives a gotta give cells with
the cumshots the

497
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:06,070
when we reported that fifteen minutes
later they fixed it

498
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:09,200
there on the ball today there quite

499
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,220
proactive thing though

500
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:16,280
all area so

501
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:21,400
what what %uh some the future directions
for this particular

502
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,600
approach set those really the basic goes
to:

503
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,700
there's nothing magic about it but its

504
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,840
but there's a lot of I'm possibilities
given up the slack adjuster incomplete

505
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,980
and they are all these resources that up
back in it

506
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:41,210
and there are some interesting API's and
so there were a few

507
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:44,580
there are a few improvements language so

508
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:48,210
if we talk about insidious an expense or
an expanding

509
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:51,590
of features when we tested Salesforce

510
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:55,060
lost in the middle of the the right
person fifty you know they're

511
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:59,650
language and at the moment there in
person ninety

512
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,700
so every three months this revision and

513
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:07,140
features get added quite it's definitely
growing

514
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:11,570
some other stuff that

515
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:14,660
but I want to carry out and talk Amazon
Web Services

516
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:18,780
which is today I guess the meaty part in
this

517
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:22,780
presentation and its cool it really is
that cool

518
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:27,230
I'm that the whole but so when you hear
Amazon Web Services a.w.s

519
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:31,300
there are a number there there are many
services that a structured

520
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:35,020
underneath that a minute fact this is
not even the full set I'm

521
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:38,820
and so the things that we do look at and
the things that we touched

522
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:42,390
not tested were ec2

523
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:46,040
s3 SQS and DEP and broadly speaking

524
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,960
ec2 gives it the ability to read but
machines s3 gives the

525
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,610
the ability to store data Tabitha SQS
gives you

526
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:58,330
accused service messages so you can have
communications between

527
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:01,950
but machines and it pays as the way for
people to sell

528
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:05,730
images that they do create but we you
know this is many other

529
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:09,150
what this out a bunch of other services
that they have that we can all

530
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:12,580
because we don't touch at all in this
presentation

531
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:19,200
if you talk briefly about bc2 and hard
work

532
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,490
I mention that the thought of the
presentation that its

533
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:25,710
in person an example Infrastructure as a
Service and

534
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:29,170
it is where or Evans and provide you
with the ability to

535
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:33,500
create and run voting machines saw your
advert image

536
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,770
and it runs in the data centers today
responsible for everything

537
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:40,990
underneath from the hypervisor dot
that's all up there

538
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:44,150
issue but everything on top will happen
by Sir is what

539
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:47,810
you are responsible that gives you in
essence access

540
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:51,060
root access to leading spots at the
click of a button I'm

541
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:55,010
and you're the only one with access to
that she

542
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:58,010
the cost is scaleable because it has
taken a look

543
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:03,740
all of us ready really cool stuff

544
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,880
so the way that that you go about ball

545
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,380
one of the videos demonstrates how you
can actually created

546
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:15,830
an image up the next one is s3 and s3 is
the storage service

547
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:19,220
good you think and where at

548
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,870
a.w.s provides me with the ability to
compute in and to run

549
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:26,640
processes ada s3 is is actually where
your day to get stored

550
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,050
so for a long time infect

551
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:33,370
of I believe I was in or 30 for a long
time

552
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:37,770
Amazon did not a a lot persistent images

553
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:41,080
so want to emit died whatever was on it
already

554
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,390
disappeared if you wanted to store that
data from

555
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:47,870
image to image you needed to to store it
in

556
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:51,790
s3 so a.m. eyes were not assistant at
all

557
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:55,420
so it's through still the way that that
you can store the stuff

558
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:59,450
and again at all that good cloud stuff

559
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:03,240
as as one would expect there's the

560
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:08,000
a cute little Firefox add-on that allows
you to treat your

561
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,270
s3 bucket as just another point to the
desktop to store stuff he can just move

562
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:16,679
file server saw and its kinda cute

563
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:21,120
up and so broadly speaking what they did
is this s3 allows you to create

564
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:25,060
buckets I mean you can name the buckets
and within that to just drop

565
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,110
objected blotted data so

566
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:32,210
there's no you a this isn't a filesystem
at all

567
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:35,580
there's no another those primitive that
we expect fast was no

568
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:39,250
Commission lucky that stuff

569
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:42,669
it's just you create a bucket that only
you have access to and within a bucket

570
00:34:42,669 --> 00:34:44,350
you can drop

571
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:47,640
data and so this is an example you may
maybe or

572
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,890
your bucket called images internet just
got images

573
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:54,000
or you made a bit public to yards and
common

574
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,190
within that drop but HTML and images
whatever

575
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:00,960
you just get the label the bucket and
you get to drop in

576
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,220
and label blocked the data

577
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,920
then SQS is

578
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,010
a little bit boy s kisses the way that

579
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:15,730
electricity is provided so it's just a
cure in service that

580
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:19,070
your images can make use of and so

581
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:22,650
that typical produce a consumer paradigm
applies you have

582
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:25,780
you may have one or two images producing
a whole bunch of

583
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:29,860
base that needs to be processed the drop
in the Q&A at the other side you've got

584
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:34,580
images that are putting data of the
queue but you can also tie last 52 that

585
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:38,540
the Q and saw so when the Q growth

586
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:42,250
you know this girl and saw I'm SQS is
just a

587
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:45,530
useful means for communicating between
images

588
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:49,590
and so we look for something that we had
with cells to come

589
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:52,850
in terms of tryin to

590
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:55,860
trying to steal processing time trying
to

591
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,030
get more execution and we we should have

592
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:02,800
and so we want to see if we could get
that

593
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,900
a still some other from

594
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,010
I'm as a from I wasn't easy so

595
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:12,810
we started to look into this not
interested you'll see that

596
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:15,980
this is also this is the list of all the
AM eyes that

597
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:19,930
and I am eyes and as a machine instance
so it's just a it's a virtual machine

598
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:24,710
that one virtual machine and this is a
little advice that they have

599
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:28,500
a what's interesting is all see this
2,768

600
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,130
am i listed of the nearly 2007

601
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:36,260
out that nearly 2,800 images Amazon
themselves provide

602
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,690
47 with the really

603
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:45,220
small presented Sanderson does not is
not the source for most the images

604
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:49,990
on ec2 which means be out of the
question where they come from

605
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:54,160
they come from people in the community
you can create an image

606
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,690
and stick it up on Amazon and have it
appear in this list that everyone else

607
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:02,210
get to see

608
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:05,450
what are the promises of the club is
that

609
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:11,070
these guys are pros at what they do they
do it really well

610
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:15,470
but if you're image that you're running
is both by

611
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:19,420
a guide to spare time that promises a
bit over a false promise

612
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:23,290
so what we decided to do with you let's
try and mister

613
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:26,610
the security abilities images some
definition

614
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:29,700
meta and so we want to find out Wall

615
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,900
all these a.m. eyes how many of them

616
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:37,140
a bundle to common comment things

617
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,930
but the contrary scan from outside
because it gets detected

618
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:44,890
II so what we try to do was the
following the also

619
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:48,460
clients can other people's images so
that'll get you

620
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:53,790
kinda booted so from within our own
account

621
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:57,580
on ec2 we get a list of all the
available images

622
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:01,950
up we put these on accused so the SQS

623
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:06,820
we then boot up 20 but machines about
virtual machines

624
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:11,050
and it took these runs Nessus because
that's got a neces-

625
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:15,250
instance a and he took both virtual
machines

626
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:18,410
boots up polls from the queue

627
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:21,810
an image that needs to be tested it
boots up

628
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:24,920
that image that needs to be tested it
scans the image

629
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,120
what this cat is completed shot that
image dog

630
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:31,720
as the you have we paralyze paralyze

631
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,520
Nessus can all the AM eyes at Amazon

632
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,410
provide and 16 got to compete at least
for the dayton is three and then the

633
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:42,560
attacker gets to

634
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,950
look at that date and it's really
interested so

635
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:51,610
2800 images biz almost 1300

636
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:55,200
issues that necessary it's as high okay
so that's

637
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,340
almost one in two images has got some
kinda

638
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:02,160
I've analytic a and almost one in

639
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,870
the wanted to say that almost one in
five

640
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:09,740
very speaking images has caught

641
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:13,010
a critical vulnerability now it's not

642
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:16,310
it's not necessarily completely accurate
getting

643
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:19,770
a bunch of those are much more
vulnerable than others but it is a bit

644
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:20,820
scary that

645
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:24,510
above all these images that are out
there

646
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:29,230
646 critical but abilities and that's
necessary mean you're not talking about

647
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:32,490
a we're not talking their data we're not

648
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:36,050
we talking well known issues that Evans
and

649
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:40,370
put that so the other thing is that we
found

650
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:43,680
so it's starting to dig through the
images looking through past histories

651
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,690
looking through my single history
looking through

652
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:50,200
all these things plot possibility
managed to pull out

653
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,680
keys that people use to create images
minutes pull out people's

654
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:59,570
GPT keys and so on and these are all
things that were left

655
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:03,020
in the image when the create a

656
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:08,050
both the emitted uploaded it as a and
left at that

657
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:11,640
so this data doesn't belong to Hamas and
it belongs to the people who originally

658
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,890
created

659
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:16,840
image up but really wanted to go again

660
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:20,620
for all that the little attacked the
people don't seem to ponder too much the

661
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,859
license steven is

662
00:40:21,859 --> 00:40:25,280
kinda funny just because it was so
successful so

663
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,430
we take an image or Evans and provide
members themselves provide a bunch of

664
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:34,370
Windows images putative the winners
images

665
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:39,060
so you use the gloriously named magical
Jelly Bean Keyfinder

666
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:43,660
you read that you get license key

667
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:46,840
from that and so that's the license key
that Amazon

668
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:52,340
used to install then on our own machines
we install

669
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:55,730
p.m. in which we runnin when those 2003

670
00:40:55,730 --> 00:41:00,320
sever and that license key works

671
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,660
a so here it is we've got Mikes openers

672
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:07,540
Server 2003 they dissented addition
runnin

673
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:12,160
base in the license key people as a that
other words you paid tribute 1

674
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:17,460
ec2 instance and I'll you but you know
license key with whatever

675
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:21,040
and just for good measure we want to
ensure that this thing would

676
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,920
verify with genuine advantage up

677
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,070
so the 10 unit pontotoc I mean this is
an example of people in updates in other

678
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,960
words Genuine Advantage has verified
that this is

679
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,450
indeed a legitimate install ok with it

680
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:38,609
so that's something that that doesn't
seem to be considered

681
00:41:38,609 --> 00:41:42,450
too much i mean if you Prince of out
there you've got to consider how it's

682
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:42,980
gonna be

683
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:46,050
old and licensed in on the back

684
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:48,920
up I wasn't that pays one of the other
services and it's quite interesting

685
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,840
because it allows you to

686
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:55,140
create your own image and upload it to
Amazon and have other people use that

687
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:55,960
image

688
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:00,170
and you get paid so you gonna do a
revenue sharing with

689
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:03,530
with Amazon which is quite cool

690
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:09,490
and so it takes us to our next video

691
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:09,850
in which
