00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,520
up web of contributed to security for a
long time

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,890
and two were contribute to

10
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:55,810
on

11
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:00,879
should be good

12

hiking chest I can just get water please
contact doctor

13
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,299
Haas um hi good morning everyone

14
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:15,009
%uh thanks for being a Saudi thanks for
the nice introduction and a

15
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:18,229
um sauna John played into it because

16
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:23,039
are like most often thanks I've got way
too many slides on that side to

17
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:26,390
get through as much of them as possible
so

18
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:30,950
up the first question you should have is
what's with the stupid title

19
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,360
some and well for those of you who have
seen it

20
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,800
the stupid title comes from a very nice
book by Ben Horowitz

21
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,840
um called the hot thing about hard
things

22
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,159
adjust to the show of hands have any of
you did it how that's interesting so

23
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,819
soul up Ben hollywood's is our mock and
leeson's pop now he's a stopped up guys

24
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,330
is done multiple startups

25
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:57,119
and the book is really aimed at someone
who wants to start a startup

26
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,009
and so he he aims it at the hot-hitting
kills what's hot about doing startups

27
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,829
and so I guess though next question
should be well

28
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:09,500
what the hell does that have to do with
security and it's a bit above each for

29
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,109
one thing

30
00:02:10,109 --> 00:02:13,560
give me a nice topic title um but well

31
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,400
getting McGraw who was he a few years
ago I'm he's got this podcast show

32
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,480
called the silver bullet and recently he
interviewed

33
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,880
the first see-saw um who have existed

34
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,480
and when he asked that guy what's your
one piece of advice for running as a

35
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,750
successful see-saw

36
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,220
that guy said you've gotta run security
has a stopped up

37
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,690
in your organization you've gotta run
your marketing department

38
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,420
you've got a long you guys essentially
you run your company within the company

39
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,459
and that's the only way you can make it
work um

40
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:48,400
sold so I think there's quite a few
overlapped and if for no other reason

41
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,329
I thought um this one quote just meant
that the overlap

42
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:56,329
was strong I'm when USC soul when you a
seal

43
00:02:56,329 --> 00:03:00,130
you don't sleep you sweat Utah a lot um

44
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,040
a solo really quickly the plan for the
stalk like most keynote

45
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,670
I'm going to hop off %uh treats from
famous treaters

46
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:11,170
um and then I'm gonna rip off smart
quotes

47
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,430
from I

48
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,750
older smarter guys um

49
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,080
if if we go a little bit back um way
back in

50
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,720
2011 um we put out a blog post from the
basic me

51
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,150
are without being too dramatic called it
all

52
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,950
upcoming information security apocalypse
okay and

53
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:35,360
up basically all premise was that when
InfoSec started twenty years ago

54
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,930
we kept saying we had no budget nobody
takes a seriously

55
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,640
arm we then hit the nineties we were
getting budget

56
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,220
we were getting management by in and for
little but we all went back and claimed

57
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,350
mission accomplished

58
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,650
okay but we were winning again script
kiddies Andrea winning against Monday

59
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,690
Dec to the tax

60
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:58,349
and like the other famous guy alone
mission accomplished was probably just a

61
00:03:58,349 --> 00:03:59,640
little bit premature

62
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,380
um and and what it was releasing in the
blog post

63
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,830
was all big a problem that was creeping
up on us

64
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,130
was that the board's didn't know ok and
I'll

65
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,630
all come to this point a few times
during the talk is

66
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:19,160
we've reached this point where everyone
no longer able to secure organizations

67
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,300
but the board swapping us all this money
didn't know that we couldn't secure

68
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,590
these organizations

69
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:29,070
cuz nobody told them and we didn't tell
them okay and all budgets

70
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:33,030
kept going upwards right in in the early
nineties

71
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:37,320
we were lucky if we got to go to one
conference now guys are doing conference

72
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,070
circuits

73
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:43,050
okay there's a whole bunch of money
pumped into it but kind of conveniently

74
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,180
kind of like in the great market are
crash

75
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,010
no one has told the people of putting
the ball yet that actually

76
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,330
we all just hoping that the stuff
doesn't hit on a watch

77
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,380
um and me up

78
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,550
some saw so a little late I'll

79
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,700
in in 2013 um we wrote another post

80
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,800
where we essentially said that look one
of the problems is

81
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,389
that some of these things a hot problems
like we don't know how to deal

82
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:13,820
I'll what some of these problems we
don't know how to write what

83
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,520
all respect to adopt the practice we
don't know how to fight

84
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,659
large applications up in a secure way it

85
00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:24,220
we don't know how to secure large
organizations are these number

86
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,120
yet for almost any security question
that's asked

87
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,600
like August on so is it's complicated

88
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,690
but by the time you say it's complicated
to some people someone else has slowed

89
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,030
in

90
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:39,990
and sold them a box with blinking lights
and

91
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,350
and when you say this you get a whole
crew of people who say but

92
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:48,810
but at least we doing something and kind
of what we were saying was that mold

93
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,870
doing something

94
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,770
isn't necessarily better that that
sometimes you actually running in the

95
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,740
wrong direction

96
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,490
and you actually gonna make things a
whole lot worse and of course

97
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,500
what all of these blog posts in with all
of these

98
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,410
are sort of talks we will obviously
super popular

99
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,560
um and her like there's one guy who

100
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,440
kept on happening on me like
consistently acted unfriend him on a few

101
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:12,780
things

102
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:16,990
'em and and one of these things like if
it's also broken why don't you just

103
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,900
leave why don't you become a truck
driver

104
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,440
um and I think what the guy didn't get

105
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,490
was criticizing it doesn't mean that we
think everyone's evil

106
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,740
we just trying to find a better way and
I'll

107
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,760
one of the quotes that ideally like for
this %uh was from admiral stockdale

108
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,730
but says you should never confuse the
fate that you won't prevail in the end

109
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,479
what the reality of your current
situation so saying

110
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:45,560
that right now we in deep deep trouble
doesn't mean we giving up hope

111
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,400
but it is the point that we need to stop
from we need to stop from the point that

112
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,000
says

113
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,560
are things are looking pretty bleak um

114
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,750
fortunately or unfortunately we don't
need to convince people so hot anymore

115
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,020
okay like the to some of things that
made this in the fourth

116
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,280
um what the combination of LulzSec and
an essay

117
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,000
um LulzSec went on and owned networks

118
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,690
left right and center with 2001 style
attacks

119
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:17,840
and the NSA went on and on everyone with
some attacks that were stayed on the

120
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,350
future

121
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,470
arm and so between the two of them they
managed to show all of us that

122
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:27,330
for the most part we were taking but
knives to gunfight

123
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:32,919
and and a really nice quote up was was
given by Brian snow also Brian snow if

124
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:33,820
you've never heard him

125
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,050
you should take any opportunity to
listen to me is a van the smart

126
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,460
ecstatic to of the NSA and he gave a
talk

127
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,009
bomb at the sidebar conference in Malta
and his talk was

128
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:47,789
are nicely titled our cyber security
status

129
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:51,130
is glum and the way ahead will be hot um

130
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:54,389
enhance his quote basically says got a
really hot Voice

131
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:58,350
he says I'm here to tell you that your
systems continue to function and serve

132
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:58,770
you

133
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:03,259
own me June to the sufferance of your
opponents

134
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:06,320
like the only reason your network some
of being owned

135
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,930
is because the opponents are not owning
them right now um

136
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,820
and this is the guy who was the head of
information assurance for the NSA

137
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,570
and are in part he was talking to an
balled up golf

138
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:21,130
audience so why are people saying

139
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:24,229
that there's such a rough times ahead
arm

140
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:27,259
or different people have eased different
explanations

141
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:32,010
fall for why they think it is um and
Saul go to a few of them and then

142
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,560
then discuss are my take on it so if you
ask den Gio

143
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:40,430
arm he says that the problem is you
dealing with sent into ponents

144
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:44,029
and the fate of changes too great okay
so

145
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:47,580
you often hear the logic that says we
know how to bowl to kill bridges why

146
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,080
can't we just do science and bold secure
all

147
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,230
on that X and the difference is when you

148
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,470
both the bridge nature doesn't been
change its plan to take a bitch dawn

149
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,330
okay but sentient opponents do they
constantly work against you

150
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:05,250
um so his big things that he's been
raising the simply

151
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,209
is the fate of changes says look we are
making progress but we're not making

152
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:11,270
progress nearly quickly enough

153
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:15,310
we getting new people into the field but
not as many as we need

154
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:18,380
um and getting withdrawal

155
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,760
like I said he can noted here a few
years back if you ask him

156
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,940
um what the problem is I'm he'll tell
you that the problem is that

157
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,120
everybody focuses on the bug parade um

158
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,779
and nobody's actually focusing on secure
engineering

159
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:36,440
oMG which is pretty self-explanatory

160
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,529
um and if you ask %uh richard Bennett
click

161
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:44,149
he'll tell you that the problem is China
a

162
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:49,190
K um the

163
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:53,040
%uh in seriousness I'll arm

164
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,050
one of the other cult I decided to look
at what called strike

165
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,630
and they tell you that the problem is
not a malware problem

166
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,100
it's an adverse to the problem it sounds
really cool

167
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,560
but I'm not really sure um what to do
with that just

168
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,370
up in 270 the stroller stop but that's
actually trademarked

169
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:14,730
thank you can say like yes someone's
applied for a trademark white

170
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,230
um so so at this point the question is

171
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,890
um what I'm saying the problem is and

172
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,390
and for all were taken at essentially um

173
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,860
we figured the problem was this um and
what they clearly mean by that

174
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,510
is arm the horrible abuse of been
diagrammed

175
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:36,529
the okay because of if

176
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:39,959
if you look at this there's been the
exam its the

177
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:44,480
like it's they want even trying like
those colors don't mean anything

178
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,529
the little component in the center
doesn't mean anything

179
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:51,880
I'm not sure who JSC that they see that
you can't help but this is

180
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,760
almost the worst then diagram I've seen
in my life we seen one loss

181
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,130
um the psalm so I'm gonna take some time
to talk about

182
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:03,410
from the problems that we think we have
and and

183
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,820
in terms of the problems there's a bunch
of them um

184
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:10,470
but one component of it is that the odd
genuinely

185
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,270
via the hot problems that need solving
ok and ima spend a little bit of time

186
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,360
going through some of those problems

187
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,560
from that we think are hot and so

188
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,649
well well kinda fix this a little bit in
fact let's

189
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:26,010
stop it from having that overlap so
there's no confusion at all

190
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,140
um n and will stop with the simple one

191
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:33,000
okay with with the problem with
complexity and

192
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,130
I know um lots of the young people today
all the young whippersnappers

193
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,839
pic on up Bruce Schneier because these
days he

194
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,410
he talks a lot in this stuff seems a
little more hand maybe than it used to

195
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:44,800
be

196
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,209
um but he wrote a blog post

197
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:52,449
um in which he basically said look the
complexity of these systems

198
00:11:52,449 --> 00:11:56,189
is what's going to kill us okay and you
don't have to go through all of that the

199
00:11:56,189 --> 00:11:57,310
link saying the slides

200
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,899
'em but essentially he says what the
networks of the future

201
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:04,189
gonna be more complex and therefore less
secure

202
00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:08,620
and there's an economic incentive to
create it at the lowest quality that

203
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,300
will fly

204
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,709
and unless we change this we gonna get
more complex systems

205
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:18,379
that we can manage from a security point
of view and the sounds perfectly sane

206
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:22,019
but what you've got to give shy attended
for is that he was saying it

207
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:25,410
in 1999 okay I'm

208
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:28,470
the question is if he was saying that
this was going to be a problem in

209
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,439
nineteen I'm

210
00:12:29,439 --> 00:12:32,449
how do we look now and I guess the
answer

211
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:36,389
is reasonably predictable okay we follow
us

212
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:40,139
and we can take some some quick
snapshots to look at how the stocks

213
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:40,879
walked out

214
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:44,480
um the Linux kernel in nineteen one

215
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,509
was comprised of ten thousand lines of
code

216
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:51,660
give or take in 2012

217
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,899
we were adding about 10,500 lines of
code

218
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:58,939
put day to the Linux kernel okay

219
00:12:58,939 --> 00:13:03,500
um so it's currently sitting at all and
are $20 million according to their comp

220
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,629
arm con Spidi um and

221
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:10,170
that stuff if you go and look at chrome
your web browser

222
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:14,079
I'm sitting somewhere at around 15
million lines of code

223
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,449
okay um which essentially means that

224
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:24,319
the next time you browse the Web Site
you getting so many thousands of cold

225
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:24,949
pots

226
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:28,600
between your desktop OS the Connell

227
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,160
chest to be able to browse that site and
we're not even talking about Windows

228
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,240
doing font ending in the Connell
anything like that

229
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,649
your a tax office is so great just for
doing some ball things

230
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:43,660
that it's obviously way beyond any
reasonable amount of control

231
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,819
and then the problem gets a whole lot
what's

232
00:13:46,819 --> 00:13:49,870
arm so a guy called Jerome Dom bug

233
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:54,309
at sprite mods um did have an
interesting post a little while back

234
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:57,529
when he started looking at his old hard
drives

235
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:00,150
okay say pulled out these hard times and
started looking

236
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:03,490
at them and what he found was Hong

237
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,460
most modern hard drives you've got three
family functioning

238
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:13,010
CPU cores okay and soul on his hard
drive he then loaded Linux

239
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:18,120
okay so saw so we're not talking about
he installed Linux on his hard drive

240
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,890
i'm saying he have and the Knicks on the
process of on his hard drive

241
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,950
okay and and that should give you um

242
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:29,380
pause to think about what's going on
here okay because more and more

243
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:34,340
your machine is no longer the a
processor its multiple microprocessors

244
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,560
and you don't even know how many of them
are in your machine anymore

245
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,130
and take message um

246
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,340
and if if we take a quick look

247
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:48,230
um also on last year I think the guys
from panic

248
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:51,560
are not security guys at all um I US
developers

249
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,710
um were having problems with beer on
lightning

250
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:59,300
digital AV cable and the one getting the
resolution they expected

251
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,440
so they took a hacksaw to it and

252
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,050
interestingly following that those
things are running

253
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:10,110
and om system-on-a-chip also with two
gigs of ram

254
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,450
okay so so literally you'd

255
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:17,450
y'all video adapter is now a computer

256
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,200
a Cayenne and just to take it one stage
worth

257
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,470
um you have money and jobs um

258
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,900
they did their DCCC talk in 2013

259
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,570
and they started taking a look at these
micro SD cuts

260
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:35,700
and but they didn't have any interesting
talk that you should go check out

261
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,530
but essentially they fall on the even
these micro SD cards

262
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:44,790
have tiny all processes on it and these
tiny ARM processors are sometimes giving

263
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,230
you a hundred megahertz

264
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:49,630
arm %uh CPU's performance levels

265
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:53,490
and and these things are being added
foot 30 US cents

266
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,760
on each of these St cuts arm but
essentially

267
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,080
but so so the talk was awesome they
basically end up man in the middling

268
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:05,370
the processors on those SD cards so
those little piece of plastic

269
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:09,010
that if you're like me you didn't even
know was a computer

270
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,310
was actually supported by bunny and all
are but

271
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,959
bunny and salt

272
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:16,870
okay so at this point if nothing else

273
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,959
it allows us to steal a quote from the
hollow its book

274
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:24,230
with says you've dropped into the birth
and you might never get out

275
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:27,290
okay um but like most things

276
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:31,790
if you talking about into dependency and
the problems that we have with into

277
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,620
dependency

278
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,959
you kinda gonna bump into the fact that

279
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:38,959
FX has said smock things about it first

280
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,370
okay so um FX and taken

281
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:47,180
release the papal called back to basics
in which they basically cooked

282
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,579
spoke about the danger that we have with
composite systems

283
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:53,889
and the called on the Israeli the money
shot

284
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:58,319
where he says in a composite system the
is no critical gate

285
00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:04,360
every everything is a gate I

286
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,370
so so the papers what the meeting and
it's what looking at

287
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:12,270
because they make a pretty forcing
listen you trying to add points security

288
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:16,470
on something where you attack as well
always find the composites that a week

289
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,640
and we have and almost unlimited are

290
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,780
number of composites um home %uh gave a
keynote

291
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,939
well at some point called johnnie contel

292
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:30,220
are if he's compromised and he
essentially

293
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,880
listed seven things way he said look if
we could do these 7 things

294
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,150
we could tell if we will compromised or
we could tell how

295
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,320
owned we will um and fairly predictably

296
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,510
um with all current computing set we can
do none of them

297
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:50,299
okay so we can verify all bootloaders
week on many fights signed cold

298
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:54,580
essentially the machines as we have them
now we unable to tell

299
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,230
if we walk compromised and we can go
back to a pristine state

300
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:02,570
um and so help us conclusion at that
point

301
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:07,140
was given the current machines went deep
deep trouble

302
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,520
okay so if my number one complaint was
complexity

303
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,710
um number two that i'm gonna bring up
then is

304
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:17,210
the state of software okay because into

305
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:21,070
we are provably bed at fighting secure
software

306
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:24,450
okay and arm when I say probably

307
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:28,740
I'm gonna take a few examples that that
hopefully make my case

308
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,940
so for those of you at all and are in

309
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:37,350
99 you remember that the mother someone
member love you mom went to the wrong

310
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,040
and that number went on an all of us use
this in all presentations

311
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:47,150
um thanks to the guys some Qaeda um but
2001 was very Microsoft horrible your

312
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,050
for security

313
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:51,310
I'm 2001 2002 they were hammered to help

314
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:54,310
um end an interesting thing happened

315
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:57,970
in December 2001 are Michael Howard

316
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,140
and David the blank pushed out writing
secure code

317
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,300
and they managed to convince both gates
that this is a serious problem

318
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,600
and book it is are not a dummy and

319
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,280
he put out his trustworthy computing
memo and

320
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,100
um if if you've never seen the memo he
basically said to Microsoft listen I

321
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:16,390
don't

322
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:21,550
often do this but when I do it it's big
and I'm saying if we don't fix all stuff

323
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:25,710
people are not going to use us and he's
a little more dramatic he actually says

324
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,710
people are not going to use computers

325
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,780
because if we come get them trusting
machines again

326
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,860
there's going to be no trust and and we
all gonna die in a fire

327
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:39,070
um and so the question that we've got to
ask then

328
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,760
is 10 things reasonably change and

329
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,870
I guess the almost on say is in lots of
ways microsoft today is much better than

330
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:47,880
the Microsoft

331
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,160
are that was when you concede at
conferences

332
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:57,240
in 2001 if you went to a black cat all
the guys what they're from Microsoft had

333
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,030
their beds

334
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,720
and Microsoft went from hiding at Black
Cat

335
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:06,190
to speaking at Black Cat to running the
own version of black cat called

336
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:09,320
blue hat ok and they swallowed hates

337
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,640
K talent they they swallowed LSD guys
and they swallowed Matt Miller

338
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:19,130
and we've got a sell-off from them in SE
hop from them and slashed GS from them

339
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:22,400
but what's interesting is if you take a
look at though

340
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,430
both Feb patch update that went out in
2015

341
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,790
arm and I saved a local copy here just
because of

342
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:33,100
from how horrible it actually was now

343
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:39,500
let's see if we can quickly go to it
will do a skit

344
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,420
on if you went to it I

345
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:48,110
Sony this was

346
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:52,380
their patch update that went out in Feb
and I want you just to look at

347
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:56,520
Internet Explorer down here okay and
what you will see

348
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,900
is forty to remote code execution

349
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,100
or important may be warmed

350
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:07,000
requires a restart elevation of
privilege chest

351
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,890
Internet Explorer okay this is a company
that has now spent

352
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:16,440
mohicans that this turn themselves in on
an and I'm not saying that that the bed

353
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,590
like David E one of the poster child for
good SDLC

354
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:24,540
but in their flagship product they had
42

355
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,880
exploitable bugs in their last patch
update

356
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,140
okay something there's there's more to
it than

357
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,570
and we've got some serious problems om

358
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:37,990
one of our problems right now is how to
restart this presentation

359
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:42,610
up should find it um

360
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:48,110
find the mouse

361
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:52,179
Moss was here I

362
00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:58,030
try to haha um

363
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:01,350
the soul the good news I guess is when a
small and I

364
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:05,270
because if Microsoft doing badly at it
open source will save us

365
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:10,410
okay and I guess are the slaves as got
enough a hammering and I

366
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:14,870
guess though open source can save us
stuff is gonna get solved left with just

367
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:15,950
one slide

368
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:19,110
um and I'll talk a little bit more but
open SSL

369
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:24,020
are in a little bit um n and one of the
bugs that were interesting for me what

370
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,850
shell shock

371
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:28,220
okay not just because someone in the
audience was the one who actually gave

372
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:28,990
it its name

373
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:32,390
um but what was interesting to me about
shell shock

374
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:35,790
was that even boxes that I had that
headlong

375
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:39,960
kind of left as in a secure state of all
mobile

376
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,110
because suddenly I had prop male photos
that will putting in

377
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:46,970
that we're going to be the leading bash
and we're going to be vulnerable if they

378
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:47,710
were attacked

379
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,900
and its almost the perfect example of

380
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:55,190
a whole bunch of composite systems with
something was gonna own you that you

381
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,630
probably forgot about

382
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:00,890
arm a long time ago and one of the
things that's interesting

383
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:05,059
is that even companies who really have
every incentive

384
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:08,970
to do security light still manage to do
it wrong

385
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:13,429
when it comes to software so I'm not
sure how many of you have seen

386
00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:17,590
the whole back home thing you can pick
your our headline with the most

387
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,330
hyperbole

388
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:22,010
it's an any safely a secret starting
back box

389
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:26,900
bomb it's the world's most secure
Android phone I guess that's a low bar

390
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,420
are now

391
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,870
ultra secure smartphone

392
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:37,010
made for secret agents okay and probably
the one slide

393
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:40,160
arm that fixes that i'm for those of you
who don't know

394
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,190
that smart dodd up so macht old is

395
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:46,450
a crazy talented um called auditor

396
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,870
but what's interesting is that mocked
old

397
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:54,100
um so he released a remotely exploitable
bug

398
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:58,170
while he was playing with his phone so
he didn't even

399
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:01,590
officially do this or that for black
phone and

400
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:06,670
and not tell it's clearly a genius if if
you use mock told as your ball for

401
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:11,720
all the way exploitable been then you
setting that bob really hot but what

402
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,490
is interesting to me his if I told you I
was putting out to secure form

403
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:20,820
how many attack Evans do you think I'd
have on this fall

404
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,030
is the baseband this SMS's

405
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:28,300
this just a handful of places way input
comes into that device

406
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,180
and the super secure NSA proof on

407
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:36,160
was take a ball by sending them an SMS
okay

408
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,320
and these are guys who are funded be not
idiots

409
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,700
um the guy invented pgp um

410
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,920
and they couldn't do that right okay n
others

411
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:50,110
in the security community haven't done
much better I'm to view cell from Google

412
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,020
took aim

413
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,630
at sauce at some point he ended up
saying

414
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:58,360
installing saw false exposes machines to
considerable dusk

415
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,580
to show you that it's not just saw foss
up my

416
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:06,360
but Jux incorrect took a look at komodo
he figured that it took them longer to

417
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,290
install them to actually find the bugs
in Komodo

418
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:13,480
um at some point at some point fed a
code

419
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,150
bomb actually the least big of that
compared

420
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:20,750
but different software for articles

421
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:25,059
and security companies came second only
to the CMS guys

422
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:28,160
for how badly security software fit

423
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,030
okay so only 30 percent of the cold
supplied by

424
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,190
security companies passed on first
submission

425
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:39,070
okay which which prompted FX to say that
just

426
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,960
on the basis of things you bet of
protecting and network with Microsoft

427
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,490
Word

428
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:46,630
some then than with the checkpoint file

429
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:52,880
the

430
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,830
um soul interestingly we don't just kept

431
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:01,740
the strong in terms of memory corruption
and overflows

432
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,200
a big male is the Thunderbird plugin

433
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,070
that handles pgp for you and at some
point

434
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:12,290
recently they had a bug where they'd
just not

435
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:16,900
and cooked stuff that was BC seed so
it's not like an email exists

436
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,960
for any other reason it exists to
encrypt your mail

437
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,150
and the one thing that it forgot to do
was income junk mail

438
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:26,710
um Sol soft whisper the bed

439
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,919
um and and I'm saying that

440
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,290
a big problem that we've got is a
problem

441
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:38,650
what all markets being broken and one of
the biggest contributions that I think

442
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:39,770
security can

443
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:43,840
can actually make to the world and I'll
cut in state is that we give them

444
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,970
a number of examples of almost perfect
market failure

445
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:53,330
okay we've got we've got some him but
then he almost perfect examples of it on

446
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:57,679
we've got tools that everyone says
doesn't walk that dominate the industry

447
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,230
we have a skills gap that everyone knows
exists

448
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:05,010
but the market isn't falling um we've
got software

449
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:08,110
that's being used by every security
professional

450
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:12,890
that exists that Kant managed to get
funded to stay awake

451
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:16,100
um soap so you know we've we pretty much
saw

452
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,880
hitting all of them soul recently this
hit the news

453
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,260
%uh in a big way which is %uh there's
one guy

454
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:28,600
essentially running no PG and and what's
interesting is that cool PG

455
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,670
isn't just used by our site its use by
MTV

456
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:35,890
in the of every Linux distribution that
they is because they signing their

457
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:36,610
pictures

458
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:40,400
Armwood GPG and essentially

459
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,530
0 vote no was making twenty-five
thousand dollars per year

460
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:48,150
i'm for the ten years that he's been
working on GPG

461
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,200
I N if you know compare um

462
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,710
I went looking this is a I forget it

463
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,830
actual official name this is an icebox
that

464
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:02,040
what went on Kickstarter because it
would like to show drinks

465
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,820
and play music for you and these guys

466
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,120
raised $13 million dollars um

467
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,430
and all what's what's worse than that is

468
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:16,540
at some point after that ought to go hit
GPG made a little bit of money

469
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:20,520
am NOT saying in same money i'm saying
he now made a hundred grand

470
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:25,540
and articles came out saying well now
the test is what's he going to do with

471
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:25,830
it

472
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:30,030
okay and you had um an academic was
normally a really smart Matt Greene

473
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:30,500
saying

474
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,970
well the question is how will that money
be spent now

475
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:39,050
like for ten years this dude has walked
on G PG for 25k

476
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,120
at this point if you want to take the
110 and spend it

477
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:49,120
on hookers and blow I think you should
tho

478
00:28:49,549 --> 00:28:51,970
come soul just

479
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:57,450
to rub it in this guy on Kickstarter man
in today's 55,000 to make potato salad

480
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:58,250
arm

481
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:01,610
like here um

482
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:04,909
but at least one with potato salad you
know what you're getting

483
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:08,309
um one of the big problems that we bump
into

484
00:29:08,309 --> 00:29:12,250
um is the asymmetry of information and
and this leads to a

485
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:17,860
a pretty classic of market failure so at
some point it did a talk on why I think

486
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,289
pen testing doesn't solve the problem
anymore

487
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:24,470
um and I used our example of the market
for lemons

488
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:28,409
I'm if you guys haven't seen it by now
there's up people from the 70's and

489
00:29:28,409 --> 00:29:29,549
economics paper

490
00:29:29,549 --> 00:29:33,279
that talks about up but essentially you
have this market

491
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:38,149
where you either have lemons of any nice
cause that could be bought

492
00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:41,380
because the buyout doesn't know which
they are

493
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,580
the buyers lowered his expectations

494
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,880
and prepares to pay for lemons expecting
it to be lemons

495
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,340
as a result most people with good goods

496
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:54,779
take them out and at some point the
market is dominated

497
00:29:54,779 --> 00:29:58,039
just buy lemons arm and it's up twenty

498
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:01,760
classic market failure and i'm saying
InfoSec

499
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,909
we bump into the small the time because
buyers contel

500
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:10,409
what's a good product and what's a bad
product paleo what the expectation too

501
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:11,350
bad products

502
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:15,049
and good products get to them out of the
market um

503
00:30:15,049 --> 00:30:19,250
so there's a number of examples of this
um all all was through a couple

504
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,470
I'm not sure if you guys have use the
secure messenger

505
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:26,610
telegram um at some point they took a
lot of flak because they put up that

506
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:27,770
cold and then stall

507
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:32,470
didn't put up they called they put up
Telegram & said we are secure

508
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:36,730
like you should use us and then they did
almost

509
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:41,490
the perfectly classically wrong thing
when trying to prove the Cup 2010 song

510
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:45,390
they held a contest okay and famously

511
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:48,460
shania has cited it and Moxie wrote

512
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:52,169
attend on a bit on white contests I'm
not a good way to test

513
00:30:52,169 --> 00:30:55,789
cooktop okay but the thing that I found
interesting here

514
00:30:55,789 --> 00:31:00,170
was up almost the same time telegram
messenger head

515
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:04,090
five million dollar molds I think that
week they had six million downloads

516
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:08,390
and at the same time would you many can
see is Moxie's

517
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:12,110
tech secure had between 200,000 and
500,000

518
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:15,760
installs globally okay so here you have
a guy

519
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,840
who did always crypto in the open
published everything

520
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,330
all of the stuff was open source
couldn't get to a million

521
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:26,720
and other guys hit six million in a week
and in part it's just because we don't

522
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,660
know any better

523
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,930
um there's a few examples of it

524
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:35,560
so I'm not sure if you guys saw the big
of us about the aviator brawls up

525
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,640
so the guys at White et will use the
browser called

526
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,770
aviator again toned on headlines

527
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:46,000
the most secure web browser secure
private web browser

528
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,230
arm and at some point guys actually took
a look at the cold

529
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:53,650
arm again to view so took a look at it
um

530
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:57,230
he spent a few moments on it and
essentially fond

531
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:01,470
the web browser basically that data back
take on stuff that you pasta

532
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:06,300
so you could possible please execute cal
and it would pop calcd for you

533
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:10,520
um but all what's the most interesting
about that

534
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,900
is how if you guys recognize the name
Justin shoe

535
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,230
some so there's a few and I'm guessing

536
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:20,510
%uh those are the guys who fed the heart
of security assessment of the security

537
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,380
assessment

538
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,400
so he's also a cold auditing legend

539
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,230
and then he wrote this piece and
something that's interesting years he

540
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,020
talks about

541
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:34,260
the chrome team any says kroll security
has 34 time members

542
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:38,770
okay and and then he says chrome privacy
has another dozen also

543
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:42,740
but what's interesting is that if you go
back to this headline

544
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,460
this just no way for you to tell the
difference between those two

545
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:49,680
okay from the outside you really can't
tell

546
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:53,720
that's Cup popping um

547
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,810
the same thing kind of happens um it's
something I

548
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:01,230
I bring up often um the guy's a job
security spend a

549
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:04,800
has led almost every security innovation
that's come out

550
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:09,190
operating systems for at least the last
fifteen years

551
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:13,270
and into your spend a makes almost
nothing

552
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:16,550
he certainly not making as much as

553
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:19,820
what one of those intelligence feed
companies

554
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,970
currently charge for intelligence feeds
which %uh

555
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:26,130
dubious at best okay and

556
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:29,960
some hold the market can't distinguish
because if you went to your company and

557
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,730
said I wanted to pay spend a foot job
security

558
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:36,120
it's just not the same as being able to
say I want to pay

559
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,340
called strike for that threat
intelligence feed

560
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:44,240
on droving panda or something like that
okay

561
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,030
end and that kind of brings us to the
fact that incentives

562
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:51,040
in the industry up pretty messed up

563
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,770
and their big reason for lots of all a
market failures

564
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:58,480
okay because you see these horribly
mixed incentives popping up

565
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,420
all the time um in development are
helpful pointed out that look managers

566
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,120
get paid

567
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,510
for shipping called I'm by the time you
actually figure out that they called was

568
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,050
bad

569
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:13,340
they've taken their bonuses and left
okay and it's not just

570
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:17,290
companies that do this um with a quick
show of hands home a few here

571
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:20,400
%uh donning always 10 so currently on a
Mac

572
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,429
okay some more than ha 4 p.m. um

573
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:28,910
do you guys remember when you started
what was the version of Windows when you

574
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:34,400
when you swapped over to Mac hat das
okay so your number all school

575
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,200
up

576
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,690
so what's interesting is

577
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:42,540
but all the time that arm always 10 got
popular again

578
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:48,200
was when Microsoft it just shipped first
up and her style was arguably Microsoft

579
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,270
most secure

580
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:53,140
operating system certainly on a
one-for-one comparison

581
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:57,660
with her star and always 10 at the time
must still would have kicked always 10

582
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,920
all over the place but almost everyone
in

583
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,360
I know in security absolutely didn't
care um

584
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:08,880
for whatever reason for lots of them
being valid we moved over to always 10

585
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,290
and never look back but one of the
things to note their

586
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:17,290
is Halloween incentivized one company
spent a whole bunch of time

587
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:21,600
turning this shit but on and focusing on
security and the moment they put out the

588
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,720
most secure loss

589
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,480
everyone went USC prompts every minute
the Sox

590
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,200
and they moved over to something easier
okay

591
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,410
n and that stuff happens a lot okay um

592
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:36,670
you you don't often see the market
punish anyone

593
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:42,320
for being in secure and this probably
lessons that we need to learn in that

594
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,240
just in terms of knowing our place in
the world whiteness helping us phrasal

595
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,380
arguments better

596
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:50,530
so everyone likes to pick on article

597
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:53,690
everyone likes to ham on the fact that
they told

598
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:57,540
unbreakable stuff and up at some point

599
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:02,150
the whole bunch of treats because David
Litchfield gave up back at Def Con talk

600
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:05,570
that basically took on a call to the
cleaners again and so

601
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:09,420
everyone was talking about it David
Litchfield said we're giving them an

602
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:14,080
F for security okay and and really smart
guys like you fun from call

603
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,370
of waltzing other calls consistently bed

604
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:20,790
and Veda called our voter thing saying
these guys

605
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:24,410
consistently don't get it at exactly

606
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:27,610
the same time that we were all saying
how much they suck

607
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:31,910
um there was this Tweet that said one of
the best comebacks

608
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:36,000
in tech history okay and what you should
see on that car

609
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,060
is the fact that articles been
completely honorable

610
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:42,060
has made no difference to on a call the
stock

611
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:45,540
okay and interestingly

612
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,800
um this question of how much

613
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,580
share prices affected by security and
security features

614
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:56,400
does come up periodically um Sobule
Woods took top previous guys

615
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,660
work and put it into a live spreadsheet
so you can see this at any given time

616
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:05,490
and what he's looking at is all of the
famous preachers down on the left

617
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:08,760
and what they cut on stock prices look
like on the right

618
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,450
okay and there's no dismal visible DUP

619
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:16,400
at all now people will go and tell you
that there's reasons for this

620
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,390
and up you need to look at other things
but one of the things to consider is

621
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:25,730
how InfoSec folks a stall throwing out
the line that somehow

622
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:28,980
your share price is affected by security

623
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,080
and if we keep saying that we just gonna
look stupid

624
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,530
because even people like The Washington
Post have figured out

625
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:39,310
that that's just not true okay n the
stops being

626
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:43,680
one more true recently any if you
remember the snapping

627
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,750
okay that's when all of those snapchat
pictures went out

628
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:49,840
um the earth kind of optic

629
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:53,520
is where that incident happened didn't
affect them at all

630
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,530
home if you remember the snapping you
remember the other called it happened to

631
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:58,050
what Apple what the law

632
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:02,350
fat burning it's a safe bet that Apple
stock didn't take any dip

633
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:05,390
um Eva um

634
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:10,230
so still really quickly um I want to
touch on another problem that we've got

635
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:14,680
which is one of organizations 'em
increasingly the sea salt all

636
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:19,790
is ridiculously complex arm I've been
thinking about this affair but recently

637
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:20,110
in

638
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:23,520
and we'll tell you some stuff assume
that mean we've written down

639
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,380
but in truth I think we need to do
something desperately with the see-saw

640
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,450
um looking at the sea salt all today

641
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:36,560
I don't think a single person can can
manage it like we use to expect them to

642
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,530
and um I took another quote show which
Marco made me promise that I won't

643
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:46,120
of course you guys to lead but but this
is actually a quote from one piece

644
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:50,070
fuckin and in one piece the guy
basically

645
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:53,980
%uh of the basically goes to a section
that says everyone looks

646
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,930
at an attack after

647
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:59,540
a general has lost and then has the
reasons and says like why didn't that

648
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,010
general move his troops

649
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:05,220
he says in the on say is because you
seeing that incident with the Stockton

650
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:05,820
and

651
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:09,270
but that general was engaged ovoid years

652
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:12,980
and the day that he had to make that
decision he also to make a hundred other

653
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,840
decisions

654
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:17,630
and so the decision just didn't look the
same to that general

655
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:20,750
in that incident and this is kind of
what happens with

656
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:25,190
in the breach that happens so talk gets
beach in all of us go all why won't they

657
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:25,890
doing this

658
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:29,180
and someone else gets breach and we say
oh no to affect all

659
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:33,440
and we all act like rerunning that'll
organizations are we pushing that all

660
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,050
clients

661
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:38,080
and lots of the time we just on and

662
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:42,130
one of the big problems that we have
here is a question of how we calculate

663
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,200
rusk

664
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,790
and my on so is I don't know how we
should be doing this

665
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:51,140
like dead guys talked alt are very nice

666
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:54,260
a leak rations and Damien nice are other
questions

667
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:58,760
but I think that we've got a fundamental
problem with how we calculate risk

668
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:03,710
and am what I mean here is that there
are people in your organization

669
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:07,970
who understand business risk but there's
no way that those guys

670
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:11,240
understand the technical intricacies of
what sets underneath

671
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:15,140
of for example ohs us talking to tomato
and basil recently

672
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:19,210
and I wonder how many boards in how many
companies

673
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:23,460
understand that somewhere in their
company is a lowly paid

674
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:27,160
d/b/a who has full access to everything
in the database

675
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,720
of which board member understands that
the helpdesk I

676
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,020
can reset the exchange guys poss word

677
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:39,300
and read all the mail in the
organization because I'm willing to bet

678
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:39,920
that im

679
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,060
boards near that boards would be hopping
mad

680
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:46,630
but the problem is that those guys won
the stand

681
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:50,690
don't understand all of these connected
pieces and all of the people who know

682
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:51,950
the connected pieces

683
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:55,110
probably don't know how scared they
should be um

684
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:59,810
but but they should be pretty scared um
because really don't get the stuff

685
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:02,750
um some gonna skip this

686
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:05,680
um and security is really bad at

687
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,080
at talking business and figuring out up
business thinking

688
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:12,450
up risky business is one of my favorite
podcasts

689
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:15,900
but this I heard there'd be a separate
so the little while back

690
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,960
when someone first pitch the idea of
square

691
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,500
um Sol so much if you guys have scenes
quayle scenes Cherie alternatives

692
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,750
um basically the guy who started one of
the founders of Twitter started this

693
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:28,430
company

694
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:32,100
that allows every phone to be a credit
card point-of-sale

695
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:36,800
ok and they do bolivians of business and
they're enabled small businesses

696
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:41,100
um to do great things but when risky
business guys heard of this they all

697
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:41,520
went

698
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,380
how stupid like that's an insane musk
this will never fly

699
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:49,380
that's like like today the tunnel Bob
billions of dollars because

700
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,500
sometimes we just don't get it and

701
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:56,780
I'm not sure how many of you did the
Cuckoo's egg like most about our

702
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,980
all all guys came into it having added
comfort stall at some point

703
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:04,790
and console if you haven't had the the
Cuckoo's egg you should

704
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:09,740
tonight arm but but this some very nice
quotes that Crawford stole gave to

705
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:13,710
um newsweek at some point way says the
cyber business

706
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:17,110
Monday promising us catalog shopping
point-and-click

707
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:20,920
will order airline tickets over the
network like the stuff never gonna

708
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,890
happen because

709
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:25,590
the sole internet thing is just the fed
and it's never going to be secure

710
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:29,170
is that whole body electric public
electronic publishing you have anything

711
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:31,040
we gonna be in a box on the desk

712
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:36,500
is like the stuff will never happen okay
so maybe sometimes a security folks get

713
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,480
that stuff from

714
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:42,280
um and one of the interesting things
when you look at organizations

715
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:47,320
and and white they fundamentally broken
for security is you've got this horrible

716
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,760
mixed reporting line problem um soul

717
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,070
a macho home if you started off in

718
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:57,210
network support to help desk support but
when

719
00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:01,100
I did network admin almost the default
page that I had on

720
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:06,490
on my machine one Novell's T ideas okay
like almost everything you needed an on

721
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:08,150
so fault there was a Novell to

722
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:12,180
that helped you and if you look at help
disguise today they love

723
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:17,110
in Microsoft TechNet okay so these guys
Lomond i buy help quickly they can

724
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:18,040
provisioning

725
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:23,870
you XP or Windows seven desktops and now
some guy from security wants to tell you

726
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:25,140
that you should be running

727
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:28,210
Joanne other calls cuz cubes all

728
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:31,530
you should be running chromium well you
should be running infancia

729
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:34,950
you've got to have fundamental competing
goals

730
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:39,910
the guy was managing the helpdesk wants
to be able to solve problems quickly

731
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:43,450
and he's got all of Microsoft TechNet to
tell him how to do it

732
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:46,680
you want to push infancia and bromine

733
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:50,020
which may be has an okay support page

734
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:53,270
okay those two things are fundamentally
different cells

735
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:56,550
and you not gonna convince the security
guy or

736
00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:01,310
if you convince the security guy of the
sale he's gonna fight like hell to be

737
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:04,850
able to get that into the organization
at the other end other mentors how if

738
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,110
you feel drunk cubes

739
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:10,480
in your organization infancia

740
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:16,560
chromium but these types of stats even I
can do the calculations

741
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,040
like

742
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,090
okay and and one of the big problems in
organizations

743
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:26,680
like I said is one of the things we
fundamentally now

744
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:31,820
is that you Kant jest by security but
boards don't know this

745
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:35,650
because everything else that they want
they can buy and

746
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:39,070
I feel wean a dangerous spot because we
haven't

747
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:43,580
sufficiently told them this like full
while we've been taking their money

748
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:46,800
and I don't think it's clear enough

749
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,250
to them that actually we don't have a
lot to show for the money

750
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:55,410
and maybe we won't have a lot to show
for it for a long time um

751
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:59,820
soul problems with people a promise to
build any quickly cuz I think I'm late

752
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:03,580
um Expo a habit all good okay so

753
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:06,910
expertise is Vandy meesh okay and

754
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:11,680
I think we all know this um but what I'm
gonna tell you is we've got a bigger

755
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,380
problem

756
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:16,300
than just the meesh are expertise and
that step

757
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:19,360
overview informed overview

758
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,470
is even here to these days so den Gio

759
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:25,640
when he talks about one of the big
problems that he sees coming

760
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:30,630
he says anyone who's new to the industry
you've got to tell them to specialize

761
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:35,170
like the field is now sold I've us that
someone has to be

762
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:38,510
good at a certain thing it means he'll
be bad other things

763
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:42,230
but increasingly what it means is we
don't have people

764
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:46,390
who have a good overview of everything
okay and this is going to be

765
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:50,410
increasingly a bigger problem for us
because at some point someone needs to

766
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:51,800
make informed decisions

767
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,040
and when you've got your infrastructure
guy you're up sick guy

768
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:59,320
and your policies guy all telling you
that their problems the biggest one

769
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,520
someone needs to make an informed call
on what that means

770
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:06,050
up so the first one getting Miche skills

771
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:09,940
that's a huge problem and it's me.
fixable this one of

772
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:13,690
of being the smart guys who have an
overview I'm not sure what we gonna do

773
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:14,420
about that

774
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:18,400
um and one of the bigger problems if you
a defender

775
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:23,670
is that you don't really know what you
have and and by this I mean you just not

776
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:24,460
tested

777
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:28,680
often enough um I'll touch on it in a
little but when I talk about

778
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,340
offense was defense

779
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:34,310
but one of the big problems that
defenders have is you just don't know

780
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:35,390
how bad you are

781
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:38,610
you kind of guessing you kind of think
you okay

782
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:41,750
but you only have incidents to measure
yourself by

783
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:44,830
and and that's a horrible part time to
be measured

784
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:48,110
and and the same is true for you experts
tonight

785
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:53,110
like these days lots of people publish
books and lots of people write blog

786
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:55,420
posts in a lot of people speak at
conferences

787
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:59,180
and it's really hard to tell for you
experts should be

788
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:04,670
and and all all talk your all talk to
you again a ball

789
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:08,940
open SSL because I want you guys to look
at something saw

790
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:12,250
company there's a whole bunch of open
SSL Sox

791
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:16,390
open SSL sucks open ourselves up by
monkeys but I want you guys to

792
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:21,360
to to notice something here um do all of
you see

793
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:24,840
whole of the scalding out happened post
hop

794
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:28,530
lead okay because I can tell you that

795
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:33,120
before hot lead we would tell people GPG
for data at rest

796
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:36,160
SSL for data in transit okay that was

797
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,180
that was almost cost like you just say
to someone someone says they doing

798
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:43,940
kept on you say is itself a date in
transit GPG for data test

799
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:47,380
but suddenly all these experts are
telling you how horrible it is

800
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:51,320
and if you wanna organization you should
be going back to experts going

801
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:54,390
what gives like repay you guys to

802
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:57,430
to actually tell us about that stuff
before it bites us in the tail

803
00:47:57,430 --> 00:48:01,720
um so again um I was talking about just
unsure

804
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,860
earlier um and and what I'm doing is
just saying that

805
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:08,290
that there's any poor metrics for who
should listen to

806
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:11,450
in this case I'm using to tell followers
as a proxy

807
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:15,420
soul um in that a v8 tell first chrome

808
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:18,980
fight you had just unsure on one side
with three thousand followers

809
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:22,940
you head of snake what 17,000

810
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:26,660
followers for white et seq and Jeremiah
Grossman

811
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:30,720
what fifty eight thousand supporters arm
from white et seq

812
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,120
but if the three of them were having an
argument

813
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:38,250
about writing a secure brawls up you
should listen to Justin

814
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:40,910
any day of the week and twice on Sunday

815
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:44,420
um but it's really hard to tell um

816
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:47,430
so while I'm giving you in those
problems

817
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:52,490
um we don't have enough people um so
again it's weird and yes says

818
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:55,880
we getting new people we not getting
them fast enough

819
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,580
arm the guys at the Hyatt then wrote a
very nice paper

820
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:03,940
up so they voted as a semi push for
white columns are good thing

821
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:07,190
um but essentially they say

822
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:10,310
if everyone every employee

823
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:14,520
at GM Costco Home Depot dealt up top 10
camp gamble

824
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:19,330
became security experts to model we
still would unfold the skills shortage

825
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:21,370
kept that we have in InfoSec

826
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:24,810
okay and and they don't just for the
stuff out of the air they have a pretty

827
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:26,330
vigorous way of defining

828
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,550
what the skills gap its Ben again

829
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:33,840
%uh at this point den Gio gives us bad
news where he says

830
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:37,800
one of the things that interesting about
InfoSec is that you don't

831
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:41,840
always see people getting better with
age he says you get

832
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:46,500
other carriers where if you look soft
money you become a master craftsman

833
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:50,720
and the longer you do it the better you
get at it and he says in InfoSec

834
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:55,470
that's not necessarily true soul some
guys who've been doing it for a while

835
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:58,500
you should just stop listening to okay
because they

836
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,890
they talking about yesterday's news um

837
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:05,660
a soul dissolve another paper that its
is what the leading

838
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:09,420
um soul doctor dancing put out a paper
called surviving

839
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:12,930
on a diet of poison trucked ok in he was

840
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:17,630
up talking about Hall the US government
should handle cybersecurity

841
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:22,050
and one of the things that's interesting
is he was cost so she previously

842
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:26,200
um he was super interesting before
during cyber he tried to put together

843
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,720
plans for the USA

844
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:32,510
on nuclear put proliferation and so he
is this guy who's

845
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:37,700
very smart and gets dropped into janie
crazy problems like can you help us

846
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:42,300
not blow up the world and and then it's
like can you help us with the side but

847
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:42,610
think

848
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:46,410
and so his skill is finding all the
people he needs to talk to

849
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:49,670
talking to them and putting all policy
papers

850
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:52,710
and so someone of him what was harder

851
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:57,859
about cyber been nuclear and what he
said was

852
00:50:57,859 --> 00:51:02,059
when he was doing nuclear he would talk
to a bunch of people

853
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:05,130
get their opinions a few months later
I'll

854
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:08,460
collect the stuff then go back to the
people and make sure

855
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:12,730
he heard them right and that what he
wrote accurately depicted what they said

856
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:16,740
and he said with cyber he would take
down what the guys adult

857
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:21,160
idk elated he'd go back to them and that
stuff wasn't true anymore

858
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:26,440
com and and he you some interesting
examples because

859
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,930
I'll at the time its it's really stopped
when you see him sick

860
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:33,599
he said when he started his study
everyone said that

861
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:36,829
de dos was a solved problem he says

862
00:51:36,829 --> 00:51:40,559
and he went back and collated stuff and
then massive de dos

863
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:44,359
started happening again in the world and
they've eased up on people's

864
00:51:44,359 --> 00:51:47,710
attention and suddenly de dos was a
problem again

865
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:50,950
and that just ties into what dan Gill
was saying about

866
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:54,239
you have sent into opponents and they
will change the game

867
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:58,509
arm and and it's one of those things
we've got a deal with um

868
00:51:58,509 --> 00:52:01,640
so in addition to all of this we lose
great people

869
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:06,099
okay so what we had small numbers to
start with but then we lose people

870
00:52:06,099 --> 00:52:07,950
because they leave the industry

871
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:12,480
in part because of the lemons market
driving them crazy we lose good guys to

872
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,239
offense

873
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:17,759
um all the time and then the last thing
that I'm adding is that we lose a lot of

874
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:19,220
good quality guys

875
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:22,869
to the scene on and I'll talk about well
why that is

876
00:52:22,869 --> 00:52:26,299
saw most people to offense happens quite
often

877
00:52:26,299 --> 00:52:29,499
and all gold channel set on a slide

878
00:52:29,499 --> 00:52:32,720
and and people who do offense don't like
it when you tell them that

879
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:37,119
offenses easier but I've done offense
for very long time and I can tell you

880
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:37,890
it's easier

881
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:43,489
um and its it's not is he ok because
you're technical challenges on this

882
00:52:43,489 --> 00:52:47,569
its easier because a whole bunch of
other problems for one thing

883
00:52:47,569 --> 00:52:50,759
defenders have to give the boss is a lot
more bad news

884
00:52:50,759 --> 00:52:55,620
asthma attack ok you don't often have to
give so much a bad news

885
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:59,780
um as an attack up I have fewer
competing goals

886
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:03,940
i cum in my intention is to break in and
I keep going till a break-in

887
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:08,150
and as a defender you've got a whole
bunch of other things and sometimes it

888
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:09,080
ranges from

889
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:12,950
called talk nice to the boss's daughter
of a think she's got a while

890
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:17,280
or think she's got a hiatus okay once
you in a corporate and doing defense

891
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,290
this just a whole bunch of other things
that suck your time

892
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:23,880
arm and that's just rule um

893
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:27,400
and so they're I want to talk quickly
about delasean

894
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:31,520
and and this an interesting thing that
you've got a question here

895
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:35,070
if you take a look at all of them are
talks that we've been giving at

896
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:37,650
conferences for your small of the back
ep talks

897
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:40,690
at some point you've got of the question

898
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:44,230
cause problems have we been solving in
those talks

899
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:47,300
um and Jacob tony was a speaker here

900
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:50,390
has done a very nice our blog post with
the summer lol

901
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:53,960
up in a similar vein but essentially if
you look at

902
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:57,730
all of the talks that we've done you'll
find that lots of them will have the

903
00:53:57,730 --> 00:53:58,500
offense

904
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,970
slanted and besides being offense lot to

905
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:05,430
they were offense of a type that what
only useful

906
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:10,070
two other Penn testers and possibly the
intelligence community

907
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:13,800
okay and clearly they've shown us that
they have skills

908
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:17,260
but they've also shown us that they've
taken a lot from those talks

909
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:20,690
ok and so what we had is this huge
problems

910
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:24,320
huge huge things that needed solving
with defending

911
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:27,540
and although a smart guys was spending
all the time

912
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:31,910
boating better tech tools um for the
guys that were doing attacking

913
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:36,100
arm I'm gonna hold talk on on conference
talks

914
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:39,750
and stop attacking and why I think
that's bad for us um

915
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:42,890
but I think it applies here too because
once you get

916
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:46,620
into that groove once you get those
dopamine hits were going conference

917
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:47,200
talks

918
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:51,320
your stock to do a lot of that and your
stop to forget about

919
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:54,400
reveal problems that need solving

920
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,670
um and I'll send us something else
that's particularly ugly

921
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:01,890
up so in the old days they used to be in
the wild west the golden rule

922
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:05,650
whoever has the gold makes the rules um
n

923
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:09,480
in the scene today there's almost a
version of it called a zero-day handle

924
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:14,119
which means if your company can put all
zero-day you can do some pretty vile

925
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:14,820
stuff

926
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:18,250
and it's probably okay because you call
okay and

927
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:21,780
and what it means is that we've managed
to lose people

928
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:25,750
to pop something this team you then he
shouldn't have because we made some of

929
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:26,540
the stuff

930
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:30,540
um kind of okay and you experts

931
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:33,840
you have any gotta find a way to be able
to judge them better

932
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:37,840
I'm so the quick example that they give
Hill when XSS first came out

933
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:41,560
all of you experts cream-colored lame it
was

934
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:45,740
if you've got a web app today probably
your number one what is XSS

935
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:50,450
when Stuxnet first came out there was a
queue of guys telling you what they

936
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:51,700
demand kept a payload

937
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:55,510
whole name was that um the heat up on
Stuxnet

938
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:58,890
it was also meet up um it solved its
purpose

939
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:03,250
for a long time client-side export
exploits will look down on

940
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:09,180
like for a whole 10-year period people
said if you a drink I insides you a lame

941
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:13,760
like today kind sides not be attacked
Victor that you need to worry about

942
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,790
so the thing that you need to worry
about free on network

943
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:20,640
is not the thing that those guys aback
have to necessarily talking about

944
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,859
because this just must match the
expectations

945
00:56:23,859 --> 00:56:27,010
um I'm not gonna pick on

946
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:30,260
on this whole chain of Utah again I'll
skip it um

947
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:35,260
soul in some idiot and he quickly arm we
have some heavy heart problems

948
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:38,380
some fundamental computer science
problems

949
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:41,660
pathological market failure Depot

950
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:45,380
deep-rooted social logical problems 'em
which means

951
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:49,200
it seems likely then that I'd be
agreeing with Dan Gill

952
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:53,520
who says that InfoSec is probably the
most intellectually challenging

953
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:57,609
arm profession on the planet except on
adding to that

954
00:56:57,609 --> 00:57:00,770
and saying but you probably coming
yourself

955
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:04,390
if you think the supplies to what you
are doing

956
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:06,880
come because probably

957
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,970
the central theme central pieces on my
talk

958
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:14,200
which comes into the late is that
InfoSec can be fairly hot

959
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,619
and InfoSec problems can be a fairly
important

960
00:57:17,619 --> 00:57:22,130
but most of us I'm not walking on the
problems that are fairly hard

961
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:26,390
all the problems that are really
important up because by and large the

962
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:28,130
problems that we focusing on

963
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:31,619
I'm not necessarily the ones that we
need to okay

964
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:36,250
um sy said already retaking the creek
dopamine hits with conference talks

965
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:39,930
we making ourselves feel good doing been
testing

966
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:42,960
but we not significantly moving the
needle

967
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,590
on any of the real problems up to an
example I gave in

968
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:50,440
when I did the pen testing talk if I
asked you if you were defending your

969
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,420
organization

970
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:56,360
um how many 0 days would it take me to
access your column jewels

971
00:57:56,360 --> 00:58:00,320
most organizations if they honest come
back and say what

972
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:03,720
um if I had one bells a zero-day

973
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:07,040
i'd have you see a fall and if I have
your see a fall

974
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:10,680
I have everything and if this is the
state that we in

975
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:14,140
then literally the board should be
fighting us

976
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:17,820
they just don't know it yet arm if the
best

977
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:22,540
most innovative thing that we could put
salt in the last 10 years was to go from

978
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:25,590
anti-virus to in line anti-virus

979
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:28,740
arm we in pretty bad shape um

980
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:33,480
and for lots of things all security guys
need to get off all a sense of

981
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:34,390
entitlement

982
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:38,570
'em i've seen in tons of companies where
the security guy say

983
00:58:38,570 --> 00:58:41,950
security is just not included they just
not putting us

984
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:44,980
in line with the decisions and that's
true

985
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:48,790
it doesn't happen for any department
like if you've got a bad marketing

986
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:50,869
department people won't use them

987
00:58:50,869 --> 00:58:53,950
they'll go external if you go to bed
anything

988
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:57,910
it gets bypassed if you doing security
at an organization

989
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:02,650
I think you call the compliance fruit in
which case they've got a tick that box

990
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:07,740
but security doesn't want to be in
compliance we just want to be included

991
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:09,270
in all those conversations

992
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:14,010
and the simple fact is if you not adding
value you just not gonna be included in

993
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:15,299
those conversations

994
00:59:15,299 --> 00:59:18,960
you gotta find a way to add that value
um

995
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,319
we need to the focus um sum of all the
such

996
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:26,400
home if you she'll have the people at
your company

997
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,309
using a password manager okay

998
00:59:30,309 --> 00:59:34,940
at a good number um interestingly it's
surprisingly lacking

999
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:39,700
like you go to companies and you see the
exec still not using password managers

1000
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:43,680
and like does no good reason for it
today

1001
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:47,630
think it's a stupid problem it nicely
solved by some software

1002
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:51,290
I think it's kind of telling that one of
the great solutions white

1003
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:55,069
don't come from a security company it's
from NIOS Mac called

1004
00:59:55,069 --> 00:59:58,470
um but own what you see is this massive
split

1005
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:02,230
this between the stuff that we walking
on and the stuff that

1006
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:06,740
the family bothers people like companies
don't know how to manage the spa swat

1007
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:09,780
problem they don't know how to share
passwords for calls

1008
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:13,430
people don't know how to handle the
local admin problem

1009
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:16,839
um and instead we doing papers on

1010
01:00:16,839 --> 01:00:20,079
how to find decom on on a machine

1011
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:23,170
okay now this is good research and it's
awesome stuff

1012
01:00:23,170 --> 01:00:28,809
but it leaves us what this mess of but
also beautiful gap in the market

1013
01:00:28,809 --> 01:00:32,220
ok and kind of survey of hope that I'm
saying are

1014
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:36,210
after all of this darkness is that
there's this massive gap

1015
01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:40,730
between all of that research and all of
the budding we've been doing so far

1016
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:43,750
because we've been building for this
medical client

1017
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:47,829
that we wished we had okay this client
who really needs to know

1018
01:00:47,829 --> 01:00:52,470
whether they've got decom rootkit on
their one machine in the silverdome

1019
01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:56,349
when in actual fact you and I both know
that your customers

1020
01:00:56,349 --> 01:00:59,599
still have a wind 2k4 that they haven't
patched

1021
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:03,109
a whole bunch of the reasons and if
someone can show them how to do that

1022
01:01:03,109 --> 01:01:04,210
they'll be grateful

1023
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:09,700
okay business entire space business
entire cost of problems that no one's

1024
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:10,349
addressing

1025
01:01:10,349 --> 01:01:13,910
and those problems are also heart
problems they

1026
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:17,109
also need our technical solving arm

1027
01:01:17,109 --> 01:01:20,150
it gives us an opportunity um to make a
difference

1028
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:25,140
and are to be relevant um so do you know
there's all we had a very nice quote

1029
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:26,140
infected cyst but

1030
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:27,009
tweet

1031
01:01:27,009 --> 01:01:30,539
up he says you never change things by
fighting the existing reality

1032
01:01:30,539 --> 01:01:34,390
you want to change it find the model
that makes the existing one

1033
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:37,670
obsolete arm its it's a space for us to
play in

1034
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:40,799
um again I'm not slating offense

1035
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:45,239
um but what I am saying is certainly
when I started

1036
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:50,599
are doing this saw in the late 90's we
kind of got drawn to this because

1037
01:01:50,599 --> 01:01:54,140
we thought that the hard problem was
blinking into networks

1038
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:57,449
um two things should be obvious to buy
now

1039
01:01:57,449 --> 01:02:00,670
eighty that's not that hot and be

1040
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:05,150
to steal a quote from the clock hackers
are not the apex predators anymore

1041
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:09,489
when you the NSA and you've got a global
passive

1042
01:02:09,489 --> 01:02:12,769
listening post on every piece of while
crossing the water

1043
01:02:12,769 --> 01:02:18,089
you've got capabilities to do attacking
that most ordinary attackers don't have

1044
01:02:18,089 --> 01:02:18,689
anymore

1045
01:02:18,689 --> 01:02:22,380
so if you wanna be the cool kid I do you
have going for the NSA

1046
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:25,699
or you just not that cool during offense
anymore

1047
01:02:25,699 --> 01:02:29,130
where the is columnists is finding ways

1048
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:32,449
to do defense on the view to reasonable
budget

1049
01:02:32,449 --> 01:02:37,729
um in addition to this all futures
currently being decided by a whole bunch

1050
01:02:37,729 --> 01:02:38,539
of stuff that's

1051
01:02:38,539 --> 01:02:41,859
out of all control okay you've got guys
deciding

1052
01:02:41,859 --> 01:02:45,349
on the one hand you've got guys who
sells you know day for loving

1053
01:02:45,349 --> 01:02:49,640
talking about let us sell anything on
the other hand you've got activists

1054
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:50,089
saying

1055
01:02:50,089 --> 01:02:53,299

1056
01:02:53,299 --> 01:02:57,130
and both the balls are dangerous
positions and both the bosnian same

1057
01:02:57,130 --> 01:02:59,029
people having those discussions

1058
01:02:59,029 --> 01:03:02,259
um so in conclusion um

1059
01:03:02,259 --> 01:03:05,929
we're at an inflection point um
simultaneously

1060
01:03:05,929 --> 01:03:09,529
we face a crisis of relevance and a
crisis of confidence

1061
01:03:09,529 --> 01:03:12,939
we've gotten really hot problems that
need solving

1062
01:03:12,939 --> 01:03:16,609
arm all best and brightest shouldn't be
spending their time

1063
01:03:16,609 --> 01:03:20,859
just distracting the best of the guys
for the not most part for all of this

1064

that need solving

1066
01:03:28,119 --> 01:03:31,999

well be you that does it

1068
