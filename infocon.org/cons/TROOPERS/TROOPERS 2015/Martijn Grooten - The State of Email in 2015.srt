1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,220
welcome after a a minimize my time
requires bottom

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,799
and this my presentation up

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,920
at the moment are just doing very
exciting things next or so this is the

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,380
time

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,549
for you too reconsider being here but if
you stay here

6
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:17,170
which I hope you do a what I'm going to
ace but

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,850
discuss where we are with email and a
fight against you know bad mess with

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:22,470
this band

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,730
and explain that I we are actually doing
quite well

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,980
but we have some problems one of the
problems is people like

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,140
and no and others here saying well

12
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,200
four billion IP addresses that not
really of and another problem its

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,520
people Mike myself and probably many
others in the room say

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,700
know what we don't like the Americans
reading all our emails I'm

15
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,360
there should be plenty of time
afterwards for questions I mean email

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,809
security is a broad fields on picnic not
gonna

17
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:54,340
cover the the whole email security so we
can have like a

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:59,809
knife discussion of sorts Oakley a

19
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,680
one is allowed to have one slight about
themselves through a presentation so it

20
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,379
is about me

21
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:06,990
I i've a passport issued by the kingdom
of the Netherlands

22
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,320
I also grew up there I

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,220
went university mathematics I'll dream
of becoming a

24
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,680
professional mathematician but I'm
somehow gave up just before principes de

25
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,799
and around that time I'll so move to
three months

26
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:25,680
I am where I joined the company called
fires bottom

27
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,090
as initially to do with web site but I
but I sold the securities

28
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,100
being was actually really cool as above
stated security

29
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,720
I set up a comparative spam filter test
what some kind of the running

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,950
and um curtly also

31
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,750
and author of the after company which
means that I'm responsible for

32
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:48,720
I am content of anything we publish the
purpose lot of technical

33
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,950
articles on our web sites and also at
the conference

34
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,360
we doing we have fun next conference in
Brock

35
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,700
in September and I'm still getting bait
in

36
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,290
and British Pound even though I moved
back to another country that

37
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,600
still uses the Euro and which is Greece
which ground-based

38
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:12,600
now and its not my house but it's not
too far

39
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,140
the okay

40
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,870
I'm anyone here use this email

41
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,820
for this from a soda knows that sweeping
offensive I think everyone here kind of

42
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,530
knows how you know works but just

43
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:29,130
I districts explain this to so we'll
have to the right concept in our hats

44
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:33,320
if I was want to send an email to Bob to
shield was a male clients and she writes

45
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,050
an email

46
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,050
pics & and the mailers submitted to her
mail server

47
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,620
and after that's the del Sur

48
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,720
server alice is mail server uses DNS to
look up

49
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,770
the address a box mail server or 10
bucks mail service

50
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:51,060
and sense the email over the internet
ideas able

51
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,890
there's an email for puppets from Alice
and then but no so for those pop

52
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,500
eight-ball a is an email it's from Alice

53
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,630
and this hasn't really changed since the
early 1980s

54
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:07,880
still using a protocol which was written
and designed for a

55
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:14,000
a much different internet and there are
two important things to note about this

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,670
the process that Alice consent emails

57
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,940
very easily a very fast yea computers

58
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,209
yea internet that's why email us it's
much better

59
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:27,650
at least for for many purposes than let
us or

60
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,320
forgot at the same time and is

61
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:36,260
is very important that is often
overlooked Alice dust

62
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,070
can send Bob an email without ball ever
happen given her permission

63
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:43,209
bob is in need to whitelist Alan Alice
those new to

64
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:46,890
follow Alice happens on Twitter he wanna
send someone a direct message

65
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,350
I she can send this message

66
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,280
unsolicited affected you can

67
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,900
sent on Celeste unsolicited message s
and if you can do it

68
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,510
very fast and very quickly basically
means that

69
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,600
the sending of unsolicited bulk email
which is

70
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,640
spam is a feature a female and is not a
Bach I think something that

71
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,250
I strongly believe that this is the case
and not everyone

72
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:18,340
agrees with me and which means that
people on by ETF discussion list about

73
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,680
email they want to stop span and i won

74
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,140
and what i don't realize if you want to
stop them completely you have to change

75
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,260
email and you have to chains one of
these two

76
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,240
these wannabes to

77
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,710
properties and I think these are
actually very important properties a

78
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,250
female

79
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:40,250
property really like and but you know
when I first look at the problem a spam

80
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,570
I also thaw hate but Conwy like fix

81
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,190
spam stops ban by fixing email so that
both mister

82
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,400
to the experts the deformation and if
you think about it for

83
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,310
at the a while you realize that's not
how you know works does not how we want

84
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,050
you know the work

85
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,389
on

86
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:04,530
and indeed in the 1990s when he entered
became back there were spammers

87
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,900
and I should point out that I called
spam a spike here in this presentation

88
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,590
made up I in the interest of gender
equality there also

89
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,880
female spouse a

90
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,850
so spike spammers to discover take a
December open email I bought email

91
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,490
address I can ask him if he wants to buy

92
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,919
cheap viagra which is the classic spam

93
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:28,270
basse-bolle what might want the loan
offer or

94
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:34,050
it is for some reason also very popular
fake watches and

95
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,350
lot more emails and books inbox overflow

96
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,360
float but a product with spam

97
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,539
of course that's not never a problem in

98
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:48,650
it. without a solution so people start
writing

99
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,650
spam filters and their response filters
they were

100
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,729
content-based basically is about the
only program and you see in this

101
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:56,580
presentation

102
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:02,240
this is some a but if the email contains
the words the I write and send it to

103
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,770
trash

104
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:07,300
allies the mail is delivered tomorrow
what's worked really well when I first

105
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,440
rota problem ill.-based filter to

106
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,229
fell to my email and then the mid 90's
this is what it's more or less

107
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:19,389
and it works well a boss Thomas went one
step further

108
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:23,400
they start its using all sorts of tricks

109
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,729
to bypass the filters for example
spelling viagra like this I'm sure that

110
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:27,639
everyone is saying this

111
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:30,910
medicines rocket science is but
something i jus new

112
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:36,039
two months a few but this happened and
indeed this bypass pencil test afterward

113
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:37,500
spam filters got operators

114
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,860
summers automatically using also two
basins

115
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,580
this takes to drop

116
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,790
a kind of cat-and-mouse game I just want
to sell them very good at finding

117
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:51,190
icons on the Internet cat-and-mouse game
dick be between spammers on one hand

118
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,570
spam filters on their hands

119
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:57,070
and that's what's happened in the
nineties and in a in a sense that still

120
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:57,750
going on

121
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,780
but a very important change game roughly

122
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,650
beginning of this century when spammers
relax hold on

123
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,670
I could use a botnet up high-tech
computers i guess im

124
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:13,080
a low spot and thomas also realized

125
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,020
thats because the models and have some
kind of authentication that could just

126
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,070
pretend to be someone else

127
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,290
addis make spam filtering

128
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,940
quite hard and I'm

129
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,110
they started to happen people but the
thing called on

130
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,700
in this email thing like totally broken

131
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,610
man anyone can rent a botnet

132
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:41,060
anyone can bombard ball or millions a
box with emails

133
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,170
claim to come from someone else and
email this does not have some built-in

134
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,070
mechanism

135
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:51,620
to verified source of these emails and
the need to work pretty clever people

136
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,350
who thought

137
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:56,910
you know spam just gonna kill email and
it hasn't

138
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:01,220
but this stuff didn't seem such a
strange thought because it

139
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,470
look like spam an expense killed so well
that's even have spent all this book

140
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,400
ninety-nine percent

141
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,450
is one percent was still so much to make
you know unusable

142
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,460
but as I said that didn't happen

143
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,340
because we are we as a anti-spam
community

144
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,960
were cleverer than that and a spam
problem

145
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,960
has been stopped and I explain why I
think it can't be stopped but its

146
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,190
well mitigate its using

147
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:32,400
a number of of ways I list quite a few
out there are probably other stuff

148
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,549
forgotten am common base built us

149
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:39,370
still play a role a

150
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:43,099
blacklist of IP addresses from its
promise and then the main

151
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:46,390
from its promise and or which appears in
the body of the email play a very

152
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,380
important role

153
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,540
especially IP based blacklist that a

154
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,640
educated guesses that about 90 percent
spam is blocked simply because

155
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,620
send

156
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,600
IP addresses on a blacklist that
something to keep in mind

157
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,660
because our effort that led from and
outbound spam filtering

158
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,290
which means that ice peace eater to
simply blocks the

159
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:10,700
sending-off emails unless you use their
Cairo mail server

160
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,270
or dates South filtering the males
outbound

161
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:17,320
a this contributed as well

162
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,690
a big down support mats the spam

163
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,530
actually was it is worse Ron late 2008
when a

164
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:28,890
number botnet takedowns really helped to
ritter's at least a volume of spam

165
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,150
it's still very big but it's not as
because it was back to

166
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:36,560
legislation if you're like me a protest

167
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,110
problem from a technical angle at
stations is boring

168
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,950
but actually helps to prevent the
different companies from sending spam

169
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:51,950
and that's why it's in hidden way very
important and three techniques cool SBS

170
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,360
the came and the mark but i'll explain a
bit

171
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,580
they start playing and very important
role

172
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,180
and it's good to know that soup

173
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,330
how filters work into

174
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:11,390
techno very broad picture I'm anti-spam
people or spent all the company's

175
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:14,660
researchers they set up honeypots which
indicates a spam

176
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,020
you to the courts but perhaps Dez on a
bus receive emails

177
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,540
because if you send a million or billion
emails you can't really distinguish

178
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,080
between

179
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,590
ru uses a fake ones and

180
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:30,110
peace the competent this emails and
their the method of the like IP address

181
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,380
and domain there send

182
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,520
back for spam filters which are then
improved

183
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,870
together with location is on some
feedback from

184
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,360
unhappy a people who received spam and
is has been filters

185
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,030
improve this also means that spam
filtering is almost entirely

186
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:49,770
bon reactively it's not on proactively
I'm

187
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:53,110
anyone here in this room can Rex the
domain

188
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,470
rent the BPS set up mail server and
start sending spam

189
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:00,830
efficient than or a hundred emails ban
probly gonna get them delivered

190
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:07,830
even if you're trying to sell viagra but
you can scale it

191
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,650
right I promise to explain

192
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:14,650
how a few of these new techniques work
spf

193
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:18,560
I am were to follow so it's good to know
that but that from a spent all this

194
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,300
point a few

195
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,820
a its dispute between the two mail
service tricky that are

196
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:27,370
thats but a promise that's why no
authentication takes place wanna das es

197
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,110
if email but claims to come from Alyssa
cents over

198
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,380
such a connection coming from

199
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:39,110
an IP address a 1234 than the receiving
mail server

200
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:44,280
can do DNS lookup ask can get IP address
this is a fetus

201
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:49,480
allowed to send mail for desmin domain
at if the answer is yes

202
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,520
it doesn't mean it's not spam but it
makes it less likely like what if your

203
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,300
answer is No

204
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,510
we would like it to me this must be spam
and forth unfortunately

205
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,660
it generally bit more complicated than
that but it really helps to make at

206
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:06,060
an informed decision DK miss something
else

207
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,120
the game signs in mouse a

208
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,550
becoming smells service sign in mouse

209
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:17,230
basically they date diet to a domain and
again you can use it very well if it

210
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,120
signed by

211
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,710
is the main you at least know that
what's a

212
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:26,610
sent by this mail server it doesn't mean
it's not spam

213
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,790
but it makes it less likely and you can
help

214
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,150
you can use this in a decision whether
or not to deliver an email

215
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:38,670
are you a a spectacle the market a
really new technique that's

216
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:42,760
mostly used by the very big email
senders like like Yahoo and Gmail and

217
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,450
Microsoft

218
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:47,440
and it's kind of cool it combines SPS
Andy Kim

219
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,660
in the following it went to waste

220
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:55,140
firstly it allows ascending domain
through to give guidance on what to do

221
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,530
with email stat

222
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,770
didn't have it became signature an
envelop one

223
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,930
or detailed SPS IPC claim to confirm is
the main

224
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:08,030
you can say well block them all together
with this very radical and probably

225
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,530
diffuse some problems but if you like
pay pal than you might want to do that

226
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,240
because

227
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,740
its fishing is such a big problem for
coping like they've all you got to say

228
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,500
well

229
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,190
pooper suspicion or putting guarantee

230
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:24,540
don't delete it as a prime I'm this is
really helpful for no service

231
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:28,520
and the second part to the mark and it's
a less nonpartisan also allows

232
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:33,010
US a domain to say well if you do get
emails that claim to come from us but

233
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:33,890
they fail

234
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:37,510
either spf already Kim I sent as a
report on

235
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:42,020
because this could been two things that
could mean someone is $14 per domain or

236
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:42,660
it could mean

237
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,230
spfld can records arms the set up while

238
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:50,730
I at our present other conference last
year guy from Microsoft gave a

239
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:51,600
presentation

240
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,370
much of this enormous company it's very
hard to

241
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:59,230
for them to know which or so no service

242
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,790
what server send email on behalf of a

243
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:07,280
so to use this this feedback mechanism
in the mark together with a very relaxed

244
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,130
policy at

245
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,880
its first to improve their own SPF and
beacon settings and now they have very

246
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,740
strict settings

247
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,120
which apparently really helps delivery
of good meal

248
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:21,490
and a a and also prevents the delivery
of the not a plane to come from one of

249
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,360
microsoft's Online

250
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,500
so to summarize the first part of his
presentation

251
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,730
a with a quote from and authority not
necessarily on

252
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:35,530
thereof span but on stricken general
Bruce Schneier

253
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:39,050
Colts band harass excess toriente inside
the crime no indeed

254
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:42,170
about the kind of tax rates we get

255
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:46,390
means that Arum makes people fighting
mall where

256
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,710
fighting D does attacks fighting all
sorts what about things really jealous

257
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:53,030
I it's still a problem there are still
spend my sis

258
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,630
being sent around someone gotta have
malicious payload people click on them

259
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,750
get in fact that woulda

260
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,930
cryptogram subreddits bats but its

261
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:04,970
it's extremely well mitigated and it's
really hard to to improve on its I think

262
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,370
I'm not saying you can't a proven that
on base but

263
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:12,240
if you want in to do to improve you need
to know how well we're already doing

264
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,910
but it's also good to know

265
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:20,550
that's the infrastructure itself remains
vulnerable to big changes it will make

266
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,890
if we make big changes

267
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,910
are mitigation mechanisms might stop
working

268
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:28,290
and that's but I'm gonna talk about in a
second

269
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,360
part of his presentation

270
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,280
which is now so there are people I like
and no

271
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,240
think for being an IP addresses not
enough we more a

272
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,490
this has some consequences of up for
email

273
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:44,620
and in particular for spam filtering
terrorist

274
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:49,090
a I assume everyone knows I I P six this
is a new protocol for sending

275
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:52,760
a internet back that's up backers have
longer addresses and our

276
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:57,920
much more arrests as well basically
there there are very few I before

277
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,520
addresses

278
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,640
bands impact practice and in for a
number of ideas expressed

279
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,400
that is good news combatants

280
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,980
about the move to ip67 consequence for
email

281
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,130
and if you know about various layers

282
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,330
I'll networker traffic and email

283
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:20,910
expecting the application layer things
layer 7 a very bad about the high number

284
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:24,420
I P six is a network layer thing which
means that if

285
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,740
if you write the a mail server from
scratch it works right to 694

286
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,240
this as well yet so we don't have to
worry about it

287
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,960
accepts I have already into the earlier

288
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,770
spam filtering makes heavy use of ipv4
addresses

289
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:44,110
it to stem to block ninety percent of
spam

290
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:47,840
more or less based on deputy I before
resting on a blacklist

291
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,330
however

292
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:54,820
as some people point out we don't need
that many mail service

293
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,320
I mean we need ipv6 addresses because
four billion

294
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,980
I before three billion as we can use and
in practice is simply not enough but

295
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,040
from mail service

296
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,360
they're probably a few million mail
service at the most IP 4's just enough

297
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,990
a and it's really a gun owner

298
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,160
only about the traffic between the mail
servers where spam filtering it is

299
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,400
important but not us

300
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,589
week it's because tell you week this
gift is your night before address and we

301
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:25,140
we forget about it. 6 thing for them
which through

302
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:29,040
unfortunately at or and I'm not even
sure if I think that's unfortunate

303
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,960
I particular momentum it's a very slow
commend them it's still not happening as

304
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,900
far as people

305
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:38,200
like it to happen but it's gonna happen
and I think mail service

306
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,960
will start using IP six and are starting
to use IP six

307
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,250
Google com cost in the US story two
years ago and it probably more now

308
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,970
a are accepting email over IP six

309
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:54,830
solutions well

310
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,840
some people a say well you can just

311
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,040
make black place the top two IP six this
is what a

312
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,750
a lookup against the black lace that you
could look at it with the National Cup

313
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,120
against this very long the main

314
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,760
if you can't read it thats my point a.m.

315
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,620
it works it works in theory

316
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:18,420
and especially well it would really help
the people unfollowed

317
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,930
the rules and the rules are thats
high-speed should never assigned and me

318
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:26,180
segment smaller than its last 64 through
I

319
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,550
to end users and something bigger if
it's a larger organization and then you

320
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:29,910
can

321
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:33,930
ignore the rest of the IP address
because it's the same

322
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:37,750
company that the set has been sending
spam or hasn't be sending spam

323
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,220
unfortunately

324
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,770
and I know probably knows better than I
do but I don't think people are really

325
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:45,760
following the rules

326
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,860
and even if they were a

327
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:54,220
sit it still a but a billion

328
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,500
yes but sorry on even if people were
following the rules

329
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,570
I P six black lace would be but a
billion times larger than IP four black

330
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,490
lists and I before blacklists

331
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:08,910
a can fit within half a good life and we
with

332
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:13,570
talking about a billion Hall
half-a-billion gigabyte times of a

333
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,960
billion billion gigabytes

334
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,330
I'm not sure from say a lot

335
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,050
book about Vera

336
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:24,740
very light and practically unmanageable
I think a better solution would be

337
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:30,420
it to say you know what's IP addresses
different kinda unnatural to

338
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:34,190
make email British space donated it
works extremely well in practice I I

339
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:38,130
think properties like Spain mouse or 27
blacklisted doing great work

340
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:42,910
I'm but it's just very unnatural amino I

341
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:46,180
I know about email life look into the
things I would have no

342
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,820
to IP addresses of our company's mail
service but of course I would know the

343
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,270
domain

344
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:54,340
I don't know which the main reason for
sending so perhaps which to choose sp8

345
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,120
Andy Kim

346
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,150
both both of which made use a domain

347
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:03,270
and what actually really nice about I
the most likely six is that

348
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:07,760
you count suddenly starts making spf in
BK mandatory on

349
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,470
for email I before because there are
just too many mail service out there

350
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,590
running all software

351
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:15,340
is wouldn't work but I P six being a new
thing you can stay

352
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,810
I'm not accepting I P six email unless
it as a beacon signature or

353
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:22,070
and/or its solitaire

354
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:26,670
it boss SBS and at least group was
actually doing that for Gmail

355
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:30,010
right

356
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:34,100
does not a problem but I actually think
it's even bigger

357
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,410
and let's look again at Allah sending an
email to Paul

358
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:42,160
and look at eyes that have been call
arts by

359
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,050
20 months of snowed in Revelations about

360
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:49,990
NSA spying email and I should point out
it there may be people in the room with

361
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,450
ink and is a step would be fine

362
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,970
if you think that and York City right
your

363
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:59,420
it each your allowed to think that the
force and China's probably also

364
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,930
impressive into combat the females

365
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:06,440
the email from Dallas to a mill server
is

366
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,990
not always but almost all weights and
reptiles and I should point out

367
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:13,000
in this case it might not even be
sending me you know I was my just lookin

368
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,980
logged in to Gmail through to send the
email them might not be even be a

369
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:21,670
connection over the Internet that's not
really a problem the problem is the

370
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:26,550
the connection and from one mil server
to another there has been

371
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:29,660
a significant increase in this
disconnect is being

372
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:33,740
and cryptic using start the last

373
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,909
but it doesn't mean that all practice
are

374
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:39,850
a group that a lot of smaller male
surfaced still don't support start the

375
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:42,700
last at many do support start the alas

376
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,100
bats for example in the case of of
hillary Clinton see not over which was

377
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,000
in the news recently

378
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,549
a don't it's at check to certificates

379
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:55,600
its Alex what's means that and advanced
at first three with a man in the middle

380
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,340
position

381
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:00,500
could reach your email but there's also
nothing that

382
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,750
leader allyssa book can do two
controllers the downside send this email

383
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,539
only if the connection is equipped with

384
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:09,570
that's not how you know works its and we
have to hope

385
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:14,330
that the Majlis the collection is
equipped with texan

386
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,399
from box nose of the ball but dennis is
generally a group that that's not

387
00:22:17,399 --> 00:22:18,590
something we worry about

388
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:21,879
but even at all that makes our crib that

389
00:22:21,879 --> 00:22:24,940
there are still the two mail servers

390
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,600
where a the battery unencrypted

391
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,860
the mouse which

392
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,860
make them vulnerable to someone hacking
into them and reading all

393
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,139
all the emails and if it's not about
hacking then perhaps they just come with

394
00:22:39,139 --> 00:22:39,559
to

395
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:43,019
government order saying we need access
to his email switches kinda what

396
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:43,789
happened to

397
00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:47,559
with Prism of course

398
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:50,649
will use pgp and where users b2b

399
00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:54,080
anyone who uses b2b you claims two men
from

400
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,419
mess-up okay yeah at

401
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:02,179
I definitely messed up all the time a

402
00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:05,379
don't look at the debate for those who
don't know Alice

403
00:23:05,379 --> 00:23:09,320
signs are email for advice and tips or
email with their

404
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,690
private key which ball and other people
have a public key

405
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:16,179
the

406
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:20,669
now that's the wrong way round Alice
signs or email using a private key

407
00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:24,970
for the book and read its but she also
users box public eat this

408
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:28,730
to encrypt that's how to bob has its own
private key that's what DICOM next

409
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:29,590
about-face

410
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,830
a to 2d crib to email

411
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:36,159
basis Alice sign in the mail so when it
gets too

412
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:42,580
to bop bop can read it

413
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,969
it's good to note what is X

414
00:23:43,969 --> 00:23:50,330
actually mean but pgp actually means in
practice Alice encrypts your email

415
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:54,239
using what he has been made to believe
his box by the key

416
00:23:54,239 --> 00:23:57,679
ball is unable to verify using

417
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:04,679
art are as a Christian at yeah

418
00:24:08,109 --> 00:24:11,119
okay okay that's that's wrong okay a

419
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:14,950
well they imagine I maintain my sanity
okay hacer

420
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:21,609
Alice encrypts your email using a what
estimate he believes box publicly yes

421
00:24:21,609 --> 00:24:25,570
I'm not Alice emails a Swedish newspaper
which twice

422
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:30,070
in recently published its own private
key on this website but bob is not

423
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,229
working for a newspaper

424
00:24:31,229 --> 00:24:36,509
apologize for that a the second segment
but was able to verify that the email

425
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:38,369
was sent by someone in possession

426
00:24:38,369 --> 00:24:41,549
what he has been made to believe is
alice is privately

427
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:46,929
I think that is correct thanks guys am

428
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:50,769
that is what it really means I'm it is
not what a teacher in got to class but

429
00:24:50,769 --> 00:24:52,169
is about b2b remains

430
00:24:52,169 --> 00:24:56,080
and what they want it to me know what
the kitchen but the classes of course

431
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,379
Alyssa Christine also Tony book and read
it and Bach and verifier

432
00:25:00,379 --> 00:25:06,109
apart from reading it also verify the
e-mail read them from Alice it generally

433
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:07,119
works and

434
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:10,119
it generally means this in practice we
people like us

435
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:13,249
use pgp and we don't mess up but we do
mess-up and

436
00:25:13,249 --> 00:25:16,589
if b2b worked some out to be adopted
widely

437
00:25:16,589 --> 00:25:19,669
and more more people messed up on this
translation simply

438
00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:26,419
wouldn't scale MPTP

439
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:31,389
has another problem it leaks a lot of
medidata and

440
00:25:31,389 --> 00:25:35,009
there's been little discussion about
method of it as a very funny slight

441
00:25:35,009 --> 00:25:36,749
about metadata from sea to sea from

442
00:25:36,749 --> 00:25:40,269
two years ago a which I I'm sure
everyone a scene

443
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:44,909
and indicated email think the following
situation you're a journalist

444
00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:48,919
you get 10 emails on a date nine of them
are on a crypt thats one by Miss b2b

445
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:49,609
encrypt it

446
00:25:49,609 --> 00:25:52,659
and also and the next day you write
something on

447
00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:57,210
and your newspaper up a which only if
you've been in combat but it was a lower

448
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:00,989
that really helps someone hacking into
your email or demonic text or email

449
00:26:00,989 --> 00:26:04,799
a make a very added educated guess about
who dis whistleblowers

450
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,239
torie licking method not that really
matters for email

451
00:26:08,239 --> 00:26:12,820
now if you think I could be given might
mean a

452
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:16,869
we're over I'm very worried about an
essay in China and and be in the

453
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:21,090
perhaps spying on us I'm but

454
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:24,940
most people it doesn't affect people's
lives I don't but my life

455
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:28,049
there dan is here is my email or there

456
00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:31,989
that read my email perhaps also

457
00:26:31,989 --> 00:26:35,379
their ability to people using email
every day I'm

458
00:26:35,379 --> 00:26:39,070
that's fine but it's working spam is not
really a problem anymore not

459
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:43,080
not a problem make people stop email so
they're not gonna change

460
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,989
but is not easily and crypto is hard

461
00:26:47,989 --> 00:26:52,460
a I messed up my much lights by
confusing public and private keys

462
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,109
and Ivan at least I know what public and
private keys are most people

463
00:26:56,109 --> 00:26:59,399
don't know shoulda now a

464
00:26:59,399 --> 00:27:02,739
so any solution to this this problem of
a

465
00:27:02,739 --> 00:27:07,849
adversaries reading emails that depends
on people understand a crypto it's bound

466
00:27:07,849 --> 00:27:08,309
to fail

467
00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:11,529
there's a solution

468
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:14,570
well there are number of people who've
written solutions

469
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:18,249
this one I like to pick out because I'm
very excited about it and I think it's

470
00:27:18,249 --> 00:27:21,609
is by far the most likely to to be
implemented

471
00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:25,330
even if it might take another ten years
it's cold I'm

472
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:29,340
what's sense for docking but male
environment as you make a plea of no

473
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,479
relation to date this protocol to be
involved in any way

474
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:37,119
I just like it people who have been a
vote by the way are

475
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:40,649
people like lot on lettuce on who said
I'd love a bit a

476
00:27:40,649 --> 00:27:43,820
John Callas from South Circle and fills
a moment from

477
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:47,970
BGP dime is based onto

478
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:51,549
slight modifications to out you know
works at the first test

479
00:27:51,549 --> 00:27:55,779
every email he

480
00:27:55,779 --> 00:27:58,799
every connection well you know makes
various steps it's always

481
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,809
encrypt thats and the only thing that's

482
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:04,440
that a they're receiving

483
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,490
party can reduce the thing that really
matters offered at the demo them reduced

484
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,140
don't thing that really matters

485
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,560
and when allison's any notable her mail
server

486
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,990
doesn't need to know its football all it
needs no its

487
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:22,260
it has to be delivered to someone on box
the main and especially a BOP use

488
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,550
his eyes peas domain or or what know the
main

489
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:31,580
that really doesn't reveal anything
about Paul a

490
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:34,870
that the email Sant over the public
Internet

491
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:38,770
its encrypt at the bar from very basic
method of the

492
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:42,740
the two domains which you kind of know
already because you see the email

493
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,840
traveling between 107 not out a
generally gives you an idea about

494
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:51,240
which domain is being used and like us
but not over never knew

495
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,970
on Alice send this email just knew that
for someone from alice is the main

496
00:28:54,970 --> 00:29:01,700
that's one part the emails are are very
much in cryptic or die message to take

497
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,370
very much in group that's

498
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:07,120
and is very little method of available
and

499
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,280
bankrupt that sometimes multiple times
sorta

500
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,860
a different parties can access the right

501
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,450
only that they could at any and set up
artist that

502
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:21,430
the MPP which is an an extension to ask
him to be which is a

503
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:24,620
the mills that every particle I'm

504
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:29,980
it apart from the sending off of time
Estes it also allows people to look up

505
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:35,990
I public keys and

506
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:39,870
which means a bullpen but no surfer can
use alice is no server to check if

507
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:43,260
this is a private a there's a public key
of of Alice

508
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,530
and a sometime today

509
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:52,680
forties request to to Alice I'm

510
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,979
as I said very excited about time and
there are a number of reasons

511
00:29:56,979 --> 00:30:00,649
it's written by people who understand
encryption and there are more people who

512
00:30:00,649 --> 00:30:03,779
understand the corruption written
something but they also understand email

513
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:05,769
on the on understand how people use

514
00:30:05,769 --> 00:30:12,469
email every day and this is probably the
most important it integrate seamlessly

515
00:30:12,469 --> 00:30:13,659
into email

516
00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:18,129
I'm it's basically a system that would
work next to you now

517
00:30:18,129 --> 00:30:21,599
you've got mail servers that support
email and I'm you got no klein's

518
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:25,249
that would support email and I'm you
would send someone a message he would

519
00:30:25,249 --> 00:30:26,639
ride I'm first on

520
00:30:26,639 --> 00:30:31,199
426 didn't work she couldn't look up the
keys as a prop

521
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:38,199
work on port 25 which is that you know
more also

522
00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:41,529
if you think about webmail providers
Gmail Hotmail

523
00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:44,969
its you maxine Germany Mel ruin russia

524
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:48,039
if you think about these from up privacy
point of view

525
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:51,169
it's a disaster I mean people people
trusting

526
00:30:51,169 --> 00:30:55,019
provides a pass in a different country
but people like it's

527
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:58,499
and I'm expressly allows you to place
thrust in a server

528
00:30:58,499 --> 00:31:01,829
say okay I trust demo server at least
with

529
00:31:01,829 --> 00:31:05,169
to mikeys perhaps I need in a group and
password but at least

530
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:08,389
across the lawn of the CDA crips after

531
00:31:08,389 --> 00:31:13,659
the storm I encrypt the private key to
but also it allows you to completely not

532
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:14,709
trust your your

533
00:31:14,709 --> 00:31:18,309
provider and store everything on your
own are devices

534
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:21,509
and

535
00:31:21,509 --> 00:31:25,089
users don't need to understand crypto to
paraphrase

536
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:28,489
the lot I'll ever some want people
behind I'm recently on a trip to Ole

537
00:31:28,489 --> 00:31:28,969
Miss

538
00:31:28,969 --> 00:31:32,029
I you don't need to be D in math to used
I'm

539
00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:36,459
at given that I always fail and when i
jus b2b and given that I

540
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:41,930
never got it bc im of I was a real champ
artist

541
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:45,260
but an I come from an anti-spam
backgrounds and ivory

542
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:48,790
read the specification which is on a
date night long it's not even done yet

543
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:49,520
lots of

544
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:53,590
DVD's in there but at

545
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:56,730
but the works pam is a mention once not
even once

546
00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:02,780
and good to keep in mind spam filters

547
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:07,950
they inspect you know as toss the n/a
site or china or to be India wherever

548
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:12,800
which have restored his favorite I'm
Intelligence Agency

549
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,370
you can't have it both ways you can say
well we trust and build us but we don't

550
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:16,950
trust

551
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,870
but to make it or not and as a country
to email I mean if anything the NSA

552
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:25,050
et cetera group compromises been told is
or could demand access to them

553
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:32,010
put them on the back door and also it's
good to keep in mind spammers

554
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:36,060
can use encryption I mean the fact that
dime everything and I'm a secret that

555
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,600
doesn't stop spammers

556
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,480
I sometimes speak to people who who
think well if only we can get that all

557
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,130
our emails

558
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:45,690
than that was stopped some problem
because

559
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:49,950
spam us and do not use encryption but
the group dislike

560
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:53,550
the Cayman S BS are not in themselves a

561
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:57,140
solution for a spam problem even if span
butter

562
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:00,220
at posit SBS or

563
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:03,790
is the campsite still fairly rare
summers could use that

564
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:08,330
service could set it up but

565
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:12,250
I have reason to be optimistic I'm
firstly I think it's good to know that

566
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:15,250
as I said in the first part of my
presentation we

567
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:20,010
collectively happy very good at fighting
spam and that mean

568
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:24,510
I'm optimistic I'm short at whatever
solution if dying or something else we

569
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,400
come up with to make he knows more
cryptic

570
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:31,190
onshore well somehow a

571
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:34,610
solve this problem not 100 percent but
then we can start

572
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:40,380
I'm on a person anyway

573
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,240
and I'm includes various level of
security and trust

574
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,780
and all the malls are a trip that

575
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:50,530
or mother authenticators that the really
would help in some children would be

576
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:51,180
very mean

577
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,220
made a lot easier if we at least could
be sure about this domain

578
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:57,290
this basically means a

579
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:00,820
a Mikes better version of the game an
spf and

580
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:04,080
also all the emails would be signed and

581
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,430
cricket from

582
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:10,780
so what do I think what will happen if
we do adopt I'm

583
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,630
which I hope will you even if it might
take another ten years before its it's

584
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,870
really what the doctors

585
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:18,140
and it's good

586
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:21,540
then is it something very important to
note s sending spam

587
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:25,000
requires a one-way infrastructure you
set up a botnet for example you

588
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,679
you rent a botnet you create a botnet

589
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,860
and this machine's send email that's
fine

590
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:36,100
but that's all they do that works local
with the block but probably few sending

591
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:36,870
off then

592
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:42,679
that's enough to make a decent return on
investment and I'm Guinea the two-way

593
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,460
infrastructure

594
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:47,030
because you need some so for us that can
be used to

595
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:50,659
about but can be a great for your

596
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:54,070
public keys that's a lot harder the
setup

597
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:57,100
that's also a lot more a lot easier to
take down

598
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:03,890
or to block

599
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:07,830
a therefore I think spam ball is likely
to decrease in quantity

600
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:11,070
at just span sending emails and expand

601
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:14,950
visible on scale as well but I think
there will be an increase

602
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:18,530
in quality meaning good spanned hard to
filter

603
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:22,070
a XP spammers will be forced to use
dedicated accounts with

604
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:25,590
much smaller span runs you already see a
trend

605
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:29,730
you know that this a if your spam are
you get your hands on the

606
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:33,460
that the uses

607
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:36,800
user data from the recent and the breach
you can send very talkative

608
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,530
spam emails must not like to block this
user is a much more like

609
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:44,100
to to really exist not be real email
addresses

610
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,500
at that will increase and stem is also

611
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:53,730
be forced to use compromised accounts
but that's a good thing I mean what are

612
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:54,580
the quantity

613
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:58,380
which is generally seen as the biggest
problem of spam if we reduce thats

614
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:02,330
a but you have to pay the price at the
Kuala to spend we better

615
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:05,890
but it's a good thing I'm not sure at
time will tell

616
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:09,780
that's my email address

617
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,480
email doesn't require you too often so
for fruit except the email you don't

618
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:13,940
have to

619
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:18,040
I don't have to approve you as a the
sender that's my Twitter account

620
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,260
you thought it was very boring you know
to unfollow and SR

621
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:28,260
company website and miss you be plenty
of time 20 minutes 0 for questions

622
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,690
i'd

623
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:42,290
want

624
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:46,930
expected I expected Andres have a
question but estate not this questions

625
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:48,860
also Commons perhaps you have found this

626
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:53,140
way to Salt and a hat or or other
problems anymore but I had overlooked

627
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:58,510
feel free to let them know wasn't all no
no no address again I suggest

628
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:01,780
here

629
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:06,940
at up

630
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:13,940
okay

631
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:21,190
yes

632
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:27,170
or yep

633
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:31,300
yea not much to see a

634
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,720
that doesn't affect mock-up toll which
a.m.

635
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,500
I haven't read I have read it but I'd
happened remember to turn off to

636
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,950
talking about a as a No

637
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:45,220
a authority voice but I this is
important

638
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:48,600
you need at least have servers that can
be queried

639
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,860
for your keys at in in you know you
don't need this

640
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,930
and any go both ways as it also point
out I

641
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:58,750
much of a mediscare dime if you haven't
heard of it it's because it's not

642
00:37:58,750 --> 00:37:59,660
implemented yet

643
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:03,480
there are some best specifications
aren't even ready de still

644
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:08,440
looking for comments mesh

645
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:12,710
the for

646
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:16,480
all yeah getting

647
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,060
here yeah play

648
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:27,060
hope

649
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,079
yeah a all

650
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:34,410
health

651
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:37,799
writing of up

652
00:38:37,799 --> 00:38:43,910
I'll she skated

653
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:47,039
at the its is done by various layers of
security and I cannot

654
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:50,589
up and an encryption and and
authentication including

655
00:38:50,589 --> 00:38:54,250
the NSX including some kind of CA
infrastructure I

656
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,880
I don't want to focus not because they
wanted to be a back and look at the

657
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,740
talks are having

658
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:01,950
remembered all the details that still
looking for common stay

659
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:06,700
a they're aware that people try to
attack this the test their

660
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,930
men in the middling is not gonna be
easier

661
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:16,930
at the very least and I probably very
hot

662
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:29,079
and reside North s/mime is that

663
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:32,339
it generally annoyed people don't you
said

664
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:36,920
but I know people use it but not many
people use it okay

665
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,229
but with a okay i'd

666
00:39:40,229 --> 00:39:43,630
would agree with that well media well

667
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:47,559
I to another ago but

668
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:51,289
be my a

669
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:54,479
want I don't like

670
00:39:54,479 --> 00:39:58,509
yeah people mop

671
00:39:58,509 --> 00:40:01,849
all that they i mean that the with
another

672
00:40:01,849 --> 00:40:05,440
we other so I'll I

673
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,249
but the probably Sun

674
00:40:10,249 --> 00:40:14,729
kinda organization yes yeah okay to that
that's fair enough and it's also good to

675
00:40:14,729 --> 00:40:15,359
know that

676
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,880
a dime

677
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,670
the emails are based on my I'm and as my
mess mom has been an inspiration for

678
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,009
time

679
00:40:23,009 --> 00:40:27,180
so I had that does something called

680
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:31,670
the my muhammad evaded the dye message
have an awful name think it's called

681
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,680
beach that's mine

682
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:39,680
which is based on SS my man it's the
same idea question back

683
00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:03,930
chore chart yeah

684
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,500
that the yet and I know there are people
working on different particles and

685
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,910
sometimes even the same people working
on different articles

686
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:22,700
I'm not sure the dime Bowl will be the
one that survives I think it has

687
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,900
backing of important cover people behind
it I think

688
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,369
lot 11 so nice going around talking to
lots of big companies that

689
00:41:29,369 --> 00:41:32,380
might want to adopt it but they might be
honest and one problem with dime

690
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:36,650
is a if you want to send email now and
you're really worried about being read

691
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:40,330
and I'm is completely useless because is
not implemented yet so

692
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:45,030
using b2b or ask my more or some on our
group and that might be easier to

693
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:49,030
set up at least four smaller group this
is very usefull got

694
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:54,300
yep

695
00:41:54,300 --> 00:42:01,230
heap

696
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:04,910
on I have not looked at this particular
ones that look at a few of these

697
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:08,610
up yes

698
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:11,730
add a debt of a

699
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:14,990
Yahoo is s make making it easier to use
at b2b

700
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:18,440
on Yahoo as his Gmail a

701
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,100
doing a the promise it still needs to be
a user deciding to do that

702
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:26,250
and it takes two to three male

703
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:30,510
what email or text to to use encrypted
email if you're excited than you at

704
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:33,780
you use b2b and I don't than be no will
be on a trip with

705
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:38,750
be anthem at the title still believed in
it in any case yes

706
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:43,320
said

707
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:48,520
his

708
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,820
yes yes yes how

709
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:56,450
cool I'm

710
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:59,650
okay a I I was hoping someone will not
ask question about perfect forward

711
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:00,190
secrecy

712
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:05,090
her but a court secrecy email if you
look at it from an economic Prof the

713
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:05,790
point of view

714
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:09,240
public support secrecy it's impossible
in email

715
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,330
or dime or anything that's 8 Notting
thing for us

716
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:16,350
like a Allah sends me know mob operated
later to drop

717
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:19,740
box computer doesn't need to be on with
this a

718
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:24,510
which by the key on it that means it in
theory private a perfect forward secrecy

719
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:25,160
or

720
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:29,210
of Fort secrecy is impossible I should
point out for secrecy is the idea that

721
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:33,750
a if someone steals your private key or
pat you on the head with a wrenching get

722
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:34,570
your private key

723
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:38,490
than a they can encrypt all your past
and future traffic

724
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:42,280
Rd cripple your boss a few traffic so it
takes one key to

725
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,570
equip them all and until you change keys

726
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:50,000
at the that's been away big problem in
in web servers that are moving away from

727
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,740
keys

728
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:54,490
supporting or not supporting pgp that
sort the

729
00:43:54,490 --> 00:44:00,040
perfect for PFS I and even as had an
email and I'm

730
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:03,470
it's a possible in theory in practice
dime allows

731
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:05,410
for very fast key

732
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:09,870
revision which means that what you got a
few revolt broke

733
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:13,490
wrote a QP every hour that's probably
just as good in practice

734
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:17,570
reports equity I your question was about
spam filters I'm not sure

735
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:24,570
if I understand what some people have to
do with it you'd

736
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,250
now with a stupid question I think the
purported was he was not a stupid

737
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:32,390
personable I just yet but yet

738
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:37,070
so it a if you get this question ask
tomorrow in in crypto class A

739
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:41,060
universe the no no no federal court
secrecy and possible if your boss

740
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:48,060
it yet kinda this yes

741
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:58,220
said yes

742
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:05,220
my head

743
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:13,910
yes

744
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,650
med

745
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:21,220
the yes that's true there are a few
things

746
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:25,420
firstly the blackness provided needs to
know if this past 48 is really your

747
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:27,310
company needs to have like an
independent

748
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:30,880
some kinda way yeah okay to but the

749
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,780
that's an extra look up and then they
need to this a

750
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:38,590
this release date that submits to be
correct that's not always the case a

751
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:42,570
secondly it means that if you in this
last 48 jokes the mail server and web

752
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:43,090
server

753
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:46,359
your web server gets compromised set up
sending spam

754
00:45:46,359 --> 00:45:49,530
then you know several blocks as well
deaths

755
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:53,640
into it if you talk to people who are in
favor by basic black to say well

756
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:58,190
a good riddance issue that at the web
server be compromised I think

757
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:01,300
it shows that IP based filtering ace

758
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,710
an inherently bad idea that up to now
works extremely well

759
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:07,990
that's my opinion and opinions vary on
this

760
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:11,680
ended

761
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,870
yep

762
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:17,830
wall

763
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:20,730
no no I i'm ok for now spammers it is
not invest in smaller

764
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:25,230
as far as I know the only span that's
been send over IP sixties to span

765
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:28,330
that uses the default ASP connection to
domain

766
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:34,150
