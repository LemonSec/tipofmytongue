quite excited at

47
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,710
point there's

48
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,970

52
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,730
by the way up Minnedosa Cantina but

53
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:21,060
that was lame I mean thinking about it

54
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,580
in it probably wasn't the referee

55
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,200
week can have quickly I i closer look

56
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,650

00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,000
set out to achieve

65
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,080
goal to do something to achieve success

66
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,790
and there was a up the water

67
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:10,680
actually it was a number of analysis of
what cop and and whatever

68
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,740

82
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:07,150
on to illustrate death let me provide
some numbers the overall

I and hours 51 students

91
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,750
which from our perspective is up

92
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,260
very important element and that's a a
high number

93
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,900
at this point I'd like to thank I los

and use it for the students pool which
allowed us to %ah in white even more

96
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,410

99
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,110
if a going to contribute to the future
of

100
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:14,930
InfoSec and thinking even more about a
number I said means

101
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,500
fatty free people out of 281 out of all

102
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,510
as a speaker arson XP codesa fat chance

103
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:26,120
that the guy sitting next to you right
now SS pick-up

104
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,490
either the right or to the left and it's
very much about

105
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,870
it's an it's a trooper spirit that you
should talk to them

106
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:37,260
those on LAN stole some no superstars
though such a robust

107
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,990
as you are to possess the opportunity to
interact with people

108
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,190
you might not meet every day and should
take this opportunity

109
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,970
two buses about indirection and talking
to each other I it's very important for

110
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:50,460
me to

111
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,790
to stress tests

112
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:56,860
a much as possible what else was in the
management on my analysis

113
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:02,330
they set up success was achieved for
longtime capability development

114
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:06,700
meticulous planning and having a mission
and the plan

115
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:12,920
and I can safely stay fairly is safely
state that this applies to true but as

116
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,390
well

117
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:17,140
we have a mission it's about long-term
development

118
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,470
we have a plan one maybe

119
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:25,820
but in any case we will have a lot of
fun and Rachel past 50

120
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,589
the
