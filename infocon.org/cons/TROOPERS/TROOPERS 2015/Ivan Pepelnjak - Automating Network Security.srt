1
00:00:00,669 --> 00:00:05,359
morning though the keynote was great and
I thoroughly enjoyed it

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,280
and not being a security but the
networking guy I can tell you the whole

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,460
thing applies to networking as well

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,440
so whatever he was standing you about
security

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,560
he could be telling you the same thing
about networking

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,220
by the way they're like few chairs
around here I

7
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,580
so we all have the same

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:32,520
Sat the problems and as you can see I've
been doing close of crazy stuff

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,540
in the past and now I am this grumpy old
man that is focused on Network Inc

10
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:42,140
and everyone who is looking at the
networking from the outside has the same

11
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,160
opinion about

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,430
networking then they have about security
those guys are always saying no

13
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:55,280
and they're not moving anywhere
networking is the same as it has been

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,739
for the last 50 years

15
00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:00,780
but not right away but it looks like
that from the outset

16
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:07,780
a way a few years back a certain thing
started to pop as huge hype called

17
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,350
software-defined networking

18
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:14,920
and I made it my mission to debunk that
hike

19
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,890
though now I am on a crusade

20
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:24,140
I'm telling people why as the and as
promoted by the academics will never

21
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:24,810
work

22
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,710
and mostly the our networking engineers
go like yeah I we thought so

23
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:34,060
a anyway lost

24
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,329
in that hey P argument he's the real gem

25
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:42,790
which is we need to change the way we do
things X

26
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,549
and in networking there are a few people

27
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:52,930
that are actively evangelizing network
automation

28
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:56,670
now is that of dealing with your network
box by box

29
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,070
maybe you should deal with your network
on a slightly higher level

30
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,560
and of course if you take a look at
white papers from

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,900
any network management vendor they will
tell you that they've been doing that

32
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,600
for the last 20 years and we know how
well that worked

33
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,470
anyway there

34
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,540
our people trying to solve this problem

35
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,390
in Network Inc and there are
organizations that

36
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,850
are actually using those things in
production network so

37
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:29,510
this is not just a dream for example

38
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,540
a I was speaking with a guy from Spotify

39
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,940
you know the company that streams music
over the Internet

40
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,850
they have this huge data center and he
doesn't have time to reply new data

41
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:41,989
center switches

42
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:47,730
manually though he built this system
where they just plugged

43
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,870
in a new switch in the Swede you get the
complete with the medically and that

44
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,520
work is reconfigured automatically

45
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,390
and the he said I haven't logged

46
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,540
into mice which in over two years

47
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,790
any switch

48
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:10,050
its all automate and now he's doing the
same thing with his sport and firewalls

49
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,569
which gave me a great idea

50
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:19,280
hey let's look at how people are doing
security stuff and can we do the same

51
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:19,830
thing

52
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:24,670
in the security field and I limited the
whole thing for network security because

53
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,350
that's the thing

54
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:31,200
I may know a little bit about after all
I was built if I was 30 years back

55
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,560
with two routers and the best can host

56
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,640
so maybe

57
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,130
the the things that we have learnt in
networking are applying to security as

58
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:42,450
well

59
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:47,170
anyway anytime I tell because this is a
management track I started management

60
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:47,700
slide

61
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,989
anytime i'd talk with a manager I throw
up this slide

62
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:56,489
and he or she goes like how do you know
my problems

63
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:00,950
and they're really not hard to guess

64
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,660
so reduce costs but be more flexible

65
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,010
and the applications have to be deployed

66
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,900
foster but we can't manage that and we
have to compete with a public lout

67
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,590
and I'll mention public lout a few
slides later

68
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,430
anyway i menu view Ron a data center

69
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,510
okay

70
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:30,510
how many of those data centers look
fundamentally like this

71
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,450
yeah

72
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:36,300
more or less all over them every
enterprise data center I've seen so far

73
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:42,090
is built like this you had this pair of
huge box hugely expensive

74
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,620
huge boxes in the middle and a than you
have the lands hopefully across

75
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,270
only one data center there are people
who are brave enough to run them across

76
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,590
multiple data centers

77
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:55,390
I wish them luck I

78
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:59,080
and all the traffic between any two
subnets

79
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,340
goes between this joke point and then of
course

80
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,590
everyone is complaining quite the
network is slow now is not slow

81
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:12,480
is the choke point that is slow sup

82
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,780
with this in mind how long does it take
you to create and deploy a new fire will

83
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:24,780
ruin production any guesses

84
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,710
two days

85
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,830
anyone else %uh donkey add that the
right answer

86
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,650
I yeah I

87
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,949
and real-life data centers if you track
your metrics

88
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:45,229
it turns out is between a few days

89
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:50,580
and a week or longer the first problem
is that there are so many people

90
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,229
manually

91
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:55,030
patching that request the second problem
is that someone has to manually type

92
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:58,300
that into the firewall or into the
parliament system

93
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,110
and author problem is that he can only
do that during the maintenance window

94
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:06,120
and the main as we know it every 50
Friday of the month

95
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,090
at 5am

96
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:13,379
for five minutes anyway

97
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:18,819
the real problem is what if we would
consider this

98
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:22,050
from the moment someone said I need a
firewall rule

99
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:26,210
the moment his application was actually
work

100
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,259
and it turns out that

101
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:33,940
in most cases this two things are the
same but there are out liars

102
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:38,800
that raise the average to 10 days for
more

103
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,390
for example someone's ass I need access
to this web server

104
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:46,590
on your TV bored eighty now why would

105
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:50,110
an application engineer needs to know
about you the P that's the first

106
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:50,600
question

107
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,830
but that's how we deal with things

108
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,850
so he says you to be bored eighty and a
moron typing that entice

109
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:04,600
in UT people are 80 instead of asking
that guy hey you really mean TCP

110
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,780
port 80 and of course that he says I'm
done

111
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,130
during the next month was maintenance
window the firewall rule is implemented

112
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:17,160
and he runs away and then the
application i three days later checks it

113
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,640
and Seth

114
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,790
it doesn't work so he opens a drama
stripping peak

115
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:26,580
the firewall rule doesn't work then you
have to bring

116
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,630
n a more experienced guy could get extra
drama should stuff

117
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:33,340
and he promises that and keep it there

118
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,070
other TM maybe you meant TCP port 80

119
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,460
so when you fix it no I come fix it

120
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,590
you have to open to new tickets to
remove the old rule

121
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:49,040
and to at the new rule that's how things
work

122
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,360
in practice in real life and

123
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,020
then compared to that those same
application people can do this

124
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:00,570
and this issue I from

125
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,670
Amazon BBC clout in Amazon

126
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,500
they can configure what ever date wish

127
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,370
and they can deploy now

128
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:15,680
there's no maintenance window at

129
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:22,140
Amazon so is there anyone there that
they're trying to run away

130
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,280
and the only thing keeping them back our
compliance rules

131
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,100
we are doing something fundamentally
wrong

132
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,300
ok but is not just a security problem
it's a bigger problem

133
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,580
so why does this work first reason

134
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:45,010
they have simple rules there is no deep
packet inspection

135
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:50,730
their is no a state school stuff there
is no application level gateway

136
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,630
Amazon would not deal with SIP for FTP

137
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:59,550
you either allows certain things to
certain port

138
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:03,590
like TCP port 80 which by the way they
tell you it's Hepp

139
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:07,940
you don't have to guess the port number
and you don't have to guess whether it's

140
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:12,630
TCP or you repeat someone actually spent
more than three seconds on the user

141
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,250
interface

142
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:18,610
and its usability weeks them benders
never get

143
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:22,730
and the second thing is it's configured
by the application

144
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:26,779
owners which scares away

145
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:32,040
any security expert ever go

146
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,820
this think we'll only work if you make
the application

147
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,060
owners responsible for their ownership
excuse the word

148
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:45,180
if you think that you are guy fixing
their mistakes

149
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:52,030
afterwards you will never move forward
I'm not saying that the application

150
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:52,690
people

151
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:57,530
have to know what PCB board ATS I'm
saying they should be responsible

152
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,710
of course they can

153
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,890
get an extra expert you for you

154
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,360
or whoever to help them figure that

155
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,760
think out

156
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,380
but you know in IP we are extremely bad

157
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:19,860
at delegating things and asking for help
if you have

158
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,870
your lawyer in your company and someone
sues your company

159
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:28,050
that lawyer is not stupid enough to go
to court he will hire

160
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,220
expert external expert who knows

161
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,440
what the court proceedings are and he
was paid

162
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:41,440
those guys also the cover his ass and in
it. we think that we can solve

163
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:46,380
any problem with the help of uncle
Google sup

164
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:51,330
this is why it works for Amazon and this
is why it does not work for us

165
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:55,480
and it Amazon you can deploy this in
real time

166
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,240
by the way I've heard about clouds were
you

167
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,040
youth agree like this and then you press
submit

168
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,480
and then eat opus trouble ticket for the
firewall teams

169
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,610
which is not how things are supposed to
be working

170
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:18,380
this has to be deployed in real time and
if you want to reply this in real time

171
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,399
you contact the team of people seem to
be in India typing this

172
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:24,519
in you have to automate

173
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:27,940
the network security K so

174
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:33,389
we wants to get to this well and of
pixies and unicorns

175
00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:38,329
where with have the a pic Asia
requirements and you look at the

176
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:41,550
security policies and there's a prancing
unicorn here

177
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:46,819
which is called security orchestration
system and this thing will combine all

178
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:48,149
these things together

179
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:54,839
and the plied them automatically to your
firewalls load balancers what have you

180
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,160
I mean we r and a different planet

181
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,290
this thing exists and

182
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:06,420
some small measure an Amazon clout

183
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,940
and a few other places we are still

184
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:15,990
on a different planet we're not even
getting close and even Amazon

185
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:21,699
doesn't have this thing you have to know
what their application meets

186
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:26,190
there is no way someone else can figure
out what your application needs

187
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:32,910
its the academics with value is the high
I think problem you cannot figure out

188
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,740
whether a program will hot or not

189
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,990
and someone has proven that and you
cannot figure out

190
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:43,189
what an application needs just by
looking at it K

191
00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:46,379
so there are people who have tried to do
this

192
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:50,249
and mostly they kept fail because you
cannot

193
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:54,439
capture all the possible coat baths in
the application anyway

194
00:12:54,439 --> 00:13:00,170
so how do we get to something realistic
the first thing you have to do

195
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,649
is if you want to get anything done

196
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:07,399
you have to simplify the mass that you
have today

197
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,540
what everyone has today

198
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:16,139
yes a bunch of exceptions

199
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:19,529
every application is different even
though they were all coded using the

200
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:20,420
same tools

201
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,639
but every application has some special
requirements

202
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,290
that you captive implement at the last
minute

203
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:31,379
to you have to simplify

204
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:35,470
once you got down to a reasonable set

205
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:40,499
of things you need to do then you can
standardize those things

206
00:13:40,499 --> 00:13:44,720
for example up got let's take an example

207
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,470
how many of you are using for example
JBoss with Oracle

208
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,800
K I and all your applications are
written

209
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,190
in JBoss and use Oracle

210
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,640
but some of them are okay so

211
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,010
why can't you can't a security profile
saying for

212
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:06,060
a JBoss application using Oracle I need

213
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:10,310
this inbound rules this rules between
the

214
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:15,530
ap and the database tier and those rules
between the web in the apt here

215
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:21,230
and use standardized that and then when
the new application comes along ok

216
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:25,340
but you publish that in advance this is
how we will support

217
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:29,900
JBoss applications with Oracle the new
application comes along you say

218
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,170
do you fit into this profile

219
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:36,200
and you can't ask that you take your
firewall

220
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,210
it they get vacation does it work yes

221
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:44,140
you can deploy it no go back to square
one

222
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:50,180
read the documents fix the application
and of course there will go to your

223
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,410
boss's boss and start yelling at him

224
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,589
at which point you have to talk to the
CFL

225
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:59,899
and you say I can fix that for that
application but that with increased my

226
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:04,480
of pics continuously for years to come
because I would have to support that

227
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:04,910
stuff

228
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:09,920
you want me to do that I'm fine but it's
your choice

229
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,750
sign on the dotted line

230
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:17,690
usually that stops the discussions but
you have to be

231
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:21,339
able to make that to have that
discussion which means that

232
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:24,830
those people have to trust you which
means that you have to turn from the

233
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:25,810
culture of no

234
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:29,740
the culture up let me help you

235
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,379
anyway once again standardized you can
start

236
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:36,579
automatic because when you standardize
you know what you want to do

237
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:40,199
before standardizing you have no clue
what you're doing Inc

238
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:43,259
and after you

239
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:46,850
bought something like this in place you
can

240
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,410
stock abstract Inc once you can automate

241
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:55,110
you can start Cat Inc templates you can
start saying

242
00:15:55,110 --> 00:16:02,110
okay now I can deploy a typical firewall
for a JBoss best Oracle Application and

243
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:03,920
than

244
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,329
you can make this template's available

245
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:12,569
to the application people so they can
deploy their own firewalls on demand and

246
00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:12,920
you

247
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:18,910
walk away and you lie on the beach and
you have fun before

248
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:23,730
you can do that you have to reduce the
blast radius

249
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,730
where a simple concept

250
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:33,730
if I mess up some think was the impact
so today with a traditional data center

251
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:38,550
if you mess up the central fire was the
impact

252
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,780
if it crashes your datacenter is gone

253
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:45,040
obviously no one allows you

254
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,150
to attach that firewall in real time
because

255
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,879
if you mess that up

256
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:56,750
your datacenter is gone that's why we
have maintenance windows

257
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:01,290
at so how do you get away from that the
first thing is your virtualized

258
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,069
everything

259
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:06,659
is dead on one huge fire wall in front
of the data center

260
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:13,189
why don't you cat 50 small firewalls in
France of individual be caissons

261
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:17,750
and then is the question for the
application teen when do you want to

262
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:22,470
update the rules I mean it's your
firewall I can do it then

263
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,280
a.m. if you're fine with that

264
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,970
and the people who owned the travel
expenses application will go yet yeah

265
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:30,600
sure

266
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,280
and the people who own the e-commerce
application window that

267
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,910
maybe that's not a good idea but

268
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:41,270
you have the choice today you don't have
the choice

269
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:45,929
today you treat the travel expenses
application the same way you treat the

270
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:49,590
mission-critical e-commerce application
because they're both

271
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:53,590
on the same file K so

272
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:57,410
whenever I talk about virtualizing I get
this problem

273
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:01,770
what complain that while you know but we
have did a bit of traffic

274
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:06,200
and commercial machine can never do that
which is

275
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,990
definitely it no longer true some
theoretical maximum size

276
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:15,030
someone from Switzerland well and an
Australian coming

277
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:20,160
to Switzerland truce with managed to
push 2000 the

278
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,390
200 geek through as the our server

279
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:27,540
and x86 server with due course though

280
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:31,679
the bus is not the problem a

281
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,809
Intel pushed 15 mega packets per second

282
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:39,700
through I don't know how many course
which is 130 get Inc

283
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:45,640
sup performers is not a problem even on
Linux people were pushing 50 gig

284
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,160
through as the old server with my the
bath the CP

285
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:53,070
obviously they could do that because
they were using TCP offload

286
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,420
but yet the game you can do that

287
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:01,490
and here are some commercial numbers are

288
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:06,869
eight then load balancer can get out
before geek on a single core

289
00:19:06,869 --> 00:19:09,749
you know how many course you cat in a
mother Esther

290
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:14,869
okay up by the way how many have you
have

291
00:19:14,869 --> 00:19:20,200
10 gig ap linked to the internet or
faster a few

292
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:27,200
yet for everyone else this is good
enough for those of you who cast foster

293
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,989
openings obviously you have to do a few
other things

294
00:19:29,989 --> 00:19:34,499
and one of them is you don't have one
outside IP address you have many

295
00:19:34,499 --> 00:19:39,289
to use plead that on multiple load
balancers and if you have one outside IP

296
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:43,080
address with more than 10 be of traffic
coming to it I have a few tricks for you

297
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,869
f5 is a bit slower

298
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:50,269
near were NSX at Services Router

299
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:54,359
which was just fans segui on top of
Linux

300
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,700
is now a bit faster so they do

301
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,700
antique fire warning imported and a
load-balancing on

302
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,400
to course

303
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,700
not bet juniper Firefly

304
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,670
1.1 gig with i mix and 4.1 geek where

305
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:14,470
a maximum size to be packed to

306
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:19,220
forget when they just switch back is
back on

307
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:23,230
of and you can use any one of these if
you have one gig uplinks

308
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:27,360
iPod alive tho claims one gate at forty
CPU's

309
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,380
but they were telling me they were doing
at that number is with full-blown deep

310
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,810
packet inspection testing

311
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:37,710
so we feature starring on were asked NSX

312
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,820
exercises router is let's be honest just

313
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,140
reflexive access control lists its

314
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,250
stateful because when a packet comes in

315
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,350
the install the reverse flow and
firewall table

316
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:54,070
thats estate well as they are compared
to that's a part of the fire which is

317
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,670
for real

318
00:20:54,670 --> 00:21:00,700
buyout that can do it then gave up by
warning and routing on one core

319
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,780
I mean this should be with enough the
showstopper

320
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:09,490
is a SS out transactions per set that
the real show stopper to best number

321
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:13,590
I've seen lost three thousand
transactions per second

322
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:17,210
but the show stopper is our essays on
the moment to start using collective

323
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,970
birth certificates UK what you go way
beyond that

324
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:27,710
that's why CloudFlare can offer SSL
offload for free

325
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:31,190
if you don't know clout on Klaus there
you can set up your own

326
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:35,110
SSL website by CDN SSL to the client

327
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:41,519
HTTP over the Internet to your server

328
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:44,639
why do they do that so I would just go
out there

329
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:49,500
why would I want that because Google is
giving high rankings to as a cell sites

330
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:55,450
problems of no additional security but I
look good

331
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:59,950
anyway as i sat

332
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:04,630
your cat to minimize the complexity and
standardize things

333
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,309
which means that you don't cap

334
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:10,450
one rule set for your whole company

335
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:14,410
you don't cap 10,000 rules in the
central firewall

336
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:17,520
you cap bar application

337
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,740
rule sets and things like

338
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:24,080
the NSX firewall actually allow you to
do that

339
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,100
you can create security group and then
you can define

340
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:32,820
rule sets for individual security group
and then they analyze which be an is

341
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:36,299
sitting on which hypervisor and download
only those relevant proves that

342
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:40,120
hypervisor but they're doing a
reasonable job

343
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,380
don't ask me how secure desktop is if
you do this

344
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:47,990
then rule sets leave and I with the
application

345
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:51,390
so when you remove the application when
the Commission it

346
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:55,289
the route that goes with the application
so

347
00:22:55,289 --> 00:22:58,990
their is no its tail there are no stale
rules

348
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:02,130
in the central fire or I know a guy who
was

349
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:06,870
bait a lot of money for a three-month
project

350
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,920
which was auditing firewall rules in the
central firewall

351
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:15,080
of a large organization so he was
spending three months trying to figure

352
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,440
out

353
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,360
which ones of those who were never use
so they could removed

354
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,490
I mean nice money

355
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:26,290
next to standardize the rule sets

356
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:30,730
the implications are usually not
especial as their owner

357
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:33,220
things they are

358
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,050
try to make s fuel standard

359
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:39,580
rule sets as possible and once you do
that

360
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:43,600
your chat with auditor will be much
simpler

361
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,230
because you can start the auditor

362
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:52,330
I have these 5 templates please auditor

363
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:56,270
and auditing a 20-year-old template is a
piece of cake

364
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,750
and then you go around the

365
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:03,010
100 small fire was a cabin organization

366
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:06,320
and the audit they're just looks at

367
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,059
the firewall and says well does this
rule set match and all the templates

368
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:13,090
if it does fine I'm done

369
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:17,820
if not I have to audit thank

370
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:21,510
so I'm joking that we need some things
like a warranty seal

371
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:26,510
you have the spiced and the fam peace
with the warranty seals the moment the

372
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,890
application owners want to have a
different rule

373
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:32,179
you tell them you have to open the box
the word is he will break and you with

374
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:35,130
up to the audit

375
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:39,019
which might persuade them defeat into
the standard rules

376
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:42,100
but it makes everyone

377
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,070
live so much easier and finally

378
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:53,070
you have to rethink the security policy
everyone things they need a stateful

379
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,539
firewall

380
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:59,529
every little things they need the state
will fire with deep packet inspection

381
00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:04,450
and biological loves you and a few other
people

382
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:10,100
the reality is usually packet filters
within data center are good enough

383
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,789
what all the traffic coming to

384
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:18,029
my stick was server its TCP traffic on
one port number

385
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:22,789
do you need the packet inspection for
that

386
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:27,409
no because bottle either doesn't have
the packet inspection for my sake one

387
00:25:27,409 --> 00:25:27,960
anyway

388
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:33,059
I maybe they do but you get the point is
there anything coming

389
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:36,100
out the best armor what it shouldn't be

390
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:40,960
if there is something coming out on that
server going to some weird address you

391
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,570
have a problem

392
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,450
anyway

393
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,690
you don't need state would expect
inspection of the outgoing session

394
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,890
because there should be no outgoing
sessions

395
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:52,700
okay so

396
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,159
usually packet filters are good enough

397
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:02,840
but we insist on stateful inspection
with application-level gateways on big

398
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,720
by Wallace

399
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,870
just because the security policy Sasso
maybe we don't need

400
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:10,940
and the

401
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,059
one thing you can do is

402
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:17,510
once you figure out that back at that
there's horse

403
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:22,159
state fallish back at that this might be
good enough you can go from this

404
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:27,279
old-world of centralized firewalls the
brave new world where you put small

405
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,110
firewalls

406
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:32,270
in front of the virtual machines and
once you do that

407
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:36,320
you become infinitely scaleable

408
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,420
the more virtual machines you have the
more

409
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:43,450
physical servers to cap the more CPU
power you have the more distributed to

410
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:47,240
be a powerful to fire warning you have
no joke by

411
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,850
and finally try to decouple

412
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:55,290
the birch or and the physical world as
much as possible

413
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:58,580
try to make everything as virtual s you
can

414
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:04,830
I show you why let's imagine that you
manage to virtualize the coal

415
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:08,860
application stack firewall

416
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,080
load balancer virtual machines
everything

417
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:17,280
is virtualized K because is virtualized

418
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,550
it's using virtual disks it cast all the
configuration on those virtual disk with

419
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:25,440
are just files on the file system which
is replicated to a different data center

420
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,279
now your datacenter burns down

421
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:32,580
what do you have to do to recover

422
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,879
you just restart those VM's in a
different data center

423
00:27:36,879 --> 00:27:43,429
it may even be Amazon Cloud because

424
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:48,440
everything is virtualized you can move
it around at will

425
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,590
not life hand the I'm not telling you
can move

426
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:54,730
a BM from East Coast West Coast that
dealers job

427
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:59,299
I but you can move the workload

428
00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:01,760
anywhere if

429
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,330
you have virtualized everything in the
workload including the network services

430
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:10,570
and of course every time I show a
picture like this

431
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:13,910
more conservative organizations collect
an

432
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:17,620
no so for them I have this recipe

433
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:21,510
you use the standard

434
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:26,670
physical firewall that does the basic
scrub Inc and then you have the scrub

435
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:29,710
segment were you have the shared caches
in proxy servers

436
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,800
and then your caps barked and virtual
appliances

437
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,270
and the application stack game

438
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:39,690
cell enough theory

439
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:46,690
let's see what other people are doing

440
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:50,720
first market down and isolation with
firewalls

441
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,040
everyone has this today

442
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,430
so if you are we link

443
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:01,160
to go down this path you have

444
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,740
plenty of commercial products that you
can use today

445
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:10,350
and every cloud orchestration system
that

446
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:14,070
but every popular cloud orchestration
system is supporting this idea

447
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:19,389
OpenStack does this weight

448
00:29:19,389 --> 00:29:24,149
either IP tables for a vendor plugin
clouds that does this but

449
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:27,320
only on KVM

450
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,770
because they use IP tables in theory
clouds that could do this

451
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,250
on hyper-v because hyper-v also cast
stateful

452
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:40,740
firewall in the car now but no one ever
wrote the code to support it

453
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,400
might pay OpenStack is open source feel
free to write the code

454
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,980
I'll be aware and a sax

455
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,070
juniper contra has something similar
hyperbole as i sat

456
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:54,560
past stateful firewall in Karnal

457
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,690
so if you thing that this is

458
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:01,930
a good idea you can go out and start
using this today

459
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:06,710
and want to deploy either VMware and a
sex or CloudStack

460
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:09,950
for OpenStack you also get the same
greed that Amazon

461
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:13,550
s what similar functionally similar

462
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:19,300
so if you think that you can't push in
this problem onto the application people

463
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,920
at least four pilot violence

464
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:25,030
go for it there's no reason why you
shouldn't be doing it

465
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:30,010
are be other beautiful think you get

466
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:33,220
want to start deploying this stuff is
that

467
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,270
this either you have the security group

468
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:41,050
in the cloud orchestration system or you
have the fire one management system like

469
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:41,920
panorama

470
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,860
tightly integrate it with the cloud
orchestration system which means that

471
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,490
you no longer have to deal with IP
addresses

472
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:53,570
you can defy a security group A Inc

473
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:56,760
web servers are all the VM's

474
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,500
where the name starts with web

475
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,480
database servers are all the M's that
run Linux

476
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:09,169
and the name starts with DB and then in
Panorama

477
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:13,960
or in the and SX manager you create a
rule that sass

478
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,149
web servers can talk to database servers

479
00:31:17,149 --> 00:31:21,510
on port whatever my secret boards and

480
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:25,380
SEO add new machines they may get random
IP addresses

481
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:30,940
but the management system with adjust
the firewall rules which still use IP

482
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,370
addresses

483
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:37,039
obviously in real time which means that
finally

484
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:41,269
you can stop thinking about something
it's

485
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:45,120
how cool is that

486
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,360
%uh and now a few other things people
are doing

487
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,210
its anyone %uh view you think that

488
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:58,500
aggregation networks in the data center
get

489
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,330
I for those of you who are

490
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:05,630
who don't have a separation network how
do you do a

491
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:11,880
troubleshooting with Wireshark you run
around with laptops

492
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,890
how the deal get the traffic from

493
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:18,710
spend port to your Wireshark bro

494
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:22,460
on

495
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:26,320
okay you can do remote span yeah that's
true that works as well

496
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,240
I'll so there how do you bring

497
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,270
traffic from a passive broken the link

498
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:37,050
that anyway you get the point

499
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:40,710
%uh large data centers

500
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:45,390
usually cap that aggregation networks
and the

501
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:48,540
its either span ports or passive

502
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:53,800
taps on core links and there are like
three or four different companies

503
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,910
that have this reassuringly expensive
products

504
00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:01,280
that can do that that aggregation big
amount for example is one of them

505
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:07,690
and it turns out that those products are
nothing else than Bubba Franks which iz

506
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:11,559
with special stock so people like Aretha
Sat

507
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:15,380
well why don't we turn our switches

508
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,140
into that K

509
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:22,110
I will cast them backboards I will have
some

510
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:27,789
told reporters I can build a fabric on
this which is and I can program that in

511
00:33:27,789 --> 00:33:28,590
real time

512
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,730
and Microsoft is using this

513
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:35,160
inside their data center because

514
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,260
they can't program this which is in real
time

515
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:43,260
through Jason which means that you can
write a simple

516
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:46,590
web application that will program your

517
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:51,090
that aggregation network so you say I
need to see

518
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:55,000
that port on

519
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,070
that Wireshark bro band you have it

520
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,220
but still we

521
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:05,289
are at the point where we are doing span

522
00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:08,330
either with

523
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:12,169
OpenFlow or yet again a respect ass

524
00:34:12,169 --> 00:34:15,169
a solution where they don't need
OpenFlow

525
00:34:15,169 --> 00:34:20,300
you you something like policy based
routing for those of you who

526
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,760
have to deal with that in the past so
you're saying

527
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,679
well I want to match this particular
traffic

528
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,940
so for example I want to match traffic
from this subnet

529
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:36,070
going to port eighty on that coast and I
want to mirror only that

530
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:38,530
traffic

531
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:41,130
so you do the significance traffic
reduction

532
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:47,050
on the source switch you don't ask to
mirror

533
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:50,860
Colby land or 1-port to the spend port

534
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:54,290
you can specify what traffic you want to
see

535
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:57,550
and then you get only that traffic yet
to gain

536
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:02,960
programmable through Jason which means
that you have

537
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,930
getting any small script that does the
switch I need this traffic

538
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:11,570
and get that traffic people are also
doing that

539
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:14,590
with OpenFlow and the

540
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:19,140
supposedly most for the data center
vendors are supporting OpenFlow on their

541
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:19,800
switches

542
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,040
so once they get all the functionality
you need

543
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,290
you will be able to do this on more or
less

544
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:32,310
every data center switch on the market
next

545
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:35,580
this is what arista and Palo Alto
demonstrated

546
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:39,980
and I think some people are using this
in real life although no one is talking

547
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,990
much about this

548
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:45,190
solutions of Iowa vendors

549
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:47,340
have

550
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:53,290
firewall clusters the only problem is
that because you cannot guarantee

551
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:58,870
that both size up a single flow will go
over the same box

552
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:01,560
those by will clusters never get

553
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,910
the same performance ass and individual
boxes combine

554
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:08,000
Cisco is what I honest I'm

555
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,730
I mean it's amazing how on a Cisco is in
the documentation sometimes

556
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:15,490
they're saying too will probably get
seventy percent

557
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:19,980
up the combined throughput so you have
Ford

558
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,720
then gave fire was still get 28 geek not
for take

559
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:30,720
because the traffic going here goes over
Juan the traffic going bad goes over the

560
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:31,550
other one

561
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:36,040
and someone has to sing state or stand
the mismatch back its across the

562
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:40,770
shared link whatever they're doing now
what arrest and part of that it was what

563
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:41,520
is simple

564
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,210
if I could control the traffic
distribution on both ends

565
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:50,520
to ensure on the switches that

566
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:55,030
traffic is going back at war the same
firewall

567
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:58,360
there would be no mismatched

568
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,960
traffic so I wouldn't have that problem
which means that

569
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,050
I would squeeze more

570
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:09,910
out of those same fire was because they
don't have to synchronize so many thanks

571
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,640
and up

572
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,950
what is simple think a wrister
implemented it actually using scripts

573
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:21,500
on their switches arrest us which is run
Linux

574
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,910
and they ship with borrow and Python on

575
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:27,440
and you can install

576
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,720
any RPM package you want on their switch
and they will happily tell you how to do

577
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,800
so it's not like some other vendors
which is left

578
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:40,880
yeah we have BST but don't touch so
everything is what a happy and telling

579
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,400
you how to break their box with her

580
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,090
whatever rpm and in this case

581
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:50,600
they actually just wrote a simple script

582
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,290
that caspar track which fire was are
active

583
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:58,510
it has to track which boards are active
so if I have only two ports here I

584
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,100
shouldn't use three ports here

585
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:03,370
got one fire what is actually an
operational

586
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:07,890
simple things like that two tracks stock
across those two switches to synchronize

587
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:08,280
them

588
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,470
bad you get better performance not bad
for a script

589
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:15,970
one other think bottle out though

590
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:19,200
and arrest are doing and I don't think I
have a slide on dat

591
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,210
yes for extremely simple trick

592
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:27,250
I am you can live with and you firewall

593
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:33,620
and you want to fire what everything and
then you heat a backup session

594
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:37,190
and the backup session its up like 8 out
all those 10 dick

595
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:41,030
why should you inspect a backup session

596
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:45,280
because they don't know it's a backup
session but when you know it's a backup

597
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,370
session well why don't you streamline
that why does it have to go through the

598
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:48,950
firewall

599
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:53,480
and what they did was an extremely
simple trick

600
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:57,370
a the respect I S

601
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:01,250
Theron on a syslog daemon on the arrest
us which

602
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:05,840
and you configured or is this which as
syslog daemon for the bottle I the

603
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,450
firewall

604
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:12,180
so whenever to fight a war matches a new
session

605
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:15,180
it sends a syslog event to the arrest
the switch

606
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:18,270
and in the switch they have this

607
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:22,310
short script that analyzes the SIS lock
and it if it finds

608
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:27,119
something that you tell you it's to
streamline it inserts a shortcut through

609
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,480
in the forwarding table

610
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,790
so was the firewall recognizes

611
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:37,880
that it actually a backup session the
switch will go ahead

612
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,810
%uh G the fireworks far the backup
session let's streamline it

613
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:45,630
and then if I world %uh the backup
session

614
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:48,190
bypasses the firewall

615
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:51,950
and obviously they install that thing
with a certain time out so that after a

616
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:52,549
while

617
00:39:52,549 --> 00:39:56,329
it times out and the backup session is
still there

618
00:39:56,329 --> 00:39:59,829
well it goes back to the firewall that I
was a yeah it's okay

619
00:39:59,829 --> 00:40:04,890
had to switch installers the shortcut
through again

620
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:09,400
%ah by the way whenever i'm talking
about. as the end I am making a joke

621
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,120
that week at as the end

622
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:14,240
twenty years ago there's even an RFC on
on that

623
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,580
that is years old and this thing is
called remote

624
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:20,740
triggered let go so when someone

625
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:24,720
attacks your server the DOS is not a new
stuff

626
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,210
when someone attacks or server to
protect everyone else you might want to

627
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:30,819
take that server offline

628
00:40:30,819 --> 00:40:33,660
but if you think that server offline
because this is a scene plot

629
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:37,390
it doesn't impact the attacker so you
have to install

630
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:40,839
a rule at the at of your backbone say
Inc anything

631
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:44,889
sand to that IP address has to be taken
offline

632
00:40:44,889 --> 00:40:49,169
and there somewhere simple trick with
BGP call you advertised Coast route

633
00:40:49,169 --> 00:40:53,679
with an unreachable next hop so that all
the packets that go to that host route

634
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:58,399
are actually dropped on ingress there's
another trick you can use where you can

635
00:40:58,399 --> 00:40:59,399
use that same thing

636
00:40:59,399 --> 00:41:04,619
on the source IP address so if you
figure out who is attacking you like you

637
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:05,579
can blog done

638
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:09,249
at the at of a your

639
00:41:09,249 --> 00:41:12,359
network and CloudFlare

640
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:15,779
went one step further there is this
thing

641
00:41:15,779 --> 00:41:20,119
and there's a own RFC about BGP flow
spec

642
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:23,349
how you can do policy based routing

643
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:28,059
over BGP only juniper implemented that
unfortunately

644
00:41:28,059 --> 00:41:31,809
and Narciso supposedly has it on a sr9
case or something

645
00:41:31,809 --> 00:41:37,609
at anyway what that thing allows you to
do is to push what is specific entry

646
00:41:37,609 --> 00:41:40,699
into anyone of your

647
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:42,210
routers

648
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:46,780
so what's out there is doing is the
figure out who is attacking them so who

649
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:51,009
is attacking walk on which port

650
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,709
and then they push the entry that blocks
that traffic

651
00:41:53,709 --> 00:41:57,880
to the at 12 their network

652
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,799
that's why did they can survive

653
00:41:59,799 --> 00:42:03,160
fans %uh gigabits of

654
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:08,069
the DoS attack now the other thing
they're also doing is there any casting

655
00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:09,140
their IP addresses

656
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:14,099
so people are attacking them but after
the traffic is going to European data

657
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:14,829
center

658
00:42:14,829 --> 00:42:18,400
and how the traffic is going to US data
center and the attacker don't know that

659
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,849
so yet they can survive 50 geek

660
00:42:21,849 --> 00:42:25,039
of combined the DOS traffic but

661
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:28,369
only 10 or 20 gigs are going to each
data center

662
00:42:28,369 --> 00:42:32,380
which is cool trick this

663
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:35,739
this what annul a large number of people

664
00:42:35,739 --> 00:42:39,210
are already doing it started obviously
as always

665
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:42,900
at universities if you have a

666
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,039
IDS that can only take one gig

667
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:49,339
and you have a 10 gig

668
00:42:49,339 --> 00:42:54,239
uplink like the reverse it is due it's
pretty car to analyze that traffic with

669
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,360
one I D S

670
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:00,100
so you have a bank of IDSs and

671
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:05,300
the they analyze the traffic the only
problem is how do you get the traffic to

672
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,420
those IDSs

673
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:10,780
and usually would use TCMP equal cost my
cat bath Inc

674
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:16,490
on the switch so they just sprayed the
traffic across all I D S

675
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:19,170
the problem with that is with the CMP

676
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:25,060
you're doing statistics so air people
are doing credit their stop

677
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,220
are the IDS is get some other traffic
but if someone is actually

678
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:33,680
attacking you than one I D S will be
over know it because all the traffic go

679
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,170
through that I D S

680
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:40,210
and and the other problem is because of
the way TCMP works

681
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:44,490
you may not see our stash is from the
same attacker on the same IDS

682
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:50,319
which kills correlation the what these
guys are doing the there are installing

683
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:51,329
deterministic

684
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:55,660
entries is that of just blind TCMP on
this which

685
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:58,990
and you can then monitor does and Chris

686
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:01,300
that they threw open flow

687
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,500
but you know cathy is open flow for that
there there are a number of other are

688
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,370
things you can use

689
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:08,690
you monitor those entries and once one
of those

690
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:14,650
entries gets too much traffic is pretty
hot in your sign haha thats to some

691
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:16,900
other IDS

692
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,180
so you can dynamically balance

693
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:22,370
how the traffic gets assigned to
individual

694
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:25,690
IDS of course you can get

695
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:31,560
one step farther once you discovered
that someone is

696
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:36,620
attacking you you can then use for
example OpenFlow controller to push

697
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:39,660
the entry down here to blog that

698
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:43,520
traffic on the switch the same thing
that

699
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,040
CloudFlare is doing where the their
network

700
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:53,290
you can do this locally a-bomb bro I D
as developers were actually thinking

701
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:53,970
about

702
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:58,220
implementing OpenFlow on the bro I D S
just for this

703
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:01,860
reason but but then they decided that

704
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:05,100
ap we're not doing that they implemented

705
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:09,750
a generic mechanism where you they can
call in your script

706
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:13,060
telling your script this is what you
need

707
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:16,790
the block and then you can use OpenFlow

708
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:20,130
or arrest the stools or Cisco's 1pk

709
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:24,470
or whatever you have or BGP flows back
if you're using juniper

710
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:29,200
to block that traffic at the at of your
network

711
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,260
so all this sounds great right why are
we not doing it

712
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:39,520
which brings me to the road blocks

713
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,600
as the mind 10

714
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:47,910
roadblock number one is the mindset and
the road block number two

715
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:52,900
is processes and procedures if you don't

716
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:58,270
change this too well including the third
one you will not get

717
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:01,640
anywhere and

718
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:07,380
obviously you conjures go back to your
CS oh and tell him that we need to

719
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,340
change everything

720
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:12,680
he will ask you what were you smoking
Qinghai to Burke

721
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:17,420
though the only thing you can do it yes

722
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:20,970
you can get like-minded people from
different teams and you for

723
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:25,920
your form his guerrilla force and you
have a small pilot

724
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:32,430
and you prove that this thing actually
works and then you find one of the cool

725
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:34,070
application developers themes

726
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:38,300
and you work with them so they succeed

727
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:41,920
and when they succeed you use them as
the shining example

728
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,460
are take it can be done

729
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:49,540
if you don't want to do it that's fine
with me but look at what those guys are

730
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:52,059
doing

731
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,079
that's the only way forward I C

732
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:59,309
and then of course there are deep
external load Road roadblocks like

733
00:46:59,309 --> 00:47:00,220
license Inc

734
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:06,260
every bend their love to charge you by
box

735
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,340
for example a f5

736
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:11,770
charge issue by box even in virtual
world

737
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:14,890
I was told yesterday that virtual
licenses are

738
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:18,720
even more expensive than physical boxes

739
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,270
which makes absolutely no sense

740
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:24,730
bot such is life

741
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:30,190
I'll bottle out there with their virtual
firewall with

742
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:33,720
being were NSX they need a virtual
firewall on every coast

743
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:37,460
and obviously you have to buy a license
for every health

744
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:39,999
in your network

745
00:47:39,999 --> 00:47:42,739
well just like nice money machine for
some people

746
00:47:42,739 --> 00:47:45,849
I there's also the problem with

747
00:47:45,849 --> 00:47:52,349
auditing tools most re-think tools are
licensed burnout

748
00:47:52,349 --> 00:47:55,320
so if you have 100 Small firewalls

749
00:47:55,320 --> 00:48:00,099
instead of two humongous firewalls they
want to charge you 50 times more

750
00:48:00,099 --> 00:48:03,180
even though the number of rule sets is

751
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,810
actually lower

752
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:11,530
but that's how licensing works sometimes
you have to live with that

753
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:15,700
sometimes you find a better vendor and
to you both with your wallet

754
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:19,220
and sometimes open source is just good
enough

755
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:24,760
and if the application was developed in
the last two years and you have to use

756
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:25,380
f5

757
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:28,670
instead of varnish or squid or H a proxy

758
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:35,670
something is fundamentally wrong with
your application development process

759
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:37,650
such life

760
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:42,160
ok it doesn't work today yes it does on
the

761
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,540
russia plans vendors you have all side
to cap on major firewall

762
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:50,300
and load balancing vendors licensing is
a different story but they have a

763
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:50,850
product

764
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:55,820
is doing the fire was a cab be aware and
a sexy theft by lot though you have

765
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:57,730
hyper-v you have a few other things

766
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:02,270
orchestration tools all the major cloud
orchestration tool support

767
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:05,540
this concept and again automation side

768
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:08,940
people are using tools like as the boat
chapter poppet

769
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:13,550
that are traditionally used to manage
servers to manage

770
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:16,980
switches firewalls load balancers

771
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:20,230
buy lotto has just released on

772
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:23,520
and simple plugin

773
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,230
which means that you can manage

774
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:30,880
apollo out the firewall through and
civil iris the cast and simple chat and

775
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:31,310
Papa

776
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:36,580
plugins juniper past but running on
their switches

777
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:39,650
Cisco cast check and pop it somewhere

778
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:44,360
I don't remember where exactly so
everyone is working on that

779
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,760
so there are no excuses start now

780
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,300
and aunt

781
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,640
finally this is my own Gartner sly

782
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,890
some people know how much I love

783
00:49:57,890 --> 00:50:03,530
industry analysts and we were always
making fun of Gartner but

784
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:06,870
actually they're writing some good stuff

785
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:10,150
so this is my own garden decided that
this was a blog post that someone from

786
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:11,150
Gartner growth

787
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:16,290
on shiny new object syndrome which
effectively assess

788
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:19,790
known be dazzled by the shiny new
objects

789
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:23,160
figure out whether this bits

790
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,170
into your organization figure out where
you could do the same thing just by

791
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:29,160
changing your policy or process

792
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:32,860
figure out whether you have to go with a
new band there are maybe your vendor

793
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:35,970
with have this in a year because you
won't be ready in a year anyway

794
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:39,600
on can we fix

795
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:43,400
eighty-five percent of the problems with
existing tools and usually you can

796
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:47,060
just require a change and policy or
process

797
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:50,400
and finally do we have the right

798
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,590
stuff and there well this is now

799
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:58,040
thirty seconds of blatant self-promotion

800
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:01,950
I do have I lot of material

801
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:06,840
on automation particular network
automation and the tools

802
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:11,930
and the technology you can use so if you
want to dive deeper into that

803
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:15,830
are like you see 10 different things
that you can watch

804
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:18,840
and finally stay in touch

805
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:24,240
if you cap comment on this presentation
I'll be around for the next three days

806
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:24,970
so

807
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:28,680
just grabbed me and we'll have a chat
send me an email

808
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:33,330
are I am running a podcast on software
defined

809
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:37,880
everything and usually the gas are
pretty interesting so

810
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:41,420
go and listen to that podcast when it's
there because

811
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:46,140
of the Gaston because I want to promote
my stuff and

812
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:51,359
if your cat if you ever have any
follow-up questions send me an email

813
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:54,140

814
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:58,579

trooper's with that

815
00:51:58,579 --> 00:52:05,579
thank you and have a great day the

816
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:11,810
thank you I would say we have a

817
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:18,810
five-minute okay

818
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:24,069
Frankfurt

819
00:52:24,069 --> 00:52:25,700
this guy

820
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,280
home

821
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,770
to post

822
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:30,180
of

823
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:33,440
room issue

824
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,900
room

825
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:39,530
ok.so here was a question saying

826
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:42,410
a there was this guy this presentation a

827
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:46,950
cool said that he's running his could do
for the plaster

828
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:50,849
straight but at this rate for the
internet because it would take aim

829
00:52:50,849 --> 00:52:54,280
to much money to build the fire wall in
front of it

830
00:52:54,280 --> 00:53:01,280
that right at 250 biggest bottle I those
would be

831
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:04,660
a few terabits which

832
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:07,660
is that one top of rack switch so yeah
is right

833
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:12,369
ion all

834
00:53:12,369 --> 00:53:15,859
the big web properties supposedly

835
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:20,910
don't use firewalls at all that's what
I've been told

836
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:24,460
from several sources you have I P tables

837
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:28,650
on your Linux box and you can use IP
tables

838
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:31,930
pretty successfully to protect

839
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:36,240
that Coast assume Inc you know how to
carton

840
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,670
and protect the coast

841
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:41,799
which is why we don't use that the
protein enterprise networks

842
00:53:41,799 --> 00:53:47,029
because we construct the people who are
supposed to be heartened that Coast

843
00:53:47,029 --> 00:53:53,099
web properties have totally different
processes and they have one deployment

844
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:57,769
that goes out to that Co farm of web
server so they can afford

845
00:53:57,769 --> 00:54:03,559
that on settlement are you can use IP
tables

846
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:06,779
and than depending on what he wanted to
do with that

847
00:54:06,779 --> 00:54:10,089
to plaster are if

848
00:54:10,089 --> 00:54:15,019
he just needed external access to it
then he could use packet filters to

849
00:54:15,019 --> 00:54:15,739
protect it

850
00:54:15,739 --> 00:54:20,029
because external access to Hadoop
cluster is on board

851
00:54:20,029 --> 00:54:25,769
80 or 443 or whatever do you think and
there is no need

852
00:54:25,769 --> 00:54:28,910
or anything else or just install packet
filters that

853
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:32,009
do that a

854
00:54:32,009 --> 00:54:36,039
going out obviously is a different story
and

855
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:42,239
their I know someone who solve that by
installing

856
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:47,279
effectively policy based routing saying
for in coming sessions we go straight

857
00:54:47,279 --> 00:54:49,230
and back

858
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:53,020
as for all the outgoing sessions so all
the weird stuff that would need to be

859
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:53,859
firewalled

860
00:54:53,859 --> 00:54:57,000
I was tended off to a firewall but

861
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,550
that is way less than the incoming and
return track

862
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:05,630
make sense

863
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:07,559
yeah

864
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:09,560
yeah

865
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:09,810
%ah
